two years I must have been very ill employed if I could not leave its merits and demerits as a whole to express themselves on its being read as a whole But as it is not unreasonable to suppose that I may have held its threads with a more continuous attention than anyone else can have given them during its desultory publication it is not unreasonable to ask that the weaving may be looked at in its completed state and with the pattern finished If I might offer any apology for so exaggerated a fiction as the Barnacles and the Circumlocution Office I would seek it in the common experience of an Englishman without presuming to mention the unimportant fact of my having done that violence to good manners in the days of a Russian war and of a Court of Inquiry at Chelsea If I might make so bold as to defend that extravagant conception mister Merdle I would hint that it originated after the Railroad share epoch in the times of a certain Irish bank and of one or two other equally laudable enterprises If I were to plead anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design it would be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these pages in the days of the public examination of late Directors of a Royal British Bank But I submit myself to suffer judgment to go by default on all these counts if need be and to accept the assurance on good authority that nothing like them was ever known in this land Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no any portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing I did not know myself until the sixth of this present month when I went to look I found the outer front courtyard often mentioned here metamorphosed into a butter shop and I then almost gave up every brick of the jail for lost Wandering however down a certain adjacent Angel Court leading to Bermondsey I came to Marshalsea Place the houses in which I recognised not only as the great block of the former prison but as preserving the rooms that arose in my mind s eye when I became Little Dorrit s biographer The smallest boy I ever conversed with carrying the largest baby I ever saw offered a supernaturally intelligent explanation of the locality in its old uses and was very nearly correct How this young Newton for such I judge him to be came by his information I don t know he was a quarter of a century too young to know anything about it of himself I pointed to the window of the room where Little Dorrit was born and where her father lived so long and asked him what was the name of the lodger who tenanted that apartment at present He said Tom Pythick I asked him who was Tom Pythick and he said Joe Pythick s uncle A little further on I found the older and smaller wall which used to enclose the pent up inner prison where nobody was put except for ceremony But whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place turning out of Angel Court leading to Bermondsey will find his feet on the very paving stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left very little altered if at all except that the walls were lowered when the place got free will look upon rooms in which the debtors lived and will stand among the crowding ghosts of many miserable years In the Preface to Bleak House I remarked that I had never had so many readers In the Preface to its next successor Little Dorrit I have still to repeat the same words Deeply sensible of the affection and confidence that have grown up between us I add to this Preface as I added to that May we meet again London May eighteen fifty seven BOOK THE FIRST POVERTY CHAPTER one Sun and Shadow Thirty years ago Marseilles lay burning in the sun one day A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern France then than at any other time before or since Everything in Marseilles and about Marseilles had stared at the fervid sky and been stared at in return until a staring habit had become universal there Strangers were stared out of countenance by staring white houses staring white walls staring white streets staring tracts of arid road staring hills from which verdure was burnt away The only things to be seen not fixedly staring and glaring were the vines drooping under their load of grapes These did occasionally wink a little as the hot air barely moved their faint leaves There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour or on the beautiful sea without The line of demarcation between the two colours black and blue showed the point which the pure sea would not pass but it lay as quiet as the abominable pool with which it never mixed Boats without awnings were too hot to touch ships blistered at their moorings the stones of the quays had not cooled night or day for months Hindoos Russians Chinese Spaniards Portuguese Englishmen Frenchmen Genoese Neapolitans Venetians Greeks Turks descendants from all the builders of Babel come to trade at Marseilles sought the shade alike taking refuge in any hiding place from a sea too intensely blue to be looked at and a sky of purple set with one great flaming jewel of fire The universal stare made the eyes ache Towards the distant line of Italian coast indeed it was a little relieved by light clouds of mist slowly rising from the evaporation of the sea but it softened nowhere else Far away the staring roads deep in dust stared from the hill side stared from the hollow stared from the interminable plain Far away the dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages and the monotonous wayside avenues of parched trees without shade drooped beneath the stare of earth and sky So did the horses with drowsy bells in long files of carts creeping slowly towards the interior so did their recumbent drivers when they were awake which rarely happened so did the exhausted labourers in the fields Everything that lived or grew was oppressed by the glare except the lizard passing swiftly over rough stone walls and the cicala chirping his dry hot chirp like a rattle The very dust was scorched brown and something quivered in the atmosphere as if the air itself were panting Blinds shutters curtains awnings were all closed and drawn to keep out the stare Grant it but a chink or keyhole and it shot in like a white hot arrow The churches were the freest from it To come out of the twilight of pillars and arches dreamily dotted with winking lamps dreamily peopled with ugly old shadows piously dozing spitting and begging was to plunge into a fiery river and swim for life to the nearest strip of shade So with people lounging and lying wherever shade was with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs with occasional jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious drums Marseilles a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted lay broiling in the sun one day In Marseilles that day there was a villainous prison In one of its chambers so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive stare blinked at it and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for itself were two men Besides the two men a notched and disfigured bench immovable from the wall with a draught board rudely hacked upon it with a knife a set of draughts made of old buttons and soup bones a set of dominoes two mats and two or three wine bottles That was all the chamber held exclusive of rats and other unseen vermin in addition to the seen vermin the two men It received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars fashioned like a pretty large window by means of which it could be always inspected from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave There was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into the masonry three or four feet above the ground Upon it one of the two men lolled half sitting and half lying with his knees drawn up and his feet and shoulders planted against the opposite sides of the aperture The bars were wide enough apart to admit of his thrusting his arm through to the elbow and so he held on negligently for his greater ease A prison taint was on everything there The imprisoned air the imprisoned light the imprisoned damps the imprisoned men were all deteriorated by confinement As the captive men were faded and haggard so the iron was rusty the stone was slimy the wood was rotten the air was faint the light was dim Like a well like a vault like a tomb the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside and would have kept its polluted atmosphere intact in one of the spice islands of the Indian ocean The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled He jerked his great cloak more heavily upon him by an impatient movement of one shoulder and growled To the devil with this Brigand of a Sun that never shines in here He was waiting to be fed looking sideways through the bars that he might see the further down the stairs with much of the expression of a wild beast in similar expectation But his eyes too close together were not so nobly set in his head as those of the king of beasts are in his and they were sharp rather than bright pointed weapons with little surface to betray them They had no depth or change they glittered and they opened and shut So far and waiving their use to himself a clockmaker could have made a better pair He had a hook nose handsome after its kind but too high between the eyes by probably just as much as his eyes were too near to one another For the rest he was large and tall in frame had thin lips where his thick moustache showed them at all and a quantity of dry hair of no definable colour in its shaggy state but shot with red The hand with which he held the grating seamed all over the back with ugly scratches newly healed was unusually small and plump would have been unusually white but for the prison grime The other man was lying on the stone floor covered with a coarse brown coat Get up pig growled the first Don t sleep when I am hungry It s all one master said the pig in a submissive manner and not without cheerfulness I can wake when I will I can sleep when I will It s all the same As he said it he rose shook himself scratched himself tied his brown coat loosely round his neck by the sleeves he had previously used it as a coverlet and sat down upon the pavement yawning with his back against the wall opposite to the grating Say what the hour is grumbled the first man The mid day bells will ring in forty minutes When he made the little pause he had looked round the prison room as if for certain information You are a clock How is it that you always know How can I say I always know what the hour is and where I am I was brought in here at night and out of a boat but I know where I am See here Marseilles harbour on his knees on the pavement mapping it all out with a swarthy forefinger Toulon where the galleys are Spain over there Algiers over there Creeping away to the left here Nice Round by the Cornice to Genoa Genoa Mole and Harbour Quarantine Ground City there terrace gardens blushing with the bella donna Here Porto Fino Stand out for Leghorn Out again for Civita Vecchia so away to hey there s no room for Naples he had got to the wall by this time but it s all one it s in there He remained on his knees looking up at his fellow prisoner with a lively look for a prison A sunburnt quick lithe little man though rather thickset Earrings in his brown ears white teeth lighting up his grotesque brown face intensely black hair clustering about his brown throat a ragged red shirt open at his brown breast Loose seaman like trousers decent shoes a long red cap a red sash round his waist and a knife in it Judge if I come back from Naples as I went See here my master Civita Vecchia Leghorn Porto Fino Genoa Cornice Off Nice which is in there Marseilles you and me The apartment of the jailer and his keys is where I put this thumb and here at my wrist they keep the national razor in its case the guillotine locked up The other man spat suddenly on the pavement and gurgled in his throat Some lock below gurgled in its throat immediately afterwards and then a door crashed Slow steps began ascending the stairs the prattle of a sweet little voice mingled with the noise they made and the prison keeper appeared carrying his daughter three or four years old and a basket How goes the world this forenoon gentlemen My little one you see going round with me to have a peep at her father s birds Fie then Look at the birds my pretty look at the birds He looked sharply at the birds himself as he held the child up at the grate especially at the little bird whose activity he seemed to mistrust I have brought your bread Signor John Baptist said he they all spoke in French but the little man was an Italian and if I might recommend you not to game You don t recommend the master said John Baptist showing his teeth as he smiled Oh but the master wins returned the jailer with a passing look of no particular liking at the other man and you lose It s quite another thing You get husky bread and sour drink by it and he gets sausage of Lyons veal in savoury jelly white bread strachino cheese and good wine by it Look at the birds my pretty Poor birds said the child The fair little face touched with divine compassion as it peeped shrinkingly through the grate was like an angel s in the prison John Baptist rose and moved towards it as if it had a good attraction for him The other bird remained as before except for an impatient glance at the basket Stay said the jailer putting his little daughter on the outer ledge of the grate she shall feed the birds This big loaf is for Signor John Baptist We must break it to get it through into the cage So there s a tame bird to kiss the little hand This sausage in a vine leaf is for Monsieur Rigaud Again this veal in savoury jelly is for Monsieur Rigaud Again these three white little loaves are for Monsieur Rigaud Again this cheese again this wine again this tobacco all for Monsieur Rigaud Lucky bird The child put all these things between the bars into the soft Smooth well shaped hand with evident dread more than once drawing back her own and looking at the man with her fair brow roughened into an expression half of fright and half of anger Whereas she had put the lump of coarse bread into the swart scaled knotted hands of John Baptist who had scarcely as much nail on his eight fingers and two thumbs as would have made out one for Monsieur Rigaud with ready confidence and when he kissed her hand had herself passed it caressingly over his face Monsieur Rigaud indifferent to this distinction propitiated the father by laughing and nodding at the daughter as often as she gave him anything and so soon as he had all his viands about him in convenient nooks of the ledge on which he rested began to eat with an appetite When Monsieur Rigaud laughed a change took place in his face that was more remarkable than prepossessing His moustache went up under his nose and his nose came down over his moustache in a very sinister and cruel manner There said the jailer turning his basket upside down to beat the crumbs out I have expended all the money I received here is the note of it and that s a thing accomplished Monsieur Rigaud as I expected yesterday the President will look for the pleasure of your society at an hour after mid day to day To try me eh said Rigaud pausing knife in hand and morsel in mouth You have said it To try you There is no news for me asked John Baptist who had begun contentedly to munch his bread The jailer shrugged his shoulders Lady of mine Am I to lie here all my life my father What do I know cried the jailer turning upon him with southern quickness and gesticulating with both his hands and all his fingers as if he were threatening to tear him to pieces My friend how is it possible for me to tell how long you are to lie here What do I know John Baptist Cavalletto Death of my life There are prisoners here sometimes who are not in such a devil of a hurry to be tried He seemed to glance obliquely at Monsieur Rigaud in this remark but Monsieur Rigaud had already resumed his meal though not with quite so quick an appetite as before Adieu my birds said the keeper of the prison taking his pretty child in his arms and dictating the words with a kiss Adieu my birds the pretty child repeated Her innocent face looked back so brightly over his shoulder as he walked away with her singing her the song of the child s game Who passes by this road so late Compagnon de la Majolaine Who passes by this road so late Always gay that John Baptist felt it a point of honour to reply at the grate and in good time and tune though a little hoarsely Of all the king s knights tis the flower Compagnon de la Majolaine Of all the king s knights tis the flower Always gay which accompanied them so far down the few steep stairs that the prison keeper had to stop at last for his little daughter to hear the song out and repeat the Refrain while they were yet in sight Then the child s head disappeared and the prison keeper s head disappeared but the little voice prolonged the strain until the door clashed Monsieur Rigaud finding the listening John Baptist in his way before the echoes had ceased even the echoes were the weaker for imprisonment and seemed to lag reminded him with a push of his foot that he had better resume his own darker place The little man sat down again upon the pavement with the negligent ease of one who was thoroughly accustomed to pavements and placing three hunks of coarse bread before himself and falling to upon a fourth began contentedly to work his way through them as if to clear them off were a sort of game Perhaps he glanced at the Lyons sausage and perhaps he glanced at the veal in savoury jelly but they were not there long to make his mouth water Monsieur Rigaud soon dispatched them in spite of the president and tribunal and proceeded to suck his fingers as clean as he could and to wipe them on his vine leaves Then as he paused in his drink to contemplate his fellow prisoner his moustache went up and his nose came down How do you find the bread A little dry but I have my old sauce here returned John Baptist holding up his knife How sauce I can cut my bread so like a melon Or so like an omelette Or so like a fried fish Or so like Lyons sausage said John Baptist demonstrating the various cuts on the bread he held and soberly chewing what he had in his mouth Here cried Monsieur Rigaud You may drink You may finish this It was no great gift for there was mighty little wine left but Signor Cavalletto jumping to his feet received the bottle gratefully turned it upside down at his mouth and smacked his lips Put the bottle by with the rest said Rigaud The little man obeyed his orders and stood ready to give him a lighted match for he was now rolling his tobacco into cigarettes by the aid of little squares of paper which had been brought in with it Here You may have one A thousand thanks my master John Baptist said in his own language and with the quick conciliatory manner of his own countrymen Monsieur Rigaud arose lighted a cigarette put the rest of his stock into a breast pocket and stretched himself out at full length upon the bench Cavalletto sat down on the pavement holding one of his ankles in each hand and smoking peacefully There seemed to be some uncomfortable attraction of Monsieur Rigaud s eyes to the immediate neighbourhood of that part of the pavement where the thumb had been in the plan They were so drawn in that direction that the Italian more than once followed them to and back from the pavement in some surprise What an infernal hole this is said Monsieur Rigaud breaking a long pause Look at the light of day Day the light of yesterday week the light of six months ago the light of six years ago So slack and dead It came languishing down a square funnel that blinded a window in the staircase wall through which the sky was never seen nor anything else Cavalletto said Monsieur Rigaud suddenly withdrawing his gaze from this funnel to which they had both involuntarily turned their eyes you know me for a gentleman Surely surely How long have we been here I eleven weeks to morrow night at midnight You nine weeks and three days at five this afternoon Have I ever done anything here Ever touched the broom or spread the mats or rolled them up or found the draughts or collected the dominoes or put my hand to any kind of work Never Have you ever thought of looking to me to do any kind of work John Baptist answered with that peculiar back handed shake of the right forefinger which is the most expressive negative in the Italian language No You knew from the first moment when you saw me here that I was a gentleman ALTRO returned John Baptist closing his eyes and giving his head a most vehement toss The word being according to its Genoese emphasis a confirmation a contradiction an assertion a denial a taunt a compliment a joke and fifty other things became in the present instance with a significance beyond all power of written expression our familiar English I believe you Haha You are right A gentleman I am And a gentleman I ll live and a gentleman I ll die It s my intent to be a gentleman It s my game Death of my soul I play it out wherever I go He changed his posture to a sitting one crying with a triumphant air Here I am See me Shaken out of destiny s dice box into the company of a mere smuggler shut up with a poor little contraband trader whose papers are wrong and whom the police lay hold of besides for placing his boat as a means of getting beyond the frontier at the disposition of other little people whose papers are wrong and he instinctively recognises my position even by this light and in this place It s well done By Heaven I win however the game goes Again his moustache went up and his nose came down What s the hour now he asked with a dry hot pallor upon him rather difficult of association with merriment A little half hour after mid day Good The President will have a gentleman before him soon Come Shall I tell you on what accusation It must be now or never for I shall not return here Either I shall go free or I shall go to be made ready for shaving You know where they keep the razor Signor Cavalletto took his cigarette from between his parted lips and showed more momentary discomfiture than might have been expected I am a Monsieur Rigaud stood up to say it I am a cosmopolitan gentleman I own no particular country My father was Swiss Canton de Vaud My mother was French by blood English by birth I myself was born in Belgium I am a citizen of the world His theatrical air as he stood with one arm on his hip within the folds of his cloak together with his manner of disregarding his companion and addressing the opposite wall instead seemed to intimate that he was rehearsing for the President whose examination he was shortly to undergo rather than troubling himself merely to enlighten so small a person as John Baptist Cavalletto Call me five and thirty years of age I have seen the world I have lived here and lived there and lived like a gentleman everywhere I have been treated and respected as a gentleman universally If you try to prejudice me by making out that I have lived by my wits how do your lawyers live your politicians your intriguers your men of the Exchange He kept his small smooth hand in constant requisition as if it were a witness to his gentility that had often done him good service before Two years ago I came to Marseilles I admit that I was poor I had been ill When your lawyers your politicians your intriguers your men of the Exchange fall ill and have not scraped money together they become poor I put up at the Cross of Gold kept then by Monsieur Henri Barronneau sixty five at least and in a failing state of health I had lived in the house some four months when Monsieur Henri Barronneau had the misfortune to die at any rate not a rare misfortune that It happens without any aid of mine pretty often John Baptist having smoked his cigarette down to his fingers ends Monsieur Rigaud had the magnanimity to throw him another He lighted the second at the ashes of the first and smoked on looking sideways at his companion who preoccupied with his own case hardly looked at him Monsieur Barronneau left a widow She was two and twenty She had gained a reputation for beauty and which is often another thing was beautiful I continued to live at the Cross of Gold I married Madame Barronneau It is not for me to say whether there was any great disparity in such a match Here I stand with the contamination of a jail upon me but it is possible that you may think me better suited to her than her former husband was He had a certain air of being a handsome man which he was not and a certain air of being a well bred man which he was not It was mere swagger and challenge but in this particular as in many others blustering assertion goes for proof half over the world Be it as it may Madame Barronneau approved of me That is not to prejudice me I hope His eye happening to light upon John Baptist with this inquiry that little man briskly shook his head in the negative and repeated in an argumentative tone under his breath altro altro altro altro an infinite number of times Now came the difficulties of our position I am proud I say nothing in defence of pride but I am proud It is also my character to govern I can t submit I must govern Unfortunately the property of Madame Rigaud was settled upon herself Such was the insane act of her late husband More unfortunately still she had relations When a wife s relations interpose against a husband who is a gentleman who is proud and who must govern the consequences are inimical to peace There was yet another source of difference between us Madame Rigaud was unfortunately a little vulgar I sought to improve her manners and ameliorate her general tone she supported in this likewise by her relations resented my endeavours Quarrels began to arise between us and propagated and exaggerated by the slanders of the relations of Madame Rigaud to become notorious to the neighbours It has been said that I treated Madame Rigaud with cruelty I may have been seen to slap her face nothing more I have a light hand and if I have been seen apparently to correct Madame Rigaud in that manner I have done it almost playfully If the playfulness of Monsieur Rigaud were at all expressed by his smile at this point the relations of Madame Rigaud might have said that they would have much preferred his correcting that unfortunate woman seriously I am sensitive and brave I do not advance it as a merit to be sensitive and brave but it is my character If the male relations of Madame Rigaud had put themselves forward openly I should have known how to deal with them They knew that and their machinations were conducted in secret consequently Madame Rigaud and I were brought into frequent and unfortunate collision Even when I wanted any little sum of money for my personal expenses I could not obtain it without collision and I too a man whose character it is to govern One night Madame Rigaud and myself were walking amicably I may say like lovers on a height overhanging the sea An evil star occasioned Madame Rigaud to advert to her relations I reasoned with her on that subject and remonstrated on the want of duty and devotion manifested in her allowing herself to be influenced by their jealous animosity towards her husband Madame Rigaud retorted I retorted Madame Rigaud grew warm I grew warm and provoked her I admit it Frankness is a part of my character At length Madame Rigaud in an access of fury that I must ever deplore threw herself upon me with screams of passion no doubt those that were overheard at some distance tore my clothes tore my hair lacerated my hands trampled and trod the dust and finally leaped over dashing herself to death upon the rocks below Such is the train of incidents which malice has perverted into my endeavouring to force from Madame Rigaud a relinquishment of her rights and on her persistence in a refusal to make the concession I required struggling with her assassinating her He stepped aside to the ledge where the vine leaves yet lay strewn about collected two or three and stood wiping his hands upon them with his back to the light Well he demanded after a silence have you nothing to say to all that It s ugly returned the little man who had risen and was brightening his knife upon his shoe as he leaned an arm against the wall What do you mean John Baptist polished his knife in silence Do you mean that I have not represented the case correctly Al tro returned John Baptist The word was an apology now and stood for Oh by no means What then Presidents and tribunals are so prejudiced Well cried the other uneasily flinging the end of his cloak over his shoulder with an oath let them do their worst Truly I think they will murmured John Baptist to himself as he bent his head to put his knife in his sash Nothing more was said on either side though they both began walking to and fro and necessarily crossed at every turn Monsieur Rigaud sometimes stopped as if he were going to put his case in a new light or make some irate remonstrance but Signor Cavalletto continuing to go slowly to and fro at a grotesque kind of jog trot pace with his eyes turned downward nothing came of these inclinings By and by the noise of the key in the lock arrested them both The sound of voices succeeded and the tread of feet The door clashed the voices and the feet came on and the prison keeper slowly ascended the stairs followed by a guard of soldiers Now Monsieur Rigaud said he pausing for a moment at the grate with his keys in his hands have the goodness to come out I am to depart in state I see Why unless you did returned the jailer you might depart in so many pieces that it would be difficult to get you together again There s a crowd Monsieur Rigaud and it doesn t love you He passed on out of sight and unlocked and unbarred a low door in the corner of the chamber Now said he as he opened it and appeared within come out There is no sort of whiteness in all the hues under the sun at all like the whiteness of Monsieur Rigaud s face as it was then Neither is there any expression of the human countenance at all like that expression in every little line of which the frightened heart is seen to beat Both are conventionally compared with death but the difference is the whole deep gulf between the struggle done and the fight at its most desperate extremity He lighted another of his paper cigars at his companion s put it tightly between his teeth covered his head with a soft slouched hat threw the end of his cloak over his shoulder again and walked out into the side gallery on which the door opened without taking any further notice of Signor Cavalletto As to that little man himself his whole attention had become absorbed in getting near the door and looking out at it Precisely as a beast might approach the opened gate of his den and eye the freedom beyond he passed those few moments in watching and peering until the door was closed upon him There was an officer in command of the soldiers a stout serviceable profoundly calm man with his drawn sword in his hand smoking a cigar He very briefly directed the placing of Monsieur Rigaud in the midst of the party put himself with consummate indifference at their head gave the word march and so they all went jingling down the staircase The door clashed the key turned and a ray of unusual light and a breath of unusual air seemed to have passed through the jail vanishing in a tiny wreath of smoke from the cigar Still in his captivity like a lower animal like some impatient ape or roused bear of the smaller species the prisoner now left solitary had jumped upon the ledge to lose no glimpse of this departure As he yet stood clasping the grate with both hands an uproar broke upon his hearing yells shrieks oaths threats execrations all comprehended in it though as in a storm nothing but a raging swell of sound distinctly heard Excited into a still greater resemblance to a caged wild animal by his anxiety to know more the prisoner leaped nimbly down ran round the chamber leaped nimbly up again clasped the grate and tried to shake it leaped down and ran leaped up and listened and never rested until the noise becoming more and more distant had died away How many better prisoners have worn their noble hearts out so no man thinking of it not even the beloved of their souls realising it great kings and governors who had made them captive careering in the sunlight jauntily and men cheering them on Even the said great personages dying in bed making exemplary ends and sounding speeches and polite history more servile than their instruments embalming them At last John Baptist now able to choose his own spot within the compass of those walls for the exercise of his faculty of going to sleep when he would lay down upon the bench with his face turned over on his crossed arms and slumbered In his submission in his lightness in his good humour in his short lived passion in his easy contentment with hard bread and hard stones in his ready sleep in his fits and starts altogether a true son of the land that gave him birth The wide stare stared itself out for one while the Sun went down in a red green golden glory the stars came out in the heavens and the fire flies mimicked them in the lower air as men may feebly imitate the goodness of a better order of beings the long dusty roads and the interminable plains were in repose and so deep a hush was on the sea that it scarcely whispered of the time when it shall give up its dead CHAPTER two Fellow Travellers No more of yesterday s howling over yonder to day Sir is there I have heard none Then you may be sure there is none When these people howl they howl to be heard Most people do I suppose Ah but these people are always howling Never happy otherwise Do you mean the Marseilles people I mean the French people They re always at it As to Marseilles we know what Marseilles is It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world that was ever composed It couldn t exist without allonging and marshonging to something or other victory or death or blazes or something The speaker with a whimsical good humour upon him all the time looked over the parapet wall with the greatest disparagement of Marseilles and taking up a determined position by putting his hands in his pockets and rattling his money at it apostrophised it with a short laugh Allong and marshong indeed It would be more creditable to you I think to let other people allong and marshong about their lawful business instead of shutting em up in quarantine Tiresome enough said the other But we shall be out to day Out to day repeated the first It s almost an aggravation of the enormity that we shall be out to day Out What have we ever been in for For no very strong reason I must say But as we come from the East and as the East is the country of the plague The plague repeated the other That s my grievance I have had the plague continually ever since I have been here I am like a sane man shut up in a madhouse I can t stand the suspicion of the thing I came here as well as ever I was in my life but to suspect me of the plague is to give me the plague And I have had it and I have got it You bear it very well mister Meagles said the second speaker smiling No If you knew the real state of the case that s the last observation you would think of making I have been waking up night after night and saying NOW I have got it NOW it has developed itself NOW I am in for it NOW these fellows are making out their case for their precautions Why I d as soon have a spit put through me and be stuck upon a card in a collection of beetles as lead the life I have been leading here Well mister Meagles say no more about it now it s over urged a cheerful feminine voice Over repeated mister Meagles who appeared though without any ill nature to be in that peculiar state of mind in which the last word spoken by anybody else is a new injury Over and why should I say no more about it because it s over It was missus Meagles who had spoken to mister Meagles and missus Meagles was like mister Meagles comely and healthy with a pleasant English face which had been looking at homely things for five and fifty years or more and shone with a bright reflection of them There Never mind Father never mind said missus Meagles For goodness sake content yourself with Pet With Pet repeated mister Meagles in his injured vein Pet however being close behind him touched him on the shoulder and mister Meagles immediately forgave Marseilles from the bottom of his heart Pet was about twenty A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in natural ringlets A lovely girl with a frank face and wonderful eyes so large so soft so bright set to such perfection in her kind good head She was round and fresh and dimpled and spoilt and there was in Pet an air of timidity and dependence which was the best weakness in the world and gave her the only crowning charm a girl so pretty and pleasant could have been without Now I ask you said mister Meagles in the blandest confidence falling back a step himself and handing his daughter a step forward to illustrate his question I ask you simply as between man and man you know DID you ever hear of such damned nonsense as putting Pet in quarantine It has had the result of making even quarantine enjoyable Come said mister Meagles that s something to be sure I am obliged to you for that remark Now Pet my darling you had better go along with Mother and get ready for the boat The officer of health and a variety of humbugs in cocked hats are coming off to let us out of this at last and all we jail birds are to breakfast together in something approaching to a Christian style again before we take wing for our different destinations Tattycoram stick you close to your young mistress He spoke to a handsome girl with lustrous dark hair and eyes and very neatly dressed who replied with a half curtsey as she passed off in the train of missus Meagles and Pet They crossed the bare scorched terrace all three together and disappeared through a staring white archway mister Meagles s companion a grave dark man of forty still stood looking towards this archway after they were gone until mister Meagles tapped him on the arm I beg your pardon said he starting Not at all said mister Meagles They took one silent turn backward and forward in the shade of the wall getting at the height on which the quarantine barracks are placed what cool refreshment of sea breeze there was at seven in the morning mister Meagles s companion resumed the conversation May I ask you he said what is the name of Tattycoram mister Meagles struck in I have not the least idea I thought said the other that Tattycoram suggested mister Meagles again Thank you that Tattycoram was a name and I have several times wondered at the oddity of it Why the fact is said mister Meagles missus Meagles and myself are you see practical people That you have frequently mentioned in the course of the agreeable and interesting conversations we have had together walking up and down on these stones said the other with a half smile breaking through the gravity of his dark face Practical people So one day five or six years ago now when we took Pet to church at the Foundling you have heard of the Foundling Hospital in London Similar to the Institution for the Found Children in Paris I have seen it Well One day when we took Pet to church there to hear the music because as practical people it is the business of our lives to show her everything that we think can please her Mother my usual name for missus Meagles began to cry so that it was necessary to take her out What s the matter Mother said I when we had brought her a little round you are frightening Pet my dear Yes I know that Father says Mother but I think it s through my loving her so much that it ever came into my head That ever what came into your head Mother O dear dear cried Mother breaking out again when I saw all those children ranged tier above tier and appealing from the father none of them has ever known on earth to the great Father of us all in Heaven I thought does any wretched mother ever come here and look among those young faces wondering which is the poor child she brought into this forlorn world never through all its life to know her love her kiss her face her voice even her name Now that was practical in Mother and I told her so I said Mother that s what I call practical in you my dear The other not unmoved assented So I said next day Now Mother I have a proposition to make that I think you ll approve of Let us take one of those same little children to be a little maid to Pet We are practical people So if we should find her temper a little defective or any of her ways a little wide of ours we shall know what we have to take into account We shall know what an immense deduction must be made from all the influences and experiences that have formed us no parents no child brother or sister no individuality of home no Glass Slipper or Fairy Godmother And that s the way we came by Tattycoram And the name itself By George said mister Meagles I was forgetting the name itself Why she was called in the Institution Harriet Beadle an arbitrary name of course Now Harriet we changed into Hattey and then into Tatty because as practical people we thought even a playful name might be a new thing to her and might have a softening and affectionate kind of effect don t you see As to Beadle that I needn t say was wholly out of the question If there is anything that is not to be tolerated on any terms anything that is a type of Jack in office insolence and absurdity anything that represents in coats waistcoats and big sticks our English holding on by nonsense after every one has found it out it is a beadle You haven t seen a beadle lately As an Englishman who has been more than twenty years in China no Then said mister Meagles laying his forefinger on his companion s breast with great animation don t you see a beadle now if you can help it Whenever I see a beadle in full fig coming down a street on a Sunday at the head of a charity school I am obliged to turn and run away or I should hit him The name of Beadle being out of the question and the originator of the Institution for these poor foundlings having been a blessed creature of the name of Coram we gave that name to Pet s little maid At one time she was Tatty and at one time she was Coram until we got into a way of mixing the two names together and now she is always Tattycoram Your daughter said the other when they had taken another silent turn to and fro and after standing for a moment at the wall glancing down at the sea had resumed their walk is your only child I know mister Meagles May I ask you in no impertinent curiosity but because I have had so much pleasure in your society may never in this labyrinth of a world exchange a quiet word with you again and wish to preserve an accurate remembrance of you and yours may I ask you if I have not gathered from your good wife that you have had other children No No said mister Meagles Not exactly other children One other child I am afraid I have inadvertently touched upon a tender theme Never mind said mister Meagles If I am grave about it I am not at all sorrowful It quiets me for a moment but does not make me unhappy Pet had a twin sister who died when we could just see her eyes exactly like Pet s above the table as she stood on tiptoe holding by it Ah indeed indeed Yes and being practical people a result has gradually sprung up in the minds of missus Meagles and myself which perhaps you may or perhaps you may not understand Pet and her baby sister were so exactly alike and so completely one that in our thoughts we have never been able to separate them since It would be of no use to tell us that our dead child was a mere infant We have changed that child according to the changes in the child spared to us and always with us As Pet has grown that child has grown as Pet has become more sensible and womanly her sister has become more sensible and womanly by just the same degrees It would be as hard to convince me that if I was to pass into the other world to morrow I should not through the mercy of God be received there by a daughter just like Pet as to persuade me that Pet herself is not a reality at my side I understand you said the other gently As to her pursued her father the sudden loss of her little picture and playfellow and her early association with that mystery in which we all have our equal share but which is not often so forcibly presented to a child has necessarily had some influence on her character Then her mother and I were not young when we married and Pet has always had a sort of grown up life with us though we have tried to adapt ourselves to her We have been advised more than once when she has been a little ailing to change climate and air for her as often as we could especially at about this time of her life and to keep her amused So as I have no need to stick at a bank desk now though I have been poor enough in my time I assure you or I should have married missus Meagles long before we go trotting about the world This is how you found us staring at the Nile and the Pyramids and the Sphinxes and the Desert and all the rest of it and this is how Tattycoram will be a greater traveller in course of time than Captain Cook I thank you said the other very heartily for your confidence Don t mention it returned mister Meagles I am sure you are quite welcome And now mister Clennam perhaps I may ask you whether you have yet come to a decision where to go next Indeed no I am such a waif and stray everywhere that I am liable to be drifted where any current may set It s extraordinary to me if you ll excuse my freedom in saying so that you don t go straight to London said mister Meagles in the tone of a confidential adviser Perhaps I shall Ay But I mean with a will I have no will That is to say he coloured a little next to none that I can put in action now Trained by main force broken not bent heavily ironed with an object on which I was never consulted and which was never mine shipped away to the other end of the world before I was of age and exiled there until my father s death there a year ago always grinding in a mill I always hated what is to be expected from me in middle life Will purpose hope All those lights were extinguished before I could sound the words Light em up again said mister Meagles Ah Easily said I am the son mister Meagles of a hard father and mother I am the only child of parents who weighed measured and priced everything for whom what could not be weighed measured and priced had no existence Strict people as the phrase is professors of a stern religion their very religion was a gloomy sacrifice of tastes and sympathies that were never their own offered up as a part of a bargain for the security of their possessions Austere faces inexorable discipline penance in this world and terror in the next nothing graceful or gentle anywhere and the void in my cowed heart everywhere this was my childhood if I may so misuse the word as to apply it to such a beginning of life Really though said mister Meagles made very uncomfortable by the picture offered to his imagination That was a tough commencement But come You must now study and profit by all that lies beyond it like a practical man If the people who are usually called practical were practical in your direction Why so they are said mister Meagles Are they indeed Well I suppose so returned mister Meagles thinking about it Eh One can but be practical and missus Meagles and myself are nothing else My unknown course is easier and more helpful than I had expected to find it then said Clennam shaking his head with his grave smile Enough of me Here is the boat The boat was filled with the cocked hats to which mister Meagles entertained a national objection and the wearers of those cocked hats landed and came up the steps and all the impounded travellers congregated together There was then a mighty production of papers on the part of the cocked hats and a calling over of names and great work of signing sealing stamping inking and sanding with exceedingly blurred gritty and undecipherable results Finally everything was done according to rule and the travellers were at liberty to depart whithersoever they would They made little account of stare and glare in the new pleasure of recovering their freedom but flitted across the harbour in gay boats and reassembled at a great hotel whence the sun was excluded by closed lattices and where bare paved floors lofty ceilings and resounding corridors tempered the intense heat There a great table in a great room was soon profusely covered with a superb repast and the quarantine quarters became bare indeed remembered among dainty dishes southern fruits cooled wines flowers from Genoa snow from the mountain tops and all the colours of the rainbow flashing in the mirrors But I bear those monotonous walls no ill will now said mister Meagles One always begins to forgive a place as soon as it s left behind I dare say a prisoner begins to relent towards his prison after he is let out They were about thirty in company and all talking but necessarily in groups Father and Mother Meagles sat with their daughter between them the last three on one side of the table on the opposite side sat mister Clennam a tall French gentleman with raven hair and beard of a swart and terrible not to say genteelly diabolical aspect but who had shown himself the mildest of men and a handsome young Englishwoman travelling quite alone who had a proud observant face and had either withdrawn herself from the rest or been avoided by the rest nobody herself excepted perhaps could have quite decided which The rest of the party were of the usual materials travellers on business and travellers for pleasure officers from India on leave merchants in the Greek and Turkey trades a clerical English husband in a meek strait waistcoat on a wedding trip with his young wife a majestic English mama and papa of the patrician order with a family of three growing up daughters who were keeping a journal for the confusion of their fellow creatures and a deaf old English mother tough in travel with a very decidedly grown up daughter indeed which daughter went sketching about the universe in the expectation of ultimately toning herself off into the married state The reserved Englishwoman took up mister Meagles in his last remark Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison said she slowly and with emphasis That was my speculation Miss Wade I don t pretend to know positively how a prisoner might feel I never was one before Mademoiselle doubts said the French gentleman in his own language it s being so easy to forgive I do Pet had to translate this passage to mister Meagles who never by any accident acquired any knowledge whatever of the language of any country into which he travelled Oh said he Dear me But that s a pity isn t it That I am not credulous said Miss Wade Not exactly that Put it another way That you can t believe it easy to forgive My experience she quietly returned has been correcting my belief in many respects for some years It is our natural progress I have heard Well well But it s not natural to bear malice I hope said mister Meagles cheerily If I had been shut up in any place to pine and suffer I should always hate that place and wish to burn it down or raze it to the ground I know no more Strong sir said mister Meagles to the Frenchman it being another of his habits to address individuals of all nations in idiomatic English with a perfect conviction that they were bound to understand it somehow Rather forcible in our fair friend you ll agree with me I think The French gentleman courteously replied Plait il To which mister Meagles returned with much satisfaction You are right My opinion The breakfast beginning by and by to languish mister Meagles made the company a speech It was short enough and sensible enough considering that it was a speech at all and hearty It merely went to the effect that as they had all been thrown together by chance and had all preserved a good understanding together and were now about to disperse and were not likely ever to find themselves all together again what could they do better than bid farewell to one another and give one another good speed in a simultaneous glass of cool champagne all round the table It was done and with a general shaking of hands the assembly broke up for ever The solitary young lady all this time had said no more She rose with the rest and silently withdrew to a remote corner of the great room where she sat herself on a couch in a window seeming to watch the reflection of the water as it made a silver quivering on the bars of the lattice She sat turned away from the whole length of the apartment as if she were lonely of her own haughty choice And yet it would have been as difficult as ever to say positively whether she avoided the rest or was avoided The shadow in which she sat falling like a gloomy veil across her forehead accorded very well with the character of her beauty One could hardly see the face so still and scornful set off by the arched dark eyebrows and the folds of dark hair without wondering what its expression would be if a change came over it That it could soften or relent appeared next to impossible That it could deepen into anger or any extreme of defiance and that it must change in that direction when it changed at all would have been its peculiar impression upon most observers It was dressed and trimmed into no ceremony of expression Although not an open face there was no pretence in it I am self contained and self reliant your opinion is nothing to me I have no interest in you care nothing for you and see and hear you with indifference this it said plainly It said so in the proud eyes in the lifted nostril in the handsome but compressed and even cruel mouth Cover either two of those channels of expression and the third would have said so still Mask them all and the mere turn of the head would have shown an unsubduable nature Pet had moved up to her she had been the subject of remark among her family and mister Clennam who were now the only other occupants of the room and was standing at her side Are you she turned her eyes and Pet faltered expecting any one to meet you here Miss Wade I No Father is sending to the Poste Restante Shall he have the pleasure of directing the messenger to ask if there are any letters for you I thank him but I know there can be none We are afraid said Pet sitting down beside her shyly and half tenderly that you will feel quite deserted when we are all gone Indeed Not said Pet apologetically and embarrassed by her eyes not of course that we are any company to you or that we have been able to be so or that we thought you wished it I have not intended to make it understood that I did wish it No Of course But in short said Pet timidly touching her hand as it lay impassive on the sofa between them will you not allow Father to tender you any slight assistance or service He will be very glad Very glad said mister Meagles coming forward with his wife and Clennam Anything short of speaking the language I shall be delighted to undertake I am sure I am obliged to you she returned but my arrangements are made and I prefer to go my own way in my own manner Do you said mister Meagles to himself as he surveyed her with a puzzled look Well There s character in that too I am not much used to the society of young ladies and I am afraid I may not show my appreciation of it as others might A pleasant journey to you Good bye She would not have put out her hand it seemed but that mister Meagles put out his so straight before her that she could not pass it She put hers in it and it lay there just as it had lain upon the couch Good bye said mister Meagles This is the last good bye upon the list for Mother and I have just said it to mister Clennam here and he only waits to say it to Pet Good bye We may never meet again In our course through life we shall meet the people who are coming to meet us from many strange places and by many strange roads was the composed reply and what it is set to us to do to them and what it is set to them to do to us will all be done There was something in the manner of these words that jarred upon Pet s ear It implied that what was to be done was necessarily evil and it caused her to say in a whisper O Father and to shrink childishly in her spoilt way a little closer to him This was not lost on the speaker Your pretty daughter she said starts to think of such things Yet looking full upon her you may be sure that there are men and women already on their road who have their business to do with YOU and who will do it Of a certainty they will do it They may be coming hundreds thousands of miles over the sea there they may be close at hand now they may be coming for anything you know or anything you can do to prevent it from the vilest sweepings of this very town With the coldest of farewells and with a certain worn expression on her beauty that gave it though scarcely yet in its prime a wasted look she left the room Now there were many stairs and passages that she had to traverse in passing from that part of the spacious house to the chamber she had secured for her own occupation When she had almost completed the journey and was passing along the gallery in which her room was she heard an angry sound of muttering and sobbing A door stood open and within she saw the attendant upon the girl she had just left the maid with the curious name She stood still to look at this maid A sullen passionate girl Her rich black hair was all about her face her face was flushed and hot and as she sobbed and raged she plucked at her lips with an unsparing hand Selfish brutes said the girl sobbing and heaving between whiles Not caring what becomes of me Leaving me here hungry and thirsty and tired to starve for anything they care Beasts Devils Wretches My poor girl what is the matter She looked up suddenly with reddened eyes and with her hands suspended in the act of pinching her neck freshly disfigured with great scarlet blots It s nothing to you what s the matter It don t signify to any one O yes it does I am sorry to see you so You are not sorry said the girl You are glad You know you are glad I never was like this but twice over in the quarantine yonder and both times you found me I am afraid of you Afraid of me Yes You seem to come like my own anger my own malice my own whatever it is I don t know what it is But I am ill used I am ill used I am ill used Here the sobs and the tears and the tearing hand which had all been suspended together since the first surprise went on together anew The visitor stood looking at her with a strange attentive smile It was wonderful to see the fury of the contest in the girl and the bodily struggle she made as if she were rent by the Demons of old I am younger than she is by two or three years and yet it s me that looks after her as if I was old and it s she that s always petted and called Baby I detest the name I hate her They make a fool of her they spoil her She thinks of nothing but herself she thinks no more of me than if I was a stock and a stone So the girl went on You must have patience I WON T have patience If they take much care of themselves and little or none of you you must not mind it I WILL mind it Hush Be more prudent You forget your dependent position I don t care for that I ll run away I ll do some mischief I won t bear it I can t bear it I shall die if I try to bear it The observer stood with her hand upon her own bosom looking at the girl as one afflicted with a diseased part might curiously watch the dissection and exposition of an analogous case The girl raged and battled with all the force of her youth and fulness of life until by little and little her passionate exclamations trailed off into broken murmurs as if she were in pain By corresponding degrees she sank into a chair then upon her knees then upon the ground beside the bed drawing the coverlet with her half to hide her shamed head and wet hair in it and half as it seemed to embrace it rather than have nothing to take to her repentant breast Go away from me go away from me When my temper comes upon me I am mad I know I might keep it off if I only tried hard enough and sometimes I do try hard enough and at other times I don t and won t What have I said I knew when I said it it was all lies They think I am being taken care of somewhere and have all I want They are nothing but good to me I love them dearly no people could ever be kinder to a thankless creature than they always are to me Do do go away for I am afraid of you I am afraid of myself when I feel my temper coming and I am as much afraid of you Go away from me and let me pray and cry myself better The day passed on and again the wide stare stared itself out and the hot night was on Marseilles and through it the caravan of the morning all dispersed went their appointed ways And thus ever by day and night under the sun and under the stars climbing the dusty hills and toiling along the weary plains journeying by land and journeying by sea coming and going so strangely to meet and to act and react on one another move all we restless travellers through the pilgrimage of life CHAPTER three Home It was a Sunday evening in London gloomy close and stale Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance sharp and flat cracked and clear fast and slow made the brick and mortar echoes hideous Melancholy streets in a penitential garb of soot steeped the souls of the people who were condemned to look at them out of windows in dire despondency In every thoroughfare up almost every alley and down almost every turning some doleful bell was throbbing jerking tolling as if the Plague were in the city and the dead carts were going round Everything was bolted and barred that could by possibility furnish relief to an overworked people No pictures no unfamiliar animals no rare plants or flowers no natural or artificial wonders of the ancient world all TABOO with that enlightened strictness that the ugly South Sea gods in the British Museum might have supposed themselves at home again Nothing to see but streets streets streets Nothing to breathe but streets streets streets Nothing to change the brooding mind or raise it up Nothing for the spent toiler to do but to compare the monotony of his seventh day with the monotony of his six days think what a weary life he led and make the best of it or the worst according to the probabilities At such a happy time so propitious to the interests of religion and morality mister Arthur Clennam newly arrived from Marseilles by way of Dover and by Dover coach the Blue eyed Maid sat in the window of a coffee house on Ludgate Hill Ten thousand responsible houses surrounded him frowning as heavily on the streets they composed as if they were every one inhabited by the ten young men of the Calender s story who blackened their faces and bemoaned their miseries every night Fifty thousand lairs surrounded him where people lived so unwholesomely that fair water put into their crowded rooms on Saturday night would be corrupt on Sunday morning albeit my lord their county member was amazed that they failed to sleep in company with their butcher s meat Miles of close wells and pits of houses where the inhabitants gasped for air stretched far away towards every point of the compass Through the heart of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed in the place of a fine fresh river What secular want could the million or so of human beings whose daily labour six days in the week lay among these Arcadian objects from the sweet sameness of which they had no escape between the cradle and the grave what secular want could they possibly have upon their seventh day Clearly they could want nothing but a stringent policeman mister Arthur Clennam sat in the window of the coffee house on Ludgate Hill counting one of the neighbouring bells making sentences and burdens of songs out of it in spite of himself and wondering how many sick people it might be the death of in the course of the year As the hour approached its changes of measure made it more and more exasperating At the quarter it went off into a condition of deadly lively importunity urging the populace in a voluble manner to Come to church Come to church Come to church At the ten minutes it became aware that the congregation would be scanty and slowly hammered out in low spirits They WON T come they WON T come they WON T come At the five minutes it abandoned hope and shook every house in the neighbourhood for three hundred seconds with one dismal swing per second as a groan of despair Thank Heaven said Clennam when the hour struck and the bell stopped But its sound had revived a long train of miserable Sundays and the procession would not stop with the bell but continued to march on Heaven forgive me said he and those who trained me How I have hated this day There was the dreary Sunday of his childhood when he sat with his hands before him scared out of his senses by a horrible tract which commenced business with the poor child by asking him in its title why he was going to Perdition a piece of curiosity that he really in a frock and drawers was not in a condition to satisfy and which for the further attraction of his infant mind had a parenthesis in every other line with some such hiccupping reference as two Ep Thess c iii v six seven There was the sleepy Sunday of his boyhood when like a military deserter he was marched to chapel by a picquet of teachers three times a day morally handcuffed to another boy and when he would willingly have bartered two meals of indigestible sermon for another ounce or two of inferior mutton at his scanty dinner in the flesh There was the interminable Sunday of his nonage when his mother stern of face and unrelenting of heart would sit all day behind a Bible bound like her own construction of it in the hardest barest and straitest boards with one dinted ornament on the cover like the drag of a chain and a wrathful sprinkling of red upon the edges of the leaves as if it of all books were a fortification against sweetness of temper natural affection and gentle intercourse There was the resentful Sunday of a little later when he sat down glowering and glooming through the tardy length of the day with a sullen sense of injury in his heart and no more real knowledge of the beneficent history of the New Testament than if he had been bred among idolaters There was a legion of Sundays all days of unserviceable bitterness and mortification slowly passing before him Beg pardon sir said a brisk waiter rubbing the table Wish see bed room Yes I have just made up my mind to do it Chaymaid cried the waiter Gelen box num seven wish see room Stay said Clennam rousing himself I was not thinking of what I said I answered mechanically I am not going to sleep here I am going home Deed sir Chaymaid Gelen box num seven not go sleep here gome He sat in the same place as the day died looking at the dull houses opposite and thinking if the disembodied spirits of former inhabitants were ever conscious of them how they must pity themselves for their old places of imprisonment Sometimes a face would appear behind the dingy glass of a window and would fade away into the gloom as if it had seen enough of life and had vanished out of it Presently the rain began to fall in slanting lines between him and those houses and people began to collect under cover of the public passage opposite and to look out hopelessly at the sky as the rain dropped thicker and faster Then wet umbrellas began to appear draggled skirts and mud What the mud had been doing with itself or where it came from who could say But it seemed to collect in a moment as a crowd will and in five minutes to have splashed all the sons and daughters of Adam The lamplighter was going his rounds now and as the fiery jets sprang up under his touch one might have fancied them astonished at being suffered to introduce any show of brightness into such a dismal scene mister Arthur Clennam took up his hat and buttoned his coat and walked out In the country the rain would have developed a thousand fresh scents and every drop would have had its bright association with some beautiful form of growth or life In the city it developed only foul stale smells and was a sickly lukewarm dirt stained wretched addition to the gutters He crossed by saint Paul s and went down at a long angle almost to the water s edge through some of the crooked and descending streets which lie and lay more crookedly and closely then between the river and Cheapside Passing now the mouldy hall of some obsolete Worshipful Company now the illuminated windows of a Congregationless Church that seemed to be waiting for some adventurous Belzoni to dig it out and discover its history passing silent warehouses and wharves and here and there a narrow alley leading to the river where a wretched little bill FOUND DROWNED was weeping on the wet wall he came at last to the house he sought An old brick house so dingy as to be all but black standing by itself within a gateway Before it a square court yard where a shrub or two and a patch of grass were as rank which is saying much as the iron railings enclosing them were rusty behind it a jumble of roots It was a double house with long narrow heavily framed windows Many years ago it had had it in its mind to slide down sideways it had been propped up however and was leaning on some half dozen gigantic crutches which gymnasium for the neighbouring cats weather stained smoke blackened and overgrown with weeds appeared in these latter days to be no very sure reliance Nothing changed said the traveller stopping to look round Dark and miserable as ever A light in my mother s window which seems never to have been extinguished since I came home twice a year from school and dragged my box over this pavement Well well well He went up to the door which had a projecting canopy in carved work of festooned jack towels and children s heads with water on the brain designed after a once popular monumental pattern and knocked A shuffling step was soon heard on the stone floor of the hall and the door was opened by an old man bent and dried but with keen eyes He had a candle in his hand and he held it up for a moment to assist his keen eyes Ah mister Arthur he said without any emotion you are come at last Step in mister Arthur stepped in and shut the door Your figure is filled out and set said the old man turning to look at him with the light raised again and shaking his head but you don t come up to your father in my opinion Nor yet your mother How is my mother She is as she always is now Keeps her room when not actually bedridden and hasn t been out of it fifteen times in as many years Arthur They had walked into a spare meagre dining room The old man had put the candlestick upon the table and supporting his right elbow with his left hand was smoothing his leathern jaws while he looked at the visitor The visitor offered his hand The old man took it coldly enough and seemed to prefer his jaws to which he returned as soon as he could I doubt if your mother will approve of your coming home on the Sabbath Arthur he said shaking his head warily You wouldn t have me go away again Oh I I I am not the master It s not what I would have I have stood between your father and mother for a number of years I don t pretend to stand between your mother and you Will you tell her that I have come home Yes Arthur yes Oh to be sure I ll tell her that you have come home Please to wait here You won t find the room changed He took another candle from a cupboard lighted it left the first on the table and went upon his errand He was a short bald old man in a high shouldered black coat and waistcoat drab breeches and long drab gaiters He might from his dress have been either clerk or servant and in fact had long been both There was nothing about him in the way of decoration but a watch which was lowered into the depths of its proper pocket by an old black ribbon and had a tarnished copper key moored above it to show where it was sunk His head was awry and he had a one sided crab like way with him as if his foundations had yielded at about the same time as those of the house and he ought to have been propped up in a similar manner How weak am I said Arthur Clennam when he was gone that I could shed tears at this reception I who have never experienced anything else who have never expected anything else He not only could but did It was the momentary yielding of a nature that had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions but had not quite given up all its hopeful yearnings yet He subdued it took up the candle and examined the room The old articles of furniture were in their old places the Plagues of Egypt much the dimmer for the fly and smoke plagues of London were framed and glazed upon the walls There was the old cellaret with nothing in it lined with lead like a sort of coffin in compartments there was the old dark closet also with nothing in it of which he had been many a time the sole contents in days of punishment when he had regarded it as the veritable entrance to that bourne to which the tract had found him galloping There was the large hard featured clock on the sideboard which he used to see bending its figured brows upon him with a savage joy when he was behind hand with his lessons and which when it was wound up once a week with an iron handle used to sound as if it were growling in ferocious anticipation of the miseries into which it would bring him But here was the old man come back saying Arthur I ll go before and light you Arthur followed him up the staircase which was panelled off into spaces like so many mourning tablets into a dim bed chamber the floor of which had gradually so sunk and settled that the fire place was in a dell On a black bier like sofa in this hollow propped up behind with one great angular black bolster like the block at a state execution in the good old times sat his mother in a widow s dress She and his father had been at variance from his earliest remembrance To sit speechless himself in the midst of rigid silence glancing in dread from the one averted face to the other had been the peacefullest occupation of his childhood She gave him one glassy kiss and four stiff fingers muffled in worsted This embrace concluded he sat down on the opposite side of her little table There was a fire in the grate as there had been night and day for fifteen years There was a kettle on the hob as there had been night and day for fifteen years There was a little mound of damped ashes on the top of the fire and another little mound swept together under the grate as there had been night and day for fifteen years There was a smell of black dye in the airless room which the fire had been drawing out of the crape and stuff of the widow s dress for fifteen months and out of the bier like sofa for fifteen years Mother this is a change from your old active habits The world has narrowed to these dimensions Arthur she rep lied glancing round the room It is well for me that I never set my heart upon its hollow vanities The old influence of her presence and her stern strong voice so gathered about her son that he felt conscious of a renewal of the timid chill and reserve of his childhood Do you never leave your room mother What with my rheumatic affection and what with its attendant debility or nervous weakness names are of no matter now I have lost the use of my limbs I never leave my room I have not been outside this door for tell him for how long she said speaking over her shoulder A dozen year next Christmas returned a cracked voice out of the dimness behind Is that Affery said Arthur looking towards it The cracked voice replied that it was Affery and an old woman came forward into what doubtful light there was and kissed her hand once then subsided again into the dimness I am able said missus Clennam with a slight motion of her worsted muffled right hand toward a chair on wheels standing before a tall writing cabinet close shut up I am able to attend to my business duties and I am thankful for the privilege It is a great privilege But no more of business on this day It is a bad night is it not Yes mother Does it snow Snow mother And we only yet in September All seasons are alike to me she returned with a grim kind of luxuriousness I know nothing of summer and winter shut up here The Lord has been pleased to put me beyond all that With her cold grey eyes and her cold grey hair and her immovable face as stiff as the folds of her stony head dress her being beyond the reach of the seasons seemed but a fit sequence to her being beyond the reach of all changing emotions On her little table lay two or three books her handkerchief a pair of steel spectacles newly taken off and an old fashioned gold watch in a heavy double case Upon this last object her son s eyes and her own now rested together I see that you received the packet I sent you on my father s death safely mother You see I never knew my father to show so much anxiety on any subject as that his watch should be sent straight to you I keep it here as a remembrance of your father It was not until the last that he expressed the wish when he could only put his hand upon it and very indistinctly say to me your mother A moment before I thought him wandering in his mind as he had been for many hours I think he had no consciousness of pain in his short illness when I saw him turn himself in his bed and try to open it Was your father then not wandering in his mind when he tried to open it No He was quite sensible at that time missus Clennam shook her head whether in dismissal of the deceased or opposing herself to her son s opinion was not clearly expressed After my father s death I opened it myself thinking there might be for anything I knew some memorandum there However as I need not tell you mother there was nothing but the old silk watch paper worked in beads which you found no doubt in its place between the cases where I found and left it missus Clennam signified assent then added No more of business on this day and then added Affery it is nine o clock Upon this the old woman cleared the little table went out of the room and quickly returned with a tray on which was a dish of little rusks and a small precise pat of butter cool symmetrical white and plump The old man who had been standing by the door in one attitude during the whole interview looking at the mother up stairs as he had looked at the son down stairs went out at the same time and after a longer absence returned with another tray on which was the greater part of a bottle of port wine which to judge by his panting he had brought from the cellar a lemon a sugar basin and a spice box With these materials and the aid of the kettle he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician s prescription Into this mixture missus Clennam dipped certain of the rusks and ate them while the old woman buttered certain other of the rusks which were to be eaten alone When the invalid had eaten all the rusks and drunk all the mixture the two trays were removed and the books and the candle watch handkerchief and spectacles were replaced upon the table She then put on the spectacles and read certain passages aloud from a book sternly fiercely wrathfully praying that her enemies she made them by her tone and manner expressly hers might be put to the edge of the sword consumed by fire smitten by plagues and leprosy that their bones might be ground to dust and that they might be utterly exterminated As she read on years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him She shut the book and remained for a little time with her face shaded by her hand So did the old man otherwise still unchanged in attitude so probably did the old woman in her dimmer part of the room Then the sick woman was ready for bed Good night Arthur Affery will see to your accommodation Only touch me for my hand is tender He touched the worsted muffling of her hand that was nothing if his mother had been sheathed in brass there would have been no new barrier between them and followed the old man and woman down stairs The latter asked him when they were alone together among the heavy shadows of the dining room would he have some supper No Affery no supper You shall if you like said Affery There s her tomorrow s partridge in the larder her first this year say the word and I ll cook it No he had not long dined and could eat nothing Have something to drink then said Affery you shall have some of her bottle of port if you like I ll tell Jeremiah that you ordered me to bring it you No nor would he have that either It s no reason Arthur said the old woman bending over him to whisper that because I am afeared of my life of em you should be You ve got half the property haven t you Yes yes Well then don t you be cowed You re clever Arthur an t you He nodded as she seemed to expect an answer in the affirmative Then stand up against them She s awful clever and none but a clever one durst say a word to her HE S a clever one oh he s a clever one and he gives it her when he has a mind to t he does Your husband does Does It makes me shake from head to foot to hear him give it her My husband Jeremiah Flintwinch can conquer even your mother What can he be but a clever one to do that His shuffling footstep coming towards them caused her to retreat to the other end of the room Though a tall hard favoured sinewy old woman who in her youth might have enlisted in the Foot Guards without much fear of discovery she collapsed before the little keen eyed crab like old man Now Affery said he now woman what are you doing Can t you find Master Arthur something or another to pick at Master Arthur repeated his recent refusal to pick at anything Very well then said the old man make his bed Stir yourself His neck was so twisted that the knotted ends of his white cravat usually dangled under one ear his natural acerbity and energy always contending with a second nature of habitual repression gave his features a swollen and suffused look and altogether he had a weird appearance of having hanged himself at one time or other and of having gone about ever since halter and all exactly as some timely hand had cut him down You ll have bitter words together to morrow Arthur you and your mother said Jeremiah Your having given up the business on your father s death which she suspects though we have left it to you to tell her won t go off smoothly I have given up everything in life for the business and the time came for me to give up that Good cried Jeremiah evidently meaning Bad Very good only don t expect me to stand between your mother and you Arthur I stood between your mother and your father fending off this and fending off that and getting crushed and pounded betwixt em and I ve done with such work You will never be asked to begin it again for me Jeremiah Good I m glad to hear it because I should have had to decline it if I had been That s enough as your mother says and more than enough of such matters on a Sabbath night Affery woman have you found what you want yet She had been collecting sheets and blankets from a press and hastened to gather them up and to reply Yes Jeremiah Arthur Clennam helped her by carrying the load himself wished the old man good night and went up stairs with her to the top of the house They mounted up and up through the musty smell of an old close house little used to a large garret bed room Meagre and spare like all the other rooms it was even uglier and grimmer than the rest by being the place of banishment for the worn out furniture Its movables were ugly old chairs with worn out seats and ugly old chairs without any seats a threadbare patternless carpet a maimed table a crippled wardrobe a lean set of fire irons like the skeleton of a set deceased a washing stand that looked as if it had stood for ages in a hail of dirty soapsuds and a bedstead with four bare atomies of posts each terminating in a spike as if for the dismal accommodation of lodgers who might prefer to impale themselves Arthur opened the long low window and looked out upon the old blasted and blackened forest of chimneys and the old red glare in the sky which had seemed to him once upon a time but a nightly reflection of the fiery environment that was presented to his childish fancy in all directions let it look where it would He drew in his head again sat down at the bedside and looked on at Affery Flintwinch making the bed Affery you were not married when I went away She screwed her mouth into the form of saying No shook her head and proceeded to get a pillow into its case How did it happen Why Jeremiah o course said Affery with an end of the pillow case between her teeth Of course he proposed it but how did it all come about I should have thought that neither of you would have married least of all should I have thought of your marrying each other No more should I said missus Flintwinch tying the pillow tightly in its case That s what I mean When did you begin to think otherwise Never begun to think otherwise at all said missus Flintwinch Seeing as she patted the pillow into its place on the bolster that he was still looking at her as if waiting for the rest of her reply she gave it a great poke in the middle and asked How could I help myself How could you help yourself from being married O course said missus Flintwinch It was no doing o mine I D never thought of it I d got something to do without thinking indeed She kept me to it as well as he when she could go about and she could go about then Well Well echoed missus Flintwinch That s what I said myself Well What s the use of considering If them two clever ones have made up their minds to it what s left for me to do Nothing Was it my mother s project then The Lord bless you Arthur and forgive me the wish cried Affery speaking always in a low tone If they hadn t been both of a mind in it how could it ever have been Jeremiah never courted me t ant likely that he would after living in the house with me and ordering me about for as many years as he d done He said to me one day he said Affery he said now I am going to tell you something What do you think of the name of Flintwinch What do I think of it I says Yes he said because you re going to take it he said Take it I says Jere MI ah Oh he s a clever one missus Flintwinch went on to spread the upper sheet over the bed and the blanket over that and the counterpane over that as if she had quite concluded her story Well said Arthur again Well echoed missus Flintwinch again How could I help myself He said to me Affery you and me must be married and I ll tell you why She s failing in health and she ll want pretty constant attendance up in her room and we shall have to be much with her and there ll be nobody about now but ourselves when we re away from her and altogether it will be more convenient She s of my opinion he said so if you ll put your bonnet on next Monday morning at eight we ll get it over missus Flintwinch tucked up the bed Well Well repeated missus Flintwinch I think so I sits me down and says it Well Jeremiah then says to me As to banns next Sunday being the third time of asking for I ve put em up a fortnight is my reason for naming Monday She ll speak to you about it herself and now she ll find you prepared Affery That same day she spoke to me and she said So Affery I understand that you and Jeremiah are going to be married I am glad of it and so are you with reason It is a very good thing for you and very welcome under the circumstances to me He is a sensible man and a trustworthy man and a persevering man and a pious man What could I say when it had come to that Why if it had been a smothering instead of a wedding missus Flintwinch cast about in her mind with great pains for this form of expression I couldn t have said a word upon it against them two clever ones In good faith I believe so And so you may Arthur Affery what girl was that in my mother s room just now Girl said missus Flintwinch in a rather sharp key It was a girl surely whom I saw near you almost hidden in the dark corner Oh She Little Dorrit She s nothing she s a whim of hers It was a peculiarity of Affery Flintwinch that she never spoke of missus Clennam by name But there s another sort of girls than that about Have you forgot your old sweetheart Long and long ago I ll be bound I suffered enough from my mother s separating us to remember her I recollect her very well Have you got another No Here s news for you then She s well to do now and a widow And if you like to have her why you can And how do you know that Affery Them two clever ones have been speaking about it There s Jeremiah on the stairs She was gone in a moment missus Flintwinch had introduced into the web that his mind was busily weaving in that old workshop where the loom of his youth had stood the last thread wanting to the pattern The airy folly of a boy s love had found its way even into that house and he had been as wretched under its hopelessness as if the house had been a castle of romance Little more than a week ago at Marseilles the face of the pretty girl from whom he had parted with regret had had an unusual interest for him and a tender hold upon him because of some resemblance real or imagined to this first face that had soared out of his gloomy life into the bright glories of fancy He leaned upon the sill of the long low window and looking out upon the blackened forest of chimneys again began to dream for it had been the uniform tendency of this man s life so much was wanting in it to think about so much that might have been better directed and happier to speculate upon to make him a dreamer after all CHAPTER four missus Flintwinch has a Dream When missus Flintwinch dreamed she usually dreamed unlike the son of her old mistress with her eyes shut She had a curiously vivid dream that night and before she had left the son of her old mistress many hours In fact it was not at all like a dream it was so very real in every respect It happened in this wise The bed chamber occupied by mister and missus Flintwinch was within a few paces of that to which missus Clennam had been so long confined It was not on the same floor for it was a room at the side of the house which was approached by a steep descent of a few odd steps diverging from the main staircase nearly opposite to missus Clennam s door It could scarcely be said to be within call the walls doors and panelling of the old place were so cumbrous but it was within easy reach in any undress at any hour of the night in any temperature At the head of the bed and within a foot of missus Flintwinch s ear was a bell the line of which hung ready to missus Clennam s hand Whenever this bell rang up started Affery and was in the sick room before she was awake Having got her mistress into bed lighted her lamp and given her good night missus Flintwinch went to roost as usual saving that her lord had not yet appeared It was her lord himself who became unlike the last theme in the mind according to the observation of most philosophers the subject of missus Flintwinch s dream It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours and found Jeremiah not yet abed That she looked at the candle she had left burning and measuring the time like King Alfred the Great was confirmed by its wasted state in her belief that she had been asleep for some considerable period That she arose thereupon muffled herself up in a wrapper put on her shoes and went out on the staircase much surprised to look for Jeremiah The staircase was as wooden and solid as need be and Affery went straight down it without any of those deviations peculiar to dreams She did not skim over it but walked down it and guided herself by the banisters on account of her candle having died out In one corner of the hall behind the house door there was a little waiting room like a well shaft with a long narrow window in it as if it had been ripped up In this room which was never used a light was burning missus Flintwinch crossed the hall feeling its pavement cold to her stockingless feet and peeped in between the rusty hinges on the door which stood a little open She expected to see Jeremiah fast asleep or in a fit but he was calmly seated in a chair awake and in his usual health But what hey Lord forgive us missus Flintwinch muttered some ejaculation to this effect and turned giddy For mister Flintwinch awake was watching mister Flintwinch asleep He sat on one side of the small table looking keenly at himself on the other side with his chin sunk on his breast snoring The waking Flintwinch had his full front face presented to his wife the sleeping Flintwinch was in profile The waking Flintwinch was the old original the sleeping Flintwinch was the double just as she might have distinguished between a tangible object and its reflection in a glass Affery made out this difference with her head going round and round If she had had any doubt which was her own Jeremiah it would have been resolved by his impatience He looked about him for an offensive weapon caught up the snuffers and before applying them to the cabbage headed candle lunged at the sleeper as though he would have run him through the body Who s that What s the matter cried the sleeper starting mister Flintwinch made a movement with the snuffers as if he would have enforced silence on his companion by putting them down his throat the companion coming to himself said rubbing his eyes I forgot where I was You have been asleep snarled Jeremiah referring to his watch two hours You said you would be rested enough if you had a short nap I have had a short nap said Double Half past two o clock in the morning muttered Jeremiah Where s your hat Where s your coat Where s the box All here said Double tying up his throat with sleepy carefulness in a shawl Stop a minute Now give me the sleeve not that sleeve the other one Ha I m not as young as I was mister Flintwinch had pulled him into his coat with vehement energy You promised me a second glass after I was rested Drink it returned Jeremiah and choke yourself I was going to say but go I mean At the same time he produced the identical port wine bottle and filled a wine glass Her port wine I believe said Double tasting it as if he were in the Docks with hours to spare Her health He took a sip Your health He took another sip His health He took another sip And all friends round saint Paul s He emptied and put down the wine glass half way through this ancient civic toast and took up the box It was an iron box some two feet square which he carried under his arms pretty easily Jeremiah watched his manner of adjusting it with jealous eyes tried it with his hands to be sure that he had a firm hold of it bade him for his life be careful what he was about and then stole out on tiptoe to open the door for him Affery anticipating the last movement was on the staircase The sequence of things was so ordinary and natural that standing there she could hear the door open feel the night air and see the stars outside But now came the most remarkable part of the dream She felt so afraid of her husband that being on the staircase she had not the power to retreat to her room which she might easily have done before he had fastened the door but stood there staring Consequently when he came up the staircase to bed candle in hand he came full upon her He looked astonished but said not a word He kept his eyes upon her and kept advancing and she completely under his influence kept retiring before him Thus she walking backward and he walking forward they came into their own room They were no sooner shut in there than mister Flintwinch took her by the throat and shook her until she was black in the face Why Affery woman Affery said mister Flintwinch What have you been dreaming of Wake up wake up What s the matter The the matter Jeremiah gasped missus Flintwinch rolling her eyes Why Affery woman Affery You have been getting out of bed in your sleep my dear I come up after having fallen asleep myself below and find you in your wrapper here with the nightmare Affery woman said mister Flintwinch with a friendly grin on his expressive countenance if you ever have a dream of this sort again it ll be a sign of your being in want of physic And I ll give you such a dose old woman such a dose missus Flintwinch thanked him and crept into bed CHAPTER five Family Affairs As the city clocks struck nine on Monday morning missus Clennam was wheeled by Jeremiah Flintwinch of the cut down aspect to her tall cabinet When she had unlocked and opened it and had settled herself at its desk Jeremiah withdrew as it might be to hang himself more effectually and her son appeared Are you any better this morning mother She shook her head with the same austere air of luxuriousness that she had shown over night when speaking of the weather I shall never be better any more It is well for me Arthur that I know it and can bear it Sitting with her hands laid separately upon the desk and the tall cabinet towering before her she looked as if she were performing on a dumb church organ Her son thought so it was an old thought with him while he took his seat beside it She opened a drawer or two looked over some business papers and put them back again Her severe face had no thread of relaxation in it by which any explorer could have been guided to the gloomy labyrinth of her thoughts Shall I speak of our affairs mother Are you inclined to enter upon business Am I inclined Arthur Rather are you Your father has been dead a year and more I have been at your disposal and waiting your pleasure ever since There was much to arrange before I could leave and when I did leave I travelled a little for rest and relief She turned her face towards him as not having heard or understood his last words For rest and relief She glanced round the sombre room and appeared from the motion of her lips to repeat the words to herself as calling it to witness how little of either it afforded her Besides mother you being sole executrix and having the direction and management of the estate there remained little business or I might say none that I could transact until you had had time to arrange matters to your satisfaction The accounts are made out she returned I have them here The vouchers have all been examined and passed You can inspect them when you like Arthur now if you please It is quite enough mother to know that the business is completed Shall I proceed then Why not she said in her frozen way Mother our House has done less and less for some years past and our dealings have been progressively on the decline We have never shown much confidence or invited much we have attached no people to us the track we have kept is not the track of the time and we have been left far behind I need not dwell on this to you mother You know it necessarily I know what you mean she answered in a qualified tone Even this old house in which we speak pursued her son is an instance of what I say In my father s earlier time and in his uncle s time before him it was a place of business really a place of business and business resort Now it is a mere anomaly and incongruity here out of date and out of purpose All our consignments have long been made to Rovinghams the commission merchants and although as a check upon them and in the stewardship of my father s resources your judgment and watchfulness have been actively exerted still those qualities would have influenced my father s fortunes equally if you had lived in any private dwelling would they not Do you consider she returned without answering his question that a house serves no purpose Arthur in sheltering your infirm and afflicted justly infirm and righteously afflicted mother I was speaking only of business purposes With what object I am coming to it I foresee she returned fixing her eyes upon him what it is But the Lord forbid that I should repine under any visitation In my sinfulness I merit bitter disappointment and I accept it Mother I grieve to hear you speak like this though I have had my apprehensions that you would You knew I would You knew ME she interrupted Her son paused for a moment He had struck fire out of her and was surprised Well she said relapsing into stone Go on Let me hear You have anticipated mother that I decide for my part to abandon the business I have done with it I will not take upon myself to advise you you will continue it I see If I had any influence with you I would simply use it to soften your judgment of me in causing you this disappointment to represent to you that I have lived the half of a long term of life and have never before set my own will against yours I cannot say that I have been able to conform myself in heart and spirit to your rules I cannot say that I believe my forty years have been profitable or pleasant to myself or any one but I have habitually submitted and I only ask you to remember it Woe to the suppliant if such a one there were or ever had been who had any concession to look for in the inexorable face at the cabinet Woe to the defaulter whose appeal lay to the tribunal where those severe eyes presided Great need had the rigid woman of her mystical religion veiled in gloom and darkness with lightnings of cursing vengeance and destruction flashing through the sable clouds Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors was a prayer too poor in spirit for her Smite Thou my debtors Lord wither them crush them do Thou as I would do and Thou shalt have my worship this was the impious tower of stone she built up to scale Heaven Have you finished Arthur or have you anything more to say to me I think there can be nothing else You have been short but full of matter Mother I have yet something more to say It has been upon my mind night and day this long time It is far more difficult to say than what I have said That concerned myself this concerns us all Us all Who are us all Yourself myself my dead father She took her hands from the desk folded them in her lap and sat looking towards the fire with the impenetrability of an old Egyptian sculpture You knew my father infinitely better than I ever knew him and his reserve with me yielded to you You were much the stronger mother and directed him As a child I knew it as well as I know it now I knew that your ascendancy over him was the cause of his going to China to take care of the business there while you took care of it here though I do not even now know whether these were really terms of separation that you agreed upon and that it was your will that I should remain with you until I was twenty and then go to him as I did You will not be offended by my recalling this after twenty years I am waiting to hear why you recall it He lowered his voice and said with manifest reluctance and against his will I want to ask you mother whether it ever occurred to you to suspect At the word Suspect she turned her eyes momentarily upon her son with a dark frown She then suffered them to seek the fire as before but with the frown fixed above them as if the sculptor of old Egypt had indented it in the hard granite face to frown for ages that he had any secret remembrance which caused him trouble of mind remorse Whether you ever observed anything in his conduct suggesting that or ever spoke to him upon it or ever heard him hint at such a thing I do not understand what kind of secret remembrance you mean to infer that your father was a prey to she returned after a silence You speak so mysteriously Is it possible mother her son leaned forward to be the nearer to her while he whispered it and laid his hand nervously upon her desk is it possible mother that he had unhappily wronged any one and made no reparation Looking at him wrathfully she bent herself back in her chair to keep him further off but gave him no reply I am deeply sensible mother that if this thought has never at any time flashed upon you it must seem cruel and unnatural in me even in this confidence to breathe it But I cannot shake it off Time and change I have tried both before breaking silence do nothing to wear it out Remember I was with my father Remember I saw his face when he gave the watch into my keeping and struggled to express that he sent it as a token you would understand to you Remember I saw him at the last with the pencil in his failing hand trying to write some word for you to read but to which he could give no shape The more remote and cruel this vague suspicion that I have the stronger the circumstances that could give it any semblance of probability to me For Heaven s sake let us examine sacredly whether there is any wrong entrusted to us to set right No one can help towards it mother but you Still so recoiling in her chair that her overpoised weight moved it from time to time a little on its wheels and gave her the appearance of a phantom of fierce aspect gliding away from him she interposed her left arm bent at the elbow with the back of her hand towards her face between herself and him and looked at him in a fixed silence In grasping at money and in driving hard bargains I have begun and I must speak of such things now mother some one may have been grievously deceived injured ruined You were the moving power of all this machinery before my birth your stronger spirit has been infused into all my father s dealings for more than two score years You can set these doubts at rest I think if you will really help me to discover the truth Will you mother He stopped in the hope that she would speak But her grey hair was not more immovable in its two folds than were her firm lips If reparation can be made to any one if restitution can be made to any one let us know it and make it Nay mother if within my means let ME make it I have seen so little happiness come of money it has brought within my knowledge so little peace to this house or to any one belonging to it that it is worth less to me than to another It can buy me nothing that will not be a reproach and misery to me if I am haunted by a suspicion that it darkened my father s last hours with remorse and that it is not honestly and justly mine There was a bell rope hanging on the panelled wall some two or three yards from the cabinet By a swift and sudden action of her foot she drove her wheeled chair rapidly back to it and pulled it violently still holding her arm up in its shield like posture as if he were striking at her and she warding off the blow A girl came hurrying in frightened Send Flintwinch here In a moment the girl had withdrawn and the old man stood within the door What You re hammer and tongs already you two he said coolly stroking his face I thought you would be I was pretty sure of it Flintwinch said the mother look at my son Look at him Well I AM looking at him said Flintwinch She stretched out the arm with which she had shielded herself and as she went on pointed at the object of her anger In the very hour of his return almost before the shoe upon his foot is dry he asperses his father s memory to his mother Asks his mother to become with him a spy upon his father s transactions through a lifetime Has misgivings that the goods of this world which we have painfully got together early and late with wear and tear and toil and self denial are so much plunder and asks to whom they shall be given up as reparation and restitution Although she said this raging she said it in a voice so far from being beyond her control that it was even lower than her usual tone She also spoke with great distinctness Reparation said she Yes truly It is easy for him to talk of reparation fresh from journeying and junketing in foreign lands and living a life of vanity and pleasure But let him look at me in prison and in bonds here I endure without murmuring because it is appointed that I shall so make reparation for my sins Reparation Is there none in this room Has there been none here this fifteen years Thus was she always balancing her bargains with the Majesty of heaven posting up the entries to her credit strictly keeping her set off and claiming her due She was only remarkable in this for the force and emphasis with which she did it Thousands upon thousands do it according to their varying manner every day Flintwinch give me that book The old man handed it to her from the table She put two fingers between the leaves closed the book upon them and held it up to her son in a threatening way In the days of old Arthur treated of in this commentary there were pious men beloved of the Lord who would have cursed their sons for less than this who would have sent them forth and sent whole nations forth if such had supported them to be avoided of God and man and perish down to the baby at the breast But I only tell you that if you ever renew that theme with me I will renounce you I will so dismiss you through that doorway that you had better have been motherless from your cradle I will never see or know you more And if after all you were to come into this darkened room to look upon me lying dead my body should bleed if I could make it when you came near me In part relieved by the intensity of this threat and in part monstrous as the fact is by a general impression that it was in some sort a religious proceeding she handed back the book to the old man and was silent Now said Jeremiah premising that I m not going to stand between you two will you let me ask as I have been called in and made a third what is all this about Take your version of it returned Arthur finding it left to him to speak from my mother Let it rest there What I have said was said to my mother only Oh returned the old man From your mother Take it from your mother Well But your mother mentioned that you had been suspecting your father That s not dutiful mister Arthur Who will you be suspecting next Enough said missus Clennam turning her face so that it was addressed for the moment to the old man only Let no more be said about this Yes but stop a bit stop a bit the old man persisted Let us see how we stand Have you told mister Arthur that he mustn t lay offences at his father s door That he has no right to do it That he has no ground to go upon I tell him so now Ah Exactly said the old man You tell him so now You hadn t told him so before and you tell him so now Ay ay That s right You know I stood between you and his father so long that it seems as if death had made no difference and I was still standing between you So I will and so in fairness I require to have that plainly put forward Arthur you please to hear that you have no right to mistrust your father and have no ground to go upon He put his hands to the back of the wheeled chair and muttering to himself slowly wheeled his mistress back to her cabinet Now he resumed standing behind her in case I should go away leaving things half done and so should be wanted again when you come to the other half and get into one of your flights has Arthur told you what he means to do about the business He has relinquished it In favour of nobody I suppose missus Clennam glanced at her son leaning against one of the windows He observed the look and said To my mother of course She does what she pleases And if any pleasure she said after a short pause could arise for me out of the disappointment of my expectations that my son in the prime of his life would infuse new youth and strength into it and make it of great profit and power it would be in advancing an old and faithful servant Jeremiah the captain deserts the ship but you and I will sink or float with it Jeremiah whose eyes glistened as if they saw money darted a sudden look at the son which seemed to say I owe YOU no thanks for this YOU have done nothing towards it and then told the mother that he thanked her and that Affery thanked her and that he would never desert her and that Affery would never desert her Finally he hauled up his watch from its depths and said Eleven Time for your oysters and with that change of subject which involved no change of expression or manner rang the bell But missus Clennam resolved to treat herself with the greater rigour for having been supposed to be unacquainted with reparation refused to eat her oysters when they were brought They looked tempting eight in number circularly set out on a white plate on a tray covered with a white napkin flanked by a slice of buttered French roll and a little compact glass of cool wine and water but she resisted all persuasions and sent them down again placing the act to her credit no doubt in her Eternal Day Book This refection of oysters was not presided over by Affery but by the girl who had appeared when the bell was rung the same who had been in the dimly lighted room last night Now that he had an opportunity of observing her Arthur found that her diminutive figure small features and slight spare dress gave her the appearance of being much younger than she was A woman probably of not less than two and twenty she might have been passed in the street for little more than half that age Not that her face was very youthful for in truth there was more consideration and care in it than naturally belonged to her utmost years but she was so little and light so noiseless and shy and appeared so conscious of being out of place among the three hard elders that she had all the manner and much of the appearance of a subdued child In a hard way and in an uncertain way that fluctuated between patronage and putting down the sprinkling from a watering pot and hydraulic pressure missus Clennam showed an interest in this dependent Even in the moment of her entrance upon the violent ringing of the bell when the mother shielded herself with that singular action from the son missus Clennam s eyes had had some individual recognition in them which seemed reserved for her As there are degrees of hardness in the hardest metal and shades of colour in black itself so even in the asperity of missus Clennam s demeanour towards all the rest of humanity and towards Little Dorrit there was a fine gradation Little Dorrit let herself out to do needlework At so much a day or at so little from eight to eight Little Dorrit was to be hired Punctual to the moment Little Dorrit appeared punctual to the moment Little Dorrit vanished What became of Little Dorrit between the two eights was a mystery Another of the moral phenomena of Little Dorrit Besides her consideration money her daily contract included meals She had an extraordinary repugnance to dining in company would never do so if it were possible to escape Would always plead that she had this bit of work to begin first or that bit of work to finish first and would of a certainty scheme and plan not very cunningly it would seem for she deceived no one to dine alone Successful in this happy in carrying off her plate anywhere to make a table of her lap or a box or the ground or even as was supposed to stand on tip toe dining moderately at a mantel shelf the great anxiety of Little Dorrit s day was set at rest It was not easy to make out Little Dorrit s face she was so retiring plied her needle in such removed corners and started away so scared if encountered on the stairs But it seemed to be a pale transparent face quick in expression though not beautiful in feature its soft hazel eyes excepted A delicately bent head a tiny form a quick little pair of busy hands and a shabby dress it must needs have been very shabby to look at all so being so neat were Little Dorrit as she sat at work For these particulars or generalities concerning Little Dorrit mister Arthur was indebted in the course of the day to his own eyes and to missus Affery s tongue If missus Affery had had any will or way of her own it would probably have been unfavourable to Little Dorrit But as them two clever ones missus Affery s perpetual reference in whom her personality was swallowed up were agreed to accept Little Dorrit as a matter of course she had nothing for it but to follow suit Similarly if the two clever ones had agreed to murder Little Dorrit by candlelight missus Affery being required to hold the candle would no doubt have done it In the intervals of roasting the partridge for the invalid chamber and preparing a baking dish of beef and pudding for the dining room missus Affery made the communications above set forth invariably putting her head in at the door again after she had taken it out to enforce resistance to the two clever ones It appeared to have become a perfect passion with missus Flintwinch that the only son should be pitted against them In the course of the day too Arthur looked through the whole house Dull and dark he found it The gaunt rooms deserted for years upon years seemed to have settled down into a gloomy lethargy from which nothing could rouse them again The furniture at once spare and lumbering hid in the rooms rather than furnished them and there was no colour in all the house such colour as had ever been there had long ago started away on lost sunbeams got itself absorbed perhaps into flowers butterflies plumage of birds precious stones what not There was not one straight floor from the foundation to the roof the ceilings were so fantastically clouded by smoke and dust that old women might have told fortunes in them better than in grouts of tea the dead cold hearths showed no traces of having ever been warmed but in heaps of soot that had tumbled down the chimneys and eddied about in little dusky whirlwinds when the doors were opened In what had once been a drawing room there were a pair of meagre mirrors with dismal processions of black figures carrying black garlands walking round the frames but even these were short of heads and legs and one undertaker like Cupid had swung round on its own axis and got upside down and another had fallen off altogether The room Arthur Clennam s deceased father had occupied for business purposes when he first remembered him was so unaltered that he might have been imagined still to keep it invisibly as his visible relict kept her room up stairs Jeremiah Flintwinch still going between them negotiating His picture dark and gloomy earnestly speechless on the wall with the eyes intently looking at his son as they had looked when life departed from them seemed to urge him awfully to the task he had attempted but as to any yielding on the part of his mother he had now no hope and as to any other means of setting his distrust at rest he had abandoned hope a long time Down in the cellars as up in the bed chambers old objects that he well remembered were changed by age and decay but were still in their old places even to empty beer casks hoary with cobwebs and empty wine bottles with fur and fungus choking up their throats There too among unusual bottle racks and pale slants of light from the yard above was the strong room stored with old ledgers which had as musty and corrupt a smell as if they were regularly balanced in the dead small hours by a nightly resurrection of old book keepers The baking dish was served up in a penitential manner on a shrunken cloth at an end of the dining table at two o clock when he dined with mister Flintwinch the new partner mister Flintwinch informed him that his mother had recovered her equanimity now and that he need not fear her again alluding to what had passed in the morning And don t you lay offences at your father s door mister Arthur added Jeremiah once for all don t do it Now we have done with the subject mister Flintwinch had been already rearranging and dusting his own particular little office as if to do honour to his accession to new dignity He resumed this occupation when he was replete with beef had sucked up all the gravy in the baking dish with the flat of his knife and had drawn liberally on a barrel of small beer in the scullery Thus refreshed he tucked up his shirt sleeves and went to work again and mister Arthur watching him as he set about it plainly saw that his father s picture or his father s grave would be as communicative with him as this old man Now Affery woman said mister Flintwinch as she crossed the hall You hadn t made mister Arthur s bed when I was up there last Stir yourself Bustle But mister Arthur found the house so blank and dreary and was so unwilling to assist at another implacable consignment of his mother s enemies perhaps himself among them to mortal disfigurement and immortal ruin that he announced his intention of lodging at the coffee house where he had left his luggage mister Flintwinch taking kindly to the idea of getting rid of him and his mother being indifferent beyond considerations of saving to most domestic arrangements that were not bounded by the walls of her own chamber he easily carried this point without new offence Daily business hours were agreed upon which his mother mister Flintwinch and he were to devote together to a necessary checking of books and papers and he left the home he had so lately found with depressed heart But Little Dorrit The business hours allowing for intervals of invalid regimen of oysters and partridges during which Clennam refreshed himself with a walk were from ten to six for about a fortnight Sometimes Little Dorrit was employed at her needle sometimes not sometimes appeared as a humble visitor which must have been her character on the occasion of his arrival His original curiosity augmented every day as he watched for her saw or did not see her and speculated about her Influenced by his predominant idea he even fell into a habit of discussing with himself the possibility of her being in some way associated with it At last he resolved to watch Little Dorrit and know more of her story CHAPTER six The Father of the Marshalsea Thirty years ago there stood a few doors short of the church of Saint George in the borough of Southwark on the left hand side of the way going southward the Marshalsea Prison It had stood there many years before and it remained there some years afterwards but it is gone now and the world is none the worse without it It was an oblong pile of barrack building partitioned into squalid houses standing back to back so that there were no back rooms environed by a narrow paved yard hemmed in by high walls duly spiked at top Itself a close and confined prison for debtors it contained within it a much closer and more confined jail for smugglers Offenders against the revenue laws and defaulters to excise or customs who had incurred fines which they were unable to pay were supposed to be incarcerated behind an iron plated door closing up a second prison consisting of a strong cell or two and a blind alley some yard and a half wide which formed the mysterious termination of the very limited skittle ground in which the Marshalsea debtors bowled down their troubles Supposed to be incarcerated there because the time had rather outgrown the strong cells and the blind alley In practice they had come to be considered a little too bad though in theory they were quite as good as ever which may be observed to be the case at the present day with other cells that are not at all strong and with other blind alleys that are stone blind Hence the smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors who received them with open arms except at certain constitutional moments when somebody came from some Office to go through some form of overlooking something which neither he nor anybody else knew anything about On these truly British occasions the smugglers if any made a feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley while this somebody pretended to do his something and made a reality of walking out again as soon as he hadn t done it neatly epitomising the administration of most of the public affairs in our right little tight little island There had been taken to the Marshalsea Prison long before the day when the sun shone on Marseilles and on the opening of this narrative a debtor with whom this narrative has some concern He was at that time a very amiable and very helpless middle aged gentleman who was going out again directly Necessarily he was going out again directly because the Marshalsea lock never turned upon a debtor who was not He brought in a portmanteau with him which he doubted its being worth while to unpack he was so perfectly clear like all the rest of them the turnkey on the lock said that he was going out again directly He was a shy retiring man well looking though in an effeminate style with a mild voice curling hair and irresolute hands rings upon the fingers in those days which nervously wandered to his trembling lip a hundred times in the first half hour of his acquaintance with the jail His principal anxiety was about his wife Do you think sir he asked the turnkey that she will be very much shocked if she should come to the gate to morrow morning The turnkey gave it as the result of his experience that some of em was and some of em wasn t In general more no than yes What like is she you see he philosophically asked that s what it hinges on She is very delicate and inexperienced indeed That said the turnkey is agen her She is so little used to go out alone said the debtor that I am at a loss to think how she will ever make her way here if she walks P raps quoth the turnkey she ll take a ackney coach Perhaps The irresolute fingers went to the trembling lip I hope she will She may not think of it Or p raps said the turnkey offering his suggestions from the the top of his well worn wooden stool as he might have offered them to a child for whose weakness he felt a compassion p raps she ll get her brother or her sister to come along with her She has no brother or sister Niece nevy cousin serwant young ooman greengrocer Dash it One or another on em said the turnkey repudiating beforehand the refusal of all his suggestions I fear I hope it is not against the rules that she will bring the children The children said the turnkey And the rules Why lord set you up like a corner pin we ve a reg lar playground o children here Children Why we swarm with em How many a you got Two said the debtor lifting his irresolute hand to his lip again and turning into the prison The turnkey followed him with his eyes And you another he observed to himself which makes three on you And your wife another I ll lay a crown Which makes four on you And another coming I ll lay half a crown Which ll make five on you And I ll go another seven and sixpence to name which is the helplessest the unborn baby or you He was right in all his particulars She came next day with a little boy of three years old and a little girl of two and he stood entirely corroborated Got a room now haven t you the turnkey asked the debtor after a week or two Yes I have got a very good room Any little sticks a coming to furnish it said the turnkey I expect a few necessary articles of furniture to be delivered by the carrier this afternoon Missis and little uns a coming to keep you company asked the turnkey Why yes we think it better that we should not be scattered even for a few weeks Even for a few weeks OF course replied the turnkey And he followed him again with his eyes and nodded his head seven times when he was gone The affairs of this debtor were perplexed by a partnership of which he knew no more than that he had invested money in it by legal matters of assignment and settlement conveyance here and conveyance there suspicion of unlawful preference of creditors in this direction and of mysterious spiriting away of property in that and as nobody on the face of the earth could be more incapable of explaining any single item in the heap of confusion than the debtor himself nothing comprehensible could be made of his case To question him in detail and endeavour to reconcile his answers to closet him with accountants and sharp practitioners learned in the wiles of insolvency and bankruptcy was only to put the case out at compound interest and incomprehensibility The irresolute fingers fluttered more and more ineffectually about the trembling lip on every such occasion and the sharpest practitioners gave him up as a hopeless job Out said the turnkey he ll never get out unless his creditors take him by the shoulders and shove him out He had been there five or six months when he came running to this turnkey one forenoon to tell him breathless and pale that his wife was ill As anybody might a known she would be said the turnkey We intended he returned that she should go to a country lodging only to morrow What am I to do Oh good heaven what am I to do Don t waste your time in clasping your hands and biting your fingers responded the practical turnkey taking him by the elbow but come along with me The turnkey conducted him trembling from head to foot and constantly crying under his breath What was he to do while his irresolute fingers bedabbled the tears upon his face up one of the common staircases in the prison to a door on the garret story Upon which door the turnkey knocked with the handle of his key Come in cried a voice inside The turnkey opening the door disclosed in a wretched ill smelling little room two hoarse puffy red faced personages seated at a rickety table playing at all fours smoking pipes and drinking brandy Doctor said the turnkey here s a gentleman s wife in want of you without a minute s loss of time The doctor s friend was in the positive degree of hoarseness puffiness red facedness all fours tobacco dirt and brandy the doctor in the comparative hoarser puffier more red faced more all fourey tobaccoer dirtier and brandier The doctor was amazingly shabby in a torn and darned rough weather sea jacket out at elbows and eminently short of buttons he had been in his time the experienced surgeon carried by a passenger ship the dirtiest white trousers conceivable by mortal man carpet slippers and no visible linen Childbed said the doctor I m the boy With that the doctor took a comb from the chimney piece and stuck his hair upright which appeared to be his way of washing himself produced a professional chest or case of most abject appearance from the cupboard where his cup and saucer and coals were settled his chin in the frowsy wrapper round his neck and became a ghastly medical scarecrow The doctor and the debtor ran down stairs leaving the turnkey to return to the lock and made for the debtor s room All the ladies in the prison had got hold of the news and were in the yard Some of them had already taken possession of the two children and were hospitably carrying them off others were offering loans of little comforts from their own scanty store others were sympathising with the greatest volubility The gentlemen prisoners feeling themselves at a disadvantage had for the most part retired not to say sneaked to their rooms from the open windows of which some of them now complimented the doctor with whistles as he passed below while others with several stories between them interchanged sarcastic references to the prevalent excitement It was a hot summer day and the prison rooms were baking between the high walls In the debtor s confined chamber missus Bangham charwoman and messenger who was not a prisoner though she had been once but was the popular medium of communication with the outer world had volunteered her services as fly catcher and general attendant The walls and ceiling were blackened with flies missus Bangham expert in sudden device with one hand fanned the patient with a cabbage leaf and with the other set traps of vinegar and sugar in gallipots at the same time enunciating sentiments of an encouraging and congratulatory nature adapted to the occasion The flies trouble you don t they my dear said missus Bangham But p raps they ll take your mind off of it and do you good What between the buryin ground the grocer s the waggon stables and the paunch trade the Marshalsea flies gets very large P raps they re sent as a consolation if we only know d it How are you now my dear No better No my dear it ain t to be expected you ll be worse before you re better and you know it don t you Yes That s right And to think of a sweet little cherub being born inside the lock Now ain t it pretty ain t THAT something to carry you through it pleasant Why we ain t had such a thing happen here my dear not for I couldn t name the time when And you a crying too said missus Bangham to rally the patient more and more You Making yourself so famous With the flies a falling into the gallipots by fifties And everything a going on so well And here if there ain t said missus Bangham as the door opened if there ain t your dear gentleman along with doctor Haggage And now indeed we ARE complete I THINK The doctor was scarcely the kind of apparition to inspire a patient with a sense of absolute completeness but as he presently delivered the opinion We are as right as we can be missus Bangham and we shall come out of this like a house afire and as he and missus Bangham took possession of the poor helpless pair as everybody else and anybody else had always done the means at hand were as good on the whole as better would have been The special feature in doctor Haggage s treatment of the case was his determination to keep missus Bangham up to the mark As thus missus Bangham said the doctor before he had been there twenty minutes go outside and fetch a little brandy or we shall have you giving in Thank you sir But none on my accounts said missus Bangham missus Bangham returned the doctor I am in professional attendance on this lady and don t choose to allow any discussion on your part Go outside and fetch a little brandy or I foresee that you ll break down You re to be obeyed sir said missus Bangham rising If you was to put your own lips to it I think you wouldn t be the worse for you look but poorly sir missus Bangham returned the doctor I am not your business thank you but you are mine Never you mind ME if you please What you have got to do is to do as you are told and to go and get what I bid you missus Bangham submitted and the doctor having administered her potion took his own He repeated the treatment every hour being very determined with missus Bangham Three or four hours passed the flies fell into the traps by hundreds and at length one little life hardly stronger than theirs appeared among the multitude of lesser deaths A very nice little girl indeed said the doctor little but well formed Halloa missus Bangham You re looking queer You be off ma am this minute and fetch a little more brandy or we shall have you in hysterics By this time the rings had begun to fall from the debtor s irresolute hands like leaves from a wintry tree Not one was left upon them that night when he put something that chinked into the doctor s greasy palm In the meantime missus Bangham had been out on an errand to a neighbouring establishment decorated with three golden balls where she was very well known Thank you said the doctor thank you Your good lady is quite composed Doing charmingly I am very happy and very thankful to know it said the debtor though I little thought once that That a child would be born to you in a place like this said the doctor Bah bah sir what does it signify A little more elbow room is all we want here We are quiet here we don t get badgered here there s no knocker here sir to be hammered at by creditors and bring a man s heart into his mouth Nobody comes here to ask if a man s at home and to say he ll stand on the door mat till he is Nobody writes threatening letters about money to this place It s freedom sir it s freedom I have had to day s practice at home and abroad on a march and aboard ship and I ll tell you this I don t know that I have ever pursued it under such quiet circumstances as here this day Elsewhere people are restless worried hurried about anxious respecting one thing anxious respecting another Nothing of the kind here sir We have done all that we know the worst of it we have got to the bottom we can t fall and what have we found Peace That s the word for it Peace With this profession of faith the doctor who was an old jail bird and was more sodden than usual and had the additional and unusual stimulus of money in his pocket returned to his associate and chum in hoarseness puffiness red facedness all fours tobacco dirt and brandy Now the debtor was a very different man from the doctor but he had already begun to travel by his opposite segment of the circle to the same point Crushed at first by his imprisonment he had soon found a dull relief in it He was under lock and key but the lock and key that kept him in kept numbers of his troubles out If he had been a man with strength of purpose to face those troubles and fight them he might have broken the net that held him or broken his heart but being what he was he languidly slipped into this smooth descent and never more took one step upward When he was relieved of the perplexed affairs that nothing would make plain through having them returned upon his hands by a dozen agents in succession who could make neither beginning middle nor end of them or him he found his miserable place of refuge a quieter refuge than it had been before He had unpacked the portmanteau long ago and his elder children now played regularly about the yard and everybody knew the baby and claimed a kind of proprietorship in her Why I m getting proud of you said his friend the turnkey one day You ll be the oldest inhabitant soon The Marshalsea wouldn t be like the Marshalsea now without you and your family The turnkey really was proud of him He would mention him in laudatory terms to new comers when his back was turned You took notice of him he would say that went out of the lodge just now New comer would probably answer Yes Brought up as a gentleman he was if ever a man was Ed cated at no end of expense Went into the Marshal s house once to try a new piano for him Played it I understand like one o clock beautiful As to languages speaks anything We ve had a Frenchman here in his time and it s my opinion he knowed more French than the Frenchman did We ve had an Italian here in his time and he shut him up in about half a minute You ll find some characters behind other locks I don t say you won t but if you want the top sawyer in such respects as I ve mentioned you must come to the Marshalsea When his youngest child was eight years old his wife who had long been languishing away of her own inherent weakness not that she retained any greater sensitiveness as to her place of abode than he did went upon a visit to a poor friend and old nurse in the country and died there He remained shut up in his room for a fortnight afterwards and an attorney s clerk who was going through the Insolvent Court engrossed an address of condolence to him which looked like a Lease and which all the prisoners signed When he appeared again he was greyer he had soon begun to turn grey and the turnkey noticed that his hands went often to his trembling lips again as they had used to do when he first came in But he got pretty well over it in a month or two and in the meantime the children played about the yard as regularly as ever but in black Then missus Bangham long popular medium of communication with the outer world began to be infirm and to be found oftener than usual comatose on pavements with her basket of purchases spilt and the change of her clients ninepence short His son began to supersede missus Bangham and to execute commissions in a knowing manner and to be of the prison prisonous of the streets streety Time went on and the turnkey began to fail His chest swelled and his legs got weak and he was short of breath The well worn wooden stool was beyond him he complained He sat in an arm chair with a cushion and sometimes wheezed so for minutes together that he couldn t turn the key When he was overpowered by these fits the debtor often turned it for him You and me said the turnkey one snowy winter s night when the lodge with a bright fire in it was pretty full of company is the oldest inhabitants I wasn t here myself above seven year before you I shan t last long When I m off the lock for good and all you ll be the Father of the Marshalsea The turnkey went off the lock of this world next day His words were remembered and repeated and tradition afterwards handed down from generation to generation a Marshalsea generation might be calculated as about three months that the shabby old debtor with the soft manner and the white hair was the Father of the Marshalsea And he grew to be proud of the title If any impostor had arisen to claim it he would have shed tears in resentment of the attempt to deprive him of his rights A disposition began to be perceived in him to exaggerate the number of years he had been there it was generally understood that you must deduct a few from his account he was vain the fleeting generations of debtors said All new comers were presented to him He was punctilious in the exaction of this ceremony The wits would perform the office of introduction with overcharged pomp and politeness but they could not easily overstep his sense of its gravity He received them in his poor room he disliked an introduction in the mere yard as informal a thing that might happen to anybody with a kind of bowed down beneficence They were welcome to the Marshalsea he would tell them Yes he was the Father of the place So the world was kind enough to call him and so he was if more than twenty years of residence gave him a claim to the title It looked small at first but there was very good company there among a mixture necessarily a mixture and very good air It became a not unusual circumstance for letters to be put under his door at night enclosing half a crown two half crowns now and then at long intervals even half a sovereign for the Father of the Marshalsea With the compliments of a collegian taking leave He received the gifts as tributes from admirers to a public character Sometimes these correspondents assumed facetious names as the Brick Bellows Old Gooseberry Wideawake Snooks Mops Cutaway the Dogs meat Man but he considered this in bad taste and was always a little hurt by it In the fulness of time this correspondence showing signs of wearing out and seeming to require an effort on the part of the correspondents to which in the hurried circumstances of departure many of them might not be equal he established the custom of attending collegians of a certain standing to the gate and taking leave of them there The collegian under treatment after shaking hands would occasionally stop to wrap up something in a bit of paper and would come back again calling Hi He would look round surprised Me he would say with a smile By this time the collegian would be up with him and he would paternally add What have you forgotten What can I do for you I forgot to leave this the collegian would usually return for the Father of the Marshalsea My good sir he would rejoin he is infinitely obliged to you But to the last the irresolute hand of old would remain in the pocket into which he had slipped the money during two or three turns about the yard lest the transaction should be too conspicuous to the general body of collegians One afternoon he had been doing the honours of the place to a rather large party of collegians who happened to be going out when as he was coming back he encountered one from the poor side who had been taken in execution for a small sum a week before had settled in the course of that afternoon and was going out too The man was a mere Plasterer in his working dress had his wife with him and a bundle and was in high spirits God bless you sir he said in passing And you benignantly returned the Father of the Marshalsea They were pretty far divided going their several ways when the Plasterer called out I say sir and came back to him It ain t much said the Plasterer putting a little pile of halfpence in his hand but it s well meant The Father of the Marshalsea had never been offered tribute in copper yet His children often had and with his perfect acquiescence it had gone into the common purse to buy meat that he had eaten and drink that he had drunk but fustian splashed with white lime bestowing halfpence on him front to front was new How dare you he said to the man and feebly burst into tears The Plasterer turned him towards the wall that his face might not be seen and the action was so delicate and the man was so penetrated with repentance and asked pardon so honestly that he could make him no less acknowledgment than I know you meant it kindly Say no more Bless your soul sir urged the Plasterer I did indeed I d do more by you than the rest of em do I fancy What would you do he asked I d come back to see you after I was let out Give me the money again said the other eagerly and I ll keep it and never spend it Thank you for it thank you I shall see you again If I live a week you shall They shook hands and parted The collegians assembled in Symposium in the Snuggery that night marvelled what had happened to their Father he walked so late in the shadows of the yard and seemed so downcast CHAPTER seven The Child of the Marshalsea The baby whose first draught of air had been tinctured with Doctor Haggage s brandy was handed down among the generations of collegians like the tradition of their common parent In the earlier stages of her existence she was handed down in a literal and prosaic sense it being almost a part of the entrance footing of every new collegian to nurse the child who had been born in the college By rights remarked the turnkey when she was first shown to him I ought to be her godfather The debtor irresolutely thought of it for a minute and said Perhaps you wouldn t object to really being her godfather Oh I don t object replied the turnkey if you don t Thus it came to pass that she was christened one Sunday afternoon when the turnkey being relieved was off the lock and that the turnkey went up to the font of Saint George s Church and promised and vowed and renounced on her behalf as he himself related when he came back like a good un This invested the turnkey with a new proprietary share in the child over and above his former official one When she began to walk and talk he became fond of her bought a little arm chair and stood it by the high fender of the lodge fire place liked to have her company when he was on the lock and used to bribe her with cheap toys to come and talk to him The child for her part soon grew so fond of the turnkey that she would come climbing up the lodge steps of her own accord at all hours of the day When she fell asleep in the little armchair by the high fender the turnkey would cover her with his pocket handkerchief and when she sat in it dressing and undressing a doll which soon came to be unlike dolls on the other side of the lock and to bear a horrible family resemblance to missus Bangham he would contemplate her from the top of his stool with exceeding gentleness Witnessing these things the collegians would express an opinion that the turnkey who was a bachelor had been cut out by nature for a family man But the turnkey thanked them and said No on the whole it was enough to see other people s children there At what period of her early life the little creature began to perceive that it was not the habit of all the world to live locked up in narrow yards surrounded by high walls with spikes at the top would be a difficult question to settle But she was a very very little creature indeed when she had somehow gained the knowledge that her clasp of her father s hand was to be always loosened at the door which the great key opened and that while her own light steps were free to pass beyond it his feet must never cross that line A pitiful and plaintive look with which she had begun to regard him when she was still extremely young was perhaps a part of this discovery With a pitiful and plaintive look for everything indeed but with something in it for only him that was like protection this Child of the Marshalsea and the child of the Father of the Marshalsea sat by her friend the turnkey in the lodge kept the family room or wandered about the prison yard for the first eight years of her life With a pitiful and plaintive look for her wayward sister for her idle brother for the high blank walls for the faded crowd they shut in for the games of the prison children as they whooped and ran and played at hide and seek and made the iron bars of the inner gateway Home Wistful and wondering she would sit in summer weather by the high fender in the lodge looking up at the sky through the barred window until when she turned her eyes away bars of light would arise between her and her friend and she would see him through a grating too Thinking of the fields the turnkey said once after watching her ain t you Where are they she inquired Why they re over there my dear said the turnkey with a vague flourish of his key Just about there Does anybody open them and shut them Are they locked The turnkey was discomfited Well he said Not in general Are they very pretty Bob She called him Bob by his own particular request and instruction Lovely Full of flowers There s buttercups and there s daisies and there s the turnkey hesitated being short of floral nomenclature there s dandelions and all manner of games Is it very pleasant to be there Bob Prime said the turnkey Was father ever there Hem coughed the turnkey O yes he was there sometimes Is he sorry not to be there now N not particular said the turnkey Nor any of the people she asked glancing at the listless crowd within O are you quite sure and certain Bob At this difficult point of the conversation Bob gave in and changed the subject to hard bake always his last resource when he found his little friend getting him into a political social or theological corner But this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two curious companions made together They used to issue from the lodge on alternate Sunday afternoons with great gravity bound for some meadows or green lanes that had been elaborately appointed by the turnkey in the course of the week and there she picked grass and flowers to bring home while he smoked his pipe Afterwards there were tea gardens shrimps ale and other delicacies and then they would come back hand in hand unless she was more than usually tired and had fallen asleep on his shoulder In those early days the turnkey first began profoundly to consider a question which cost him so much mental labour that it remained undetermined on the day of his death He decided to will and bequeath his little property of savings to his godchild and the point arose how could it be so tied up as that only she should have the benefit of it His experience on the lock gave him such an acute perception of the enormous difficulty of tying up money with any approach to tightness and contrariwise of the remarkable ease with which it got loose that through a series of years he regularly propounded this knotty point to every new insolvent agent and other professional gentleman who passed in and out Supposing he would say stating the case with his key on the professional gentleman s waistcoat supposing a man wanted to leave his property to a young female and wanted to tie it up so that nobody else should ever be able to make a grab at it how would you tie up that property Settle it strictly on herself the professional gentleman would complacently answer But look here quoth the turnkey Supposing she had say a brother say a father say a husband who would be likely to make a grab at that property when she came into it how about that It would be settled on herself and they would have no more legal claim on it than you would be the professional answer Stop a bit said the turnkey Supposing she was tender hearted and they came over her Where s your law for tying it up then The deepest character whom the turnkey sounded was unable to produce his law for tying such a knot as that So the turnkey thought about it all his life and died intestate after all But that was long afterwards when his god daughter was past sixteen The first half of that space of her life was only just accomplished when her pitiful and plaintive look saw her father a widower From that time the protection that her wondering eyes had expressed towards him became embodied in action and the Child of the Marshalsea took upon herself a new relation towards the Father At first such a baby could do little more than sit with him deserting her livelier place by the high fender and quietly watching him But this made her so far necessary to him that he became accustomed to her and began to be sensible of missing her when she was not there Through this little gate she passed out of childhood into the care laden world What her pitiful look saw at that early time in her father in her sister in her brother in the jail how much or how little of the wretched truth it pleased God to make visible to her lies hidden with many mysteries It is enough that she was inspired to be something which was not what the rest were and to be that something different and laborious for the sake of the rest Inspired Yes Shall we speak of the inspiration of a poet or a priest and not of the heart impelled by love and self devotion to the lowliest work in the lowliest way of life With no earthly friend to help her or so much as to see her but the one so strangely assorted with no knowledge even of the common daily tone and habits of the common members of the free community who are not shut up in prisons born and bred in a social condition false even with a reference to the falsest condition outside the walls drinking from infancy of a well whose waters had their own peculiar stain their own unwholesome and unnatural taste the Child of the Marshalsea began her womanly life No matter through what mistakes and discouragements what ridicule not unkindly meant but deeply felt of her youth and little figure what humble consciousness of her own babyhood and want of strength even in the matter of lifting and carrying through how much weariness and hopelessness and how many secret tears she drudged on until recognised as useful even indispensable That time came She took the place of eldest of the three in all things but precedence was the head of the fallen family and bore in her own heart its anxieties and shames At thirteen she could read and keep accounts that is could put down in words and figures how much the bare necessaries that they wanted would cost and how much less they had to buy them with She had been by snatches of a few weeks at a time to an evening school outside and got her sister and brother sent to day schools by desultory starts during three or four years There was no instruction for any of them at home but she knew well no one better that a man so broken as to be the Father of the Marshalsea could be no father to his own children To these scanty means of improvement she added another of her own contriving Once among the heterogeneous crowd of inmates there appeared a dancing master Her sister had a great desire to learn the dancing master s art and seemed to have a taste that way At thirteen years old the Child of the Marshalsea presented herself to the dancing master with a little bag in her hand and preferred her humble petition If you please I was born here sir Oh You are the young lady are you said the dancing master surveying the small figure and uplifted face Yes sir And what can I do for you said the dancing master Nothing for me sir thank you anxiously undrawing the strings of the little bag but if while you stay here you could be so kind as to teach my sister cheap My child I ll teach her for nothing said the dancing master shutting up the bag He was as good natured a dancing master as ever danced to the Insolvent Court and he kept his word The sister was so apt a pupil and the dancing master had such abundant leisure to bestow upon her for it took him a matter of ten weeks to set to his creditors lead off turn the Commissioners and right and left back to his professional pursuits that wonderful progress was made Indeed the dancing master was so proud of it and so wishful to display it before he left to a few select friends among the collegians that at six o clock on a certain fine morning a minuet de la cour came off in the yard the college rooms being of too confined proportions for the purpose in which so much ground was covered and the steps were so conscientiously executed that the dancing master having to play the kit besides was thoroughly blown The success of this beginning which led to the dancing master s continuing his instruction after his release emboldened the poor child to try again She watched and waited months for a seamstress In the fulness of time a milliner came in and to her she repaired on her own behalf I beg your pardon ma am she said looking timidly round the door of the milliner whom she found in tears and in bed but I was born here Everybody seemed to hear of her as soon as they arrived for the milliner sat up in bed drying her eyes and said just as the dancing master had said Oh You are the child are you Yes ma am I am sorry I haven t got anything for you said the milliner shaking her head It s not that ma am If you please I want to learn needle work Why should you do that returned the milliner with me before you It has not done me much good Nothing whatever it is seems to have done anybody much good who comes here she returned in all simplicity but I want to learn just the same I am afraid you are so weak you see the milliner objected I don t think I am weak ma am And you are so very very little you see the milliner objected Yes I am afraid I am very little indeed returned the Child of the Marshalsea and so began to sob over that unfortunate defect of hers which came so often in her way The milliner who was not morose or hard hearted only newly insolvent was touched took her in hand with goodwill found her the most patient and earnest of pupils and made her a cunning work woman in course of time In course of time and in the very self same course of time the Father of the Marshalsea gradually developed a new flower of character The more Fatherly he grew as to the Marshalsea and the more dependent he became on the contributions of his changing family the greater stand he made by his forlorn gentility With the same hand that he pocketed a collegian s half crown half an hour ago he would wipe away the tears that streamed over his cheeks if any reference were made to his daughters earning their bread So over and above other daily cares the Child of the Marshalsea had always upon her the care of preserving the genteel fiction that they were all idle beggars together The sister became a dancer There was a ruined uncle in the family group ruined by his brother the Father of the Marshalsea and knowing no more how than his ruiner did but accepting the fact as an inevitable certainty on whom her protection devolved Naturally a retired and simple man he had shown no particular sense of being ruined at the time when that calamity fell upon him further than that he left off washing himself when the shock was announced and never took to that luxury any more He had been a very indifferent musical amateur in his better days and when he fell with his brother resorted for support to playing a clarionet as dirty as himself in a small Theatre Orchestra It was the theatre in which his niece became a dancer he had been a fixture there a long time when she took her poor station in it and he accepted the task of serving as her escort and guardian just as he would have accepted an illness a legacy a feast starvation anything but soap To enable this girl to earn her few weekly shillings it was necessary for the Child of the Marshalsea to go through an elaborate form with the Father Fanny is not going to live with us just now father She will be here a good deal in the day but she is going to live outside with uncle You surprise me Why I think uncle wants a companion father He should be attended to and looked after A companion He passes much of his time here And you attend to him and look after him Amy a great deal more than ever your sister will You all go out so much you all go out so much This was to keep up the ceremony and pretence of his having no idea that Amy herself went out by the day to work But we are always glad to come home father now are we not And as to Fanny perhaps besides keeping uncle company and taking care of him it may be as well for her not quite to live here always She was not born here as I was you know father Well Amy well I don t quite follow you but it s natural I suppose that Fanny should prefer to be outside and even that you often should too So you and Fanny and your uncle my dear shall have your own way Good good I ll not meddle don t mind me To get her brother out of the prison out of the succession to missus Bangham in executing commissions and out of the slang interchange with very doubtful companions consequent upon both was her hardest task At eighteen he would have dragged on from hand to mouth from hour to hour from penny to penny until eighty Nobody got into the prison from whom he derived anything useful or good and she could find no patron for him but her old friend and godfather Dear Bob said she what is to become of poor Tip His name was Edward and Ted had been transformed into Tip within the walls The turnkey had strong private opinions as to what would become of poor Tip and had even gone so far with the view of averting their fulfilment as to sound Tip in reference to the expediency of running away and going to serve his country But Tip had thanked him and said he didn t seem to care for his country Well my dear said the turnkey something ought to be done with him Suppose I try and get him into the law That would be so good of you Bob The turnkey had now two points to put to the professional gentlemen as they passed in and out He put this second one so perseveringly that a stool and twelve shillings a week were at last found for Tip in the office of an attorney in a great National Palladium called the Palace Court at that time one of a considerable list of everlasting bulwarks to the dignity and safety of Albion whose places know them no more Tip languished in Clifford s Inns for six months and at the expiration of that term sauntered back one evening with his hands in his pockets and incidentally observed to his sister that he was not going back again Not going back again said the poor little anxious Child of the Marshalsea always calculating and planning for Tip in the front rank of her charges I am so tired of it said Tip that I have cut it Tip tired of everything With intervals of Marshalsea lounging and missus Bangham succession his small second mother aided by her trusty friend got him into a warehouse into a market garden into the hop trade into the law again into an auctioneers into a brewery into a stockbroker s into the law again into a coach office into a waggon office into the law again into a general dealer s into a distillery into the law again into a wool house into a dry goods house into the Billingsgate trade into the foreign fruit trade and into the docks But whatever Tip went into he came out of tired announcing that he had cut it Wherever he went this foredoomed Tip appeared to take the prison walls with him and to set them up in such trade or calling and to prowl about within their narrow limits in the old slip shod purposeless down at heel way until the real immovable Marshalsea walls asserted their fascination over him and brought him back Nevertheless the brave little creature did so fix her heart on her brother s rescue that while he was ringing out these doleful changes she pinched and scraped enough together to ship him for Canada When he was tired of nothing to do and disposed in its turn to cut even that he graciously consented to go to Canada And there was grief in her bosom over parting with him and joy in the hope of his being put in a straight course at last God bless you dear Tip Don t be too proud to come and see us when you have made your fortune All right said Tip and went But not all the way to Canada in fact not further than Liverpool After making the voyage to that port from London he found himself so strongly impelled to cut the vessel that he resolved to walk back again Carrying out which intention he presented himself before her at the expiration of a month in rags without shoes and much more tired than ever At length after another interval of successorship to missus Bangham he found a pursuit for himself and announced it Amy I have got a situation Have you really and truly Tip All right I shall do now You needn t look anxious about me any more old girl What is it Tip Why you know Slingo by sight Not the man they call the dealer That s the chap He ll be out on Monday and he s going to give me a berth What is he a dealer in Tip Horses All right I shall do now Amy She lost sight of him for months afterwards and only heard from him once A whisper passed among the elder collegians that he had been seen at a mock auction in Moorfields pretending to buy plated articles for massive silver and paying for them with the greatest liberality in bank notes but it never reached her ears One evening she was alone at work standing up at the window to save the twilight lingering above the wall when he opened the door and walked in She kissed and welcomed him but was afraid to ask him any questions He saw how anxious and timid she was and appeared sorry I am afraid Amy you ll be vexed this time Upon my life I am I am very sorry to hear you say so Tip Have you come back Why yes Not expecting this time that what you had found would answer very well I am less surprised and sorry than I might have been Tip Ah But that s not the worst of it Not the worst of it Don t look so startled No Amy not the worst of it I have come back you see but DON T look so startled I have come back in what I may call a new way I am off the volunteer list altogether I am in now as one of the regulars Oh Don t say you are a prisoner Tip Don t don t Well I don t want to say it he returned in a reluctant tone but if you can t understand me without my saying it what am I to do I am in for forty pound odd For the first time in all those years she sunk under her cares She cried with her clasped hands lifted above her head that it would kill their father if he ever knew it and fell down at Tip s graceless feet It was easier for Tip to bring her to her senses than for her to bring him to understand that the Father of the Marshalsea would be beside himself if he knew the truth The thing was incomprehensible to Tip and altogether a fanciful notion He yielded to it in that light only when he submitted to her entreaties backed by those of his uncle and sister There was no want of precedent for his return it was accounted for to the father in the usual way and the collegians with a better comprehension of the pious fraud than Tip supported it loyally This was the life and this the history of the child of the Marshalsea at twenty two With a still surviving attachment to the one miserable yard and block of houses as her birthplace and home she passed to and fro in it shrinkingly now with a womanly consciousness that she was pointed out to every one Since she had begun to work beyond the walls she had found it necessary to conceal where she lived and to come and go as secretly as she could between the free city and the iron gates outside of which she had never slept in her life Her original timidity had grown with this concealment and her light step and her little figure shunned the thronged streets while they passed along them Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities she was innocent in all things else Innocent in the mist through which she saw her father and the prison and the turbid living river that flowed through it and flowed on This was the life and this the history of Little Dorrit now going home upon a dull September evening observed at a distance by Arthur Clennam This was the life and this the history of Little Dorrit turning at the end of London Bridge recrossing it going back again passing on to Saint George s Church turning back suddenly once more and flitting in at the open outer gate and little court yard of the Marshalsea CHAPTER eight The Lock Arthur Clennam stood in the street waiting to ask some passer by what place that was He suffered a few people to pass him in whose face there was no encouragement to make the inquiry and still stood pausing in the street when an old man came up and turned into the courtyard He stooped a good deal and plodded along in a slow pre occupied manner which made the bustling London thoroughfares no very safe resort for him He was dirtily and meanly dressed in a threadbare coat once blue reaching to his ankles and buttoned to his chin where it vanished in the pale ghost of a velvet collar A piece of red cloth with which that phantom had been stiffened in its lifetime was now laid bare and poked itself up at the back of the old man s neck into a confusion of grey hair and rusty stock and buckle which altogether nearly poked his hat off A greasy hat it was and a napless impending over his eyes cracked and crumpled at the brim and with a wisp of pocket handkerchief dangling out below it His trousers were so long and loose and his shoes so clumsy and large that he shuffled like an elephant though how much of this was gait and how much trailing cloth and leather no one could have told Under one arm he carried a limp and worn out case containing some wind instrument in the same hand he had a pennyworth of snuff in a little packet of whitey brown paper from which he slowly comforted his poor blue old nose with a lengthened out pinch as Arthur Clennam looked at him To this old man crossing the court yard he preferred his inquiry touching him on the shoulder The old man stopped and looked round with the expression in his weak grey eyes of one whose thoughts had been far off and who was a little dull of hearing also Pray sir said Arthur repeating his question what is this place Ay This place returned the old man staying his pinch of snuff on its road and pointing at the place without looking at it This is the Marshalsea sir The debtors prison Sir said the old man with the air of deeming it not quite necessary to insist upon that designation the debtors prison He turned himself about and went on I beg your pardon said Arthur stopping him once more but will you allow me to ask you another question Can any one go in here Any one can go IN replied the old man plainly adding by the significance of his emphasis but it is not every one who can go out Pardon me once more Are you familiar with the place Sir returned the old man squeezing his little packet of snuff in his hand and turning upon his interrogator as if such questions hurt him I am I beg you to excuse me I am not impertinently curious but have a good object Do you know the name of Dorrit here My name sir replied the old man most unexpectedly is Dorrit Arthur pulled off his hat to him Grant me the favour of half a dozen words I was wholly unprepared for your announcement and hope that assurance is my sufficient apology for having taken the liberty of addressing you I have recently come home to England after a long absence I have seen at my mother s missus Clennam in the city a young woman working at her needle whom I have only heard addressed or spoken of as Little Dorrit I have felt sincerely interested in her and have had a great desire to know something more about her I saw her not a minute before you came up pass in at that door The old man looked at him attentively Are you a sailor sir he asked He seemed a little disappointed by the shake of the head that replied to him Not a sailor I judged from your sunburnt face that you might be Are you in earnest sir I do assure you that I am and do entreat you to believe that I am in plain earnest I know very little of the world sir returned the other who had a weak and quavering voice I am merely passing on like the shadow over the sun dial It would be worth no man s while to mislead me it would really be too easy too poor a success to yield any satisfaction The young woman whom you saw go in here is my brother s child My brother is William Dorrit I am Frederick You say you have seen her at your mother s I know your mother befriends her you have felt an interest in her and you wish to know what she does here Come and see He went on again and Arthur accompanied him My brother said the old man pausing on the step and slowly facing round again has been here many years and much that happens even among ourselves out of doors is kept from him for reasons that I needn t enter upon now Be so good as to say nothing of my niece s working at her needle Be so good as to say nothing that goes beyond what is said among us If you keep within our bounds you cannot well be wrong Now Come and see Arthur followed him down a narrow entry at the end of which a key was turned and a strong door was opened from within It admitted them into a lodge or lobby across which they passed and so through another door and a grating into the prison The old man always plodding on before turned round in his slow stiff stooping manner when they came to the turnkey on duty as if to present his companion The turnkey nodded and the companion passed in without being asked whom he wanted The night was dark and the prison lamps in the yard and the candles in the prison windows faintly shining behind many sorts of wry old curtain and blind had not the air of making it lighter A few people loitered about but the greater part of the population was within doors The old man taking the right hand side of the yard turned in at the third or fourth doorway and began to ascend the stairs They are rather dark sir but you will not find anything in the way He paused for a moment before opening a door on the second story He had no sooner turned the handle than the visitor saw Little Dorrit and saw the reason of her setting so much store by dining alone She had brought the meat home that she should have eaten herself and was already warming it on a gridiron over the fire for her father clad in an old grey gown and a black cap awaiting his supper at the table A clean cloth was spread before him with knife fork and spoon salt cellar pepper box glass and pewter ale pot Such zests as his particular little phial of cayenne pepper and his pennyworth of pickles in a saucer were not wanting She started coloured deeply and turned white The visitor more with his eyes than by the slight impulsive motion of his hand entreated her to be reassured and to trust him I found this gentleman said the uncle mister Clennam William son of Amy s friend at the outer gate wishful as he was going by of paying his respects but hesitating whether to come in or not This is my brother William sir I hope said Arthur very doubtful what to say that my respect for your daughter may explain and justify my desire to be presented to you sir mister Clennam returned the other rising taking his cap off in the flat of his hand and so holding it ready to put on again you do me honour You are welcome sir with a low bow Frederick a chair Pray sit down mister Clennam He put his black cap on again as he had taken it off and resumed his own seat There was a wonderful air of benignity and patronage in his manner These were the ceremonies with which he received the collegians You are welcome to the Marshalsea sir I have welcomed many gentlemen to these walls Perhaps you are aware my daughter Amy may have mentioned that I am the Father of this place I so I have understood said Arthur dashing at the assertion You know I dare say that my daughter Amy was born here A good girl sir a dear girl and long a comfort and support to me Amy my dear put this dish on mister Clennam will excuse the primitive customs to which we are reduced here Is it a compliment to ask you if you would do me the honour sir to Thank you returned Arthur Not a morsel He felt himself quite lost in wonder at the manner of the man and that the probability of his daughter s having had a reserve as to her family history should be so far out of his mind She filled his glass put all the little matters on the table ready to his hand and then sat beside him while he ate his supper Evidently in observance of their nightly custom she put some bread before herself and touched his glass with her lips but Arthur saw she was troubled and took nothing Her look at her father half admiring him and proud of him half ashamed for him all devoted and loving went to his inmost heart The Father of the Marshalsea condescended towards his brother as an amiable well meaning man a private character who had not arrived at distinction Frederick said he you and Fanny sup at your lodgings to night I know What have you done with Fanny Frederick She is walking with Tip Tip as you may know is my son mister Clennam He has been a little wild and difficult to settle but his introduction to the world was rather he shrugged his shoulders with a faint sigh and looked round the room a little adverse Your first visit here sir My first You could hardly have been here since your boyhood without my knowledge It very seldom happens that anybody of any pretensions any pretensions comes here without being presented to me As many as forty or fifty in a day have been introduced to my brother said Frederick faintly lighting up with a ray of pride Yes the Father of the Marshalsea assented We have even exceeded that number On a fine Sunday in term time it is quite a Levee quite a Levee Amy my dear I have been trying half the day to remember the name of the gentleman from Camberwell who was introduced to me last Christmas week by that agreeable coal merchant who was remanded for six months I don t remember his name father Frederick do you remember his name Frederick doubted if he had ever heard it No one could doubt that Frederick was the last person upon earth to put such a question to with any hope of information I mean said his brother the gentleman who did that handsome action with so much delicacy Ha Tush The name has quite escaped me mister Clennam as I have happened to mention handsome and delicate action you may like perhaps to know what it was Very much said Arthur withdrawing his eyes from the delicate head beginning to droop and the pale face with a new solicitude stealing over it It is so generous and shows so much fine feeling that it is almost a duty to mention it I said at the time that I always would mention it on every suitable occasion without regard to personal sensitiveness A well a it s of no use to disguise the fact you must know mister Clennam that it does sometimes occur that people who come here desire to offer some little Testimonial to the Father of the place To see her hand upon his arm in mute entreaty half repressed and her timid little shrinking figure turning away was to see a sad sad sight Sometimes he went on in a low soft voice agitated and clearing his throat every now and then sometimes hem it takes one shape and sometimes another but it is generally ha Money And it is I cannot but confess it it is too often hem acceptable This gentleman that I refer to was presented to me mister Clennam in a manner highly gratifying to my feelings and conversed not only with great politeness but with great ahem information All this time though he had finished his supper he was nervously going about his plate with his knife and fork as if some of it were still before him It appeared from his conversation that he had a garden though he was delicate of mentioning it at first as gardens are hem are not accessible to me But it came out through my admiring a very fine cluster of geranium beautiful cluster of geranium to be sure which he had brought from his conservatory On my taking notice of its rich colour he showed me a piece of paper round it on which was written For the Father of the Marshalsea and presented it to me But this was hem not all He made a particular request on taking leave that I would remove the paper in half an hour I ha I did so and I found that it contained ahem two guineas I assure you mister Clennam I have received hem Testimonials in many ways and of many degrees of value and they have always been ha unfortunately acceptable but I never was more pleased than with this ahem this particular Testimonial Arthur was in the act of saying the little he could say on such a theme when a bell began to ring and footsteps approached the door A pretty girl of a far better figure and much more developed than Little Dorrit though looking much younger in the face when the two were observed together stopped in the doorway on seeing a stranger and a young man who was with her stopped too mister Clennam Fanny My eldest daughter and my son mister Clennam The bell is a signal for visitors to retire and so they have come to say good night but there is plenty of time plenty of time Girls mister Clennam will excuse any household business you may have together He knows I dare say that I have but one room here I only want my clean dress from Amy father said the second girl And I my clothes said Tip Amy opened a drawer in an old piece of furniture that was a chest of drawers above and a bedstead below and produced two little bundles which she handed to her brother and sister Mended and made up Clennam heard the sister ask in a whisper To which Amy answered Yes He had risen now and took the opportunity of glancing round the room The bare walls had been coloured green evidently by an unskilled hand and were poorly decorated with a few prints The window was curtained and the floor carpeted and there were shelves and pegs and other such conveniences that had accumulated in the course of years It was a close confined room poorly furnished and the chimney smoked to boot or the tin screen at the top of the fireplace was superfluous but constant pains and care had made it neat and even after its kind comfortable All the while the bell was ringing and the uncle was anxious to go Come Fanny come Fanny he said with his ragged clarionet case under his arm the lock child the lock Fanny bade her father good night and whisked off airily Tip had already clattered down stairs Now mister Clennam said the uncle looking back as he shuffled out after them the lock sir the lock mister Clennam had two things to do before he followed one to offer his testimonial to the Father of the Marshalsea without giving pain to his child the other to say something to that child though it were but a word in explanation of his having come there Allow me said the Father to see you down stairs She had slipped out after the rest and they were alone Not on any account said the visitor hurriedly Pray allow me to chink chink chink mister Clennam said the Father I am deeply deeply But his visitor had shut up his hand to stop the clinking and had gone down stairs with great speed He saw no Little Dorrit on his way down or in the yard The last two or three stragglers were hurrying to the lodge and he was following when he caught sight of her in the doorway of the first house from the entrance He turned back hastily Pray forgive me he said for speaking to you here pray forgive me for coming here at all I followed you to night I did so that I might endeavour to render you and your family some service You know the terms on which I and my mother are and may not be surprised that I have preserved our distant relations at her house lest I should unintentionally make her jealous or resentful or do you any injury in her estimation What I have seen here in this short time has greatly increased my heartfelt wish to be a friend to you It would recompense me for much disappointment if I could hope to gain your confidence She was scared at first but seemed to take courage while he spoke to her You are very good sir You speak very earnestly to me But I but I wish you had not watched me He understood the emotion with which she said it to arise in her father s behalf and he respected it and was silent missus Clennam has been of great service to me I don t know what we should have done without the employment she has given me I am afraid it may not be a good return to become secret with her I can say no more to night sir I am sure you mean to be kind to us Thank you thank you Let me ask you one question before I leave Have you known my mother long I think two years sir The bell has stopped How did you know her first Did she send here for you No She does not even know that I live here We have a friend father and I a poor labouring man but the best of friends and I wrote out that I wished to do needlework and gave his address And he got what I wrote out displayed at a few places where it cost nothing and missus Clennam found me that way and sent for me The gate will be locked sir She was so tremulous and agitated and he was so moved by compassion for her and by deep interest in her story as it dawned upon him that he could scarcely tear himself away But the stoppage of the bell and the quiet in the prison were a warning to depart and with a few hurried words of kindness he left her gliding back to her father But he remained too late The inner gate was locked and the lodge closed After a little fruitless knocking with his hand he was standing there with the disagreeable conviction upon him that he had got to get through the night when a voice accosted him from behind Caught eh said the voice You won t go home till morning Oh It s you is it mister Clennam The voice was Tip s and they stood looking at one another in the prison yard as it began to rain You ve done it observed Tip you must be sharper than that next time But you are locked in too said Arthur I believe I am said Tip sarcastically About But not in your way I belong to the shop only my sister has a theory that our governor must never know it I don t see why myself Can I get any shelter asked Arthur What had I better do We had better get hold of Amy first of all said Tip referring any difficulty to her as a matter of course I would rather walk about all night it s not much to do than give that trouble You needn t do that if you don t mind paying for a bed If you don t mind paying they ll make you up one on the Snuggery table under the circumstances If you ll come along I ll introduce you there As they passed down the yard Arthur looked up at the window of the room he had lately left where the light was still burning Yes sir said Tip following his glance That s the governor s She ll sit with him for another hour reading yesterday s paper to him or something of that sort and then she ll come out like a little ghost and vanish away without a sound I don t understand you The governor sleeps up in the room and she has a lodging at the turnkey s First house there said Tip pointing out the doorway into which she had retired First house sky parlour She pays twice as much for it as she would for one twice as good outside But she stands by the governor poor dear girl day and night This brought them to the tavern establishment at the upper end of the prison where the collegians had just vacated their social evening club The apartment on the ground floor in which it was held was the Snuggery in question the presidential tribune of the chairman the pewter pots glasses pipes tobacco ashes and general flavour of members were still as that convivial institution had left them on its adjournment The Snuggery had two of the qualities popularly held to be essential to grog for ladies in respect that it was hot and strong but in the third point of analogy requiring plenty of it the Snuggery was defective being but a cooped up apartment The unaccustomed visitor from outside naturally assumed everybody here to be prisoners landlord waiter barmaid potboy and all Whether they were or not did not appear but they all had a weedy look The keeper of a chandler s shop in a front parlour who took in gentlemen boarders lent his assistance in making the bed He had been a tailor in his time and had kept a phaeton he said He boasted that he stood up litigiously for the interests of the college and he had undefined and undefinable ideas that the marshal intercepted a Fund which ought to come to the collegians He liked to believe this and always impressed the shadowy grievance on new comers and strangers though he could not for his life have explained what Fund he meant or how the notion had got rooted in his soul He had fully convinced himself notwithstanding that his own proper share of the Fund was three and ninepence a week and that in this amount he as an individual collegian was swindled by the marshal regularly every Monday Apparently he helped to make the bed that he might not lose an opportunity of stating this case after which unloading of his mind and after announcing as it seemed he always did without anything coming of it that he was going to write a letter to the papers and show the marshal up he fell into miscellaneous conversation with the rest It was evident from the general tone of the whole party that they had come to regard insolvency as the normal state of mankind and the payment of debts as a disease that occasionally broke out In this strange scene and with these strange spectres flitting about him Arthur Clennam looked on at the preparations as if they were part of a dream Pending which the long initiated Tip with an awful enjoyment of the Snuggery s resources pointed out the common kitchen fire maintained by subscription of collegians the boiler for hot water supported in like manner and other premises generally tending to the deduction that the way to be healthy wealthy and wise was to come to the Marshalsea The two tables put together in a corner were at length converted into a very fair bed and the stranger was left to the Windsor chairs the presidential tribune the beery atmosphere sawdust pipe lights spittoons and repose But the last item was long long long in linking itself to the rest The novelty of the place the coming upon it without preparation the sense of being locked up the remembrance of that room up stairs of the two brothers and above all of the retiring childish form and the face in which he now saw years of insufficient food if not of want kept him waking and unhappy Speculations too bearing the strangest relations towards the prison but always concerning the prison ran like nightmares through his mind while he lay awake Whether coffins were kept ready for people who might die there where they were kept how they were kept where people who died in the prison were buried how they were taken out what forms were observed whether an implacable creditor could arrest the dead As to escaping what chances there were of escape Whether a prisoner could scale the walls with a cord and grapple how he would descend upon the other side whether he could alight on a housetop steal down a staircase let himself out at a door and get lost in the crowd As to Fire in the prison if one were to break out while he lay there And these involuntary starts of fancy were after all but the setting of a picture in which three people kept before him His father with the steadfast look with which he had died prophetically darkened forth in the portrait his mother with her arm up warding off his suspicion Little Dorrit with her hand on the degraded arm and her drooping head turned away What if his mother had an old reason she well knew for softening to this poor girl What if the prisoner now sleeping quietly Heaven grant it by the light of the great Day of judgment should trace back his fall to her What if any act of hers and of his father s should have even remotely brought the grey heads of those two brothers so low A swift thought shot into his mind In that long imprisonment here and in her own long confinement to her room did his mother find a balance to be struck I admit that I was accessory to that man s captivity I have suffered for it in kind He has decayed in his prison I in mine I have paid the penalty When all the other thoughts had faded out this one held possession of him When he fell asleep she came before him in her wheeled chair warding him off with this justification When he awoke and sprang up causelessly frightened the words were in his ears as if her voice had slowly spoken them at his pillow to break his rest He withers away in his prison I wither away in mine inexorable justice is done what do I owe on this score CHAPTER nine Little Mother The morning light was in no hurry to climb the prison wall and look in at the Snuggery windows and when it did come it would have been more welcome if it had come alone instead of bringing a rush of rain with it But the equinoctial gales were blowing out at sea and the impartial south west wind in its flight would not neglect even the narrow Marshalsea While it roared through the steeple of saint George s Church and twirled all the cowls in the neighbourhood it made a swoop to beat the Southwark smoke into the jail and plunging down the chimneys of the few early collegians who were yet lighting their fires half suffocated them Arthur Clennam would have been little disposed to linger in bed though his bed had been in a more private situation and less affected by the raking out of yesterday s fire the kindling of to day s under the collegiate boiler the filling of that Spartan vessel at the pump the sweeping and sawdusting of the common room and other such preparations Heartily glad to see the morning though little rested by the night he turned out as soon as he could distinguish objects about him and paced the yard for two heavy hours before the gate was opened The walls were so near to one another and the wild clouds hurried over them so fast that it gave him a sensation like the beginning of sea sickness to look up at the gusty sky The rain carried aslant by flaws of wind blackened that side of the central building which he had visited last night but left a narrow dry trough under the lee of the wall where he walked up and down among the waits of straw and dust and paper the waste droppings of the pump and the stray leaves of yesterday s greens It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look upon Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought him there Perhaps she glided out of her doorway and in at that where her father lived while his face was turned from both but he saw nothing of her It was too early for her brother to have seen him once was to have seen enough of him to know that he would be sluggish to leave whatever frowsy bed he occupied at night so as Arthur Clennam walked up and down waiting for the gate to open he cast about in his mind for future rather than for present means of pursuing his discoveries At last the lodge gate turned and the turnkey standing on the step taking an early comb at his hair was ready to let him out With a joyful sense of release he passed through the lodge and found himself again in the little outer court yard where he had spoken to the brother last night There was a string of people already straggling in whom it was not difficult to identify as the nondescript messengers go betweens and errand bearers of the place Some of them had been lounging in the rain until the gate should open others who had timed their arrival with greater nicety were coming up now and passing in with damp whitey brown paper bags from the grocers loaves of bread lumps of butter eggs milk and the like The shabbiness of these attendants upon shabbiness the poverty of these insolvent waiters upon insolvency was a sight to see Such threadbare coats and trousers such fusty gowns and shawls such squashed hats and bonnets such boots and shoes such umbrellas and walking sticks never were seen in Rag Fair All of them wore the cast off clothes of other men and women were made up of patches and pieces of other people s individuality and had no sartorial existence of their own proper Their walk was the walk of a race apart They had a peculiar way of doggedly slinking round the corner as if they were eternally going to the pawnbroker s When they coughed they coughed like people accustomed to be forgotten on doorsteps and in draughty passages waiting for answers to letters in faded ink which gave the recipients of those manuscripts great mental disturbance and no satisfaction As they eyed the stranger in passing they eyed him with borrowing eyes hungry sharp speculative as to his softness if they were accredited to him and the likelihood of his standing something handsome Mendicity on commission stooped in their high shoulders shambled in their unsteady legs buttoned and pinned and darned and dragged their clothes frayed their button holes leaked out of their figures in dirty little ends of tape and issued from their mouths in alcoholic breathings As these people passed him standing still in the court yard and one of them turned back to inquire if he could assist him with his services it came into Arthur Clennam s mind that he would speak to Little Dorrit again before he went away She would have recovered her first surprise and might feel easier with him He asked this member of the fraternity who had two red herrings in his hand and a loaf and a blacking brush under his arm where was the nearest place to get a cup of coffee at The nondescript replied in encouraging terms and brought him to a coffee shop in the street within a stone s throw Do you know Miss Dorrit asked the new client The nondescript knew two Miss Dorrits one who was born inside That was the one That was the one The nondescript had known her many years In regard of the other Miss Dorrit the nondescript lodged in the same house with herself and uncle This changed the client s half formed design of remaining at the coffee shop until the nondescript should bring him word that Dorrit had issued forth into the street He entrusted the nondescript with a confidential message to her importing that the visitor who had waited on her father last night begged the favour of a few words with her at her uncle s lodging he obtained from the same source full directions to the house which was very near dismissed the nondescript gratified with half a crown and having hastily refreshed himself at the coffee shop repaired with all speed to the clarionet player s dwelling There were so many lodgers in this house that the doorpost seemed to be as full of bell handles as a cathedral organ is of stops Doubtful which might be the clarionet stop he was considering the point when a shuttlecock flew out of the parlour window and alighted on his hat He then observed that in the parlour window was a blind with the inscription mister CRIPPLES s ACADEMY also in another line EVENING TUITION and behind the blind was a little white faced boy with a slice of bread and butter and a battledore The window being accessible from the footway he looked in over the blind returned the shuttlecock and put his question Dorrit said the little white faced boy Master Cripples in fact mister Dorrit Third bell and one knock The pupils of mister Cripples appeared to have been making a copy book of the street door it was so extensively scribbled over in pencil The frequency of the inscriptions Old Dorrit and Dirty Dick in combination suggested intentions of personality on the part Of mister Cripples s pupils There was ample time to make these observations before the door was opened by the poor old man himself Ha said he very slowly remembering Arthur you were shut in last night Yes mister Dorrit I hope to meet your niece here presently Oh said he pondering Out of my brother s way True Would you come up stairs and wait for her Thank you Turning himself as slowly as he turned in his mind whatever he heard or said he led the way up the narrow stairs The house was very close and had an unwholesome smell The little staircase windows looked in at the back windows of other houses as unwholesome as itself with poles and lines thrust out of them on which unsightly linen hung as if the inhabitants were angling for clothes and had had some wretched bites not worth attending to In the back garret a sickly room with a turn up bedstead in it so hastily and recently turned up that the blankets were boiling over as it were and keeping the lid open a half finished breakfast of coffee and toast for two persons was jumbled down anyhow on a rickety table There was no one there The old man mumbling to himself after some consideration that Fanny had run away went to the next room to fetch her back The visitor observing that she held the door on the inside and that when the uncle tried to open it there was a sharp adjuration of Don t stupid and an appearance of loose stocking and flannel concluded that the young lady was in an undress The uncle without appearing to come to any conclusion shuffled in again sat down in his chair and began warming his hands at the fire not that it was cold or that he had any waking idea whether it was or not What did you think of my brother sir he asked when he by and by discovered what he was doing left off reached over to the chimney piece and took his clarionet case down I was glad said Arthur very much at a loss for his thoughts were on the brother before him to find him so well and cheerful Ha muttered the old man yes yes yes yes yes Arthur wondered what he could possibly want with the clarionet case He did not want it at all He discovered in due time that it was not the little paper of snuff which was also on the chimney piece put it back again took down the snuff instead and solaced himself with a pinch He was as feeble spare and slow in his pinches as in everything else but a certain little trickling of enjoyment of them played in the poor worn nerves about the corners of his eyes and mouth Amy mister Clennam What do you think of her I am much impressed mister Dorrit by all that I have seen of her and thought of her My brother would have been quite lost without Amy he returned We should all have been lost without Amy She is a very good girl Amy She does her duty Arthur fancied that he heard in these praises a certain tone of custom which he had heard from the father last night with an inward protest and feeling of antagonism It was not that they stinted her praises or were insensible to what she did for them but that they were lazily habituated to her as they were to all the rest of their condition He fancied that although they had before them every day the means of comparison between her and one another and themselves they regarded her as being in her necessary place as holding a position towards them all which belonged to her like her name or her age He fancied that they viewed her not as having risen away from the prison atmosphere but as appertaining to it as being vaguely what they had a right to expect and nothing more Her uncle resumed his breakfast and was munching toast sopped in coffee oblivious of his guest when the third bell rang That was Amy he said and went down to let her in leaving the visitor with as vivid a picture on his mind of his begrimed hands dirt worn face and decayed figure as if he were still drooping in his chair She came up after him in the usual plain dress and with the usual timid manner Her lips were a little parted as if her heart beat faster than usual mister Clennam Amy said her uncle has been expecting you some time I took the liberty of sending you a message I received the message sir Are you going to my mother s this morning I think not for it is past your usual hour Not to day sir I am not wanted to day Will you allow Me to walk a little way in whatever direction you may be going I can then speak to you as we walk both without detaining you here and without intruding longer here myself She looked embarrassed but said if he pleased He made a pretence of having mislaid his walking stick to give her time to set the bedstead right to answer her sister s impatient knock at the wall and to say a word softly to her uncle Then he found it and they went down stairs she first he following the uncle standing at the stair head and probably forgetting them before they had reached the ground floor mister Cripples s pupils who were by this time coming to school desisted from their morning recreation of cuffing one another with bags and books to stare with all the eyes they had at a stranger who had been to see Dirty Dick They bore the trying spectacle in silence until the mysterious visitor was at a safe distance when they burst into pebbles and yells and likewise into reviling dances and in all respects buried the pipe of peace with so many savage ceremonies that if mister Cripples had been the chief of the Cripplewayboo tribe with his war paint on they could scarcely have done greater justice to their education In the midst of this homage mister Arthur Clennam offered his arm to Little Dorrit and Little Dorrit took it Will you go by the Iron Bridge said he where there is an escape from the noise of the street Little Dorrit answered if he pleased and presently ventured to hope that he would not mind mister Cripples s boys for she had herself received her education such as it was in mister Cripples s evening academy He returned with the best will in the world that mister Cripples s boys were forgiven out of the bottom of his soul Thus did Cripples unconsciously become a master of the ceremonies between them and bring them more naturally together than Beau Nash might have done if they had lived in his golden days and he had alighted from his coach and six for the purpose The morning remained squally and the streets were miserably muddy but no rain fell as they walked towards the Iron Bridge The little creature seemed so young in his eyes that there were moments when he found himself thinking of her if not speaking to her as if she were a child Perhaps he seemed as old in her eyes as she seemed young in his I am sorry to hear you were so inconvenienced last night sir as to be locked in It was very unfortunate It was nothing he returned He had had a very good bed Oh yes she said quickly she believed there were excellent beds at the coffee house He noticed that the coffee house was quite a majestic hotel to her and that she treasured its reputation I believe it is very expensive said Little Dorrit but MY father has told me that quite beautiful dinners may be got there And wine she added timidly Were you ever there Oh no Only into the kitchen to fetch hot water To think of growing up with a kind of awe upon one as to the luxuries of that superb establishment the Marshalsea Hotel I asked you last night said Clennam how you had become acquainted with my mother Did you ever hear her name before she sent for you No sir Do you think your father ever did No sir He met her eyes raised to his with so much wonder in them she was scared when the encounter took place and shrunk away again that he felt it necessary to say I have a reason for asking which I cannot very well explain but you must on no account suppose it to be of a nature to cause you the least alarm or anxiety Quite the reverse And you think that at no time of your father s life was my name of Clennam ever familiar to him No sir He felt from the tone in which she spoke that she was glancing up at him with those parted lips therefore he looked before him rather than make her heart beat quicker still by embarrassing her afresh Thus they emerged upon the Iron Bridge which was as quiet after the roaring streets as though it had been open country The wind blew roughly the wet squalls came rattling past them skimming the pools on the road and pavement and raining them down into the river The clouds raced on furiously in the lead Coloured sky the smoke and mist raced after them the dark tide ran fierce and strong in the same direction Little Dorrit seemed the least the quietest and weakest of Heaven s creatures Let me put you in a coach said Clennam very nearly adding my poor child She hurriedly declined saying that wet or dry made little difference to her she was used to go about in all weathers He knew it to be so and was touched with more pity thinking of the slight figure at his side making its nightly way through the damp dark boisterous streets to such a place of rest You spoke so feelingly to me last night sir and I found afterwards that you had been so generous to my father that I could not resist your message if it was only to thank you especially as I wished very much to say to you she hesitated and trembled and tears rose in her eyes but did not fall To say to me That I hope you will not misunderstand my father Don t judge him sir as you would judge others outside the gates He has been there so long I never saw him outside but I can understand that he must have grown different in some things since My thoughts will never be unjust or harsh towards him believe me Not she said with a prouder air as the misgiving evidently crept upon her that she might seem to be abandoning him not that he has anything to be ashamed of for himself or that I have anything to be ashamed of for him He only requires to be understood I only ask for him that his life may be fairly remembered All that he said was quite true It all happened just as he related it He is very much respected Everybody who comes in is glad to know him He is more courted than anyone else He is far more thought of than the Marshal is If ever pride were innocent it was innocent in Little Dorrit when she grew boastful of her father It is often said that his manners are a true gentleman s and quite a study I see none like them in that place but he is admitted to be superior to all the rest This is quite as much why they make him presents as because they know him to be needy He is not to be blamed for being in need poor love Who could be in prison a quarter of a century and be prosperous What affection in her words what compassion in her repressed tears what a great soul of fidelity within her how true the light that shed false brightness round him If I have found it best to conceal where my home is it is not because I am ashamed of him God forbid Nor am I so much ashamed of the place itself as might be supposed People are not bad because they come there I have known numbers of good persevering honest people come there through misfortune They are almost all kind hearted to one another And it would be ungrateful indeed in me to forget that I have had many quiet comfortable hours there that I had an excellent friend there when I was quite a baby who was very very fond of me that I have been taught there and have worked there and have slept soundly there I think it would be almost cowardly and cruel not to have some little attachment for it after all this She had relieved the faithful fulness of her heart and modestly said raising her eyes appealingly to her new friend s I did not mean to say so much nor have I ever but once spoken about this before But it seems to set it more right than it was last night I said I wished you had not followed me sir I don t wish it so much now unless you should think indeed I don t wish it at all unless I should have spoken so confusedly that that you can scarcely understand me which I am afraid may be the case He told her with perfect truth that it was not the case and putting himself between her and the sharp wind and rain sheltered her as well as he could I feel permitted now he said to ask you a little more concerning your father Has he many creditors Oh a great number I mean detaining creditors who keep him where he is Oh yes a great number Can you tell me I can get the information no doubt elsewhere if you cannot who is the most influential of them Little Dorrit said after considering a little that she used to hear long ago of mister Tite Barnacle as a man of great power He was a commissioner or a board or a trustee or something He lived in Grosvenor Square she thought or very near it He was under Government high in the Circumlocution Office She appeared to have acquired in her infancy some awful impression of the might of this formidable mister Tite Barnacle of Grosvenor Square or very near it and the Circumlocution Office which quite crushed her when she mentioned him It can do no harm thought Arthur if I see this mister Tite Barnacle The thought did not present itself so quietly but that her quickness intercepted it Ah said Little Dorrit shaking her head with the mild despair of a lifetime Many people used to think once of getting my poor father out but you don t know how hopeless it is She forgot to be shy at the moment in honestly warning him away from the sunken wreck he had a dream of raising and looked at him with eyes which assuredly in association with her patient face her fragile figure her spare dress and the wind and rain did not turn him from his purpose of helping her Even if it could be done said she and it never can be done now where could father live or how could he live I have often thought that if such a change could come it might be anything but a service to him now People might not think so well of him outside as they do there He might not be so gently dealt with outside as he is there He might not be so fit himself for the life outside as he is for that Here for the first time she could not restrain her tears from falling and the little thin hands he had watched when they were so busy trembled as they clasped each other It would be a new distress to him even to know that I earn a little money and that Fanny earns a little money He is so anxious about us you see feeling helplessly shut up there Such a good good father He let the little burst of feeling go by before he spoke It was soon gone She was not accustomed to think of herself or to trouble any one with her emotions He had but glanced away at the piles of city roofs and chimneys among which the smoke was rolling heavily and at the wilderness of masts on the river and the wilderness of steeples on the shore indistinctly mixed together in the stormy haze when she was again as quiet as if she had been plying her needle in his mother s room You would be glad to have your brother set at liberty Oh very very glad sir Well we will hope for him at least You told me last night of a friend you had His name was Plornish Little Dorrit said And where did Plornish live Plornish lived in Bleeding Heart Yard He was only a plasterer Little Dorrit said as a caution to him not to form high social expectations of Plornish He lived at the last house in Bleeding Heart Yard and his name was over a little gateway Arthur took down the address and gave her his He had now done all he sought to do for the present except that he wished to leave her with a reliance upon him and to have something like a promise from her that she would cherish it There is one friend he said putting up his pocketbook As I take you back you are going back Oh yes going straight home As I take you back the word home jarred upon him let me ask you to persuade yourself that you have another friend I make no professions and say no more You are truly kind to me sir I am sure I need no more They walked back through the miserable muddy streets and among the poor mean shops and were jostled by the crowds of dirty hucksters usual to a poor neighbourhood There was nothing by the short way that was pleasant to any of the five senses Yet it was not a common passage through common rain and mire and noise to Clennam having this little slender careful creature on his arm How young she seemed to him or how old he to her or what a secret either to the other in that beginning of the destined interweaving of their stories matters not here He thought of her having been born and bred among these scenes and shrinking through them now familiar yet misplaced he thought of her long acquaintance with the squalid needs of life and of her innocence of her solicitude for others and her few years and her childish aspect They were come into the High Street where the prison stood when a voice cried Little mother little mother Little Dorrit stopping and looking back an excited figure of a strange kind bounced against them still crying little mother fell down and scattered the contents of a large basket filled with potatoes in the mud Oh Maggy said Little Dorrit what a clumsy child you are Maggy was not hurt but picked herself up immediately and then began to pick up the potatoes in which both Little Dorrit and Arthur Clennam helped Maggy picked up very few potatoes and a great quantity of mud but they were all recovered and deposited in the basket Maggy then smeared her muddy face with her shawl and presenting it to mister Clennam as a type of purity enabled him to see what she was like She was about eight and twenty with large bones large features large feet and hands large eyes and no hair Her large eyes were limpid and almost colourless they seemed to be very little affected by light and to stand unnaturally still There was also that attentive listening expression in her face which is seen in the faces of the blind but she was not blind having one tolerably serviceable eye Her face was not exceedingly ugly though it was only redeemed from being so by a smile a good humoured smile and pleasant in itself but rendered pitiable by being constantly there A great white cap with a quantity of opaque frilling that was always flapping about apologised for Maggy s baldness and made it so very difficult for her old black bonnet to retain its place upon her head that it held on round her neck like a gipsy s baby A commission of haberdashers could alone have reported what the rest of her poor dress was made of but it had a strong general resemblance to seaweed with here and there a gigantic tea leaf Her shawl looked particularly like a tea leaf after long infusion Arthur Clennam looked at Little Dorrit with the expression of one saying May I ask who this is Little Dorrit whose hand this Maggy still calling her little mother had begun to fondle answered in words they were under a gateway into which the majority of the potatoes had rolled This is Maggy sir Maggy sir echoed the personage presented Little mother She is the grand daughter said Little Dorrit Grand daughter echoed Maggy Of my old nurse who has been dead a long time Maggy how old are you Ten mother said Maggy You can t think how good she is sir said Little Dorrit with infinite tenderness Good SHE is echoed Maggy transferring the pronoun in a most expressive way from herself to her little mother Or how clever said Little Dorrit She goes on errands as well as any one Maggy laughed And is as trustworthy as the Bank of England Maggy laughed She earns her own living entirely Entirely sir said Little Dorrit in a lower and triumphant tone Really does What is her history asked Clennam Think of that Maggy said Little Dorrit taking her two large hands and clapping them together A gentleman from thousands of miles away wanting to know your history My history cried Maggy Little mother She means me said Little Dorrit rather confused she is very much attached to me Her old grandmother was not so kind to her as she should have been was she Maggy Maggy shook her head made a drinking vessel of her clenched left hand drank out of it and said Gin Then beat an imaginary child and said Broom handles and pokers When Maggy was ten years old said Little Dorrit watching her face while she spoke she had a bad fever sir and she has never grown any older ever since Ten years old said Maggy nodding her head But what a nice hospital So comfortable wasn t it Oh so nice it was Such a Ev nly place She had never been at peace before sir said Little Dorrit turning towards Arthur for an instant and speaking low and she always runs off upon that Such beds there is there cried Maggy Such lemonades Such oranges Such d licious broth and wine Such Chicking Oh AIN T it a delightful place to go and stop at So Maggy stopped there as long as she could said Little Dorrit in her former tone of telling a child s story the tone designed for Maggy s ear and at last when she could stop there no longer she came out Then because she was never to be more than ten years old however long she lived However long she lived echoed Maggy And because she was very weak indeed was so weak that when she began to laugh she couldn t stop herself which was a great pity Maggy mighty grave of a sudden Her grandmother did not know what to do with her and for some years was very unkind to her indeed At length in course of time Maggy began to take pains to improve herself and to be very attentive and very industrious and by degrees was allowed to come in and out as often as she liked and got enough to do to support herself and does support herself And that said Little Dorrit clapping the two great hands together again is Maggy s history as Maggy knows Ah But Arthur would have known what was wanting to its completeness though he had never heard of the words Little mother though he had never seen the fondling of the small spare hand though he had had no sight for the tears now standing in the colourless eyes though he had had no hearing for the sob that checked the clumsy laugh The dirty gateway with the wind and rain whistling through it and the basket of muddy potatoes waiting to be spilt again or taken up never seemed the common hole it really was when he looked back to it by these lights Never never They were very near the end of their walk and they now came out of the gateway to finish it Nothing would serve Maggy but that they must stop at a grocer s window short of their destination for her to show her learning She could read after a sort and picked out the fat figures in the tickets of prices for the most part correctly She also stumbled with a large balance of success against her failures through various philanthropic recommendations to Try our Mixture Try our Family Black Try our Orange flavoured Pekoe challenging competition at the head of Flowery Teas and various cautions to the public against spurious establishments and adulterated articles When he saw how pleasure brought a rosy tint into Little Dorrit s face when Maggy made a hit he felt that he could have stood there making a library of the grocer s window until the rain and wind were tired The court yard received them at last and there he said goodbye to Little Dorrit Little as she had always looked she looked less than ever when he saw her going into the Marshalsea lodge passage the little mother attended by her big child The cage door opened and when the small bird reared in captivity had tamely fluttered in he saw it shut again and then he came away CHAPTER ten Containing the whole Science of Government The Circumlocution Office was as everybody knows without being told the most important Department under Government No public business of any kind could possibly be done at any time without the acquiescence of the Circumlocution Office Its finger was in the largest public pie and in the smallest public tart It was equally impossible to do the plainest right and to undo the plainest wrong without the express authority of the Circumlocution Office If another Gunpowder Plot had been discovered half an hour before the lighting of the match nobody would have been justified in saving the parliament until there had been half a score of boards half a bushel of minutes several sacks of official memoranda and a family vault full of ungrammatical correspondence on the part of the Circumlocution Office This glorious establishment had been early in the field when the one sublime principle involving the difficult art of governing a country was first distinctly revealed to statesmen It had been foremost to study that bright revelation and to carry its shining influence through the whole of the official proceedings Whatever was required to be done the Circumlocution Office was beforehand with all the public departments in the art of perceiving HOW NOT TO DO IT Through this delicate perception through the tact with which it invariably seized it and through the genius with which it always acted on it the Circumlocution Office had risen to overtop all the public departments and the public condition had risen to be what it was It is true that How not to do it was the great study and object of all public departments and professional politicians all round the Circumlocution Office It is true that every new premier and every new government coming in because they had upheld a certain thing as necessary to be done were no sooner come in than they applied their utmost faculties to discovering How not to do it It is true that from the moment when a general election was over every returned man who had been raving on hustings because it hadn t been done and who had been asking the friends of the honourable gentleman in the opposite interest on pain of impeachment to tell him why it hadn t been done and who had been asserting that it must be done and who had been pledging himself that it should be done began to devise How it was not to be done It is true that the debates of both Houses of Parliament the whole session through uniformly tended to the protracted deliberation How not to do it It is true that the royal speech at the opening of such session virtually said My lords and gentlemen you have a considerable stroke of work to do and you will please to retire to your respective chambers and discuss How not to do it It is true that the royal speech at the close of such session virtually said My lords and gentlemen you have through several laborious months been considering with great loyalty and patriotism How not to do it and you have found out and with the blessing of Providence upon the harvest natural not political I now dismiss you All this is true but the Circumlocution Office went beyond it Because the Circumlocution Office went on mechanically every day keeping this wonderful all sufficient wheel of statesmanship How not to do it in motion Because the Circumlocution Office was down upon any ill advised public servant who was going to do it or who appeared to be by any surprising accident in remote danger of doing it with a minute and a memorandum and a letter of instructions that extinguished him It was this spirit of national efficiency in the Circumlocution Office that had gradually led to its having something to do with everything Mechanicians natural philosophers soldiers sailors petitioners memorialists people with grievances people who wanted to prevent grievances people who wanted to redress grievances jobbing people jobbed people people who couldn t get rewarded for merit and people who couldn t get punished for demerit were all indiscriminately tucked up under the foolscap paper of the Circumlocution Office Numbers of people were lost in the Circumlocution Office Unfortunates with wrongs or with projects for the general welfare and they had better have had wrongs at first than have taken that bitter English recipe for certainly getting them who in slow lapse of time and agony had passed safely through other public departments who according to rule had been bullied in this over reached by that and evaded by the other got referred at last to the Circumlocution Office and never reappeared in the light of day Boards sat upon them secretaries minuted upon them commissioners gabbled about them clerks registered entered checked and ticked them off and they melted away In short all the business of the country went through the Circumlocution Office except the business that never came out of it and its name was Legion Sometimes angry spirits attacked the Circumlocution Office Sometimes parliamentary questions were asked about it and even parliamentary motions made or threatened about it by demagogues so low and ignorant as to hold that the real recipe of government was How to do it Then would the noble lord or right honourable gentleman in whose department it was to defend the Circumlocution Office put an orange in his pocket and make a regular field day of the occasion Then would he come down to that house with a slap upon the table and meet the honourable gentleman foot to foot Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that the Circumlocution Office not only was blameless in this matter but was commendable in this matter was extollable to the skies in this matter Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that although the Circumlocution Office was invariably right and wholly right it never was so right as in this matter Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that it would have been more to his honour more to his credit more to his good taste more to his good sense more to half the dictionary of commonplaces if he had left the Circumlocution Office alone and never approached this matter Then would he keep one eye upon a coach or crammer from the Circumlocution Office sitting below the bar and smash the honourable gentleman with the Circumlocution Office account of this matter And although one of two things always happened namely either that the Circumlocution Office had nothing to say and said it or that it had something to say of which the noble lord or right honourable gentleman blundered one half and forgot the other the Circumlocution Office was always voted immaculate by an accommodating majority Such a nursery of statesmen had the Department become in virtue of a long career of this nature that several solemn lords had attained the reputation of being quite unearthly prodigies of business solely from having practised How not to do it as the head of the Circumlocution Office As to the minor priests and acolytes of that temple the result of all this was that they stood divided into two classes and down to the junior messenger either believed in the Circumlocution Office as a heaven born institution that had an absolute right to do whatever it liked or took refuge in total infidelity and considered it a flagrant nuisance The Barnacle family had for some time helped to administer the Circumlocution Office The Tite Barnacle Branch indeed considered themselves in a general way as having vested rights in that direction and took it ill if any other family had much to say to it The Barnacles were a very high family and a very large family They were dispersed all over the public offices and held all sorts of public places Either the nation was under a load of obligation to the Barnacles or the Barnacles were under a load of obligation to the nation It was not quite unanimously settled which the Barnacles having their opinion the nation theirs The mister Tite Barnacle who at the period now in question usually coached or crammed the statesman at the head of the Circumlocution Office when that noble or right honourable individual sat a little uneasily in his saddle by reason of some vagabond making a tilt at him in a newspaper was more flush of blood than money As a Barnacle he had his place which was a snug thing enough and as a Barnacle he had of course put in his son Barnacle Junior in the office But he had intermarried with a branch of the Stiltstalkings who were also better endowed in a sanguineous point of view than with real or personal property and of this marriage there had been issue Barnacle junior and three young ladies What with the patrician requirements of Barnacle junior the three young ladies missus Tite Barnacle nee Stiltstalking and himself mister Tite Barnacle found the intervals between quarter day and quarter day rather longer than he could have desired a circumstance which he always attributed to the country s parsimony For mister Tite Barnacle mister Arthur Clennam made his fifth inquiry one day at the Circumlocution Office having on previous occasions awaited that gentleman successively in a hall a glass case a waiting room and a fire proof passage where the Department seemed to keep its wind On this occasion mister Barnacle was not engaged as he had been before with the noble prodigy at the head of the Department but was absent Barnacle Junior however was announced as a lesser star yet visible above the office horizon With Barnacle junior he signified his desire to confer and found that young gentleman singeing the calves of his legs at the parental fire and supporting his spine against the mantel shelf It was a comfortable room handsomely furnished in the higher official manner an presenting stately suggestions of the absent Barnacle in the thick carpet the leather covered desk to sit at the leather covered desk to stand at the formidable easy chair and hearth rug the interposed screen the torn up papers the dispatch boxes with little labels sticking out of them like medicine bottles or dead game the pervading smell of leather and mahogany and a general bamboozling air of How not to do it The present Barnacle holding mister Clennam s card in his hand had a youthful aspect and the fluffiest little whisker perhaps that ever was seen Such a downy tip was on his callow chin that he seemed half fledged like a young bird and a compassionate observer might have urged that if he had not singed the calves of his legs he would have died of cold He had a superior eye glass dangling round his neck but unfortunately had such flat orbits to his eyes and such limp little eyelids that it wouldn t stick in when he put it up but kept tumbling out against his waistcoat buttons with a click that discomposed him very much Oh I say Look here My father s not in the way and won t be in the way to day said Barnacle Junior Is this anything that I can do Click Eye glass down Barnacle Junior quite frightened and feeling all round himself but not able to find it You are very good said Arthur Clennam I wish however to see mister Barnacle But I say Look here You haven t got any appointment you know said Barnacle Junior By this time he had found the eye glass and put it up again No said Arthur Clennam That is what I wish to have But I say Look here Is this public business asked Barnacle junior Click Eye glass down again Barnacle Junior in that state of search after it that mister Clennam felt it useless to reply at present Is it said Barnacle junior taking heed of his visitor s brown face anything about Tonnage or that sort of thing Pausing for a reply he opened his right eye with his hand and stuck his glass in it in that inflammatory manner that his eye began watering dreadfully No said Arthur it is nothing about tonnage Then look here Is it private business I really am not sure It relates to a mister Dorrit Look here I tell you what You had better call at our house if you are going that way Twenty four Mews Street Grosvenor Square My father s got a slight touch of the gout and is kept at home by it The misguided young Barnacle evidently going blind on his eye glass side but ashamed to make any further alteration in his painful arrangements Thank you I will call there now Good morning Young Barnacle seemed discomfited at this as not having at all expected him to go You are quite sure said Barnacle junior calling after him when he got to the door unwilling wholly to relinquish the bright business idea he had conceived that it s nothing about Tonnage Quite sure With such assurance and rather wondering what might have taken place if it HAD been anything about tonnage mister Clennam withdrew to pursue his inquiries Mews Street Grosvenor Square was not absolutely Grosvenor Square itself but it was very near it It was a hideous little street of dead wall stables and dunghills with lofts over coach houses inhabited by coachmen s families who had a passion for drying clothes and decorating their window sills with miniature turnpike gates The principal chimney sweep of that fashionable quarter lived at the blind end of Mews Street and the same corner contained an establishment much frequented about early morning and twilight for the purchase of wine bottles and kitchen stuff Punch s shows used to lean against the dead wall in Mews Street while their proprietors were dining elsewhere and the dogs of the neighbourhood made appointments to meet in the same locality Yet there were two or three small airless houses at the entrance end of Mews Street which went at enormous rents on account of their being abject hangers on to a fashionable situation and whenever one of these fearful little coops was to be let which seldom happened for they were in great request the house agent advertised it as a gentlemanly residence in the most aristocratic part of town inhabited solely by the elite of the beau monde If a gentlemanly residence coming strictly within this narrow margin had not been essential to the blood of the Barnacles this particular branch would have had a pretty wide selection among let us say ten thousand houses offering fifty times the accommodation for a third of the money As it was mister Barnacle finding his gentlemanly residence extremely inconvenient and extremely dear always laid it as a public servant at the door of the country and adduced it as another instance of the country s parsimony Arthur Clennam came to a squeezed house with a ramshackle bowed front little dingy windows and a little dark area like a damp waistcoat pocket which he found to be number twenty four Mews Street Grosvenor Square To the sense of smell the house was like a sort of bottle filled with a strong distillation of Mews and when the footman opened the door he seemed to take the stopper out The footman was to the Grosvenor Square footmen what the house was to the Grosvenor Square houses Admirable in his way his way was a back and a bye way His gorgeousness was not unmixed with dirt and both in complexion and consistency he had suffered from the closeness of his pantry A sallow flabbiness was upon him when he took the stopper out and presented the bottle to mister Clennam s nose Be so good as to give that card to mister Tite Barnacle and to say that I have just now seen the younger mister Barnacle who recommended me to call here The footman who had as many large buttons with the Barnacle crest upon them on the flaps of his pockets as if he were the family strong box and carried the plate and jewels about with him buttoned up pondered over the card a little then said Walk in It required some judgment to do it without butting the inner hall door open and in the consequent mental confusion and physical darkness slipping down the kitchen stairs The visitor however brought himself up safely on the door mat Still the footman said Walk in so the visitor followed him At the inner hall door another bottle seemed to be presented and another stopper taken out This second vial appeared to be filled with concentrated provisions and extract of Sink from the pantry After a skirmish in the narrow passage occasioned by the footman s opening the door of the dismal dining room with confidence finding some one there with consternation and backing on the visitor with disorder the visitor was shut up pending his announcement in a close back parlour There he had an opportunity of refreshing himself with both the bottles at once looking out at a low blinding wall three feet off and speculating on the number of Barnacle families within the bills of mortality who lived in such hutches of their own free flunkey choice mister Barnacle would see him Would he walk up stairs He would and he did and in the drawing room with his leg on a rest he found mister Barnacle himself the express image and presentment of How not to do it mister Barnacle dated from a better time when the country was not so parsimonious and the Circumlocution Office was not so badgered He wound and wound folds of white cravat round his neck as he wound and wound folds of tape and paper round the neck of the country His wristbands and collar were oppressive his voice and manner were oppressive He had a large watch chain and bunch of seals a coat buttoned up to inconvenience a waistcoat buttoned up to inconvenience an unwrinkled pair of trousers a stiff pair of boots He was altogether splendid massive overpowering and impracticable He seemed to have been sitting for his portrait to Sir Thomas Lawrence all the days of his life mister Clennam said mister Barnacle Be seated mister Clennam became seated You have called on me I believe said mister Barnacle at the Circumlocution giving it the air of a word of about five and twenty syllables Office I have taken that liberty mister Barnacle solemnly bent his head as who should say I do not deny that it is a liberty proceed to take another liberty and let me know your business Allow me to observe that I have been for some years in China am quite a stranger at home and have no personal motive or interest in the inquiry I am about to make mister Barnacle tapped his fingers on the table and as if he were now sitting for his portrait to a new and strange artist appeared to say to his visitor If you will be good enough to take me with my present lofty expression I shall feel obliged I have found a debtor in the Marshalsea Prison of the name of Dorrit who has been there many years I wish to investigate his confused affairs so far as to ascertain whether it may not be possible after this lapse of time to ameliorate his unhappy condition The name of mister Tite Barnacle has been mentioned to me as representing some highly influential interest among his creditors Am I correctly informed It being one of the principles of the Circumlocution Office never on any account whatever to give a straightforward answer mister Barnacle said Possibly On behalf of the Crown may I ask or as private individual The Circumlocution Department sir mister Barnacle replied may have possibly recommended possibly I cannot say that some public claim against the insolvent estate of a firm or copartnership to which this person may have belonged should be enforced The question may have been in the course of official business referred to the Circumlocution Department for its consideration The Department may have either originated or confirmed a Minute making that recommendation I assume this to be the case then The Circumlocution Department said mister Barnacle is not responsible for any gentleman s assumptions May I inquire how I can obtain official information as to the real state of the case It is competent said mister Barnacle to any member of the Public mentioning that obscure body with reluctance as his natural enemy to memorialise the Circumlocution Department Such formalities as are required to be observed in so doing may be known on application to the proper branch of that Department Which is the proper branch I must refer you returned mister Barnacle ringing the bell to the Department itself for a formal answer to that inquiry Excuse my mentioning The Department is accessible to the Public mister Barnacle was always checked a little by that word of impertinent signification if the Public approaches it according to the official forms if the Public does not approach it according to the official forms the Public has itself to blame mister Barnacle made him a severe bow as a wounded man of family a wounded man of place and a wounded man of a gentlemanly residence all rolled into one and he made mister Barnacle a bow and was shut out into Mews Street by the flabby footman Having got to this pass he resolved as an exercise in perseverance to betake himself again to the Circumlocution Office and try what satisfaction he could get there So he went back to the Circumlocution Office and once more sent up his card to Barnacle junior by a messenger who took it very ill indeed that he should come back again and who was eating mashed potatoes and gravy behind a partition by the hall fire He was readmitted to the presence of Barnacle junior and found that young gentleman singeing his knees now and gaping his weary way on to four o clock I say Look here You stick to us in a devil of a manner Said Barnacle junior looking over his shoulder I want to know Look here Upon my soul you mustn t come into the place saying you want to know you know remonstrated Barnacle junior turning about and putting up the eye glass I want to know said Arthur Clennam who had made up his mind to persistence in one short form of words the precise nature of the claim of the Crown against a prisoner for debt named Dorrit I say Look here You really are going it at a great pace you know Egad you haven t got an appointment said Barnacle junior as if the thing were growing serious I want to know said Arthur and repeated his case Barnacle junior stared at him until his eye glass fell out and then put it in again and stared at him until it fell out again You have no right to come this sort of move he then observed with the greatest weakness Look here What do you mean You told me you didn t know whether it was public business or not I have now ascertained that it is public business returned the suitor and I want to know and again repeated his monotonous inquiry Its effect upon young Barnacle was to make him repeat in a defenceless way Look here Upon my SOUL you mustn t come into the place saying you want to know you know The effect of that upon Arthur Clennam was to make him repeat his inquiry in exactly the same words and tone as before The effect of that upon young Barnacle was to make him a wonderful spectacle of failure and helplessness Well I tell you what Look here You had better try the Secretarial Department he said at last sidling to the bell and ringing it Jenkinson to the mashed potatoes messenger mister Wobbler Arthur Clennam who now felt that he had devoted himself to the storming of the Circumlocution Office and must go through with it accompanied the messenger to another floor of the building where that functionary pointed out mister Wobbler s room He entered that apartment and found two gentlemen sitting face to face at a large and easy desk one of whom was polishing a gun barrel on his pocket handkerchief while the other was spreading marmalade on bread with a paper knife mister Wobbler inquired the suitor Both gentlemen glanced at him and seemed surprised at his assurance So he went said the gentleman with the gun barrel who was an extremely deliberate speaker down to his cousin s place and took the Dog with him by rail Inestimable Dog Flew at the porter fellow when he was put into the dog box and flew at the guard when he was taken out He got half a dozen fellows into a Barn and a good supply of Rats and timed the Dog Finding the Dog able to do it immensely made the match and heavily backed the Dog When the match came off some devil of a fellow was bought over Sir Dog was made drunk Dog s master was cleaned out mister Wobbler inquired the suitor The gentleman who was spreading the marmalade returned without looking up from that occupation What did he call the Dog Called him Lovely said the other gentleman Said the Dog was the perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations Found him particularly like her when hocussed mister Wobbler said the suitor Both gentlemen laughed for some time The gentleman with the gun barrel considering it on inspection in a satisfactory state referred it to the other receiving confirmation of his views he fitted it into its place in the case before him and took out the stock and polished that softly whistling mister Wobbler said the suitor What s the matter then said mister Wobbler with his mouth full I want to know and Arthur Clennam again mechanically set forth what he wanted to know Can t inform you observed mister Wobbler apparently to his lunch Never heard of it Nothing at all to do with it Better try mister Clive second door on the left in the next passage Perhaps he will give me the same answer Very likely Don t know anything about it said mister Wobbler The suitor turned away and had left the room when the gentleman with the gun called out Mister Hallo He looked in again Shut the door after you You re letting in a devil of a draught here A few steps brought him to the second door on the left in the next passage In that room he found three gentlemen number one doing nothing particular number two doing nothing particular number three doing nothing particular They seemed however to be more directly concerned than the others had been in the effective execution of the great principle of the office as there was an awful inner apartment with a double door in which the Circumlocution Sages appeared to be assembled in council and out of which there was an imposing coming of papers and into which there was an imposing going of papers almost constantly wherein another gentleman number four was the active instrument I want to know said Arthur Clennam and again stated his case in the same barrel organ way As number one referred him to number two and as number two referred him to number three he had occasion to state it three times before they all referred him to number four to whom he stated it again Number four was a vivacious well looking well dressed agreeable young fellow he was a Barnacle but on the more sprightly side of the family and he said in an easy way Oh you had better not bother yourself about it I think Not bother myself about it No I recommend you not to bother yourself about it This was such a new point of view that Arthur Clennam found himself at a loss how to receive it You can if you like I can give you plenty of forms to fill up Lots of em here You can have a dozen if you like But you ll never go on with it said number four Would it be such hopeless work Excuse me I am a stranger in England I don t say it would be hopeless returned number four with a frank smile I don t express an opinion about that I only express an opinion about you I don t think you d go on with it However of course you can do as you like I suppose there was a failure in the performance of a contract or something of that kind was there I really don t know Well That you can find out Then you ll find out what Department the contract was in and then you ll find out all about it there I beg your pardon How shall I find out Why you ll you ll ask till they tell you Then you ll memorialise that Department according to regular forms which you ll find out for leave to memorialise this Department If you get it which you may after a time that memorial must be entered in that Department sent to be registered in this Department sent back to be signed by that Department sent back to be countersigned by this Department and then it will begin to be regularly before that Department You ll find out when the business passes through each of these stages by asking at both Departments till they tell you But surely this is not the way to do the business Arthur Clennam could not help saying This airy young Barnacle was quite entertained by his simplicity in supposing for a moment that it was This light in hand young Barnacle knew perfectly that it was not This touch and go young Barnacle had got up the Department in a private secretaryship that he might be ready for any little bit of fat that came to hand and he fully understood the Department to be a politico diplomatic hocus pocus piece of machinery for the assistance of the nobs in keeping off the snobs This dashing young Barnacle in a word was likely to become a statesman and to make a figure When the business is regularly before that Department whatever it is pursued this bright young Barnacle then you can watch it from time to time through that Department When it comes regularly before this Department then you must watch it from time to time through this Department We shall have to refer it right and left and when we refer it anywhere then you ll have to look it up When it comes back to us at any time then you had better look US up When it sticks anywhere you ll have to try to give it a jog When you write to another Department about it and then to this Department about it and don t hear anything satisfactory about it why then you had better keep on writing Arthur Clennam looked very doubtful indeed But I am obliged to you at any rate said he for your politeness Not at all replied this engaging young Barnacle Try the thing and see how you like it It will be in your power to give it up at any time if you don t like it You had better take a lot of forms away with you Give him a lot of forms With which instruction to number two this sparkling young Barnacle took a fresh handful of papers from numbers one and three and carried them into the sanctuary to offer to the presiding Idol of the Circumlocution Office Arthur Clennam put his forms in his pocket gloomily enough and went his way down the long stone passage and the long stone staircase He had come to the swing doors leading into the street and was waiting not over patiently for two people who were between him and them to pass out and let him follow when the voice of one of them struck familiarly on his ear He looked at the speaker and recognised mister Meagles mister Meagles was very red in the face redder than travel could have made him and collaring a short man who was with him said come out you rascal come Out It was such an unexpected hearing and it was also such an unexpected sight to see mister Meagles burst the swing doors open and emerge into the street with the short man who was of an unoffending appearance that Clennam stood still for the moment exchanging looks of surprise with the porter He followed however quickly and saw mister Meagles going down the street with his enemy at his side He soon came up with his old travelling companion and touched him on the back The choleric face which mister Meagles turned upon him smoothed when he saw who it was and he put out his friendly hand How are you said mister Meagles How d ye do I have only just come over from abroad I am glad to see you And I am rejoiced to see you Thank ee Thank ee missus Meagles and your daughter Are as well as possible said mister Meagles I only wish you had come upon me in a more prepossessing condition as to coolness Though it was anything but a hot day mister Meagles was in a heated state that attracted the attention of the passersby more particularly as he leaned his back against a railing took off his hat and cravat and heartily rubbed his steaming head and face and his reddened ears and neck without the least regard for public opinion Whew said mister Meagles dressing again That s comfortable Now I am cooler You have been ruffled mister Meagles What is the matter Wait a bit and I ll tell you Have you leisure for a turn in the Park As much as you please Come along then Ah you may well look at him He happened to have turned his eyes towards the offender whom mister Meagles had so angrily collared He s something to look at that fellow is He was not much to look at either in point of size or in point of dress being merely a short square practical looking man whose hair had turned grey and in whose face and forehead there were deep lines of cogitation which looked as though they were carved in hard wood He was dressed in decent black a little rusty and had the appearance of a sagacious master in some handicraft He had a spectacle case in his hand which he turned over and over while he was thus in question with a certain free use of the thumb that is never seen but in a hand accustomed to tools You keep with us said mister Meagles in a threatening kind of Way and I ll introduce you presently Now then Clennam wondered within himself as they took the nearest way to the Park what this unknown who complied in the gentlest manner could have been doing His appearance did not at all justify the suspicion that he had been detected in designs on mister Meagles s pocket handkerchief nor had he any appearance of being quarrelsome or violent He was a quiet plain steady man made no attempt to escape and seemed a little depressed but neither ashamed nor repentant If he were a criminal offender he must surely be an incorrigible hypocrite and if he were no offender why should mister Meagles have collared him in the Circumlocution Office He perceived that the man was not a difficulty in his own mind alone but in mister Meagles s too for such conversation as they had together on the short way to the Park was by no means well sustained and mister Meagles s eye always wandered back to the man even when he spoke of something very different At length they being among the trees mister Meagles stopped short and said mister Clennam will you do me the favour to look at this man His name is Doyce Daniel Doyce You wouldn t suppose this man to be a notorious rascal would you I certainly should not It was really a disconcerting question with the man there No You would not I know you would not You wouldn t suppose him to be a public offender would you No No But he is He is a public offender What has he been guilty of Murder manslaughter arson forgery swindling house breaking highway robbery larceny conspiracy fraud Which should you say now I should say returned Arthur Clennam observing a faint smile in Daniel Doyce s face not one of them You are right said mister Meagles But he has been ingenious and he has been trying to turn his ingenuity to his country s service That makes him a public offender directly sir Arthur looked at the man himself who only shook his head This Doyce said mister Meagles is a smith and engineer He is not in a large way but he is well known as a very ingenious man A dozen years ago he perfects an invention involving a very curious secret process of great importance to his country and his fellow creatures I won t say how much money it cost him or how many years of his life he had been about it but he brought it to perfection a dozen years ago Wasn t it a dozen said mister Meagles addressing Doyce He is the most exasperating man in the world he never complains Yes Rather better than twelve years ago Rather better said mister Meagles you mean rather worse Well mister Clennam he addresses himself to the Government The moment he addresses himself to the Government he becomes a public offender Sir said mister Meagles in danger of making himself excessively hot again he ceases to be an innocent citizen and becomes a culprit He is treated from that instant as a man who has done some infernal action He is a man to be shirked put off brow beaten sneered at handed over by this highly connected young or old gentleman to that highly connected young or old gentleman and dodged back again he is a man with no rights in his own time or his own property a mere outlaw whom it is justifiable to get rid of anyhow a man to be worn out by all possible means It was not so difficult to believe after the morning s experience as mister Meagles supposed Don t stand there Doyce turning your spectacle case over and over cried mister Meagles but tell mister Clennam what you confessed to me I undoubtedly was made to feel said the inventor as if I had committed an offence In dancing attendance at the various offices I was always treated more or less as if it was a very bad offence I have frequently found it necessary to reflect for my own self support that I really had not done anything to bring myself into the Newgate Calendar but only wanted to effect a great saving and a great improvement There said mister Meagles Judge whether I exaggerate Now you ll be able to believe me when I tell you the rest of the case With this prelude mister Meagles went through the narrative the established narrative which has become tiresome the matter of course narrative which we all know by heart How after interminable attendance and correspondence after infinite impertinences ignorances and insults my lords made a Minute number three thousand four hundred and seventy two allowing the culprit to make certain trials of his invention at his own expense How the trials were made in the presence of a board of six of whom two ancient members were too blind to see it two other ancient members were too deaf to hear it one other ancient member was too lame to get near it and the final ancient member was too pig headed to look at it How there were more years more impertinences ignorances and insults How my lords then made a Minute number five thousand one hundred and three whereby they resigned the business to the Circumlocution Office How the Circumlocution Office in course of time took up the business as if it were a bran new thing of yesterday which had never been heard of before muddled the business addled the business tossed the business in a wet blanket How the impertinences ignorances and insults went through the multiplication table How there was a reference of the invention to three Barnacles and a Stiltstalking who knew nothing about it into whose heads nothing could be hammered about it who got bored about it and reported physical impossibilities about it How the Circumlocution Office in a Minute number eight thousand seven hundred and forty saw no reason to reverse the decision at which my lords had arrived How the Circumlocution Office being reminded that my lords had arrived at no decision shelved the business How there had been a final interview with the head of the Circumlocution Office that very morning and how the Brazen Head had spoken and had been upon the whole and under all the circumstances and looking at it from the various points of view of opinion that one of two courses was to be pursued in respect of the business that was to say either to leave it alone for evermore or to begin it all over again Upon which said mister Meagles as a practical man I then and there in that presence took Doyce by the collar and told him it was plain to me that he was an infamous rascal and treasonable disturber of the government peace and took him away I brought him out of the office door by the collar that the very porter might know I was a practical man who appreciated the official estimate of such characters and here we are If that airy young Barnacle had been there he would have frankly told them perhaps that the Circumlocution Office had achieved its function That what the Barnacles had to do was to stick on to the national ship as long as they could That to trim the ship lighten the ship clean the ship would be to knock them off that they could but be knocked off once and that if the ship went down with them yet sticking to it that was the ship s look out and not theirs There said mister Meagles now you know all about Doyce Except which I own does not improve my state of mind that even now you don t hear him complain You must have great patience said Arthur Clennam looking at him with some wonder great forbearance No he returned I don t know that I have more than another man By the Lord you have more than I have though cried mister Meagles Doyce smiled as he said to Clennam You see my experience of these things does not begin with myself It has been in my way to know a little about them from time to time Mine is not a particular case I am not worse used than a hundred others who have put themselves in the same position than all the others I was going to say I don t know that I should find that a consolation if it were my case but I am very glad that you do Understand me I don t say he replied in his steady planning way and looking into the distance before him as if his grey eye were measuring it that it s recompense for a man s toil and hope but it s a certain sort of relief to know that I might have counted on this He spoke in that quiet deliberate manner and in that undertone which is often observable in mechanics who consider and adjust with great nicety It belonged to him like his suppleness of thumb or his peculiar way of tilting up his hat at the back every now and then as if he were contemplating some half finished work of his hand and thinking about it Disappointed he went on as he walked between them under the trees Yes No doubt I am disappointed Hurt Yes No doubt I am hurt That s only natural But what I mean when I say that people who put themselves in the same position are mostly used in the same way In England said mister Meagles Oh of course I mean in England When they take their inventions into foreign countries that s quite different And that s the reason why so many go there mister Meagles very hot indeed again What I mean is that however this comes to be the regular way of our government it is its regular way Have you ever heard of any projector or inventor who failed to find it all but inaccessible and whom it did not discourage and ill treat I cannot say that I ever have Have you ever known it to be beforehand in the adoption of any useful thing Ever known it to set an example of any useful kind I am a good deal older than my friend here said mister Meagles and I ll answer that Never But we all three have known I expect said the inventor a pretty many cases of its fixed determination to be miles upon miles and years upon years behind the rest of us and of its being found out persisting in the use of things long superseded even after the better things were well known and generally taken up They all agreed upon that Well then said Doyce with a sigh as I know what such a metal will do at such a temperature and such a body under such a pressure so I may know if I will only consider how these great lords and gentlemen will certainly deal with such a matter as mine I have no right to be surprised with a head upon my shoulders and memory in it that I fall into the ranks with all who came before me I ought to have let it alone I have had warning enough I am sure With that he put up his spectacle case and said to Arthur If I don t complain mister Clennam I can feel gratitude and I assure you that I feel it towards our mutual friend Many s the day and many s the way in which he has backed me Stuff and nonsense said mister Meagles Arthur could not but glance at Daniel Doyce in the ensuing silence Though it was evidently in the grain of his character and of his respect for his own case that he should abstain from idle murmuring it was evident that he had grown the older the sterner and the poorer for his long endeavour He could not but think what a blessed thing it would have been for this man if he had taken a lesson from the gentlemen who were so kind as to take a nation s affairs in charge and had learnt How not to do it mister Meagles was hot and despondent for about five minutes and then began to cool and clear up Come come said he We shall not make this the better by being grim Where do you think of going Dan I shall go back to the factory said Dan Why then we ll all go back to the factory or walk in that direction returned mister Meagles cheerfully mister Clennam won t be deterred by its being in Bleeding Heart Yard Bleeding Heart Yard said Clennam I want to go there So much the better cried mister Meagles Come along As they went along certainly one of the party and probably more than one thought that Bleeding Heart Yard was no inappropriate destination for a man who had been in official correspondence with my lords and the Barnacles and perhaps had a misgiving also that Britannia herself might come to look for lodgings in Bleeding Heart Yard some ugly day or other if she over did the Circumlocution Office CHAPTER eleven Let Loose A late dull autumn night was closing in upon the river Saone The stream like a sullied looking glass in a gloomy place reflected the clouds heavily and the low banks leaned over here and there as if they were half curious and half afraid to see their darkening pictures in the water The flat expanse of country about Chalons lay a long heavy streak occasionally made a little ragged by a row of poplar trees against the wrathful sunset On the banks of the river Saone it was wet depressing solitary and the night deepened fast One man slowly moving on towards Chalons was the only visible figure in the landscape Cain might have looked as lonely and avoided With an old sheepskin knapsack at his back and a rough unbarked stick cut out of some wood in his hand miry footsore his shoes and gaiters trodden out his hair and beard untrimmed the cloak he carried over his shoulder and the clothes he wore sodden with wet limping along in pain and difficulty he looked as if the clouds were hurrying from him as if the wail of the wind and the shuddering of the grass were directed against him as if the low mysterious plashing of the water murmured at him as if the fitful autumn night were disturbed by him He glanced here and he glanced there sullenly but shrinkingly and sometimes stopped and turned about and looked all round him Then he limped on again toiling and muttering To the devil with this plain that has no end To the devil with these stones that cut like knives To the devil with this dismal darkness wrapping itself about one with a chill I hate you And he would have visited his hatred upon it all with the scowl he threw about him if he could He trudged a little further and looking into the distance before him stopped again I hungry thirsty weary You imbeciles where the lights are yonder eating and drinking and warming yourselves at fires I wish I had the sacking of your town I would repay you my children But the teeth he set at the town and the hand he shook at the town brought the town no nearer and the man was yet hungrier and thirstier and wearier when his feet were on its jagged pavement and he stood looking about him There was the hotel with its gateway and its savoury smell of cooking there was the cafe with its bright windows and its rattling of dominoes there was the dyer s with its strips of red cloth on the doorposts there was the silversmith s with its earrings and its offerings for altars there was the tobacco dealer s with its lively group of soldier customers coming out pipe in mouth there were the bad odours of the town and the rain and the refuse in the kennels and the faint lamps slung across the road and the huge Diligence and its mountain of luggage and its six grey horses with their tails tied up getting under weigh at the coach office But no small cabaret for a straitened traveller being within sight he had to seek one round the dark corner where the cabbage leaves lay thickest trodden about the public cistern at which women had not yet left off drawing water There in the back street he found one the Break of Day The curtained windows clouded the Break of Day but it seemed light and warm and it announced in legible inscriptions with appropriate pictorial embellishment of billiard cue and ball that at the Break of Day one could play billiards that there one could find meat drink and lodgings whether one came on horseback or came on foot and that it kept good wines liqueurs and brandy The man turned the handle of the Break of Day door and limped in He touched his discoloured slouched hat as he came in at the door to a few men who occupied the room Two were playing dominoes at one of the little tables three or four were seated round the stove conversing as they smoked the billiard table in the centre was left alone for the time the landlady of the Daybreak sat behind her little counter among her cloudy bottles of syrups baskets of cakes and leaden drainage for glasses working at her needle Making his way to an empty little table in a corner of the room behind the stove he put down his knapsack and his cloak upon the ground As he raised his head from stooping to do so he found the landlady beside him One can lodge here to night madame Perfectly said the landlady in a high sing song cheery voice Good One can dine sup what you please to call it Ah perfectly cried the landlady as before Dispatch then madame if you please Something to eat as quickly as you can and some wine at once I am exhausted It is very bad weather monsieur said the landlady Cursed weather And a very long road A cursed road His hoarse voice failed him and he rested his head upon his hands until a bottle of wine was brought from the counter Having filled and emptied his little tumbler twice and having broken off an end from the great loaf that was set before him with his cloth and napkin soup plate salt pepper and oil he rested his back against the corner of the wall made a couch of the bench on which he sat and began to chew crust until such time as his repast should be ready There had been that momentary interruption of the talk about the stove and that temporary inattention to and distraction from one another which is usually inseparable in such a company from the arrival of a stranger It had passed over by this time and the men had done glancing at him and were talking again That s the true reason said one of them bringing a story he had been telling to a close that s the true reason why they said that the devil was let loose The speaker was the tall Swiss belonging to the church and he brought something of the authority of the church into the discussion especially as the devil was in question The landlady having given her directions for the new guest s entertainment to her husband who acted as cook to the Break of Day had resumed her needlework behind her counter She was a smart neat bright little woman with a good deal of cap and a good deal of stocking and she struck into the conversation with several laughing nods of her head but without looking up from her work Ah Heaven then said she When the boat came up from Lyons and brought the news that the devil was actually let loose at Marseilles some fly catchers swallowed it But I No not I Madame you are always right returned the tall Swiss Doubtless you were enraged against that man madame Ay yes then cried the landlady raising her eyes from her work opening them very wide and tossing her head on one side Naturally yes He was a bad subject He was a wicked wretch said the landlady and well merited what he had the good fortune to escape So much the worse Stay madame Let us see returned the Swiss argumentatively turning his cigar between his lips It may have been his unfortunate destiny He may have been the child of circumstances It is always possible that he had and has good in him if one did but know how to find it out Philosophical philanthropy teaches The rest of the little knot about the stove murmured an objection to the introduction of that threatening expression Even the two players at dominoes glanced up from their game as if to protest against philosophical philanthropy being brought by name into the Break of Day Hold there you and your philanthropy cried the smiling landlady nodding her head more than ever Listen then I am a woman I I know nothing of philosophical philanthropy But I know what I have seen and what I have looked in the face in this world here where I find myself And I tell you this my friend that there are people men and women both unfortunately who have no good in them none That there are people whom it is necessary to detest without compromise That there are people who must be dealt with as enemies of the human race That there are people who have no human heart and who must be crushed like savage beasts and cleared out of the way They are but few I hope but I have seen in this world here where I find myself and even at the little Break of Day that there are such people And I do not doubt that this man whatever they call him I forget his name is one of them The landlady s lively speech was received with greater favour at the Break of Day than it would have elicited from certain amiable whitewashers of the class she so unreasonably objected to nearer Great Britain My faith If your philosophical philanthropy said the landlady putting down her work and rising to take the stranger s soup from her husband who appeared with it at a side door puts anybody at the mercy of such people by holding terms with them at all in words or deeds or both take it away from the Break of Day for it isn t worth a sou As she placed the soup before the guest who changed his attitude to a sitting one he looked her full in the face and his moustache went up under his nose and his nose came down over his moustache Well said the previous speaker let us come back to our subject Leaving all that aside gentlemen it was because the man was acquitted on his trial that people said at Marseilles that the devil was let loose That was how the phrase began to circulate and what it meant nothing more How do they call him said the landlady Biraud is it not Rigaud madame returned the tall Swiss Rigaud To be sure The traveller s soup was succeeded by a dish of meat and that by a dish of vegetables He ate all that was placed before him emptied his bottle of wine called for a glass of rum and smoked his cigarette with his cup of coffee As he became refreshed he became overbearing and patronised the company at the Daybreak in certain small talk at which he assisted as if his condition were far above his appearance The company might have had other engagements or they might have felt their inferiority but in any case they dispersed by degrees and not being replaced by other company left their new patron in possession of the Break of Day The landlord was clinking about in his kitchen the landlady was quiet at her work and the refreshed traveller sat smoking by the stove warming his ragged feet Pardon me madame that Biraud Rigaud monsieur Rigaud Pardon me again has contracted your displeasure how The landlady who had been at one moment thinking within herself that this was a handsome man at another moment that this was an ill looking man observed the nose coming down and the moustache going up and strongly inclined to the latter decision Rigaud was a criminal she said who had killed his wife Ay ay Death of my life that s a criminal indeed But how do you know it All the world knows it Hah And yet he escaped justice Monsieur the law could not prove it against him to its satisfaction So the law says Nevertheless all the world knows he did it The people knew it so well that they tried to tear him to pieces Being all in perfect accord with their own wives said the guest Haha The landlady of the Break of Day looked at him again and felt almost confirmed in her last decision He had a fine hand though and he turned it with a great show She began once more to think that he was not ill looking after all Did you mention madame or was it mentioned among the gentlemen what became of him The landlady shook her head it being the first conversational stage at which her vivacious earnestness had ceased to nod it keeping time to what she said It had been mentioned at the Daybreak she remarked on the authority of the journals that he had been kept in prison for his own safety However that might be he had escaped his deserts so much the worse The guest sat looking at her as he smoked out his final cigarette and as she sat with her head bent over her work with an expression that might have resolved her doubts and brought her to a lasting conclusion on the subject of his good or bad looks if she had seen it When she did look up the expression was not there The hand was smoothing his shaggy moustache May one ask to be shown to bed madame Very willingly monsieur Hola my husband My husband would conduct him up stairs There was one traveller there asleep who had gone to bed very early indeed being overpowered by fatigue but it was a large chamber with two beds in it and space enough for twenty This the landlady of the Break of Day chirpingly explained calling between whiles Hola my husband out at the side door My husband answered at length It is I my wife and presenting himself in his cook s cap lighted the traveller up a steep and narrow staircase the traveller carrying his own cloak and knapsack and bidding the landlady good night with a complimentary reference to the pleasure of seeing her again to morrow It was a large room with a rough splintery floor unplastered rafters overhead and two bedsteads on opposite sides Here my husband put down the candle he carried and with a sidelong look at his guest stooping over his knapsack gruffly gave him the instruction The bed to the right and left him to his repose The landlord whether he was a good or a bad physiognomist had fully made up his mind that the guest was an ill looking fellow The guest looked contemptuously at the clean coarse bedding prepared for him and sitting down on the rush chair at the bedside drew his money out of his pocket and told it over in his hand One must eat he muttered to himself but by Heaven I must eat at the cost of some other man to morrow As he sat pondering and mechanically weighing his money in his palm the deep breathing of the traveller in the other bed fell so regularly upon his hearing that it attracted his eyes in that direction The man was covered up warm and had drawn the white curtain at his head so that he could be only heard not seen But the deep regular breathing still going on while the other was taking off his worn shoes and gaiters and still continuing when he had laid aside his coat and cravat became at length a strong provocative to curiosity and incentive to get a glimpse of the sleeper s face The waking traveller therefore stole a little nearer and yet a little nearer and a little nearer to the sleeping traveller s bed until he stood close beside it Even then he could not see his face for he had drawn the sheet over it The regular breathing still continuing he put his smooth white hand such a treacherous hand it looked as it went creeping from him to the sheet and gently lifted it away Death of my soul he whispered falling back here s Cavalletto The little Italian previously influenced in his sleep perhaps by the stealthy presence at his bedside stopped in his regular breathing and with a long deep respiration opened his eyes At first they were not awake though open He lay for some seconds looking placidly at his old prison companion and then all at once with a cry of surprise and alarm sprang out of bed Hush What s the matter Keep quiet It s I You know me cried the other in a suppressed voice But John Baptist widely staring muttering a number of invocations and ejaculations tremblingly backing into a corner slipping on his trousers and tying his coat by the two sleeves round his neck manifested an unmistakable desire to escape by the door rather than renew the acquaintance Seeing this his old prison comrade fell back upon the door and set his shoulders against it Cavalletto Wake boy Rub your eyes and look at me Not the name you used to call me don t use that Lagnier say Lagnier John Baptist staring at him with eyes opened to their utmost width made a number of those national backhanded shakes of the right forefinger in the air as if he were resolved on negativing beforehand everything that the other could possibly advance during the whole term of his life Cavalletto Give me your hand You know Lagnier the gentleman Touch the hand of a gentleman Submitting himself to the old tone of condescending authority John Baptist not at all steady on his legs as yet advanced and put his hand in his patron s Monsieur Lagnier laughed and having given it a squeeze tossed it up and let it go Then you were faltered John Baptist Not shaved No See here cried Lagnier giving his head a twirl as tight on as your own John Baptist with a slight shiver looked all round the room as if to recall where he was His patron took that opportunity of turning the key in the door and then sat down upon his bed Look he said holding up his shoes and gaiters That s a poor trim for a gentleman you ll say No matter you shall see how Soon I ll mend it Come and sit down Take your old place John Baptist looking anything but reassured sat down on the floor at the bedside keeping his eyes upon his patron all the time That s well cried Lagnier Now we might be in the old infernal hole again hey How long have you been out Two days after you my master How do you come here I was cautioned not to stay there and so I left the town at once and since then I have changed about I have been doing odds and ends at Avignon at Pont Esprit at Lyons upon the Rhone upon the Saone As he spoke he rapidly mapped the places out with his sunburnt hand upon the floor And where are you going Going my master Ay John Baptist seemed to desire to evade the question without knowing how By Bacchus he said at last as if he were forced to the admission I have sometimes had a thought of going to Paris and perhaps to England Cavalletto This is in confidence I also am going to Paris and perhaps to England We ll go together The little man nodded his head and showed his teeth and yet seemed not quite convinced that it was a surpassingly desirable arrangement We ll go together repeated Lagnier You shall see how soon I will force myself to be recognised as a gentleman and you shall profit by it It is agreed Are we one Oh surely surely said the little man Then you shall hear before I sleep and in six words for I want sleep how I appear before you I Lagnier Remember that Not the other Altro altro Not Ri Before John Baptist could finish the name his comrade had got his hand under his chin and fiercely shut up his mouth Death what are you doing Do you want me to be trampled upon and stoned Do YOU want to be trampled upon and stoned You would be You don t imagine that they would set upon me and let my prison chum go Don t think it There was an expression in his face as he released his grip of his friend s jaw from which his friend inferred that if the course of events really came to any stoning and trampling Monsieur Lagnier would so distinguish him with his notice as to ensure his having his full share of it He remembered what a cosmopolitan gentleman Monsieur Lagnier was and how few weak distinctions he made I am a man said Monsieur Lagnier whom society has deeply wronged since you last saw me You know that I am sensitive and brave and that it is my character to govern How has society respected those qualities in me I have been shrieked at through the streets I have been guarded through the streets against men and especially women running at me armed with any weapons they could lay their hands on I have lain in prison for security with the place of my confinement kept a secret lest I should be torn out of it and felled by a hundred blows I have been carted out of Marseilles in the dead of night and carried leagues away from it packed in straw It has not been safe for me to go near my house and with a beggar s pittance in my pocket I have walked through vile mud and weather ever since until my feet are crippled look at them Such are the humiliations that society has inflicted upon me possessing the qualities I have mentioned and which you know me to possess But society shall pay for it All this he said in his companion s ear and with his hand before his lips Even here he went on in the same way even in this mean drinking shop society pursues me Madame defames me and her guests defame me I too a gentleman with manners and accomplishments to strike them dead But the wrongs society has heaped upon me are treasured in this breast To all of which John Baptist listening attentively to the suppressed hoarse voice said from time to time Surely surely tossing his head and shutting his eyes as if there were the clearest case against society that perfect candour could make out Put my shoes there continued Lagnier Hang my cloak to dry there by the door Take my hat He obeyed each instruction as it was given And this is the bed to which society consigns me is it Hah Very well As he stretched out his length upon it with a ragged handkerchief bound round his wicked head and only his wicked head showing above the bedclothes John Baptist was rather strongly reminded of what had so very nearly happened to prevent the moustache from any more going up as it did and the nose from any more coming down as it did Shaken out of destiny s dice box again into your company eh By Heaven So much the better for you You ll profit by it I shall need a long rest Let me sleep in the morning John Baptist replied that he should sleep as long as he would and wishing him a happy night put out the candle One might have Supposed that the next proceeding of the Italian would have been to undress but he did exactly the reverse and dressed himself from head to foot saving his shoes When he had so done he lay down upon his bed with some of its coverings over him and his coat still tied round his neck to get through the night When he started up the Godfather Break of Day was peeping at its namesake He rose took his shoes in his hand turned the key in the door with great caution and crept downstairs Nothing was astir there but the smell of coffee wine tobacco and syrups and madame s little counter looked ghastly enough But he had paid madame his little note at it over night and wanted to see nobody wanted nothing but to get on his shoes and his knapsack open the door and run away He prospered in his object No movement or voice was heard when he opened the door no wicked head tied up in a ragged handkerchief looked out of the upper window When the sun had raised his full disc above the flat line of the horizon and was striking fire out of the long muddy vista of paved road with its weary avenue of little trees a black speck moved along the road and splashed among the flaming pools of rain water which black speck was John Baptist Cavalletto running away from his patron CHAPTER twelve Bleeding Heart Yard In London itself though in the old rustic road towards a suburb of note where in the days of William Shakespeare author and stage player there were Royal hunting seats howbeit no sport is left there now but for hunters of men Bleeding Heart Yard was to be found a place much changed in feature and in fortune yet with some relish of ancient greatness about it Two or three mighty stacks of chimneys and a few large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions gave the Yard a character It was inhabited by poor people who set up their rest among its faded glories as Arabs of the desert pitch their tents among the fallen stones of the Pyramids but there was a family sentimental feeling prevalent in the Yard that it had a character As if the aspiring city had become puffed up in the very ground on which it stood the ground had so risen about Bleeding Heart Yard that you got into it down a flight of steps which formed no part of the original approach and got out of it by a low gateway into a maze of shabby streets which went about and about tortuously ascending to the level again At this end of the Yard and over the gateway was the factory of Daniel Doyce often heavily beating like a bleeding heart of iron with the clink of metal upon metal The opinion of the Yard was divided respecting the derivation of its name The more practical of its inmates abided by the tradition of a murder the gentler and more imaginative inhabitants including the whole of the tender sex were loyal to the legend of a young lady of former times closely imprisoned in her chamber by a cruel father for remaining true to her own true love and refusing to marry the suitor he chose for her The legend related how that the young lady used to be seen up at her window behind the bars murmuring a love lorn song of which the burden was Bleeding Heart Bleeding Heart bleeding away until she died It was objected by the murderous party that this Refrain was notoriously the invention of a tambour worker a spinster and romantic still lodging in the Yard But forasmuch as all favourite legends must be associated with the affections and as many more people fall in love than commit murder which it may be hoped howsoever bad we are will continue until the end of the world to be the dispensation under which we shall live the Bleeding Heart Bleeding Heart bleeding away story carried the day by a great majority Neither party would listen to the antiquaries who delivered learned lectures in the neighbourhood showing the Bleeding Heart to have been the heraldic cognisance of the old family to whom the property had once belonged And considering that the hour glass they turned from year to year was filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand the Bleeding Heart Yarders had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the one little golden grain of poetry that sparkled in it Down in to the Yard by way of the steps came Daniel Doyce mister Meagles and Clennam Passing along the Yard and between the open doors on either hand all abundantly garnished with light children nursing heavy ones they arrived at its opposite boundary the gateway Here Arthur Clennam stopped to look about him for the domicile of Plornish plasterer whose name according to the custom of Londoners Daniel Doyce had never seen or heard of to that hour It was plain enough nevertheless as Little Dorrit had said over a lime splashed gateway in the corner within which Plornish kept a ladder and a barrel or two The last house in Bleeding Heart Yard which she had described as his place of habitation was a large house let off to various tenants but Plornish ingeniously hinted that he lived in the parlour by means of a painted hand under his name the forefinger of which hand on which the artist had depicted a ring and a most elaborate nail of the genteelest form referred all inquirers to that apartment Parting from his companions after arranging another meeting with mister Meagles Clennam went alone into the entry and knocked with his knuckles at the parlour door It was opened presently by a woman with a child in her arms whose unoccupied hand was hastily rearranging the upper part of her dress This was missus Plornish and this maternal action was the action of missus Plornish during a large part of her waking existence Was mister Plornish at home Well sir said missus Plornish a civil woman not to deceive you he s gone to look for a job Not to deceive you was a method of speech with missus Plornish She would deceive you under any circumstances as little as might be but she had a trick of answering in this provisional form Do you think he will be back soon if I wait for him I have been expecting him said missus Plornish this half an hour at any minute of time Walk in sir Arthur entered the rather dark and close parlour though it was lofty too and sat down in the chair she placed for him Not to deceive you sir I notice it said missus Plornish and I take it kind of you He was at a loss to understand what she meant and by expressing as much in his looks elicited her explanation It ain t many that comes into a poor place that deems it worth their while to move their hats said missus Plornish But people think more of it than people think Clennam returned with an uncomfortable feeling in so very slight a courtesy being unusual Was that all And stooping down to pinch the cheek of another young child who was sitting on the floor staring at him asked missus Plornish how old that fine boy was Four year just turned sir said missus Plornish He IS a fine little fellow ain t he sir But this one is rather sickly She tenderly hushed the baby in her arms as she said it You wouldn t mind my asking if it happened to be a job as you was come about sir would you asked missus Plornish wistfully She asked it so anxiously that if he had been in possession of any kind of tenement he would have had it plastered a foot deep rather than answer No But he was obliged to answer No and he saw a shade of disappointment on her face as she checked a sigh and looked at the low fire Then he saw also that missus Plornish was a young woman made somewhat slatternly in herself and her belongings by poverty and so dragged at by poverty and the children together that their united forces had already dragged her face into wrinkles All such things as jobs said missus Plornish seems to me to have gone underground they do indeed Herein missus Plornish limited her remark to the plastering trade and spoke without reference to the Circumlocution Office and the Barnacle Family Is it so difficult to get work asked Arthur Clennam Plornish finds it so she returned He is quite unfortunate Really he is Really he was He was one of those many wayfarers on the road of life who seem to be afflicted with supernatural corns rendering it impossible for them to keep up even with their lame competitors A willing working soft hearted not hard headed fellow Plornish took his fortune as smoothly as could be expected but it was a rough one It so rarely happened that anybody seemed to want him it was such an exceptional case when his powers were in any request that his misty mind could not make out how it happened He took it as it came therefore he tumbled into all kinds of difficulties and tumbled out of them and by tumbling through life got himself considerably bruised It s not for want of looking after jobs I am sure said missus Plornish lifting up her eyebrows and searching for a solution of the problem between the bars of the grate nor yet for want of working at them when they are to be got No one ever heard my husband complain of work Somehow or other this was the general misfortune of Bleeding Heart Yard From time to time there were public complaints pathetically going about of labour being scarce which certain people seemed to take extraordinarily ill as though they had an absolute right to it on their own terms but Bleeding Heart Yard though as willing a Yard as any in Britain was never the better for the demand That high old family the Barnacles had long been too busy with their great principle to look into the matter and indeed the matter had nothing to do with their watchfulness in out generalling all other high old families except the Stiltstalkings While missus Plornish spoke in these words of her absent lord her lord returned A smooth cheeked fresh coloured sandy whiskered man of thirty Long in the legs yielding at the knees foolish in the face flannel jacketed lime whitened This is Plornish sir I came said Clennam rising to beg the favour of a little conversation with you on the subject of the Dorrit family Plornish became suspicious Seemed to scent a creditor Said Ah yes Well He didn t know what satisfaction he could give any gentleman respecting that family What might it be about now I know you better said Clennam smiling than you suppose Plornish observed not Smiling in return And yet he hadn t the pleasure of being acquainted with the gentleman neither No said Arthur I know your kind offices at second hand but on the best authority through Little Dorrit I mean he explained Miss Dorrit mister Clennam is it Oh I ve heard of you Sir And I of you said Arthur Please to sit down again Sir and consider yourself welcome Why yes said Plornish taking a chair and lifting the elder child upon his knee that he might have the moral support of speaking to a stranger over his head I have been on the wrong side of the Lock myself and in that way we come to know Miss Dorrit Me and my wife we are well acquainted with Miss Dorrit Intimate cried missus Plornish Indeed she was so proud of the acquaintance that she had awakened some bitterness of spirit in the Yard by magnifying to an enormous amount the sum for which Miss Dorrit s father had become insolvent The Bleeding Hearts resented her claiming to know people of such distinction It was her father that I got acquainted with first And through getting acquainted with him you see why I got acquainted with her said Plornish tautologically I see Ah And there s manners There s polish There s a gentleman to have run to seed in the Marshalsea jail Why perhaps you are not aware said Plornish lowering his voice and speaking with a perverse admiration of what he ought to have pitied or despised not aware that Miss Dorrit and her sister dursn t let him know that they work for a living No said Plornish looking with a ridiculous triumph first at his wife and then all round the room Dursn t let him know it they dursn t Without admiring him for that Clennam quietly observed I am very sorry for him The remark appeared to suggest to Plornish for the first time that it might not be a very fine trait of character after all He pondered about it for a moment and gave it up As to me he resumed certainly mister Dorrit is as affable with me I am sure as I can possibly expect Considering the differences and distances betwixt us more so But it s Miss Dorrit that we were speaking of True Pray how did you introduce her at my mother s mister Plornish picked a bit of lime out of his whisker put it between his lips turned it with his tongue like a sugar plum considered found himself unequal to the task of lucid explanation and appealing to his wife said Sally you may as well mention how it was old woman Miss Dorrit said Sally hushing the baby from side to side and laying her chin upon the little hand as it tried to disarrange the gown again came here one afternoon with a bit of writing telling that how she wished for needlework and asked if it would be considered any ill conwenience in case she was to give her address here Plornish repeated her address here in a low voice as if he were making responses at church Me and Plornish says No Miss Dorrit no ill conwenience Plornish repeated no ill conwenience and she wrote it in according Which then me and Plornish says Ho Miss Dorrit Plornish repeated Ho Miss Dorrit Have you thought of copying it three or four times as the way to make it known in more places than one No says Miss Dorrit I have not but I will She copied it out according on this table in a sweet writing and Plornish he took it where he worked having a job just then Plornish repeated job just then and likewise to the landlord of the Yard through which it was that missus Clennam first happened to employ Miss Dorrit Plornish repeated employ Miss Dorrit and missus Plornish having come to an end feigned to bite the fingers of the little hand as she kissed it The landlord of the Yard said Arthur Clennam is He is mister Casby by name he is said Plornish and Pancks he collects the rents That added mister Plornish dwelling on the subject with a slow thoughtfulness that appeared to have no connection with any specific object and to lead him nowhere that is about what they are you may believe me or not as you think proper Ay returned Clennam thoughtful in his turn mister Casby too An old acquaintance of mine long ago mister Plornish did not see his road to any comment on this fact and made none As there truly was no reason why he should have the least interest in it Arthur Clennam went on to the present purport of his visit namely to make Plornish the instrument of effecting Tip s release with as little detriment as possible to the self reliance and self helpfulness of the young man supposing him to possess any remnant of those qualities without doubt a very wide stretch of supposition Plornish having been made acquainted with the cause of action from the Defendant s own mouth gave Arthur to understand that the Plaintiff was a Chaunter meaning not a singer of anthems but a seller of horses and that he Plornish considered that ten shillings in the pound would settle handsome and that more would be a waste of money The Principal and instrument soon drove off together to a stable yard in High Holborn where a remarkably fine grey gelding worth at the lowest figure seventy five guineas not taking into account the value of the shot he had been made to swallow for the improvement of his form was to be parted with for a twenty pound note in consequence of his having run away last week with missus Captain Barbary of Cheltenham who wasn t up to a horse of his courage and who in mere spite insisted on selling him for that ridiculous sum or in other words on giving him away Plornish going up this yard alone and leaving his Principal outside found a gentleman with tight drab legs a rather old hat a little hooked stick and a blue neckerchief Captain Maroon of Gloucestershire a private friend of Captain Barbary who happened to be there in a friendly way to mention these little circumstances concerning the remarkably fine grey gelding to any real judge of a horse and quick snapper up of a good thing who might look in at that address as per advertisement This gentleman happening also to be the Plaintiff in the Tip case referred mister Plornish to his solicitor and declined to treat with mister Plornish or even to endure his presence in the yard unless he appeared there with a twenty pound note in which case only the gentleman would augur from appearances that he meant business and might be induced to talk to him On this hint mister Plornish retired to communicate with his Principal and presently came back with the required credentials Then said Captain Maroon Now how much time do you want to make the other twenty in Now I ll give you a month Then said Captain Maroon when that wouldn t suit Now I ll tell what I ll do with you You shall get me a good bill at four months made payable at a banking house for the other twenty Then said Captain Maroon when THAT wouldn t suit Now come Here s the last I ve got to say to you You shall give me another ten down and I ll run my pen clean through it Then said Captain Maroon when THAT wouldn t suit Now I ll tell you what it is and this shuts it up he has used me bad but I ll let him off for another five down and a bottle of wine and if you mean done say done and if you don t like it leave it Finally said Captain Maroon when THAT wouldn t suit either Hand over then And in consideration of the first offer gave a receipt in full and discharged the prisoner mister Plornish said Arthur I trust to you if you please to keep my secret If you will undertake to let the young man know that he is free and to tell him that you were employed to compound for the debt by some one whom you are not at liberty to name you will not only do me a service but may do him one and his sister also The last reason sir said Plornish would be quite sufficient Your wishes shall be attended to A Friend has obtained his discharge you can say if you please A Friend who hopes that for his sister s sake if for no one else s he will make good use of his liberty Your wishes sir shall be attended to And if you will be so good in your better knowledge of the family as to communicate freely with me and to point out to me any means by which you think I may be delicately and really useful to Little Dorrit I shall feel under an obligation to you Don t name it sir returned Plornish it ll be ekally a pleasure an a it l be ekally a pleasure and a Finding himself unable to balance his sentence after two efforts mister Plornish wisely dropped it He took Clennam s card and appropriate pecuniary compliment He was earnest to finish his commission at once and his Principal was in the same mind So his Principal offered to set him down at the Marshalsea Gate and they drove in that direction over Blackfriars Bridge On the way Arthur elicited from his new friend a confused summary of the interior life of Bleeding Heart Yard They was all hard up there mister Plornish said uncommon hard up to be sure Well he couldn t say how it was he didn t know as anybody could say how it was all he know d was that so it was When a man felt on his own back and in his own belly that poor he was that man mister Plornish gave it as his decided belief know d well that he was poor somehow or another and you couldn t talk it out of him no more than you could talk Beef into him Then you see some people as was better off said and a good many such people lived pretty close up to the mark themselves if not beyond it so he d heerd that they was improvident that was the favourite word down the Yard For instance if they see a man with his wife and children going to Hampton Court in a Wan perhaps once in a year they says Hallo I thought you was poor my improvident friend Why Lord how hard it was upon a man What was a man to do He couldn t go mollancholy mad and even if he did you wouldn t be the better for it In mister Plornish s judgment you would be the worse for it Yet you seemed to want to make a man mollancholy mad You was always at it if not with your right hand with your left What was they a doing in the Yard Why take a look at em and see There was the girls and their mothers a working at their sewing or their shoe binding or their trimming or their waistcoat making day and night and night and day and not more than able to keep body and soul together after all often not so much There was people of pretty well all sorts of trades you could name all wanting to work and yet not able to get it There was old people after working all their lives going and being shut up in the workhouse much worse fed and lodged and treated altogether than mister Plornish said manufacturers but appeared to mean malefactors Why a man didn t know where to turn himself for a crumb of comfort As to who was to blame for it mister Plornish didn t know who was to blame for it He could tell you who suffered but he couldn t tell you whose fault it was It wasn t HIS place to find out and who d mind what he said if he did find out He only know d that it wasn t put right by them what undertook that line of business and that it didn t come right of itself And in brief his illogical opinion was that if you couldn t do nothing for him you had better take nothing from him for doing of it so far as he could make out that was about what it come to Thus in a prolix gently growling foolish way did Plornish turn the tangled skein of his estate about and about like a blind man who was trying to find some beginning or end to it until they reached the prison gate There he left his Principal alone to wonder as he rode away how many thousand Plornishes there might be within a day or two s journey of the Circumlocution Office playing sundry curious variations on the same tune which were not known by ear in that glorious institution CHAPTER thirteen Patriarchal The mention of mister Casby again revived in Clennam s memory the smouldering embers of curiosity and interest which missus Flintwinch had fanned on the night of his arrival Flora Casby had been the beloved of his boyhood and Flora was the daughter and only child of wooden headed old Christopher so he was still occasionally spoken of by some irreverent spirits who had had dealings with him and in whom familiarity had bred its proverbial result perhaps who was reputed to be rich in weekly tenants and to get a good quantity of blood out of the stones of several unpromising courts and alleys After some days of inquiry and research Arthur Clennam became convinced that the case of the Father of the Marshalsea was indeed a hopeless one and sorrowfully resigned the idea of helping him to freedom again He had no hopeful inquiry to make at present concerning Little Dorrit either but he argued with himself that it might for anything he knew it might be serviceable to the poor child if he renewed this acquaintance It is hardly necessary to add that beyond all doubt he would have presented himself at mister Casby s door if there had been no Little Dorrit in existence for we all know how we all deceive ourselves that is to say how people in general our profounder selves excepted deceive themselves as to motives of action With a comfortable impression upon him and quite an honest one in its way that he was still patronising Little Dorrit in doing what had no reference to her he found himself one afternoon at the corner of mister Casby s street mister Casby lived in a street in the Gray s Inn Road which had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention of running at one heat down into the valley and up again to the top of Pentonville Hill but which had run itself out of breath in twenty yards and had stood still ever since There is no such place in that part now but it remained there for many years looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness patched with unfruitful gardens and pimpled with eruptive summerhouses that it had meant to run over in no time The house thought Clennam as he crossed to the door is as little changed as my mother s and looks almost as gloomy But the likeness ends outside I know its staid repose within The smell of its jars of old rose leaves and lavender seems to come upon me even here When his knock at the bright brass knocker of obsolete shape brought a woman servant to the door those faded scents in truth saluted him like wintry breath that had a faint remembrance in it of the bygone spring He stepped into the sober silent air tight house one might have fancied it to have been stifled by Mutes in the Eastern manner and the door closing again seemed to shut out sound and motion The furniture was formal grave and quaker like but well kept and had as prepossessing an aspect as anything from a human creature to a wooden stool that is meant for much use and is preserved for little can ever wear There was a grave clock ticking somewhere up the staircase and there was a songless bird in the same direction pecking at his cage as if he were ticking too The parlour fire ticked in the grate There was only one person on the parlour hearth and the loud watch in his pocket ticked audibly The servant maid had ticked the two words mister Clennam so softly that she had not been heard and he consequently stood within the door she had closed unnoticed The figure of a man advanced in life whose smooth grey eyebrows seemed to move to the ticking as the fire light flickered on them sat in an arm chair with his list shoes on the rug and his thumbs slowly revolving over one another This was old Christopher Casby recognisable at a glance as unchanged in twenty years and upward as his own solid furniture as little touched by the influence of the varying seasons as the old rose leaves and old lavender in his porcelain jars Perhaps there never was a man in this troublesome world so troublesome for the imagination to picture as a boy And yet he had changed very little in his progress through life Confronting him in the room in which he sat was a boy s portrait which anybody seeing him would have identified as Master Christopher Casby aged ten though disguised with a haymaking rake for which he had had at any time as much taste or use as for a diving bell and sitting on one of his own legs upon a bank of violets moved to precocious contemplation by the spire of a village church There was the same smooth face and forehead the same calm blue eye the same placid air The shining bald head which looked so very large because it shone so much and the long grey hair at its sides and back like floss silk or spun glass which looked so very benevolent because it was never cut were not of course to be seen in the boy as in the old man Nevertheless in the Seraphic creature with the haymaking rake were clearly to be discerned the rudiments of the Patriarch with the list shoes Patriarch was the name which many people delighted to give him Various old ladies in the neighbourhood spoke of him as The Last of the Patriarchs So grey so slow so quiet so impassionate so very bumpy in the head Patriarch was the word for him He had been accosted in the streets and respectfully solicited to become a Patriarch for painters and for sculptors with so much importunity in sooth that it would appear to be beyond the Fine Arts to remember the points of a Patriarch or to invent one Philanthropists of both sexes had asked who he was and on being informed Old Christopher Casby formerly Town agent to Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle had cried in a rapture of disappointment Oh why with that head is he not a benefactor to his species Oh why with that head is he not a father to the orphan and a friend to the friendless With that head however he remained old Christopher Casby proclaimed by common report rich in house property and with that head he now sat in his silent parlour Indeed it would be the height of unreason to expect him to be sitting there without that head Arthur Clennam moved to attract his attention and the grey eyebrows turned towards him I beg your pardon said Clennam I fear you did not hear me announced No sir I did not Did you wish to see me sir I wished to pay my respects mister Casby seemed a feather s weight disappointed by the last words having perhaps prepared himself for the visitor s wishing to pay something else Have I the pleasure sir he proceeded take a chair if you please have I the pleasure of knowing Ah truly yes I think I have I believe I am not mistaken in supposing that I am acquainted with those features I think I address a gentleman of whose return to this country I was informed by mister Flintwinch That is your present visitor Really mister Clennam No other mister Casby mister Clennam I am glad to see you How have you been since we met Without thinking it worth while to explain that in the course of some quarter of a century he had experienced occasional slight fluctuations in his health and spirits Clennam answered generally that he had never been better or something equally to the purpose and shook hands with the possessor of that head as it shed its patriarchal light upon him We are older mister Clennam said Christopher Casby We are not younger said Clennam After this wise remark he felt that he was scarcely shining with brilliancy and became aware that he was nervous And your respected father said mister Casby is no more I was grieved to hear it mister Clennam I was grieved Arthur replied in the usual way that he felt infinitely obliged to him There was a time said mister Casby when your parents and myself were not on friendly terms There was a little family misunderstanding among us Your respected mother was rather jealous of her son maybe when I say her son I mean your worthy self your worthy self His smooth face had a bloom upon it like ripe wall fruit What with his blooming face and that head and his blue eyes he seemed to be delivering sentiments of rare wisdom and virtue In like manner his physiognomical expression seemed to teem with benignity Nobody could have said where the wisdom was or where the virtue was or where the benignity was but they all seemed to be somewhere about him Those times however pursued mister Casby are past and gone past and gone I do myself the pleasure of making a visit to your respected mother occasionally and of admiring the fortitude and strength of mind with which she bears her trials bears her trials When he made one of these little repetitions sitting with his hands crossed before him he did it with his head on one side and a gentle smile as if he had something in his thoughts too sweetly profound to be put into words As if he denied himself the pleasure of uttering it lest he should soar too high and his meekness therefore preferred to be unmeaning I have heard that you were kind enough on one of those occasions said Arthur catching at the opportunity as it drifted past him to mention Little Dorrit to my mother Little Dorrit That s the seamstress who was mentioned to me by a small tenant of mine Yes yes Dorrit That s the name Ah yes yes You call her Little Dorrit No road in that direction Nothing came of the cross cut It led no further My daughter Flora said mister Casby as you may have heard probably mister Clennam was married and established in life several years ago She had the misfortune to lose her husband when she had been married a few months She resides with me again She will be glad to see you if you will permit me to let her know that you are here By all means returned Clennam I should have preferred the request if your kindness had not anticipated me Upon this mister Casby rose up in his list shoes and with a slow heavy step he was of an elephantine build made for the door He had a long wide skirted bottle green coat on and a bottle green pair of trousers and a bottle green waistcoat The Patriarchs were not dressed in bottle green broadcloth and yet his clothes looked patriarchal He had scarcely left the room and allowed the ticking to become audible again when a quick hand turned a latchkey in the house door opened it and shut it Immediately afterwards a quick and eager short dark man came into the room with so much way upon him that he was within a foot of Clennam before he could stop Halloa he said Clennam saw no reason why he should not say Halloa too What s the matter said the short dark man I have not heard that anything is the matter returned Clennam Where s mister Casby asked the short dark man looking about He will be here directly if you want him I want him said the short dark man Don t you This elicited a word or two of explanation from Clennam during the delivery of which the short dark man held his breath and looked at him He was dressed in black and rusty iron grey had jet black beads of eyes a scrubby little black chin wiry black hair striking out from his head in prongs like forks or hair pins and a complexion that was very dingy by nature or very dirty by art or a compound of nature and art He had dirty hands and dirty broken nails and looked as if he had been in the coals he was in a perspiration and snorted and sniffed and puffed and blew like a little labouring steam engine Oh said he when Arthur told him how he came to be there Very well That s right If he should ask for Pancks will you be so good as to say that Pancks is come in And so with a snort and a puff he worked out by another door Now in the old days at home certain audacious doubts respecting the last of the Patriarchs which were afloat in the air had by some forgotten means come in contact with Arthur s sensorium He was aware of motes and specks of suspicion in the atmosphere of that time seen through which medium Christopher Casby was a mere Inn signpost without any Inn an invitation to rest and be thankful when there was no place to put up at and nothing whatever to be thankful for He knew that some of these specks even represented Christopher as capable of harbouring designs in that head and as being a crafty impostor Other motes there were which showed him as a heavy selfish drifting Booby who having stumbled in the course of his unwieldy jostlings against other men on the discovery that to get through life with ease and credit he had but to hold his tongue keep the bald part of his head well polished and leave his hair alone had had just cunning enough to seize the idea and stick to it It was said that his being town agent to Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle was referable not to his having the least business capacity but to his looking so supremely benignant that nobody could suppose the property screwed or jobbed under such a man also that for similar reasons he now got more money out of his own wretched lettings unquestioned than anybody with a less nobby and less shining crown could possibly have done In a word it was represented Clennam called to mind alone in the ticking parlour that many people select their models much as the painters just now mentioned select theirs and that whereas in the Royal Academy some evil old ruffian of a Dog stealer will annually be found embodying all the cardinal virtues on account of his eyelashes or his chin or his legs thereby planting thorns of confusion in the breasts of the more observant students of nature so in the great social Exhibition accessories are often accepted in lieu of the internal character Calling these things to mind and ranging mister Pancks in a row with them Arthur Clennam leaned this day to the opinion without quite deciding on it that the last of the Patriarchs was the drifting Booby aforesaid with the one idea of keeping the bald part of his head highly polished and that much as an unwieldy ship in the Thames river may sometimes be seen heavily driving with the tide broadside on stern first in its own way and in the way of everything else though making a great show of navigation when all of a sudden a little coaly steam tug will bear down upon it take it in tow and bustle off with it similarly the cumbrous Patriarch had been taken in tow by the snorting Pancks and was now following in the wake of that dingy little craft The return of mister Casby with his daughter Flora put an end to these meditations Clennam s eyes no sooner fell upon the subject of his old passion than it shivered and broke to pieces Most men will be found sufficiently true to themselves to be true to an old idea It is no proof of an inconstant mind but exactly the opposite when the idea will not bear close comparison with the reality and the contrast is a fatal shock to it Such was Clennam s case In his youth he had ardently loved this woman and had heaped upon her all the locked up wealth of his affection and imagination That wealth had been in his desert home like Robinson Crusoe s money exchangeable with no one lying idle in the dark to rust until he poured it out for her Ever since that memorable time though he had until the night of his arrival as completely dismissed her from any association with his Present or Future as if she had been dead which she might easily have been for anything he knew he had kept the old fancy of the Past unchanged in its old sacred place And now after all the last of the Patriarchs coolly walked into the parlour saying in effect Be good enough to throw it down and dance upon it This is Flora Flora always tall had grown to be very broad too and short of breath but that was not much Flora whom he had left a lily had become a peony but that was not much Flora who had seemed enchanting in all she said and thought was diffuse and silly That was much Flora who had been spoiled and artless long ago was determined to be spoiled and artless now That was a fatal blow This is Flora I am sure giggled Flora tossing her head with a caricature of her girlish manner such as a mummer might have presented at her own funeral if she had lived and died in classical antiquity I am ashamed to see mister Clennam I am a mere fright I know he ll find me fearfully changed I am actually an old woman it s shocking to be found out it s really shocking He assured her that she was just what he had expected and that time had not stood still with himself Oh But with a gentleman it s so different and really you look so amazingly well that you have no right to say anything of the kind while as to me you know oh cried Flora with a little scream I am dreadful The Patriarch apparently not yet understanding his own part in the drama under representation glowed with vacant serenity But if we talk of not having changed said Flora who whatever she said never once came to a full stop look at Papa is not Papa precisely what he was when you went away isn t it cruel and unnatural of Papa to be such a reproach to his own child if we go on in this way much longer people who don t know us will begin to suppose that I am Papa s Mama That must be a long time hence Arthur considered Oh mister Clennam you insincerest of creatures said Flora I perceive already you have not lost your old way of paying compliments your old way when you used to pretend to be so sentimentally struck you know at least I don t mean that I oh I don t know what I mean Here Flora tittered confusedly and gave him one of her old glances The Patriarch as if he now began to perceive that his part in the piece was to get off the stage as soon as might be rose and went to the door by which Pancks had worked out hailing that Tug by name He received an answer from some little Dock beyond and was towed out of sight directly You mustn t think of going yet said Flora Arthur had looked at his hat being in a ludicrous dismay and not knowing what to do you could never be so unkind as to think of going Arthur I mean mister Arthur or I suppose mister Clennam would be far more proper but I am sure I don t know what I am saying without a word about the dear old days gone for ever when I come to think of it I dare say it would be much better not to speak of them and it s highly probable that you have some much more agreeable engagement and pray let Me be the last person in the world to interfere with it though there was a time but I am running into nonsense again Was it possible that Flora could have been such a chatterer in the days she referred to Could there have been anything like her present disjointed volubility in the fascinations that had captivated him Indeed I have little doubt said Flora running on with astonishing speed and pointing her conversation with nothing but commas and very few of them that you are married to some Chinese lady being in China so long and being in business and naturally desirous to settle and extend your connection nothing was more likely than that you should propose to a Chinese lady and nothing was more natural I am sure than that the Chinese lady should accept you and think herself very well off too I only hope she s not a Pagodian dissenter I am not returned Arthur smiling in spite of himself married to any lady Flora Oh good gracious me I hope you never kept yourself a bachelor so long on my account tittered Flora but of course you never did why should you pray don t answer I don t know where I m running to oh do tell me something about the Chinese ladies whether their eyes are really so long and narrow always putting me in mind of mother of pearl fish at cards and do they really wear tails down their back and plaited too or is it only the men and when they pull their hair so very tight off their foreheads don t they hurt themselves and why do they stick little bells all over their bridges and temples and hats and things or don t they really do it Flora gave him another of her old glances Instantly she went on again as if he had spoken in reply for some time Then it s all true and they really do good gracious Arthur pray excuse me old habit mister Clennam far more proper what a country to live in for so long a time and with so many lanterns and umbrellas too how very dark and wet the climate ought to be and no doubt actually is and the sums of money that must be made by those two trades where everybody carries them and hangs them everywhere the little shoes too and the feet screwed back in infancy is quite surprising what a traveller you are In his ridiculous distress Clennam received another of the old glances without in the least knowing what to do with it Dear dear said Flora only to think of the changes at home Arthur cannot overcome it and seems so natural mister Clennam far more proper since you became familiar with the Chinese customs and language which I am persuaded you speak like a Native if not better for you were always quick and clever though immensely difficult no doubt I am sure the tea chests alone would kill me if I tried such changes Arthur I am doing it again seems so natural most improper as no one could have believed who could have ever imagined missus Finching when I can t imagine it myself Is that your married name asked Arthur struck in the midst of all this by a certain warmth of heart that expressed itself in her tone when she referred however oddly to the youthful relation in which they had stood to one another Finching Finching oh yes isn t it a dreadful name but as mister F said when he proposed to me which he did seven times and handsomely consented I must say to be what he used to call on liking twelve months after all he wasn t answerable for it and couldn t help it could he Excellent man not at all like you but excellent man Flora had at last talked herself out of breath for one moment One moment for she recovered breath in the act of raising a minute corner of her pocket handkerchief to her eye as a tribute to the ghost of the departed mister F and began again No one could dispute Arthur mister Clennam that it s quite right you should be formally friendly to me under the altered circumstances and indeed you couldn t be anything else at least I suppose not you ought to know but I can t help recalling that there was a time when things were very different My dear missus Finching Arthur began struck by the good tone again Oh not that nasty ugly name say Flora Flora I assure you Flora I am happy in seeing you once more and in finding that like me you have not forgotten the old foolish dreams when we saw all before us in the light of our youth and hope You don t seem so pouted Flora you take it very coolly but however I know you are disappointed in me I suppose the Chinese ladies Mandarinesses if you call them so are the cause or perhaps I am the cause myself it s just as likely No no Clennam entreated don t say that Oh I must you know said Flora in a positive tone what nonsense not to I know I am not what you expected I know that very well In the midst of her rapidity she had found that out with the quick perception of a cleverer woman The inconsistent and profoundly unreasonable way in which she instantly went on nevertheless to interweave their long abandoned boy and girl relations with their present interview made Clennam feel as if he were light headed One remark said Flora giving their conversation without the slightest notice and to the great terror of Clennam the tone of a love quarrel I wish to make one explanation I wish to offer when your Mama came and made a scene of it with my Papa and when I was called down into the little breakfast room where they were looking at one another with your Mama s parasol between them seated on two chairs like mad bulls what was I to do My dear missus Finching urged Clennam all so long ago and so long concluded is it worth while seriously to I can t Arthur returned Flora be denounced as heartless by the whole society of China without setting myself right when I have the opportunity of doing so and you must be very well aware that there was Paul and Virginia which had to be returned and which was returned without note or comment not that I mean to say you could have written to me watched as I was but if it had only come back with a red wafer on the cover I should have known that it meant Come to Pekin Nankeen and What s the third place barefoot My dear missus Finching you were not to blame and I never blamed you We were both too young too dependent and helpless to do anything but accept our separation Pray think how long ago gently remonstrated Arthur One more remark proceeded Flora with unslackened volubility I wish to make one more explanation I wish to offer for five days I had a cold in the head from crying which I passed entirely in the back drawing room there is the back drawing room still on the first floor and still at the back of the house to confirm my words when that dreary period had passed a lull succeeded years rolled on and mister F became acquainted with us at a mutual friend s he was all attention he called next day he soon began to call three evenings a week and to send in little things for supper it was not love on mister F s part it was adoration mister F proposed with the full approval of Papa and what could I do Nothing whatever said Arthur with the cheerfulest readiness but what you did Let an old friend assure you of his full conviction that you did quite right One last remark proceeded Flora rejecting commonplace life with a wave of her hand I wish to make one last explanation I wish to offer there was a time ere mister F first paid attentions incapable of being mistaken but that is past and was not to be dear mister Clennam you no longer wear a golden chain you are free I trust you may be happy here is Papa who is always tiresome and putting in his nose everywhere where he is not wanted With these words and with a hasty gesture fraught with timid caution such a gesture had Clennam s eyes been familiar with in the old time poor Flora left herself at eighteen years of age a long long way behind again and came to a full stop at last Or rather she left about half of herself at eighteen years of age behind and grafted the rest on to the relict of the late mister F thus making a moral mermaid of herself which her once boy lover contemplated with feelings wherein his sense of the sorrowful and his sense of the comical were curiously blended For example As if there were a secret understanding between herself and Clennam of the most thrilling nature as if the first of a train of post chaises and four extending all the way to Scotland were at that moment round the corner and as if she couldn t and wouldn t have walked into the Parish Church with him under the shade of the family umbrella with the Patriarchal blessing on her head and the perfect concurrence of all mankind Flora comforted her soul with agonies of mysterious signalling expressing dread of discovery With the sensation of becoming more and more light headed every minute Clennam saw the relict of the late mister F enjoying herself in the most wonderful manner by putting herself and him in their old places and going through all the old performances now when the stage was dusty when the scenery was faded when the youthful actors were dead when the orchestra was empty when the lights were out And still through all this grotesque revival of what he remembered as having once been prettily natural to her he could not but feel that it revived at sight of him and that there was a tender memory in it The Patriarch insisted on his staying to dinner and Flora signalled Yes Clennam so wished he could have done more than stay to dinner so heartily wished he could have found the Flora that had been or that never had been that he thought the least atonement he could make for the disappointment he almost felt ashamed of was to give himself up to the family desire Therefore he stayed to dinner Pancks dined with them Pancks steamed out of his little dock at a quarter before six and bore straight down for the Patriarch who happened to be then driving in an inane manner through a stagnant account of Bleeding Heart Yard Pancks instantly made fast to him and hauled him out Bleeding Heart Yard said Pancks with a puff and a snort It s a troublesome property Don t pay you badly but rents are very hard to get there You have more trouble with that one place than with all the places belonging to you Just as the big ship in tow gets the credit with most spectators of being the powerful object so the Patriarch usually seemed to have said himself whatever Pancks said for him Indeed returned Clennam upon whom this impression was so efficiently made by a mere gleam of the polished head that he spoke the ship instead of the Tug The people are so poor there You can t say you know snorted Pancks taking one of his dirty hands out of his rusty iron grey pockets to bite his nails if he could find any and turning his beads of eyes upon his employer whether they re poor or not They say they are but they all say that When a man says he s rich you re generally sure he isn t Besides if they ARE poor you can t help it You d be poor yourself if you didn t get your rents True enough said Arthur You re not going to keep open house for all the poor of London pursued Pancks You re not going to lodge em for nothing You re not going to open your gates wide and let em come free Not if you know it you ain t mister Casby shook his head in Placid and benignant generality If a man takes a room of you at half a crown a week and when the week comes round hasn t got the half crown you say to that man Why have you got the room then If you haven t got the one thing why have you got the other What have you been and done with your money What do you mean by it What are you up to That s what YOU say to a man of that sort and if you didn t say it more shame for you mister Pancks here made a singular and startling noise produced by a strong blowing effort in the region of the nose unattended by any result but that acoustic one You have some extent of such property about the east and north east here I believe said Clennam doubtful which of the two to address Oh pretty well said Pancks You re not particular to east or north east any point of the compass will do for you What you want is a good investment and a quick return You take it where you can find it You ain t nice as to situation not you There was a fourth and most original figure in the Patriarchal tent who also appeared before dinner This was an amazing little old woman with a face like a staring wooden doll too cheap for expression and a stiff yellow wig perched unevenly on the top of her head as if the child who owned the doll had driven a tack through it anywhere so that it only got fastened on Another remarkable thing in this little old woman was that the same child seemed to have damaged her face in two or three places with some blunt instrument in the nature of a spoon her countenance and particularly the tip of her nose presenting the phenomena of several dints generally answering to the bowl of that article A further remarkable thing in this little old woman was that she had no name but mister F s Aunt She broke upon the visitor s view under the following circumstances Flora said when the first dish was being put on the table perhaps mister Clennam might not have heard that mister F had left her a legacy Clennam in return implied his hope that mister F had endowed the wife whom he adored with the greater part of his worldly substance if not with all Flora said oh yes she didn t mean that mister F had made a beautiful will but he had left her as a separate legacy his Aunt She then went out of the room to fetch the legacy and on her return rather triumphantly presented mister F s Aunt The major characteristics discoverable by the stranger in mister F s Aunt were extreme severity and grim taciturnity sometimes interrupted by a propensity to offer remarks in a deep warning voice which being totally uncalled for by anything said by anybody and traceable to no association of ideas confounded and terrified the Mind mister F s Aunt may have thrown in these observations on some system of her own and it may have been ingenious or even subtle but the key to it was wanted The neatly served and well cooked dinner for everything about the Patriarchal household promoted quiet digestion began with some soup some fried soles a butter boat of shrimp sauce and a dish of potatoes The conversation still turned on the receipt of rents mister F s Aunt after regarding the company for ten minutes with a malevolent gaze delivered the following fearful remark When we lived at Henley Barnes s gander was stole by tinkers mister Pancks courageously nodded his head and said All right ma am But the effect of this mysterious communication upon Clennam was absolutely to frighten him And another circumstance invested this old lady with peculiar terrors Though she was always staring she never acknowledged that she saw any individual The polite and attentive stranger would desire say to consult her inclinations on the subject of potatoes His expressive action would be hopelessly lost upon her and what could he do No man could say mister F s Aunt will you permit me Every man retired from the spoon as Clennam did cowed and baffled There was mutton a steak and an apple pie nothing in the remotest way connected with ganders and the dinner went on like a disenchanted feast as it truly was Once upon a time Clennam had sat at that table taking no heed of anything but Flora now the principal heed he took of Flora was to observe against his will that she was very fond of porter that she combined a great deal of sherry with sentiment and that if she were a little overgrown it was upon substantial grounds The last of the Patriarchs had always been a mighty eater and he disposed of an immense quantity of solid food with the benignity of a good soul who was feeding some one else mister Pancks who was always in a hurry and who referred at intervals to a little dirty notebook which he kept beside him perhaps containing the names of the defaulters he meant to look up by way of dessert took in his victuals much as if he were coaling with a good deal of noise a good deal of dropping about and a puff and a snort occasionally as if he were nearly ready to steam away All through dinner Flora combined her present appetite for eating and drinking with her past appetite for romantic love in a way that made Clennam afraid to lift his eyes from his plate since he could not look towards her without receiving some glance of mysterious meaning or warning as if they were engaged in a plot mister F s Aunt sat silently defying him with an aspect of the greatest bitterness until the removal of the cloth and the appearance of the decanters when she originated another observation struck into the conversation like a clock without consulting anybody Flora had just said mister Clennam will you give me a glass of port for mister F s Aunt The Monument near London Bridge that lady instantly proclaimed was put up arter the Great Fire of London and the Great Fire of London was not the fire in which your uncle George s workshops was burned down mister Pancks with his former courage said Indeed ma am All right But appearing to be incensed by imaginary contradiction or other ill usage mister F s Aunt instead of relapsing into silence made the following additional proclamation I hate a fool She imparted to this sentiment in itself almost Solomonic so extremely injurious and personal a character by levelling it straight at the visitor s head that it became necessary to lead mister F s Aunt from the room This was quietly done by Flora mister F s Aunt offering no resistance but inquiring on her way out What he come there for then with implacable animosity When Flora returned she explained that her legacy was a clever old lady but was sometimes a little singular and took dislikes peculiarities of which Flora seemed to be proud rather than otherwise As Flora s good nature shone in the case Clennam had no fault to find with the old lady for eliciting it now that he was relieved from the terrors of her presence and they took a glass or two of wine in peace Foreseeing then that the Pancks would shortly get under weigh and that the Patriarch would go to sleep he pleaded the necessity of visiting his mother and asked mister Pancks in which direction he was going Citywards sir said Pancks Shall we walk together said Arthur Quite agreeable said Pancks Meanwhile Flora was murmuring in rapid snatches for his ear that there was a time and that the past was a yawning gulf however and that a golden chain no longer bound him and that she revered the memory of the late mister F and that she should be at home to morrow at half past one and that the decrees of Fate were beyond recall and that she considered nothing so improbable as that he ever walked on the north west side of Gray s Inn Gardens at exactly four o clock in the afternoon He tried at parting to give his hand in frankness to the existing Flora not the vanished Flora or the mermaid but Flora wouldn t have it couldn t have it was wholly destitute of the power of separating herself and him from their bygone characters He left the house miserably enough and so much more light headed than ever that if it had not been his good fortune to be towed away he might for the first quarter of an hour have drifted anywhere When he began to come to himself in the cooler air and the absence of Flora he found Pancks at full speed cropping such scanty pasturage of nails as he could find and snorting at intervals These in conjunction with one hand in his pocket and his roughened hat hind side before were evidently the conditions under which he reflected A fresh night said Arthur Yes it s pretty fresh assented Pancks As a stranger you feel the climate more than I do I dare say Indeed I haven t got time to feel it You lead such a busy life Yes I have always some of em to look up or something to look after But I like business said Pancks getting on a little faster What s a man made for For nothing else said Clennam Pancks put the counter question What else It packed up in the smallest compass a weight that had rested on Clennam s life and he made no answer That s what I ask our weekly tenants said Pancks Some of em will pull long faces to me and say Poor as you see us master we re always grinding drudging toiling every minute we re awake I say to them What else are you made for It shuts them up They haven t a word to answer What else are you made for That clinches it Ah dear dear dear sighed Clennam Here am I said Pancks pursuing his argument with the weekly tenant What else do you suppose I think I am made for Nothing Rattle me out of bed early set me going give me as short a time as you like to bolt my meals in and keep me at it Keep me always at it and I ll keep you always at it you keep somebody else always at it There you are with the Whole Duty of Man in a commercial country When they had walked a little further in silence Clennam said Have you no taste for anything mister Pancks What s taste drily retorted Pancks Let us say inclination I have an inclination to get money sir said Pancks if you will show me how He blew off that sound again and it occurred to his companion for the first time that it was his way of laughing He was a singular man in all respects he might not have been quite in earnest but that the short hard rapid manner in which he shot out these cinders of principles as if it were done by mechanical revolvency seemed irreconcilable with banter You are no great reader I suppose said Clennam Never read anything but letters and accounts Never collect anything but advertisements relative to next of kin If that s a taste I have got that You re not of the Clennams of Cornwall mister Clennam Not that I ever heard of I know you re not I asked your mother sir She has too much character to let a chance escape her Supposing I had been of the Clennams of Cornwall You d have heard of something to your advantage Indeed I have heard of little enough to my advantage for some time There s a Cornish property going a begging sir and not a Cornish Clennam to have it for the asking said Pancks taking his note book from his breast pocket and putting it in again I turn off here I wish you good night Good night said Clennam But the Tug suddenly lightened and untrammelled by having any weight in tow was already puffing away into the distance They had crossed Smithfield together and Clennam was left alone at the corner of Barbican He had no intention of presenting himself in his mother s dismal room that night and could not have felt more depressed and cast away if he had been in a wilderness He turned slowly down Aldersgate Street and was pondering his way along towards Saint Paul s purposing to come into one of the great thoroughfares for the sake of their light and life when a crowd of people flocked towards him on the same pavement and he stood aside against a shop to let them pass As they came up he made out that they were gathered around a something that was carried on men s shoulders He soon saw that it was a litter hastily made of a shutter or some such thing and a recumbent figure upon it and the scraps of conversation in the crowd and a muddy bundle carried by one man and a muddy hat carried by another informed him that an accident had occurred The litter stopped under a lamp before it had passed him half a dozen paces for some readjustment of the burden and the crowd stopping too he found himself in the midst of the array An accident going to the Hospital he asked an old man beside him who stood shaking his head inviting conversation Yes said the man along of them Mails They ought to be prosecuted and fined them Mails They come a racing out of Lad Lane and Wood Street at twelve or fourteen mile a hour them Mails do The only wonder is that people ain t killed oftener by them Mails This person is not killed I hope I don t know said the man it an t for the want of a will in them Mails if he an t The speaker having folded his arms and set in comfortably to address his depreciation of them Mails to any of the bystanders who would listen several voices out of pure sympathy with the sufferer confirmed him one voice saying to Clennam They re a public nuisance them Mails sir another I see one on em pull up within half a inch of a boy last night another I see one on em go over a cat sir and it might have been your own mother and all representing by implication that if he happened to possess any public influence he could not use it better than against them Mails Why a native Englishman is put to it every night of his life to save his life from them Mails argued the first old man and he knows when they re a coming round the corner to tear him limb from limb What can you expect from a poor foreigner who don t know nothing about em Is this a foreigner said Clennam leaning forward to look In the midst of such replies as Frenchman sir Porteghee sir Dutchman sir Prooshan sir and other conflicting testimony he now heard a feeble voice asking both in Italian and in French for water A general remark going round in reply of Ah poor fellow he says he ll never get over it and no wonder Clennam begged to be allowed to pass as he understood the poor creature He was immediately handed to the front to speak to him First he wants some water said he looking round A dozen good fellows dispersed to get it Are you badly hurt my friend he asked the man on the litter in Italian Yes sir yes yes yes It s my leg it s my leg But it pleases me to hear the old music though I am very bad You are a traveller Stay See the water Let me give you some They had rested the litter on a pile of paving stones It was at a convenient height from the ground and by stooping he could lightly raise the head with one hand and hold the glass to his lips with the other A little muscular brown man with black hair and white teeth A lively face apparently Earrings in his ears That s well You are a traveller Surely sir A stranger in this city Surely surely altogether I am arrived this unhappy evening From what country Marseilles Why see there I also Almost as much a stranger here as you though born here I came from Marseilles a little while ago Don t be cast down The face looked up at him imploringly as he rose from wiping it and gently replaced the coat that covered the writhing figure I won t leave you till you shall be well taken care of Courage You will be very much better half an hour hence Ah Altro Altro cried the poor little man in a faintly incredulous tone and as they took him up hung out his right hand to give the forefinger a back handed shake in the air Arthur Clennam turned and walking beside the litter and saying an encouraging word now and then accompanied it to the neighbouring hospital of Saint Bartholomew None of the crowd but the bearers and he being admitted the disabled man was soon laid on a table in a cool methodical way and carefully examined by a surgeon who was as near at hand and as ready to appear as Calamity herself He hardly knows an English word said Clennam is he badly hurt Let us know all about it first said the surgeon continuing his examination with a businesslike delight in it before we pronounce After trying the leg with a finger and two fingers and one hand and two hands and over and under and up and down and in this direction and in that and approvingly remarking on the points of interest to another gentleman who joined him the surgeon at last clapped the patient on the shoulder and said He won t hurt He ll do very well It s difficult enough but we shall not want him to part with his leg this time Which Clennam interpreted to the patient who was full of gratitude and in his demonstrative way kissed both the interpreter s hand and the surgeon s several times It s a serious injury I suppose said Clennam Ye es replied the surgeon with the thoughtful pleasure of an artist contemplating the work upon his easel Yes it s enough There s a compound fracture above the knee and a dislocation below They are both of a beautiful kind He gave the patient a friendly clap on the shoulder again as if he really felt that he was a very good fellow indeed and worthy of all commendation for having broken his leg in a manner interesting to science He speaks French said the surgeon Oh yes he speaks French He ll be at no loss here then You have only to bear a little pain like a brave fellow my friend and to be thankful that all goes as well as it does he added in that tongue and you ll walk again to a marvel Now let us see whether there s anything else the matter and how our ribs are There was nothing else the matter and our ribs were sound Clennam remained until everything possible to be done had been skilfully and promptly done the poor belated wanderer in a strange land movingly besought that favour of him and lingered by the bed to which he was in due time removed until he had fallen into a doze Even then he wrote a few words for him on his card with a promise to return to morrow and left it to be given to him when he should awake All these proceedings occupied so long that it struck eleven o clock at night as he came out at the Hospital Gate He had hired a lodging for the present in Covent Garden and he took the nearest way to that quarter by Snow Hill and Holborn Left to himself again after the solicitude and compassion of his last adventure he was naturally in a thoughtful mood As naturally he could not walk on thinking for ten minutes without recalling Flora She necessarily recalled to him his life with all its misdirection and little happiness When he got to his lodging he sat down before the dying fire as he had stood at the window of his old room looking out upon the blackened forest of chimneys and turned his gaze back upon the gloomy vista by which he had come to that stage in his existence So long so bare so blank No childhood no youth except for one remembrance that one remembrance proved only that day to be a piece of folly It was a misfortune to him trifle as it might have been to another For while all that was hard and stern in his recollection remained Reality on being proved was obdurate to the sight and touch and relaxed nothing of its old indomitable grimness the one tender recollection of his experience would not bear the same test and melted away He had foreseen this on the former night when he had dreamed with waking eyes but he had not felt it then and he had now He was a dreamer in such wise because he was a man who had deep rooted in his nature a belief in all the gentle and good things his life had been without Bred in meanness and hard dealing this had rescued him to be a man of honourable mind and open hand Bred in coldness and severity this had rescued him to have a warm and sympathetic heart Bred in a creed too darkly audacious to pursue through its process of reserving the making of man in the image of his Creator to the making of his Creator in the image of an erring man this had rescued him to judge not and in humility to be merciful and have hope and charity And this saved him still from the whimpering weakness and cruel selfishness of holding that because such a happiness or such a virtue had not come into his little path or worked well for him therefore it was not in the great scheme but was reducible when found in appearance to the basest elements A disappointed mind he had but a mind too firm and healthy for such unwholesome air Leaving himself in the dark it could rise into the light seeing it shine on others and hailing it Therefore he sat before his dying fire sorrowful to think upon the way by which he had come to that night yet not strewing poison on the way by which other men had come to it That he should have missed so much and at his time of life should look so far about him for any staff to bear him company upon his downward journey and cheer it was a just regret He looked at the fire from which the blaze departed from which the afterglow subsided in which the ashes turned grey from which they dropped to dust and thought How soon I too shall pass through such changes and be gone To review his life was like descending a green tree in fruit and flower and seeing all the branches wither and drop off one by one as he came down towards them From the unhappy suppression of my youngest days through the rigid and unloving home that followed them through my departure my long exile my return my mother s welcome my intercourse with her since down to the afternoon of this day with poor Flora said Arthur Clennam what have I found His door was softly opened and these spoken words startled him and came as if they were an answer Little Dorrit CHAPTER fourteen Little Dorrit s Party Arthur Clennam rose hastily and saw her standing at the door This history must sometimes see with Little Dorrit s eyes and shall begin that course by seeing him Little Dorrit looked into a dim room which seemed a spacious one to her and grandly furnished Courtly ideas of Covent Garden as a place with famous coffee houses where gentlemen wearing gold laced coats and swords had quarrelled and fought duels costly ideas of Covent Garden as a place where there were flowers in winter at guineas a piece pine apples at guineas a pound and peas at guineas a pint picturesque ideas of Covent Garden as a place where there was a mighty theatre showing wonderful and beautiful sights to richly dressed ladies and gentlemen and which was for ever far beyond the reach of poor Fanny or poor uncle desolate ideas of Covent Garden as having all those arches in it where the miserable children in rags among whom she had just now passed like young rats slunk and hid fed on offal huddled together for warmth and were hunted about look to the rats young and old all ye Barnacles for before God they are eating away our foundations and will bring the roofs on our heads teeming ideas of Covent Garden as a place of past and present mystery romance abundance want beauty ugliness fair country gardens and foul street gutters all confused together made the room dimmer than it was in Little Dorrit s eyes as they timidly saw it from the door At first in the chair before the gone out fire and then turned round wondering to see her was the gentleman whom she sought The brown grave gentleman who smiled so pleasantly who was so frank and considerate in his manner and yet in whose earnestness there was something that reminded her of his mother with the great difference that she was earnest in asperity and he in gentleness Now he regarded her with that attentive and inquiring look before which Little Dorrit s eyes had always fallen and before which they fell still My poor child Here at midnight I said Little Dorrit sir on purpose to prepare you I knew you must be very much surprised Are you alone No sir I have got Maggy with me Considering her entrance sufficiently prepared for by this mention of her name Maggy appeared from the landing outside on the broad grin She instantly suppressed that manifestation however and became fixedly solemn And I have no fire said Clennam And you are He was going to say so lightly clad but stopped himself in what would have been a reference to her poverty saying instead And it is so cold Putting the chair from which he had risen nearer to the grate he made her sit down in it and hurriedly bringing wood and coal heaped them together and got a blaze Your foot is like marble my child he had happened to touch it while stooping on one knee at his work of kindling the fire put it nearer the warmth Little Dorrit thanked him hastily It was quite warm it was very warm It smote upon his heart to feel that she hid her thin worn shoe Little Dorrit was not ashamed of her poor shoes He knew her story and it was not that Little Dorrit had a misgiving that he might blame her father if he saw them that he might think why did he dine to day and leave this little creature to the mercy of the cold stones She had no belief that it would have been a just reflection she simply knew by experience that such delusions did sometimes present themselves to people It was a part of her father s misfortunes that they did Before I say anything else Little Dorrit began sitting before the pale fire and raising her eyes again to the face which in its harmonious look of interest and pity and protection she felt to be a mystery far above her in degree and almost removed beyond her guessing at may I tell you something sir Yes my child A slight shade of distress fell upon her at his so often calling her a child She was surprised that he should see it or think of such a slight thing but he said directly I wanted a tender word and could think of no other As you just now gave yourself the name they give you at my mother s and as that is the name by which I always think of you let me call you Little Dorrit Thank you sir I should like it better than any name Little Dorrit Little mother Maggy who had been falling asleep put in as a correction It s all the same Maggy returned Little Dorrit all the same Is it all the same mother Just the same Maggy laughed and immediately snored In Little Dorrit s eyes and ears the uncouth figure and the uncouth sound were as pleasant as could be There was a glow of pride in her big child overspreading her face when it again met the eyes of the grave brown gentleman She wondered what he was thinking of as he looked at Maggy and her She thought what a good father he would be How with some such look he would counsel and cherish his daughter What I was going to tell you sir said Little Dorrit is that MY brother is at large Arthur was rejoiced to hear it and hoped he would do well And what I was going to tell you sir said Little Dorrit trembling in all her little figure and in her voice is that I am not to know whose generosity released him am never to ask and am never to be told and am never to thank that gentleman with all MY grateful heart He would probably need no thanks Clennam said Very likely he would be thankful himself and with reason that he had had the means and chance of doing a little service to her who well deserved a great one And what I was going to say sir is said Little Dorrit trembling more and more that if I knew him and I might I would tell him that he can never never know how I feel his goodness and how my good father would feel it And what I was going to say sir is that if I knew him and I might but I don t know him and I must not I know that I would tell him that I shall never any more lie down to sleep without having prayed to Heaven to bless him and reward him And if I knew him and I might I would go down on my knees to him and take his hand and kiss it and ask him not to draw it away but to leave it O to leave it for a moment and let my thankful tears fall on it for I have no other thanks to give him Little Dorrit had put his hand to her lips and would have kneeled to him but he gently prevented her and replaced her in her chair Her eyes and the tones of her voice had thanked him far better than she thought He was not able to say quite as composedly as usual There Little Dorrit there there there We will suppose that you did know this person and that you might do all this and that it was all done And now tell me Who am quite another person who am nothing more than the friend who begged you to trust him why you are out at midnight and what it is that brings you so far through the streets at this late hour my slight delicate child was on his lips again Little Dorrit Maggy and I have been to night she answered subduing herself with the quiet effort that had long been natural to her to the theatre where my sister is engaged And oh ain t it a Ev nly place suddenly interrupted Maggy who seemed to have the power of going to sleep and waking up whenever she chose Almost as good as a hospital Only there ain t no Chicking in it Here she shook herself and fell asleep again We went there said Little Dorrit glancing at her charge because I like sometimes to know of my own knowledge that my sister is doing well and like to see her there with my own eyes when neither she nor Uncle is aware It is very seldom indeed that I can do that because when I am not out at work I am with my father and even when I am out at work I hurry home to him But I pretend to night that I am at a party As she made the confession timidly hesitating she raised her eyes to the face and read its expression so plainly that she answered it Oh no certainly I never was at a party in my life She paused a little under his attentive look and then said I hope there is no harm in it I could never have been of any use if I had not pretended a little She feared that he was blaming her in his mind for so devising to contrive for them think for them and watch over them without their knowledge or gratitude perhaps even with their reproaches for supposed neglect But what was really in his mind was the weak figure with its strong purpose the thin worn shoes the insufficient dress and the pretence of recreation and enjoyment He asked where the suppositious party was At a place where she worked answered Little Dorrit blushing She had said very little about it only a few words to make her father easy Her father did not believe it to be a grand party indeed he might suppose that And she glanced for an instant at the shawl she wore It is the first night said Little Dorrit that I have ever been away from home And London looks so large so barren and so wild In Little Dorrit s eyes its vastness under the black sky was awful a tremor passed over her as she said the words But this is not she added with the quiet effort again what I have come to trouble you with sir My sister s having found a friend a lady she has told me of and made me rather anxious about was the first cause of my coming away from home And being away and coming on purpose round by where you lived and seeing a light in the window Not for the first time No not for the first time In Little Dorrit s eyes the outside of that window had been a distant star on other nights than this She had toiled out of her way tired and troubled to look up at it and wonder about the grave brown gentleman from so far off who had spoken to her as a friend and protector There were three things said Little Dorrit that I thought I would like to say if you were alone and I might come up stairs First what I have tried to say but never can never shall Hush hush That is done with and disposed of Let us pass to the second said Clennam smiling her agitation away making the blaze shine upon her and putting wine and cake and fruit towards her on the table I think said Little Dorrit this is the second thing sir I think missus Clennam must have found out my secret and must know where I come from and where I go to Where I live I mean Indeed returned Clennam quickly He asked her after short consideration why she supposed so I think replied Little Dorrit that mister Flintwinch must have watched me And why Clennam asked as he turned his eyes upon the fire bent his brows and considered again why did she suppose that I have met him twice Both times near home Both times at night when I was going back Both times I thought though that may easily be my mistake that he hardly looked as if he had met me by accident Did he say anything No he only nodded and put his head on one side The devil take his head mused Clennam still looking at the fire it s always on one side He roused himself to persuade her to put some wine to her lips and to touch something to eat it was very difficult she was so timid and shy and then said musing again Is my mother at all changed to you Oh not at all She is just the same I wondered whether I had better tell her my history I wondered whether I might I mean whether you would like me to tell her I wondered said Little Dorrit looking at him in a suppliant way and gradually withdrawing her eyes as he looked at her whether you would advise me what I ought to do Little Dorrit said Clennam and the phrase had already begun between these two to stand for a hundred gentle phrases according to the varying tone and connection in which it was used do nothing I will have some talk with my old friend missus Affery Do nothing Little Dorrit except refresh yourself with such means as there are here I entreat you to do that Thank you I am not hungry Nor said Little Dorrit as he softly put her glass towards her nor thirsty I think Maggy might like something perhaps We will make her find pockets presently for all there is here said Clennam but before we awake her there was a third thing to say Yes You will not be offended sir I promise that unreservedly It will sound strange I hardly know how to say it Don t think it unreasonable or ungrateful in me said Little Dorrit with returning and increasing agitation No no no I am sure it will be natural and right I am not afraid that I shall put a wrong construction on it whatever it is Thank you You are coming back to see my father again Yes You have been so good and thoughtful as to write him a note saying that you are coming to morrow Oh that was nothing Yes Can you guess said Little Dorrit folding her small hands tight in one another and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking steadily out of her eyes what I am going to ask you not to do I think I can But I may be wrong No you are not wrong said Little Dorrit shaking her head If we should want it so very very badly that we cannot do without it let me ask you for it I Will I Will Don t encourage him to ask Don t understand him if he does ask Don t give it to him Save him and spare him that and you will be able to think better of him Clennam said not very plainly seeing those tears glistening in her anxious eyes that her wish should be sacred with him You don t know what he is she said you don t know what he really is How can you seeing him there all at once dear love and not gradually as I have done You have been so good to us so delicately and truly good that I want him to be better in your eyes than in anybody s And I cannot bear to think cried Little Dorrit covering her tears with her hands I cannot bear to think that you of all the world should see him in his only moments of degradation Pray said Clennam do not be so distressed Pray pray Little Dorrit This is quite understood now Thank you sir Thank you I have tried very much to keep myself from saying this I have thought about it days and nights but when I knew for certain you were coming again I made up my mind to speak to you Not because I am ashamed of him she dried her tears quickly but because I know him better than any one does and love him and am proud of him Relieved of this weight Little Dorrit was nervously anxious to be gone Maggy being broad awake and in the act of distantly gloating over the fruit and cakes with chuckles of anticipation Clennam made the best diversion in his power by pouring her out a glass of wine which she drank in a series of loud smacks putting her hand upon her windpipe after every one and saying breathless with her eyes in a prominent state Oh ain t it d licious Ain t it hospitally When she had finished the wine and these encomiums he charged her to load her basket she was never without her basket with every eatable thing upon the table and to take especial care to leave no scrap behind Maggy s pleasure in doing this and her little mother s pleasure in seeing Maggy pleased was as good a turn as circumstances could have given to the late conversation But the gates will have been locked long ago said Clennam suddenly remembering it Where are you going I am going to Maggy s lodging answered Little Dorrit I shall be quite safe quite well taken care of I must accompany you there said Clennam I cannot let you go alone Yes pray leave us to go there by ourselves Pray do begged Little Dorrit She was so earnest in the petition that Clennam felt a delicacy in obtruding himself upon her the rather because he could well understand that Maggy s lodging was of the obscurest sort Come Maggy said Little Dorrit cheerily we shall do very well we know the way by this time Maggy Yes yes little mother we know the way chuckled Maggy And away they went Little Dorrit turned at the door to say God bless you She said it very softly but perhaps she may have been as audible above who knows as a whole cathedral choir Arthur Clennam suffered them to pass the corner of the street before he followed at a distance not with any idea of encroaching a second time on Little Dorrit s privacy but to satisfy his mind by seeing her secure in the neighbourhood to which she was accustomed So diminutive she looked so fragile and defenceless against the bleak damp weather flitting along in the shuffling shadow of her charge that he felt in his compassion and in his habit of considering her a child apart from the rest of the rough world as if he would have been glad to take her up in his arms and carry her to her journey s end In course of time she came into the leading thoroughfare where the Marshalsea was and then he saw them slacken their pace and soon turn down a by street He stopped felt that he had no right to go further and slowly left them He had no suspicion that they ran any risk of being houseless until morning had no idea of the truth until long long afterwards But said Little Dorrit when they stopped at a poor dwelling all in darkness and heard no sound on listening at the door Now this is a good lodging for you Maggy and we must not give offence Consequently we will only knock twice and not very loud and if we cannot wake them so we must walk about till day Once Little Dorrit knocked with a careful hand and listened Twice Little Dorrit knocked with a careful hand and listened All was close and still Maggy we must do the best we can my dear We must be patient and wait for day It was a chill dark night with a damp wind blowing when they came out into the leading street again and heard the clocks strike half past one In only five hours and a half said Little Dorrit we shall be able to go home To speak of home and to go and look at it it being so near was a natural sequence They went to the closed gate and peeped through into the court yard I hope he is sound asleep said Little Dorrit kissing one of the bars and does not miss me The gate was so familiar and so like a companion that they put down Maggy s basket in a corner to serve for a seat and keeping close together rested there for some time While the street was empty and silent Little Dorrit was not afraid but when she heard a footstep at a distance or saw a moving shadow among the street lamps she was startled and whispered Maggy I see some one Come away Maggy would then wake up more or less fretfully and they would wander about a little and come back again As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement Maggy kept up pretty well But that period going by she became querulous about the cold and shivered and whimpered It will soon be over dear said Little Dorrit patiently Oh it s all very fine for you little mother returned Maggy but I m a poor thing only ten years old At last in the dead of the night when the street was very still indeed Little Dorrit laid the heavy head upon her bosom and soothed her to sleep And thus she sat at the gate as it were alone looking up at the stars and seeing the clouds pass over them in their wild flight which was the dance at Little Dorrit s party If it really was a party she thought once as she sat there If it was light and warm and beautiful and it was our house and my poor dear was its master and had never been inside these walls And if mister Clennam was one of our visitors and we were dancing to delightful music and were all as gay and light hearted as ever we could be I wonder Such a vista of wonder opened out before her that she sat looking up at the stars quite lost until Maggy was querulous again and wanted to get up and walk Three o clock and half past three and they had passed over London Bridge They had heard the rush of the tide against obstacles and looked down awed through the dark vapour on the river had seen little spots of lighted water where the bridge lamps were reflected shining like demon eyes with a terrible fascination in them for guilt and misery They had shrunk past homeless people lying coiled up in nooks They had run from drunkards They had started from slinking men whistling and signing to one another at bye corners or running away at full speed Though everywhere the leader and the guide Little Dorrit happy for once in her youthful appearance feigned to cling to and rely upon Maggy And more than once some voice from among a knot of brawling or prowling figures in their path had called out to the rest to let the woman and the child go by So the woman and the child had gone by and gone on and five had sounded from the steeples They were walking slowly towards the east already looking for the first pale streak of day when a woman came after them What are you doing with the child she said to Maggy She was young far too young to be there Heaven knows and neither ugly nor wicked looking She spoke coarsely but with no naturally coarse voice there was even something musical in its sound What are you doing with yourself retorted Maggy for want Of a better answer Can t you see without my telling you I don t know as I can said Maggy Killing myself Now I have answered you answer me What are you doing with the child The supposed child kept her head drooped down and kept her form close at Maggy s side Poor thing said the woman Have you no feeling that you keep her out in the cruel streets at such a time as this Have you no eyes that you don t see how delicate and slender she is Have you no sense you don t look as if you had much that you don t take more pity on this cold and trembling little hand She had stepped across to that side and held the hand between her own two chafing it Kiss a poor lost creature dear she said bending her face and tell me where s she taking you Little Dorrit turned towards her Why my God she said recoiling you re a woman Don t mind that said Little Dorrit clasping one of her hands that had suddenly released hers I am not afraid of you Then you had better be she answered Have you no mother No No father Yes a very dear one Go home to him and be afraid of me Let me go Good night I must thank you first let me speak to you as if I really were a child You can t do it said the woman You are kind and innocent but you can t look at me out of a child s eyes I never should have touched you but I thought that you were a child And with a strange wild cry she went away No day yet in the sky but there was day in the resounding stones of the streets in the waggons carts and coaches in the workers going to various occupations in the opening of early shops in the traffic at markets in the stir of the riverside There was coming day in the flaring lights with a feebler colour in them than they would have had at another time coming day in the increased sharpness of the air and the ghastly dying of the night They went back again to the gate intending to wait there now until it should be opened but the air was so raw and cold that Little Dorrit leading Maggy about in her sleep kept in motion Going round by the Church she saw lights there and the door open and went up the steps and looked in Who s that cried a stout old man who was putting on a nightcap as if he were going to bed in a vault It s no one particular sir said Little Dorrit Stop cried the man Let s have a look at you This caused her to turn back again in the act of going out and to present herself and her charge before him I thought so said he I know YOU We have often seen each other said Little Dorrit recognising the sexton or the beadle or the verger or whatever he was when I have been at church here More than that we ve got your birth in our Register you know you re one of our curiosities Indeed said Little Dorrit To be sure As the child of the by the bye how did you get out so early We were shut out last night and are waiting to get in You don t mean it And there s another hour good yet Come into the vestry You ll find a fire in the vestry on account of the painters I m waiting for the painters or I shouldn t be here you may depend upon it One of our curiosities mustn t be cold when we have it in our power to warm her up comfortable Come along He was a very good old fellow in his familiar way and having stirred the vestry fire he looked round the shelves of registers for a particular volume Here you are you see he said taking it down and turning the leaves Here you ll find yourself as large as life Amy daughter of William and Fanny Dorrit Born Marshalsea Prison Parish of saint George And we tell people that you have lived there without so much as a day s or a night s absence ever since Is it true Quite true till last night Lord But his surveying her with an admiring gaze suggested Something else to him to wit I am sorry to see though that you are faint and tired Stay a bit I ll get some cushions out of the church and you and your friend shall lie down before the fire Don t be afraid of not going in to join your father when the gate opens I ll call you He soon brought in the cushions and strewed them on the ground There you are you see Again as large as life Oh never mind thanking I ve daughters of my own And though they weren t born in the Marshalsea Prison they might have been if I had been in my ways of carrying on of your father s breed Stop a bit I must put something under the cushion for your head Here s a burial volume just the thing We have got missus Bangham in this book But what makes these books interesting to most people is not who s in em but who isn t who s coming you know and when That s the interesting question Commendingly looking back at the pillow he had improvised he left them to their hour s repose Maggy was snoring already and Little Dorrit was soon fast asleep with her head resting on that sealed book of Fate untroubled by its mysterious blank leaves This was Little Dorrit s party The shame desertion wretchedness and exposure of the great capital the wet the cold the slow hours and the swift clouds of the dismal night This was the party from which Little Dorrit went home jaded in the first grey mist of a rainy morning CHAPTER fifteen missus Flintwinch has another Dream The debilitated old house in the city wrapped in its mantle of soot and leaning heavily on the crutches that had partaken of its decay and worn out with it never knew a healthy or a cheerful interval let what would betide If the sun ever touched it it was but with a ray and that was gone in half an hour if the moonlight ever fell upon it it was only to put a few patches on its doleful cloak and make it look more wretched The stars to be sure coldly watched it when the nights and the smoke were clear enough and all bad weather stood by it with a rare fidelity You should alike find rain hail frost and thaw lingering in that dismal enclosure when they had vanished from other places and as to snow you should see it there for weeks long after it had changed from yellow to black slowly weeping away its grimy life The place had no other adherents As to street noises the rumbling of wheels in the lane merely rushed in at the gateway in going past and rushed out again making the listening Mistress Affery feel as if she were deaf and recovered the sense of hearing by instantaneous flashes So with whistling singing talking laughing and all pleasant human sounds They leaped the gap in a moment and went upon their way The varying light of fire and candle in missus Clennam s room made the greatest change that ever broke the dead monotony of the spot In her two long narrow windows the fire shone sullenly all day and sullenly all night On rare occasions it flashed up passionately as she did but for the most part it was suppressed like her and preyed upon itself evenly and slowly During many hours of the short winter days however when it was dusk there early in the afternoon changing distortions of herself in her wheeled chair of mister Flintwinch with his wry neck of Mistress Affery coming and going would be thrown upon the house wall that was over the gateway and would hover there like shadows from a great magic lantern As the room ridden invalid settled for the night these would gradually disappear Mistress Affery s magnified shadow always flitting about last until it finally glided away into the air as though she were off upon a witch excursion Then the solitary light would burn unchangingly until it burned pale before the dawn and at last died under the breath of missus Affery as her shadow descended on it from the witch region of sleep Strange if the little sick room fire were in effect a beacon fire summoning some one and that the most unlikely some one in the world to the spot that MUST be come to Strange if the little sick room light were in effect a watch light burning in that place every night until an appointed event should be watched out Which of the vast multitude of travellers under the sun and the stars climbing the dusty hills and toiling along the weary plains journeying by land and journeying by sea coming and going so strangely to meet and to act and react on one another which of the host may with no suspicion of the journey s end be travelling surely hither Time shall show us The post of honour and the post of shame the general s station and the drummer s a peer s statue in Westminster Abbey and a seaman s hammock in the bosom of the deep the mitre and the workhouse the woolsack and the gallows the throne and the guillotine the travellers to all are on the great high road but it has wonderful divergencies and only Time shall show us whither each traveller is bound On a wintry afternoon at twilight missus Flintwinch having been heavy all day dreamed this dream She thought she was in the kitchen getting the kettle ready for tea and was warming herself with her feet upon the fender and the skirt of her gown tucked up before the collapsed fire in the middle of the grate bordered on either hand by a deep cold black ravine She thought that as she sat thus musing upon the question whether life was not for some people a rather dull invention she was frightened by a sudden noise behind her She thought that she had been similarly frightened once last week and that the noise was of a mysterious kind a sound of rustling and of three or four quick beats like a rapid step while a shock or tremble was communicated to her heart as if the step had shaken the floor or even as if she had been touched by some awful hand She thought that this revived within her certain old fears of hers that the house was haunted and that she flew up the kitchen stairs without knowing how she got up to be nearer company Mistress Affery thought that on reaching the hall she saw the door of her liege lord s office standing open and the room empty That she went to the ripped up window in the little room by the street door to connect her palpitating heart through the glass with living things beyond and outside the haunted house That she then saw on the wall over the gateway the shadows of the two clever ones in conversation above That she then went upstairs with her shoes in her hand partly to be near the clever ones as a match for most ghosts and partly to hear what they were talking about None of your nonsense with me said mister Flintwinch I won t take it from you missus Flintwinch dreamed that she stood behind the door which was just ajar and most distinctly heard her husband say these bold words Flintwinch returned missus Clennam in her usual strong low voice there is a demon of anger in you Guard against it I don t care whether there s one or a dozen said mister Flintwinch forcibly suggesting in his tone that the higher number was nearer the mark If there was fifty they should all say None of your nonsense with me I won t take it from you I d make em say it whether they liked it or not What have I done you wrathful man her strong voice asked Done said mister Flintwinch Dropped down upon me If you mean remonstrated with you Don t put words into my mouth that I don t mean said Jeremiah sticking to his figurative expression with tenacious and impenetrable obstinacy I mean dropped down upon me I remonstrated with you she began again because I won t have it cried Jeremiah You dropped down upon me I dropped down upon you then you ill conditioned man Jeremiah chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase for having been needlessly significant to Arthur that morning I have a right to complain of it as almost a breach of confidence You did not mean it I won t have it interposed the contradictory Jeremiah flinging back the concession I did mean it I suppose I must leave you to speak in soliloquy if you choose she replied after a pause that seemed an angry one It is useless my addressing myself to a rash and headstrong old man who has a set purpose not to hear me Now I won t take that from you either said Jeremiah I have no such purpose I have told you I did mean it Do you wish to know why I meant it you rash and headstrong old woman After all you only restore me my own words she said struggling with her indignation Yes This is why then Because you hadn t cleared his father to him and you ought to have done it Because before you went into any tantrum about yourself who are Hold there Flintwinch she cried out in a changed voice you may go a word too far The old man seemed to think so There was another pause and he had altered his position in the room when he spoke again more mildly I was going to tell you why it was Because before you took your own part I thought you ought to have taken the part of Arthur s father Arthur s father I had no particular love for Arthur s father I served Arthur s father s uncle in this house when Arthur s father was not much above me was poorer as far as his pocket went and when his uncle might as soon have left me his heir as have left him He starved in the parlour and I starved in the kitchen that was the principal difference in our positions there was not much more than a flight of breakneck stairs between us I never took to him in those times I don t know that I ever took to him greatly at any time He was an undecided irresolute chap who had everything but his orphan life scared out of him when he was young And when he brought you home here the wife his uncle had named for him I didn t need to look at you twice you were a good looking woman at that time to know who d be master You have stood of your own strength ever since Stand of your own strength now Don t lean against the dead I do not as you call it lean against the dead But you had a mind to do it if I had submitted growled Jeremiah and that s why you drop down upon me You can t forget that I didn t submit I suppose you are astonished that I should consider it worth my while to have justice done to Arthur s father Hey It doesn t matter whether you answer or not because I know you are and you know you are Come then I ll tell you how it is I may be a bit of an oddity in point of temper but this is my temper I can t let anybody have entirely their own way You are a determined woman and a clever woman and when you see your purpose before you nothing will turn you from it Who knows that better than I do Nothing will turn me from it Flintwinch when I have justified it to myself Add that Justified it to yourself I said you were the most determined woman on the face of the earth or I meant to say so and if you are determined to justify any object you entertain of course you ll do it Man I justify myself by the authority of these Books she cried with stern emphasis and appearing from the sound that followed to strike the dead weight of her arm upon the table Never mind that returned Jeremiah calmly we won t enter into that question at present However that may be you carry out your purposes and you make everything go down before them Now I won t go down before them I have been faithful to you and useful to you and I am attached to you But I can t consent and I won t consent and I never did consent and I never will consent to be lost in you Swallow up everybody else and welcome The peculiarity of my temper is ma am that I won t be swallowed up alive Perhaps this had Originally been the mainspring of the understanding between them Descrying thus much of force of character in mister Flintwinch perhaps missus Clennam had deemed alliance with him worth her while Enough and more than enough of the subject said she gloomily Unless you drop down upon me again returned the persistent Flintwinch and then you must expect to hear of it again Mistress Affery dreamed that the figure of her lord here began walking up and down the room as if to cool his spleen and that she ran away but that as he did not issue forth when she had stood listening and trembling in the shadowy hall a little time she crept up stairs again impelled as before by ghosts and curiosity and once more cowered outside the door Please to light the candle Flintwinch missus Clennam was saying apparently wishing to draw him back into their usual tone It is nearly time for tea Little Dorrit is coming and will find me in the dark mister Flintwinch lighted the candle briskly and said as he put it down upon the table What are you going to do with Little Dorrit Is she to come to work here for ever To come to tea here for ever To come backwards and forwards here in the same way for ever How can you talk about for ever to a maimed creature like me Are we not all cut down like the grass of the field and was not I shorn by the scythe many years ago since when I have been lying here waiting to be gathered into the barn Ay ay But since you have been lying here not near dead nothing like it numbers of children and young people blooming women strong men and what not have been cut down and carried and still here are you you see not much changed after all Your time and mine may be a long one yet When I say for ever I mean though I am not poetical through all our time mister Flintwinch gave this explanation with great calmness and calmly waited for an answer So long as Little Dorrit is quiet and industrious and stands in need of the slight help I can give her and deserves it so long I suppose unless she withdraws of her own act she will continue to come here I being spared Nothing more than that said Flintwinch stroking his mouth and chin What should there be more than that What could there be more than that she ejaculated in her sternly wondering way missus Flintwinch dreamed that for the space of a minute or two they remained looking at each other with the candle between them and that she somehow derived an impression that they looked at each other fixedly Do you happen to know missus Clennam Affery s liege lord then demanded in a much lower voice and with an amount of expression that seemed quite out of proportion to the simple purpose of his words where she lives No Would you now would you like to know said Jeremiah with a pounce as if he had sprung upon her If I cared to know I should know already Could I not have asked her any day Then you don t care to know I do not mister Flintwinch having expelled a long significant breath said with his former emphasis For I have accidentally mind found out Wherever she lives said missus Clennam speaking in one unmodulated hard voice and separating her words as distinctly as if she were reading them off from separate bits of metal that she took up one by one she has made a secret of it and she shall always keep her secret from me After all perhaps you would rather not have known the fact any how said Jeremiah and he said it with a twist as if his words had come out of him in his own wry shape Flintwinch said his mistress and partner flashing into a sudden energy that made Affery start why do you goad me Look round this room If it is any compensation for my long confinement within these narrow limits not that I complain of being afflicted you know I never complain of that if it is any compensation to me for long confinement to this room that while I am shut up from all pleasant change I am also shut up from the knowledge of some things that I may prefer to avoid knowing why should you of all men grudge me that belief I don t grudge it to you returned Jeremiah Then say no more Say no more Let Little Dorrit keep her secret from me and do you keep it from me also Let her come and go unobserved and unquestioned Let me suffer and let me have what alleviation belongs to my condition Is it so much that you torment me like an evil spirit I asked you a question That s all I have answered it So say no more Say no more Here the sound of the wheeled chair was heard upon the floor and Affery s bell rang with a hasty jerk More afraid of her husband at the moment than of the mysterious sound in the kitchen Affery crept away as lightly and as quickly as she could descended the kitchen stairs almost as rapidly as she had ascended them resumed her seat before the fire tucked up her skirt again and finally threw her apron over her head Then the bell rang once more and then once more and then kept on ringing in despite of which importunate summons Affery still sat behind her apron recovering her breath At last mister Flintwinch came shuffling down the staircase into the hall muttering and calling Affery woman all the way Affery still remaining behind her apron he came stumbling down the kitchen stairs candle in hand sidled up to her twitched her apron off and roused her Oh Jeremiah cried Affery waking What a start you gave me What have you been doing woman inquired Jeremiah You ve been rung for fifty times Oh Jeremiah said Mistress Affery I have been a dreaming Reminded of her former achievement in that way mister Flintwinch held the candle to her head as if he had some idea of lighting her up for the illumination of the kitchen Don t you know it s her tea time he demanded with a vicious grin and giving one of the legs of Mistress Affery s chair a kick Jeremiah Tea time I don t know what s come to me But I got such a dreadful turn Jeremiah before I went off a dreaming that I think it must be that Yoogh Sleepy Head said mister Flintwinch what are you talking about Such a strange noise Jeremiah and such a curious movement In the kitchen here just here Jeremiah held up his light and looked at the blackened ceiling held down his light and looked at the damp stone floor turned round with his light and looked about at the spotted and blotched walls Rats cats water drains said Jeremiah Mistress Affery negatived each with a shake of her head No Jeremiah I have felt it before I have felt it up stairs and once on the staircase as I was going from her room to ours in the night a rustle and a sort of trembling touch behind me Affery my woman said mister Flintwinch grimly after advancing his nose to that lady s lips as a test for the detection of spirituous liquors if you don t get tea pretty quick old woman you ll become sensible of a rustle and a touch that ll send you flying to the other end of the kitchen This prediction stimulated missus Flintwinch to bestir herself and to hasten up stairs to missus Clennam s chamber But for all that she now began to entertain a settled conviction that there was something wrong in the gloomy house Henceforth she was never at peace in it after daylight departed and never went up or down stairs in the dark without having her apron over her head lest she should see something What with these ghostly apprehensions and her singular dreams missus Flintwinch fell that evening into a haunted state of mind from which it may be long before this present narrative descries any trace of her recovery In the vagueness and indistinctness of all her new experiences and perceptions as everything about her was mysterious to herself she began to be mysterious to others and became as difficult to be made out to anybody s satisfaction as she found the house and everything in it difficult to make out to her own She had not yet finished preparing missus Clennam s tea when the soft knock came to the door which always announced Little Dorrit Mistress Affery looked on at Little Dorrit taking off her homely bonnet in the hall and at mister Flintwinch scraping his jaws and contemplating her in silence as expecting some wonderful consequence to ensue which would frighten her out of her five wits or blow them all three to pieces After tea there came another knock at the door announcing Arthur Mistress Affery went down to let him in and he said on entering Affery I am glad it s you I want to ask you a question Affery immediately replied For goodness sake don t ask me nothing Arthur I am frightened out of one half of my life and dreamed out of the other Don t ask me nothing I don t know which is which or what is what and immediately started away from him and came near him no more Mistress Affery having no taste for reading and no sufficient light for needlework in the subdued room supposing her to have the inclination now sat every night in the dimness from which she had momentarily emerged on the evening of Arthur Clennam s return occupied with crowds of wild speculations and suspicions respecting her mistress and her husband and the noises in the house When the ferocious devotional exercises were engaged in these speculations would distract Mistress Affery s eyes towards the door as if she expected some dark form to appear at those propitious moments and make the party one too many Otherwise Affery never said or did anything to attract the attention of the two clever ones towards her in any marked degree except on certain occasions generally at about the quiet hour towards bed time when she would suddenly dart out of her dim corner and whisper with a face of terror to mister Flintwinch reading the paper near missus Clennam s little table There Jeremiah Now What s that noise Then the noise if there were any would have ceased and mister Flintwinch would snarl turning upon her as if she had cut him down that moment against his will Affery old woman you shall have a dose old woman such a dose You have been dreaming again CHAPTER sixteen Nobody s Weakness The time being come for the renewal of his acquaintance with the Meagles family Clennam pursuant to contract made between himself and mister Meagles within the precincts of Bleeding Heart Yard turned his face on a certain Saturday towards Twickenham where mister Meagles had a cottage residence of his own The weather being fine and dry and any English road abounding in interest for him who had been so long away he sent his valise on by the coach and set out to walk A walk was in itself a new enjoyment to him and one that had rarely diversified his life afar off He went by Fulham and Putney for the pleasure of strolling over the heath It was bright and shining there and when he found himself so far on his road to Twickenham he found himself a long way on his road to a number of airier and less substantial destinations They had risen before him fast in the healthful exercise and the pleasant road It is not easy to walk alone in the country without musing upon something And he had plenty of unsettled subjects to meditate upon though he had been walking to the Land s End First there was the subject seldom absent from his mind the question what he was to do henceforth in life to what occupation he should devote himself and in what direction he had best seek it He was far from rich and every day of indecision and inaction made his inheritance a source of greater anxiety to him As often as he began to consider how to increase this inheritance or to lay it by so often his misgiving that there was some one with an unsatisfied claim upon his justice returned and that alone was a subject to outlast the longest walk Again there was the subject of his relations with his mother which were now upon an equable and peaceful but never confidential footing and whom he saw several times a week Little Dorrit was a leading and a constant subject for the circumstances of his life united to those of her own story presented the little creature to him as the only person between whom and himself there were ties of innocent reliance on one hand and affectionate protection on the other ties of compassion respect unselfish interest gratitude and pity Thinking of her and of the possibility of her father s release from prison by the unbarring hand of death the only change of circumstance he could foresee that might enable him to be such a friend to her as he wished to be by altering her whole manner of life smoothing her rough road and giving her a home he regarded her in that perspective as his adopted daughter his poor child of the Marshalsea hushed to rest If there were a last subject in his thoughts and it lay towards Twickenham its form was so indefinite that it was little more than the pervading atmosphere in which these other subjects floated before him He had crossed the heath and was leaving it behind when he gained upon a figure which had been in advance of him for some time and which as he gained upon it he thought he knew He derived this impression from something in the turn of the head and in the figure s action of consideration as it went on at a sufficiently sturdy walk But when the man for it was a man s figure pushed his hat up at the back of his head and stopped to consider some object before him he knew it to be Daniel Doyce How do you do mister Doyce said Clennam overtaking him I am glad to see you again and in a healthier place than the Circumlocution Office Ha mister Meagles s friend exclaimed that public criminal coming out of some mental combinations he had been making and offering his hand I am glad to see you sir Will you excuse me if I forget your name Readily It s not a celebrated name It s not Barnacle No no said Daniel laughing And now I know what it is It s Clennam How do you do mister Clennam I have some hope said Arthur as they walked on together that we may be going to the same place mister Doyce Meaning Twickenham returned Daniel I am glad to hear it They were soon quite intimate and lightened the way with a variety of conversation The ingenious culprit was a man of great modesty and good sense and though a plain man had been too much accustomed to combine what was original and daring in conception with what was patient and minute in execution to be by any means an ordinary man It was at first difficult to lead him to speak about himself and he put off Arthur s advances in that direction by admitting slightly oh yes he had done this and he had done that and such a thing was of his making and such another thing was his discovery but it was his trade you see his trade until as he gradually became assured that his companion had a real interest in his account of himself he frankly yielded to it Then it appeared that he was the son of a north country blacksmith and had originally been apprenticed by his widowed mother to a lock maker that he had struck out a few little things at the lock maker s which had led to his being released from his indentures with a present which present had enabled him to gratify his ardent wish to bind himself to a working engineer under whom he had laboured hard learned hard and lived hard seven years His time being out he had worked in the shop at weekly wages seven or eight years more and had then betaken himself to the banks of the Clyde where he had studied and filed and hammered and improved his knowledge theoretical and practical for six or seven years more There he had had an offer to go to Lyons which he had accepted and from Lyons had been engaged to go to Germany and in Germany had had an offer to go to saint Petersburg and there had done very well indeed never better However he had naturally felt a preference for his own country and a wish to gain distinction there and to do whatever service he could do there rather than elsewhere And so he had come home And so at home he had established himself in business and had invented and executed and worked his way on until after a dozen years of constant suit and service he had been enrolled in the Great British Legion of Honour the Legion of the Rebuffed of the Circumlocution Office and had been decorated with the Great British Order of Merit the Order of the Disorder of the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings It is much to be regretted said Clennam that you ever turned your thoughts that way mister Doyce True sir true to a certain extent But what is a man to do if he has the misfortune to strike out something serviceable to the nation he must follow where it leads him Hadn t he better let it go said Clennam He can t do it said Doyce shaking his head with a thoughtful smile It s not put into his head to be buried It s put into his head to be made useful You hold your life on the condition that to the last you shall struggle hard for it Every man holds a discovery on the same terms That is to say said Arthur with a growing admiration of his quiet companion you are not finally discouraged even now I have no right to be if I am returned the other The thing is as true as it ever was When they had walked a little way in silence Clennam at once to change the direct point of their conversation and not to change it too abruptly asked mister Doyce if he had any partner in his business to relieve him of a portion of its anxieties No he returned not at present I had when I first entered on it and a good man he was But he has been dead some years and as I could not easily take to the notion of another when I lost him I bought his share for myself and have gone on by myself ever since And here s another thing he said stopping for a moment with a good humoured laugh in his eyes and laying his closed right hand with its peculiar suppleness of thumb on Clennam s arm no inventor can be a man of business you know No said Clennam Why so the men of business say he answered resuming the walk and laughing outright I don t know why we unfortunate creatures should be supposed to want common sense but it is generally taken for granted that we do Even the best friend I have in the world our excellent friend over yonder said Doyce nodding towards Twickenham extends a sort of protection to me don t you know as a man not quite able to take care of himself Arthur Clennam could not help joining in the good humoured laugh for he recognised the truth of the description So I find that I must have a partner who is a man of business and not guilty of any inventions said Daniel Doyce taking off his hat to pass his hand over his forehead if it s only in deference to the current opinion and to uphold the credit of the Works I don t think he ll find that I have been very remiss or confused in my way of conducting them but that s for him to say whoever he is not for me You have not chosen him yet then No sir no I have only just come to a decision to take one The fact is there s more to do than there used to be and the Works are enough for me as I grow older What with the books and correspondence and foreign journeys for which a Principal is necessary I can t do all I am going to talk over the best way of negotiating the matter if I find a spare half hour between this and Monday morning with my my Nurse and protector said Doyce with laughing eyes again He is a sagacious man in business and has had a good apprenticeship to it After this they conversed on different subjects until they arrived at their journey s end A composed and unobtrusive self sustainment was noticeable in Daniel Doyce a calm knowledge that what was true must remain true in spite of all the Barnacles in the family ocean and would be just the truth and neither more nor less when even that sea had run dry which had a kind of greatness in it though not of the official quality As he knew the house well he conducted Arthur to it by the way that showed it to the best advantage It was a charming place none the worse for being a little eccentric on the road by the river and just what the residence of the Meagles family ought to be It stood in a garden no doubt as fresh and beautiful in the May of the Year as Pet now was in the May of her life and it was defended by a goodly show of handsome trees and spreading evergreens as Pet was by mister and missus Meagles It was made out of an old brick house of which a part had been altogether pulled down and another part had been changed into the present cottage so there was a hale elderly portion to represent mister and missus Meagles and a young picturesque very pretty portion to represent Pet There was even the later addition of a conservatory sheltering itself against it uncertain of hue in its deep stained glass and in its more transparent portions flashing to the sun s rays now like fire and now like harmless water drops which might have stood for Tattycoram Within view was the peaceful river and the ferry boat to moralise to all the inmates saying Young or old passionate or tranquil chafing or content you thus runs the current always Let the heart swell into what discord it will thus plays the rippling water on the prow of the ferry boat ever the same tune Year after year so much allowance for the drifting of the boat so many miles an hour the flowing of the stream here the rushes there the lilies nothing uncertain or unquiet upon this road that steadily runs away while you upon your flowing road of time are so capricious and distracted The bell at the gate had scarcely sounded when mister Meagles came out to receive them mister Meagles had scarcely come out when missus Meagles came out missus Meagles had scarcely come out when Pet came out Pet scarcely had come out when Tattycoram came out Never had visitors a more hospitable reception Here we are you see said mister Meagles boxed up mister Clennam within our own home limits as if we were never going to expand that is travel again Not like Marseilles eh No allonging and marshonging here A different kind of beauty indeed said Clennam looking about him But Lord bless me cried mister Meagles rubbing his hands with a relish it was an uncommonly pleasant thing being in quarantine wasn t it Do you know I have often wished myself back again We were a capital party This was mister Meagles s invariable habit Always to object to everything while he was travelling and always to want to get back to it when he was not travelling If it was summer time said mister Meagles which I wish it was on your account and in order that you might see the place at its best you would hardly be able to hear yourself speak for birds Being practical people we never allow anybody to scare the birds and the birds being practical people too come about us in myriads We are delighted to see you Clennam if you ll allow me I shall drop the Mister I heartily assure you we are delighted I have not had so pleasant a greeting said Clennam then he recalled what Little Dorrit had said to him in his own room and faithfully added except once since we last walked to and fro looking down at the Mediterranean Ah returned mister Meagles Something like a look out that was wasn t it I don t want a military government but I shouldn t mind a little allonging and marshonging just a dash of it in this neighbourhood sometimes It s Devilish still Bestowing this eulogium on the retired character of his retreat with a dubious shake of the head mister Meagles led the way into the house It was just large enough and no more was as pretty within as it was without and was perfectly well arranged and comfortable Some traces of the migratory habits of the family were to be observed in the covered frames and furniture and wrapped up hangings but it was easy to see that it was one of mister Meagles s whims to have the cottage always kept in their absence as if they were always coming back the day after to morrow Of articles collected on his various expeditions there was such a vast miscellany that it was like the dwelling of an amiable Corsair There were antiquities from Central Italy made by the best modern houses in that department of industry bits of mummy from Egypt and perhaps Birmingham model gondolas from Venice model villages from Switzerland morsels of tesselated pavement from Herculaneum and Pompeii like petrified minced veal ashes out of tombs and lava out of Vesuvius Spanish fans Spezzian straw hats Moorish slippers Tuscan hairpins Carrara sculpture Trastaverini scarves Genoese velvets and filigree Neapolitan coral Roman cameos Geneva jewellery Arab lanterns rosaries blest all round by the Pope himself and an infinite variety of lumber There were views like and unlike of a multitude of places and there was one little picture room devoted to a few of the regular sticky old Saints with sinews like whipcord hair like Neptune s wrinkles like tattooing and such coats of varnish that every holy personage served for a fly trap and became what is now called in the vulgar tongue a Catch em alive O Of these pictorial acquisitions mister Meagles spoke in the usual manner He was no judge he said except of what pleased himself he had picked them up dirt cheap and people had considered them rather fine One man who at any rate ought to know something of the subject had declared that Sage Reading a specially oily old gentleman in a blanket with a swan s down tippet for a beard and a web of cracks all over him like rich pie crust to be a fine Guercino As for Sebastian del Piombo there you would judge for yourself if it were not his later manner the question was Who was it Titian that might or might not be perhaps he had only touched it Daniel Doyce said perhaps he hadn t touched it but mister Meagles rather declined to overhear the remark When he had shown all his spoils mister Meagles took them into his own snug room overlooking the lawn which was fitted up in part like a dressing room and in part like an office and in which upon a kind of counter desk were a pair of brass scales for weighing gold and a scoop for shovelling out money Here they are you see said mister Meagles I stood behind these two articles five and thirty years running when I no more thought of gadding about than I now think of staying at home When I left the Bank for good I asked for them and brought them away with me I mention it at once or you might suppose that I sit in my counting house as Pet says I do like the king in the poem of the four and twenty blackbirds counting out my money Clennam s eyes had strayed to a natural picture on the wall of two pretty little girls with their arms entwined Yes Clennam said mister Meagles in a lower voice There they both are It was taken some seventeen years ago As I often say to Mother they were babies then Their names said Arthur Ah to be sure You have never heard any name but Pet Pet s name is Minnie her sister s Lillie Should you have known mister Clennam that one of them was meant for me asked Pet herself now standing in the doorway I might have thought that both of them were meant for you both are still so like you Indeed said Clennam glancing from the fair original to the picture and back I cannot even now say which is not your portrait D ye hear that Mother cried mister Meagles to his wife who had followed her daughter It s always the same Clennam nobody can decide The child to your left is Pet The picture happened to be near a looking glass As Arthur looked at it again he saw by the reflection of the mirror Tattycoram stop in passing outside the door listen to what was going on and pass away with an angry and contemptuous frown upon her face that changed its beauty into ugliness But come said mister Meagles You have had a long walk and will be glad to get your boots off As to Daniel here I suppose he d never think of taking his boots off unless we showed him a boot jack Why not asked Daniel with a significant smile at Clennam Oh You have so many things to think about returned mister Meagles clapping him on the shoulder as if his weakness must not be left to itself on any account Figures and wheels and cogs and levers and screws and cylinders and a thousand things In my calling said Daniel amused the greater usually includes the less But never mind never mind Whatever pleases you pleases me Clennam could not help speculating as he seated himself in his room by the fire whether there might be in the breast of this honest affectionate and cordial mister Meagles any microscopic portion of the mustard seed that had sprung up into the great tree of the Circumlocution Office His curious sense of a general superiority to Daniel Doyce which seemed to be founded not so much on anything in Doyce s personal character as on the mere fact of his being an originator and a man out of the beaten track of other men suggested the idea It might have occupied him until he went down to dinner an hour afterwards if he had not had another question to consider which had been in his mind so long ago as before he was in quarantine at Marseilles and which had now returned to it and was very urgent with it No less a question than this Whether he should allow himself to fall in love with Pet He was twice her age He changed the leg he had crossed over the other and tried the calculation again but could not bring out the total at less He was twice her age Well He was young in appearance young in health and strength young in heart A man was certainly not old at forty and many men were not in circumstances to marry or did not marry until they had attained that time of life On the other hand the question was not what he thought of the point but what she thought of it He believed that mister Meagles was disposed to entertain a ripe regard for him and he knew that he had a sincere regard for mister Meagles and his good wife He could foresee that to relinquish this beautiful only child of whom they were so fond to any husband would be a trial of their love which perhaps they never yet had had the fortitude to contemplate But the more beautiful and winning and charming she the nearer they must always be to the necessity of approaching it And why not in his favour as well as in another s When he had got so far it came again into his head that the question was not what they thought of it but what she thought of it Arthur Clennam was a retiring man with a sense of many deficiencies and he so exalted the merits of the beautiful Minnie in his mind and depressed his own that when he pinned himself to this point his hopes began to fail him He came to the final resolution as he made himself ready for dinner that he would not allow himself to fall in love with Pet There were only five at a round table and it was very pleasant indeed They had so many places and people to recall and they were all so easy and cheerful together Daniel Doyce either sitting out like an amused spectator at cards or coming in with some shrewd little experiences of his own when it happened to be to the purpose that they might have been together twenty times and not have known so much of one another And Miss Wade said mister Meagles after they had recalled a number of fellow travellers Has anybody seen Miss Wade I have said Tattycoram She had brought a little mantle which her young mistress had sent for and was bending over her putting it on when she lifted up her dark eyes and made this unexpected answer Tatty her young mistress exclaimed You seen Miss Wade where Here miss said Tattycoram How An impatient glance from Tattycoram seemed as Clennam saw it to answer With my eyes But her only answer in words was I met her near the church What was she doing there I wonder said mister Meagles Not going to it I should think She had written to me first said Tattycoram Oh Tatty murmured her mistress take your hands away I feel as if some one else was touching me She said it in a quick involuntary way but half playfully and not more petulantly or disagreeably than a favourite child might have done who laughed next moment Tattycoram set her full red lips together and crossed her arms upon her bosom Did you wish to know sir she said looking at mister Meagles what Miss Wade wrote to me about Well Tattycoram returned mister Meagles since you ask the question and we are all friends here perhaps you may as well mention it if you are so inclined She knew when we were travelling where you lived said Tattycoram and she had seen me not quite not quite Not quite in a good temper Tattycoram suggested mister Meagles shaking his head at the dark eyes with a quiet caution Take a little time count five and twenty Tattycoram She pressed her lips together again and took a long deep breath So she wrote to me to say that if I ever felt myself hurt she looked down at her young mistress or found myself worried she looked down at her again I might go to her and be considerately treated I was to think of it and could speak to her by the church So I went there to thank her Tatty said her young mistress putting her hand up over her shoulder that the other might take it Miss Wade almost frightened me when we parted and I scarcely like to think of her just now as having been so near me without my knowing it Tatty dear Tatty stood for a moment immovable Hey cried mister Meagles Count another five and twenty Tattycoram She might have counted a dozen when she bent and put her lips to the caressing hand It patted her cheek as it touched the owner s beautiful curls and Tattycoram went away Now there said mister Meagles softly as he gave a turn to the dumb waiter on his right hand to twirl the sugar towards himself There s a girl who might be lost and ruined if she wasn t among practical people Mother and I know solely from being practical that there are times when that girl s whole nature seems to roughen itself against seeing us so bound up in Pet No father and mother were bound up in her poor soul I don t like to think of the way in which that unfortunate child with all that passion and protest in her feels when she hears the Fifth Commandment on a Sunday I am always inclined to call out Church Count five and twenty Tattycoram Besides his dumb waiter mister Meagles had two other not dumb waiters in the persons of two parlour maids with rosy faces and bright eyes who were a highly ornamental part of the table decoration And why not you see said mister Meagles on this head As I always say to Mother why not have something pretty to look at if you have anything at all A certain missus Tickit who was Cook and Housekeeper when the family were at home and Housekeeper only when the family were away completed the establishment mister Meagles regretted that the nature of the duties in which she was engaged rendered missus Tickit unpresentable at present but hoped to introduce her to the new visitor to morrow She was an important part of the Cottage he said and all his friends knew her That was her picture up in the corner When they went away she always put on the silk gown and the jet black row of curls represented in that portrait her hair was reddish grey in the kitchen established herself in the breakfast room put her spectacles between two particular leaves of Doctor Buchan s Domestic Medicine and sat looking over the blind all day until they came back again It was supposed that no persuasion could be invented which would induce missus Tickit to abandon her post at the blind however long their absence or to dispense with the attendance of doctor Buchan the lucubrations of which learned practitioner mister Meagles implicitly believed she had never yet consulted to the extent of one word in her life In the evening they played an old fashioned rubber and Pet sat looking over her father s hand or singing to herself by fits and starts at the piano She was a spoilt child but how could she be otherwise Who could be much with so pliable and beautiful a creature and not yield to her endearing influence Who could pass an evening in the house and not love her for the grace and charm of her very presence in the room This was Clennam s reflection notwithstanding the final conclusion at which he had arrived up stairs In making it he revoked Why what are you thinking of my good sir asked the astonished mister Meagles who was his partner I beg your pardon Nothing returned Clennam Think of something next time that s a dear fellow said mister Meagles Pet laughingly believed he had been thinking of Miss Wade Why of Miss Wade Pet asked her father Why indeed said Arthur Clennam Pet coloured a little and went to the piano again As they broke up for the night Arthur overheard Doyce ask his host if he could give him half an hour s conversation before breakfast in the morning The host replying willingly Arthur lingered behind a moment having his own word to add to that topic mister Meagles he said on their being left alone do you remember when you advised me to go straight to London Perfectly well And when you gave me some other good advice which I needed at that time I won t say what it was worth answered mister Meagles but of course I remember our being very pleasant and confidential together I have acted on your advice and having disembarrassed myself of an occupation that was painful to me for many reasons wish to devote myself and what means I have to another pursuit Right You can t do it too soon said mister Meagles Now as I came down to day I found that your friend mister Doyce is looking for a partner in his business not a partner in his mechanical knowledge but in the ways and means of turning the business arising from it to the best account Just so said mister Meagles with his hands in his pockets and with the old business expression of face that had belonged to the scales and scoop mister Doyce mentioned incidentally in the course of our conversation that he was going to take your valuable advice on the subject of finding such a partner If you should think our views and opportunities at all likely to coincide perhaps you will let him know my available position I speak of course in ignorance of the details and they may be unsuitable on both sides No doubt no doubt said mister Meagles with the caution belonging to the scales and scoop But they will be a question of figures and accounts Just so just so said mister Meagles with arithmetical solidity belonging to the scales and scoop And I shall be glad to enter into the subject provided mister Doyce responds and you think well of it If you will at present therefore allow me to place it in your hands you will much oblige me Clennam I accept the trust with readiness said mister Meagles And without anticipating any of the points which you as a man of business have of course reserved I am free to say to you that I think something may come of this Of one thing you may be perfectly certain Daniel is an honest man I am so sure of it that I have promptly made up my mind to speak to you You must guide him you know you must steer him you must direct him he is one of a crotchety sort said mister Meagles evidently meaning nothing more than that he did new things and went new ways but he is as honest as the sun and so good night Clennam went back to his room sat down again before his fire and made up his mind that he was glad he had resolved not to fall in love with Pet She was so beautiful so amiable so apt to receive any true impression given to her gentle nature and her innocent heart and make the man who should be so happy as to communicate it the most fortunate and enviable of all men that he was very glad indeed he had come to that conclusion But as this might have been a reason for coming to the opposite conclusion he followed out the theme again a little way in his mind to justify himself perhaps Suppose that a man so his thoughts ran who had been of age some twenty years or so who was a diffident man from the circumstances of his youth who was rather a grave man from the tenor of his life who knew himself to be deficient in many little engaging qualities which he admired in others from having been long in a distant region with nothing softening near him who had no kind sisters to present to her who had no congenial home to make her known in who was a stranger in the land who had not a fortune to compensate in any measure for these defects who had nothing in his favour but his honest love and his general wish to do right suppose such a man were to come to this house and were to yield to the captivation of this charming girl and were to persuade himself that he could hope to win her what a weakness it would be He softly opened his window and looked out upon the serene river Year after year so much allowance for the drifting of the ferry boat so many miles an hour the flowing of the stream here the rushes there the lilies nothing uncertain or unquiet Why should he be vexed or sore at heart It was not his weakness that he had imagined It was nobody s nobody s within his knowledge why should it trouble him And yet it did trouble him And he thought who has not thought for a moment sometimes that it might be better to flow away monotonously like the river and to compound for its insensibility to happiness with its insensibility to pain CHAPTER seventeen Nobody s Rival Before breakfast in the morning Arthur walked out to look about him As the morning was fine and he had an hour on his hands he crossed the river by the ferry and strolled along a footpath through some meadows When he came back to the towing path he found the ferry boat on the opposite side and a gentleman hailing it and waiting to be taken over This gentleman looked barely thirty He was well dressed of a sprightly and gay appearance a well knit figure and a rich dark complexion As Arthur came over the stile and down to the water s edge the lounger glanced at him for a moment and then resumed his occupation of idly tossing stones into the water with his foot There was something in his way of spurning them out of their places with his heel and getting them into the required position that Clennam thought had an air of cruelty in it Most of us have more or less frequently derived a similar impression from a man s manner of doing some very little thing plucking a flower clearing away an obstacle or even destroying an insentient object The gentleman s thoughts were preoccupied as his face showed and he took no notice of a fine Newfoundland dog who watched him attentively and watched every stone too in its turn eager to spring into the river on receiving his master s sign The ferry boat came over however without his receiving any sign and when it grounded his master took him by the collar and walked him into it Not this morning he said to the dog You won t do for ladies company dripping wet Lie down Clennam followed the man and the dog into the boat and took his seat The dog did as he was ordered The man remained standing with his hands in his pockets and towered between Clennam and the prospect Man and dog both jumped lightly out as soon as they touched the other side and went away Clennam was glad to be rid of them The church clock struck the breakfast hour as he walked up the little lane by which the garden gate was approached The moment he pulled the bell a deep loud barking assailed him from within the wall I heard no dog last night thought Clennam The gate was opened by one of the rosy maids and on the lawn were the Newfoundland dog and the man Miss Minnie is not down yet gentlemen said the blushing portress as they all came together in the garden Then she said to the master of the dog mister Clennam sir and tripped away Odd enough mister Clennam that we should have met just now said the man Upon which the dog became mute Allow me to introduce myself Henry Gowan A pretty place this and looks wonderfully well this morning The manner was easy and the voice agreeable but still Clennam thought that if he had not made that decided resolution to avoid falling in love with Pet he would have taken a dislike to this Henry Gowan It s new to you I believe said this Gowan when Arthur had extolled the place Quite new I made acquaintance with it only yesterday afternoon Ah Of course this is not its best aspect It used to look charming in the spring before they went away last time I should like you to have seen it then But for that resolution so often recalled Clennam might have wished him in the crater of Mount Etna in return for this civility I have had the pleasure of seeing it under many circumstances during the last three years and it s a Paradise It was at least it might have been always excepting for that wise resolution like his dexterous impudence to call it a Paradise He only called it a Paradise because he first saw her coming and so made her out within her hearing to be an angel Confusion to him And ah how beaming she looked and how glad How she caressed the dog and how the dog knew her How expressive that heightened colour in her face that fluttered manner her downcast eyes her irresolute happiness When had Clennam seen her look like this Not that there was any reason why he might could would or should have ever seen her look like this or that he had ever hoped for himself to see her look like this but still when had he ever known her do it He stood at a little distance from them This Gowan when he had talked about a Paradise had gone up to her and taken her hand The dog had put his great paws on her arm and laid his head against her dear bosom She had laughed and welcomed them and made far too much of the dog far far too much that is to say supposing there had been any third person looking on who loved her She disengaged herself now and came to Clennam and put her hand in his and wished him good morning and gracefully made as if she would take his arm and be escorted into the house To this Gowan had no objection No he knew he was too safe There was a passing cloud on mister Meagles s good humoured face when they all three four counting the dog and he was the most objectionable but one of the party came in to breakfast Neither it nor the touch of uneasiness on missus Meagles as she directed her eyes towards it was unobserved by Clennam Well Gowan said mister Meagles even suppressing a sigh how goes the world with you this morning Much as usual sir Lion and I being determined not to waste anything of our weekly visit turned out early and came over from Kingston my present headquarters where I am making a sketch or two Then he told how he had met mister Clennam at the ferry and they had come over together missus Gowan is well Henry said missus Meagles Clennam became attentive My mother is quite well thank you Clennam became inattentive I have taken the liberty of making an addition to your family dinner party to day which I hope will not be inconvenient to you or to mister Meagles I couldn t very well get out of it he explained turning to the latter The young fellow wrote to propose himself to me and as he is well connected I thought you would not object to my transferring him here Who is the young fellow asked mister Meagles with peculiar complacency He is one of the Barnacles Tite Barnacle s son Clarence Barnacle who is in his father s Department I can at least guarantee that the river shall not suffer from his visit He won t set it on fire Aye aye said Meagles A Barnacle is he We know something of that family eh Dan By George they are at the top of the tree though Let me see What relation will this young fellow be to Lord Decimus now His Lordship married in seventeen ninety seven Lady Jemima Bilberry who was the second daughter by the third marriage no There I am wrong That was Lady Seraphina Lady Jemima was the first daughter by the second marriage of the fifteenth Earl of Stiltstalking with the Honourable Clementina Toozellem Very well Now this young fellow s father married a Stiltstalking and his father married his cousin who was a Barnacle The father of that father who married a Barnacle married a Joddleby I am getting a little too far back Gowan I want to make out what relation this young fellow is to Lord Decimus That s easily stated His father is nephew to Lord Decimus Nephew to Lord Decimus mister Meagles luxuriously repeated with his eyes shut that he might have nothing to distract him from the full flavour of the genealogical tree By George you are right Gowan So he is Consequently Lord Decimus is his great uncle But stop a bit said mister Meagles opening his eyes with a fresh discovery Then on the mother s side Lady Stiltstalking is his great aunt Of course she is Aye aye aye said mister Meagles with much interest Indeed indeed We shall be glad to see him We ll entertain him as well as we can in our humble way and we shall not starve him I hope at all events In the beginning of this dialogue Clennam had expected some great harmless outburst from mister Meagles like that which had made him burst out of the Circumlocution Office holding Doyce by the collar But his good friend had a weakness which none of us need go into the next street to find and which no amount of Circumlocution experience could long subdue in him Clennam looked at Doyce but Doyce knew all about it beforehand and looked at his plate and made no sign and said no word I am much obliged to you said Gowan to conclude the subject Clarence is a great ass but he is one of the dearest and best fellows that ever lived It appeared before the breakfast was over that everybody whom this Gowan knew was either more or less of an ass or more or less of a knave but was notwithstanding the most lovable the most engaging the simplest truest kindest dearest best fellow that ever lived The process by which this unvarying result was attained whatever the premises might have been stated by mister Henry Gowan thus I claim to be always book keeping with a peculiar nicety in every man s case and posting up a careful little account of Good and Evil with him I do this so conscientiously that I am happy to tell you I find the most worthless of men to be the dearest old fellow too and am in a condition to make the gratifying report that there is much less difference than you are inclined to suppose between an honest man and a scoundrel The effect of this cheering discovery happened to be that while he seemed to be scrupulously finding good in most men he did in reality lower it where it was and set it up where it was not but that was its only disagreeable or dangerous feature It scarcely seemed however to afford mister Meagles as much satisfaction as the Barnacle genealogy had done The cloud that Clennam had never seen upon his face before that morning frequently overcast it again and there was the same shadow of uneasy observation of him on the comely face of his wife More than once or twice when Pet caressed the dog it appeared to Clennam that her father was unhappy in seeing her do it and in one particular instance when Gowan stood on the other side of the dog and bent his head at the same time Arthur fancied that he saw tears rise to mister Meagles s eyes as he hurried out of the room It was either the fact too or he fancied further that Pet herself was not insensible to these little incidents that she tried with a more delicate affection than usual to express to her good father how much she loved him that it was on this account that she fell behind the rest both as they went to church and as they returned from it and took his arm He could not have sworn but that as he walked alone in the garden afterwards he had an instantaneous glimpse of her in her father s room clinging to both her parents with the greatest tenderness and weeping on her father s shoulder The latter part of the day turning out wet they were fain to keep the house look over mister Meagles s collection and beguile the time with conversation This Gowan had plenty to say for himself and said it in an off hand and amusing manner He appeared to be an artist by profession and to have been at Rome some time yet he had a slight careless amateur way with him a perceptible limp both in his devotion to art and his attainments which Clennam could scarcely understand He applied to Daniel Doyce for help as they stood together looking out of window You know mister Gowan he said in a low voice I have seen him here Comes here every Sunday when they are at home An artist I infer from what he says A sort of a one said Daniel Doyce in a surly tone What sort of a one asked Clennam with a smile Why he has sauntered into the Arts at a leisurely Pall Mall pace said Doyce and I doubt if they care to be taken quite so coolly Pursuing his inquiries Clennam found that the Gowan family were a very distant ramification of the Barnacles and that the paternal Gowan originally attached to a legation abroad had been pensioned off as a Commissioner of nothing particular somewhere or other and had died at his post with his drawn salary in his hand nobly defending it to the last extremity In consideration of this eminent public service the Barnacle then in power had recommended the Crown to bestow a pension of two or three hundred a year on his widow to which the next Barnacle in power had added certain shady and sedate apartments in the Palaces at Hampton Court where the old lady still lived deploring the degeneracy of the times in company with several other old ladies of both sexes Her son mister Henry Gowan inheriting from his father the Commissioner that very questionable help in life a very small independence had been difficult to settle the rather as public appointments chanced to be scarce and his genius during his earlier manhood was of that exclusively agricultural character which applies itself to the cultivation of wild oats At last he had declared that he would become a Painter partly because he had always had an idle knack that way and partly to grieve the souls of the Barnacles in chief who had not provided for him So it had come to pass successively first that several distinguished ladies had been frightfully shocked then that portfolios of his performances had been handed about o nights and declared with ecstasy to be perfect Claudes perfect Cuyps perfect phaenomena then that Lord Decimus had bought his picture and had asked the President and Council to dinner at a blow and had said with his own magnificent gravity Do you know there appears to me to be really immense merit in that work and in short that people of condition had absolutely taken pains to bring him into fashion But somehow it had all failed The prejudiced public had stood out against it obstinately They had determined not to admire Lord Decimus s picture They had determined to believe that in every service except their own a man must qualify himself by striving early and late and by working heart and soul might and main So now mister Gowan like that worn out old coffin which never was Mahomet s nor anybody else s hung midway between two points jaundiced and jealous as to the one he had left jaundiced and jealous as to the other that he couldn t reach Such was the substance of Clennam s discoveries concerning him made that rainy Sunday afternoon and afterwards About an hour or so after dinner time Young Barnacle appeared attended by his eye glass in honour of whose family connections mister Meagles had cashiered the pretty parlour maids for the day and had placed on duty in their stead two dingy men Young Barnacle was in the last degree amazed and disconcerted at sight of Arthur and had murmured involuntarily Look here upon my soul you know before his presence of mind returned Even then he was obliged to embrace the earliest opportunity of taking his friend into a window and saying in a nasal way that was a part of his general debility I want to speak to you Gowan I say Look here Who is that fellow A friend of our host s None of mine He s a most ferocious Radical you know said Young Barnacle Is he How do you know Ecod sir he was Pitching into our people the other day in the most tremendous manner Went up to our place and Pitched into my father to that extent that it was necessary to order him out Came back to our Department and Pitched into me Look here You never saw such a fellow What did he want Ecod sir returned Young Barnacle he said he wanted to know you know Pervaded our Department without an appointment and said he wanted to know The stare of indignant wonder with which Young Barnacle accompanied this disclosure would have strained his eyes injuriously but for the opportune relief of dinner mister Meagles who had been extremely solicitous to know how his uncle and aunt were begged him to conduct missus Meagles to the dining room And when he sat on missus Meagles s right hand mister Meagles looked as gratified as if his whole family were there All the natural charm of the previous day was gone The eaters of the dinner like the dinner itself were lukewarm insipid overdone and all owing to this poor little dull Young Barnacle Conversationless at any time he was now the victim of a weakness special to the occasion and solely referable to Clennam He was under a pressing and continual necessity of looking at that gentleman which occasioned his eye glass to get into his soup into his wine glass into missus Meagles s plate to hang down his back like a bell rope and be several times disgracefully restored to his bosom by one of the dingy men Weakened in mind by his frequent losses of this instrument and its determination not to stick in his eye and more and more enfeebled in intellect every time he looked at the mysterious Clennam he applied spoons to his eyes forks and other foreign matters connected with the furniture of the dinner table His discovery of these mistakes greatly increased his difficulties but never released him from the necessity of looking at Clennam And whenever Clennam spoke this ill starred young man was clearly seized with a dread that he was coming by some artful device round to that point of wanting to know you know It may be questioned therefore whether any one but mister Meagles had much enjoyment of the time mister Meagles however thoroughly enjoyed Young Barnacle As a mere flask of the golden water in the tale became a full fountain when it was poured out so mister Meagles seemed to feel that this small spice of Barnacle imparted to his table the flavour of the whole family tree In its presence his frank fine genuine qualities paled he was not so easy he was not so natural he was striving after something that did not belong to him he was not himself What a strange peculiarity on the part of mister Meagles and where should we find another such case At last the wet Sunday wore itself out in a wet night and Young Barnacle went home in a cab feebly smoking and the objectionable Gowan went away on foot accompanied by the objectionable dog Pet had taken the most amiable pains all day to be friendly with Clennam but Clennam had been a little reserved since breakfast that is to say would have been if he had loved her When he had gone to his own room and had again thrown himself into the chair by the fire mister Doyce knocked at the door candle in hand to ask him how and at what hour he proposed returning on the morrow After settling this question he said a word to mister Doyce about this Gowan who would have run in his head a good deal if he had been his rival Those are not good prospects for a painter said Clennam No returned Doyce mister Doyce stood chamber candlestick in hand the other hand in his pocket looking hard at the flame of his candle with a certain quiet perception in his face that they were going to say something more I thought our good friend a little changed and out of spirits after he came this morning said Clennam Yes returned Doyce But not his daughter said Clennam No said Doyce There was a pause on both sides mister Doyce still looking at the flame of his candle slowly resumed The truth is he has twice taken his daughter abroad in the hope of separating her from mister Gowan He rather thinks she is disposed to like him and he has painful doubts I quite agree with him as I dare say you do of the hopefulness of such a marriage There Clennam choked and coughed and stopped Yes you have taken cold said Daniel Doyce But without looking at him There is an engagement between them of course said Clennam airily No As I am told certainly not It has been solicited on the gentleman s part but none has been made Since their recent return our friend has yielded to a weekly visit but that is the utmost Minnie would not deceive her father and mother You have travelled with them and I believe you know what a bond there is among them extending even beyond this present life All that there is between Miss Minnie and mister Gowan I have no doubt we see Ah We see enough cried Arthur mister Doyce wished him Good Night in the tone of a man who had heard a mournful not to say despairing exclamation and who sought to infuse some encouragement and hope into the mind of the person by whom it had been uttered Such tone was probably a part of his oddity as one of a crotchety band for how could he have heard anything of that kind without Clennam s hearing it too The rain fell heavily on the roof and pattered on the ground and dripped among the evergreens and the leafless branches of the trees The rain fell heavily drearily It was a night of tears If Clennam had not decided against falling in love with Pet if he had had the weakness to do it if he had little by little persuaded himself to set all the earnestness of his nature all the might of his hope and all the wealth of his matured character on that cast if he had done this and found that all was lost he would have been that night unutterably miserable As it was As it was the rain fell heavily drearily CHAPTER eighteen Little Dorrit s Lover Little Dorrit had not attained her twenty second birthday without finding a lover Even in the shallow Marshalsea the ever young Archer shot off a few featherless arrows now and then from a mouldy bow and winged a Collegian or two Little Dorrit s lover however was not a Collegian He was the sentimental son of a turnkey His father hoped in the fulness of time to leave him the inheritance of an unstained key and had from his early youth familiarised him with the duties of his office and with an ambition to retain the prison lock in the family While the succession was yet in abeyance he assisted his mother in the conduct of a snug tobacco business round the corner of Horsemonger Lane his father being a non resident turnkey which could usually command a neat connection within the College walls Years agone when the object of his affections was wont to sit in her little arm chair by the high Lodge fender Young John family name Chivery a year older than herself had eyed her with admiring wonder When he had played with her in the yard his favourite game had been to counterfeit locking her up in corners and to counterfeit letting her out for real kisses When he grew tall enough to peep through the keyhole of the great lock of the main door he had divers times set down his father s dinner or supper to get on as it might on the outer side thereof while he stood taking cold in one eye by dint of peeping at her through that airy perspective If Young John had ever slackened in his truth in the less penetrable days of his boyhood when youth is prone to wear its boots unlaced and is happily unconscious of digestive organs he had soon strung it up again and screwed it tight At nineteen his hand had inscribed in chalk on that part of the wall which fronted her lodgings on the occasion of her birthday Welcome sweet nursling of the Fairies At twenty three the same hand falteringly presented cigars on Sundays to the Father of the Marshalsea and Father of the queen of his soul Young John was small of stature with rather weak legs and very weak light hair One of his eyes perhaps the eye that used to peep through the keyhole was also weak and looked larger than the other as if it couldn t collect itself Young John was gentle likewise But he was great of soul Poetical expansive faithful Though too humble before the ruler of his heart to be sanguine Young John had considered the object of his attachment in all its lights and shades Following it out to blissful results he had descried without self commendation a fitness in it Say things prospered and they were united She the child of the Marshalsea he the lock keeper There was a fitness in that Say he became a resident turnkey She would officially succeed to the chamber she had rented so long There was a beautiful propriety in that It looked over the wall if you stood on tip toe and with a trellis work of scarlet beans and a canary or so would become a very Arbour There was a charming idea in that Then being all in all to one another there was even an appropriate grace in the lock With the world shut out except that part of it which would be shut in with its troubles and disturbances only known to them by hearsay as they would be described by the pilgrims tarrying with them on their way to the Insolvent Shrine with the Arbour above and the Lodge below they would glide down the stream of time in pastoral domestic happiness Young John drew tears from his eyes by finishing the picture with a tombstone in the adjoining churchyard close against the prison wall bearing the following touching inscription Sacred to the Memory Of JOHN CHIVERY Sixty years Turnkey and fifty years Head Turnkey Of the neighbouring Marshalsea Who departed this life universally respected on the thirty first of December One thousand eight hundred and eighty six Aged eighty three years Also of his truly beloved and truly loving wife AMY whose maiden name was DORRIT Who survived his loss not quite forty eight hours And who breathed her last in the Marshalsea aforesaid There she was born There she lived There she died The Chivery parents were not ignorant of their son s attachment indeed it had on some exceptional occasions thrown him into a state of mind that had impelled him to conduct himself with irascibility towards the customers and damage the business but they in their turns had worked it out to desirable conclusions missus Chivery a prudent woman had desired her husband to take notice that their John s prospects of the Lock would certainly be strengthened by an alliance with Miss Dorrit who had herself a kind of claim upon the College and was much respected there missus Chivery had desired her husband to take notice that if on the one hand their John had means and a post of trust on the other hand Miss Dorrit had family and that her missus Chivery s sentiment was that two halves made a whole missus Chivery speaking as a mother and not as a diplomatist had then from a different point of view desired her husband to recollect that their John had never been strong and that his love had fretted and worrited him enough as it was without his being driven to do himself a mischief as nobody couldn t say he wouldn t be if he was crossed These arguments had so powerfully influenced the mind of mister Chivery who was a man of few words that he had on sundry Sunday mornings given his boy what he termed a lucky touch signifying that he considered such commendation of him to Good Fortune preparatory to his that day declaring his passion and becoming triumphant But Young John had never taken courage to make the declaration and it was principally on these occasions that he had returned excited to the tobacco shop and flown at the customers In this affair as in every other Little Dorrit herself was the last person considered Her brother and sister were aware of it and attained a sort of station by making a peg of it on which to air the miserably ragged old fiction of the family gentility Her sister asserted the family gentility by flouting the poor swain as he loitered about the prison for glimpses of his dear Tip asserted the family gentility and his own by coming out in the character of the aristocratic brother and loftily swaggering in the little skittle ground respecting seizures by the scruff of the neck which there were looming probabilities of some gentleman unknown executing on some little puppy not mentioned These were not the only members of the Dorrit family who turned it to account No no The Father of the Marshalsea was supposed to know nothing about the matter of course his poor dignity could not see so low But he took the cigars on Sundays and was glad to get them and sometimes even condescended to walk up and down the yard with the donor who was proud and hopeful then and benignantly to smoke one in his society With no less readiness and condescension did he receive attentions from Chivery Senior who always relinquished his arm chair and newspaper to him when he came into the Lodge during one of his spells of duty and who had even mentioned to him that if he would like at any time after dusk quietly to step out into the fore court and take a look at the street there was not much to prevent him If he did not avail himself of this latter civility it was only because he had lost the relish for it inasmuch as he took everything else he could get and would say at times Extremely civil person Chivery very attentive man and very respectful Young Chivery too really almost with a delicate perception of one s position here A very well conducted family indeed the Chiveries Their behaviour gratifies me The devoted Young John all this time regarded the family with reverence He never dreamed of disputing their pretensions but did homage to the miserable Mumbo jumbo they paraded As to resenting any affront from her brother he would have felt even if he had not naturally been of a most pacific disposition that to wag his tongue or lift his hand against that sacred gentleman would be an unhallowed act He was sorry that his noble mind should take offence still he felt the fact to be not incompatible with its nobility and sought to propitiate and conciliate that gallant soul Her father a gentleman in misfortune a gentleman of a fine spirit and courtly manners who always bore with him he deeply honoured Her sister he considered somewhat vain and proud but a young lady of infinite accomplishments who could not forget the past It was an instinctive testimony to Little Dorrit s worth and difference from all the rest that the poor young fellow honoured and loved her for being simply what she was The tobacco business round the corner of Horsemonger Lane was carried out in a rural establishment one story high which had the benefit of the air from the yards of Horsemonger Lane jail and the advantage of a retired walk under the wall of that pleasant establishment The business was of too modest a character to support a life size Highlander but it maintained a little one on a bracket on the door post who looked like a fallen Cherub that had found it necessary to take to a kilt From the portal thus decorated one Sunday after an early dinner of baked viands Young John issued forth on his usual Sunday errand not empty handed but with his offering of cigars He was neatly attired in a plum coloured coat with as large a collar of black velvet as his figure could carry a silken waistcoat bedecked with golden sprigs a chaste neckerchief much in vogue at that day representing a preserve of lilac pheasants on a buff ground pantaloons so highly decorated with side stripes that each leg was a three stringed lute and a hat of state very high and hard When the prudent missus Chivery perceived that in addition to these adornments her John carried a pair of white kid gloves and a cane like a little finger post surmounted by an ivory hand marshalling him the way that he should go and when she saw him in this heavy marching order turn the corner to the right she remarked to mister Chivery who was at home at the time that she thought she knew which way the wind blew The Collegians were entertaining a considerable number of visitors that Sunday afternoon and their Father kept his room for the purpose of receiving presentations After making the tour of the yard Little Dorrit s lover with a hurried heart went up stairs and knocked with his knuckles at the Father s door Come in come in said a gracious voice The Father s voice her father s the Marshalsea s father s He was seated in his black velvet cap with his newspaper three and sixpence accidentally left on the table and two chairs arranged Everything prepared for holding his Court Ah Young John How do you do how do you do Pretty well I thank you sir I hope you are the same Yes John Chivery yes Nothing to complain of I have taken the liberty sir of Eh The Father of the Marshalsea always lifted up his eyebrows at this point and became amiably distraught and smilingly absent in mind A few cigars sir Oh For the moment excessively surprised Thank you Young John thank you But really I am afraid I am too No Well then I will say no more about it Put them on the mantelshelf if you please Young John And sit down sit down You are not a stranger John Thank you sir I am sure Miss here Young John turned the great hat round and round upon his left hand like a slowly twirling mouse cage Miss Amy quite well sir Yes John yes very well She is out Indeed sir Yes John Miss Amy is gone for an airing My young people all go out a good deal But at their time of life it s natural John Very much so I am sure sir An airing An airing Yes He was blandly tapping his fingers on the table and casting his eyes up at the window Amy has gone for an airing on the Iron Bridge She has become quite partial to the Iron Bridge of late and seems to like to walk there better than anywhere He returned to conversation Your father is not on duty at present I think John No sir he comes on later in the afternoon Another twirl of the great hat and then Young John said rising I am afraid I must wish you good day sir So soon Good day Young John Nay nay with the utmost condescension never mind your glove John Shake hands with it on You are no stranger here you know Highly gratified by the kindness of his reception Young John descended the staircase On his way down he met some Collegians bringing up visitors to be presented and at that moment mister Dorrit happened to call over the banisters with particular distinctness Much obliged to you for your little testimonial John Little Dorrit s lover very soon laid down his penny on the tollplate of the Iron Bridge and came upon it looking about him for the well known and well beloved figure At first he feared she was not there but as he walked on towards the Middlesex side he saw her standing still looking at the water She was absorbed in thought and he wondered what she might be thinking about There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys more free from smoke than on week days and there were the distant masts and steeples Perhaps she was thinking about them Little Dorrit mused so long and was so entirely preoccupied that although her lover stood quiet for what he thought was a long time and twice or thrice retired and came back again to the former spot still she did not move So in the end he made up his mind to go on and seem to come upon her casually in passing and speak to her The place was quiet and now or never was the time to speak to her He walked on and she did not appear to hear his steps until he was close upon her When he said Miss Dorrit she started and fell back from him with an expression in her face of fright and something like dislike that caused him unutterable dismay She had often avoided him before always indeed for a long long while She had turned away and glided off so often when she had seen him coming toward her that the unfortunate Young John could not think it accidental But he had hoped that it might be shyness her retiring character her foreknowledge of the state of his heart anything short of aversion Now that momentary look had said You of all people I would rather have seen any one on earth than you It was but a momentary look inasmuch as she checked it and said in her soft little voice Oh mister John Is it you But she felt what it had been as he felt what it had been and they stood looking at one another equally confused Miss Amy I am afraid I disturbed you by speaking to you Yes rather I I came here to be alone and I thought I was Miss Amy I took the liberty of walking this way because mister Dorrit chanced to mention when I called upon him just now that you She caused him more dismay than before by suddenly murmuring O father father in a heartrending tone and turning her face away Miss Amy I hope I don t give you any uneasiness by naming mister Dorrit I assure you I found him very well and in the best of Spirits and he showed me even more than his usual kindness being so very kind as to say that I was not a stranger there and in all ways gratifying me very much To the inexpressible consternation of her lover Little Dorrit with her hands to her averted face and rocking herself where she stood as if she were in pain murmured O father how can you O dear dear father how can you can you do it The poor fellow stood gazing at her overflowing with sympathy but not knowing what to make of this until having taken out her handkerchief and put it to her still averted face she hurried away At first he remained stock still then hurried after her Miss Amy pray Will you have the goodness to stop a moment Miss Amy if it comes to that let ME go I shall go out of my senses if I have to think that I have driven you away like this His trembling voice and unfeigned earnestness brought Little Dorrit to a stop Oh I don t know what to do she cried I don t know what to do To Young John who had never seen her bereft of her quiet self command who had seen her from her infancy ever so reliable and self suppressed there was a shock in her distress and in having to associate himself with it as its cause that shook him from his great hat to the pavement He felt it necessary to explain himself He might be misunderstood supposed to mean something or to have done something that had never entered into his imagination He begged her to hear him explain himself as the greatest favour she could show him Miss Amy I know very well that your family is far above mine It were vain to conceal it There never was a Chivery a gentleman that ever I heard of and I will not commit the meanness of making a false representation on a subject so momentous Miss Amy I know very well that your high souled brother and likewise your spirited sister spurn me from a height What I have to do is to respect them to wish to be admitted to their friendship to look up at the eminence on which they are placed from my lowlier station for whether viewed as tobacco or viewed as the lock I well know it is lowly and ever wish them well and happy There really was a genuineness in the poor fellow and a contrast between the hardness of his hat and the softness of his heart albeit perhaps of his head too that was moving Little Dorrit entreated him to disparage neither himself nor his station and above all things to divest himself of any idea that she supposed hers to be superior This gave him a little comfort Miss Amy he then stammered I have had for a long time ages they seem to me Revolving ages a heart cherished wish to say something to you May I say it Little Dorrit involuntarily started from his side again with the faintest shadow of her former look conquering that she went on at great speed half across the Bridge without replying May I Miss Amy I but ask the question humbly may I say it I have been so unlucky already in giving you pain without having any such intentions before the holy Heavens that there is no fear of my saying it unless I have your leave I can be miserable alone I can be cut up by myself why should I also make miserable and cut up one that I would fling myself off that parapet to give half a moment s joy to Not that that s much to do for I d do it for twopence The mournfulness of his spirits and the gorgeousness of his appearance might have made him ridiculous but that his delicacy made him respectable Little Dorrit learnt from it what to do If you please John Chivery she returned trembling but in a quiet way since you are so considerate as to ask me whether you shall say any more if you please no Never Miss Amy No if you please Never O Lord gasped Young John But perhaps you will let me instead say something to you I want to say it earnestly and with as plain a meaning as it is possible to express When you think of us John I mean my brother and sister and me don t think of us as being any different from the rest for whatever we once were which I hardly know we ceased to be long ago and never can be any more It will be much better for you and much better for others if you will do that instead of what you are doing now Young John dolefully protested that he would try to bear it in mind and would be heartily glad to do anything she wished As to me said Little Dorrit think as little of me as you can the less the better When you think of me at all John let it only be as the child you have seen grow up in the prison with one set of duties always occupying her as a weak retired contented unprotected girl I particularly want you to remember that when I come outside the gate I am unprotected and solitary He would try to do anything she wished But why did Miss Amy so much want him to remember that Because returned Little Dorrit I know I can then quite trust you not to forget to day and not to say any more to me You are so generous that I know I can trust to you for that and I do and I always will I am going to show you at once that I fully trust you I like this place where we are speaking better than any place I know her slight colour had faded but her lover thought he saw it coming back just then and I may be often here I know it is only necessary for me to tell you so to be quite sure that you will never come here again in search of me And I am quite sure She might rely upon it said Young John He was a miserable wretch but her word was more than a law for him And good bye John said Little Dorrit And I hope you will have a good wife one day and be a happy man I am sure you will deserve to be happy and you will be John As she held out her hand to him with these words the heart that was under the waistcoat of sprigs mere slop work if the truth must be known swelled to the size of the heart of a gentleman and the poor common little fellow having no room to hold it burst into tears Oh don t cry said Little Dorrit piteously Don t don t Good bye John God bless you Good bye Miss Amy Good bye And so he left her first observing that she sat down on the corner of a seat and not only rested her little hand upon the rough wall but laid her face against it too as if her head were heavy and her mind were sad It was an affecting illustration of the fallacy of human projects to behold her lover with the great hat pulled over his eyes the velvet collar turned up as if it rained the plum coloured coat buttoned to conceal the silken waistcoat of golden sprigs and the little direction post pointing inexorably home creeping along by the worst back streets and composing as he went the following new inscription for a tombstone in saint George s Churchyard Here lie the mortal remains Of JOHN CHIVERY Never anything worth mentioning Who died about the end of the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty six Of a broken heart Requesting with his last breath that the word AMY might be inscribed over his ashes which was accordingly directed to be done By his afflicted Parents CHAPTER nineteen The Father of the Marshalsea in two or three Relations The brothers William and Frederick Dorrit walking up and down the College yard of course on the aristocratic or Pump side for the Father made it a point of his state to be chary of going among his children on the Poor side except on Sunday mornings Christmas Days and other occasions of ceremony in the observance whereof he was very punctual and at which times he laid his hand upon the heads of their infants and blessed those young insolvents with a benignity that was highly edifying the brothers walking up and down the College yard together were a memorable sight Frederick the free was so humbled bowed withered and faded William the bond was so courtly condescending and benevolently conscious of a position that in this regard only if in no other the brothers were a spectacle to wonder at They walked up and down the yard on the evening of Little Dorrit s Sunday interview with her lover on the Iron Bridge The cares of state were over for that day the Drawing Room had been well attended several new presentations had taken place the three and sixpence accidentally left on the table had accidentally increased to twelve shillings and the Father of the Marshalsea refreshed himself with a whiff of cigar As he walked up and down affably accommodating his step to the shuffle of his brother not proud in his superiority but considerate of that poor creature bearing with him and breathing toleration of his infirmities in every little puff of smoke that issued from his lips and aspired to get over the spiked wall he was a sight to wonder at His brother Frederick of the dim eye palsied hand bent form and groping mind submissively shuffled at his side accepting his patronage as he accepted every incident of the labyrinthian world in which he had got lost He held the usual screwed bit of whitey brown paper in his hand from which he ever and again unscrewed a spare pinch of snuff That falteringly taken he would glance at his brother not unadmiringly put his hands behind him and shuffle on so at his side until he took another pinch or stood still to look about him perchance suddenly missing his clarionet The College visitors were melting away as the shades of night drew on but the yard was still pretty full the Collegians being mostly out seeing their friends to the Lodge As the brothers paced the yard William the bond looked about him to receive salutes returned them by graciously lifting off his hat and with an engaging air prevented Frederick the free from running against the company or being jostled against the wall The Collegians as a body were not easily impressible but even they according to their various ways of wondering appeared to find in the two brothers a sight to wonder at You are a little low this evening Frederick said the Father of the Marshalsea Anything the matter The matter He stared for a moment and then dropped his head and eyes again No William no Nothing is the matter If you could be persuaded to smarten yourself up a little Frederick Aye aye said the old man hurriedly But I can t be I can t be Don t talk so That s all over The Father of the Marshalsea glanced at a passing Collegian with whom he was on friendly terms as who should say An enfeebled old man this but he is my brother sir my brother and the voice of Nature is potent and steered his brother clear of the handle of the pump by the threadbare sleeve Nothing would have been wanting to the perfection of his character as a fraternal guide philosopher and friend if he had only steered his brother clear of ruin instead of bringing it upon him I think William said the object of his affectionate consideration that I am tired and will go home to bed My dear Frederick returned the other don t let me detain you don t sacrifice your inclination to me Late hours and a heated atmosphere and years I suppose said Frederick weaken me My dear Frederick returned the Father of the Marshalsea do you think you are sufficiently careful of yourself Do you think your habits are as precise and methodical as shall I say as mine are Not to revert again to that little eccentricity which I mentioned just now I doubt if you take air and exercise enough Frederick Here is the parade always at your service Why not use it more regularly than you do Hah sighed the other Yes yes yes yes But it is of no use saying yes yes my dear Frederick the Father of the Marshalsea in his mild wisdom persisted unless you act on that assent Consider my case Frederick I am a kind of example Necessity and time have taught me what to do At certain stated hours of the day you will find me on the parade in my room in the Lodge reading the paper receiving company eating and drinking I have impressed upon Amy during many years that I must have my meals for instance punctually Amy has grown up in a sense of the importance of these arrangements and you know what a good girl she is The brother only sighed again as he plodded dreamily along Hah Yes yes yes yes My dear fellow said the Father of the Marshalsea laying his hand upon his shoulder and mildly rallying him mildly because of his weakness poor dear soul you said that before and it does not express much Frederick even if it means much I wish I could rouse you my good Frederick you want to be roused Yes William yes No doubt returned the other lifting his dim eyes to his face But I am not like you The Father of the Marshalsea said with a shrug of modest self depreciation Oh You might be like me my dear Frederick you might be if you chose and forbore in the magnanimity of his strength to press his fallen brother further There was a great deal of leave taking going on in corners as was usual on Sunday nights and here and there in the dark some poor woman wife or mother was weeping with a new Collegian The time had been when the Father himself had wept in the shades of that yard as his own poor wife had wept But it was many years ago and now he was like a passenger aboard ship in a long voyage who has recovered from sea sickness and is impatient of that weakness in the fresher passengers taken aboard at the last port He was inclined to remonstrate and to express his opinion that people who couldn t get on without crying had no business there In manner if not in words he always testified his displeasure at these interruptions of the general harmony and it was so well understood that delinquents usually withdrew if they were aware of him On this Sunday evening he accompanied his brother to the gate with an air of endurance and clemency being in a bland temper and graciously disposed to overlook the tears In the flaring gaslight of the Lodge several Collegians were basking some taking leave of visitors and some who had no visitors watching the frequent turning of the key and conversing with one another and with mister Chivery The paternal entrance made a sensation of course and mister Chivery touching his hat in a short manner though with his key hoped he found himself tolerable Thank you Chivery quite well And you mister Chivery said in a low growl Oh he was all right Which was his general way of acknowledging inquiries after his health when a little sullen I had a visit from Young John to day Chivery And very smart he looked I assure you So mister Chivery had heard mister Chivery must confess however that his wish was that the boy didn t lay out so much money upon it For what did it bring him in It only brought him in wexation And he could get that anywhere for nothing How vexation Chivery asked the benignant father No odds returned mister Chivery Never mind mister Frederick going out Yes Chivery my brother is going home to bed He is tired and not quite well Take care Frederick take care Good night my dear Frederick Shaking hands with his brother and touching his greasy hat to the company in the Lodge Frederick slowly shuffled out of the door which mister Chivery unlocked for him The Father of the Marshalsea showed the amiable solicitude of a superior being that he should come to no harm Be so kind as to keep the door open a moment Chivery that I may see him go along the passage and down the steps Take care Frederick He is very infirm Mind the steps He is so very absent Be careful how you cross Frederick I really don t like the notion of his going wandering at large he is so extremely liable to be run over With these words and with a face expressive of many uneasy doubts and much anxious guardianship he turned his regards upon the assembled company in the Lodge so plainly indicating that his brother was to be pitied for not being under lock and key that an opinion to that effect went round among the Collegians assembled But he did not receive it with unqualified assent on the contrary he said No gentlemen no let them not misunderstand him His brother Frederick was much broken no doubt and it might be more comfortable to himself the Father of the Marshalsea to know that he was safe within the walls Still it must be remembered that to support an existence there during many years required a certain combination of qualities he did not say high qualities but qualities moral qualities Now had his brother Frederick that peculiar union of qualities Gentlemen he was a most excellent man a most gentle tender and estimable man with the simplicity of a child but would he though unsuited for most other places do for that place No he said confidently no And he said Heaven forbid that Frederick should be there in any other character than in his present voluntary character Gentlemen whoever came to that College to remain there a length of time must have strength of character to go through a good deal and to come out of a good deal Was his beloved brother Frederick that man No They saw him even as it was crushed Misfortune crushed him He had not power of recoil enough not elasticity enough to be a long time in such a place and yet preserve his self respect and feel conscious that he was a gentleman Frederick had not if he might use the expression Power enough to see in any delicate little attentions and and Testimonials that he might under such circumstances receive the goodness of human nature the fine spirit animating the Collegians as a community and at the same time no degradation to himself and no depreciation of his claims as a gentleman Gentlemen God bless you Such was the homily with which he improved and pointed the occasion to the company in the Lodge before turning into the sallow yard again and going with his own poor shabby dignity past the Collegian in the dressing gown who had no coat and past the Collegian in the sea side slippers who had no shoes and past the stout greengrocer Collegian in the corduroy knee breeches who had no cares and past the lean clerk Collegian in buttonless black who had no hopes up his own poor shabby staircase to his own poor shabby room There the table was laid for his supper and his old grey gown was ready for him on his chair back at the fire His daughter put her little prayer book in her pocket had she been praying for pity on all prisoners and captives and rose to welcome him Uncle had gone home then she asked as she changed his coat and gave him his black velvet cap Yes uncle had gone home Had her father enjoyed his walk Why not much Amy not much No Did he not feel quite well As she stood behind him leaning over his chair so lovingly he looked with downcast eyes at the fire An uneasiness stole over him that was like a touch of shame and when he spoke as he presently did it was in an unconnected and embarrassed manner Something I hem I don t know what has gone wrong with Chivery He is not ha not nearly so obliging and attentive as usual to night It hem it s a little thing but it puts me out my love It s impossible to forget turning his hands over and over and looking closely at them that hem that in such a life as mine I am unfortunately dependent on these men for something every hour in the day Her arm was on his shoulder but she did not look in his face while he spoke Bending her head she looked another way I hem I can t think Amy what has given Chivery offence He is generally so so very attentive and respectful And to night he was quite quite short with me Other people there too Why good Heaven if I was to lose the support and recognition of Chivery and his brother officers I might starve to death here While he spoke he was opening and shutting his hands like valves so conscious all the time of that touch of shame that he shrunk before his own knowledge of his meaning I ha I can t think what it s owing to I am sure I cannot imagine what the cause of it is There was a certain Jackson here once a turnkey of the name of Jackson I don t think you can remember him my dear you were very young and hem and he had a brother and this young brother paid his addresses to at least did not go so far as to pay his addresses to but admired respectfully admired the not daughter the sister of one of us a rather distinguished Collegian I may say very much so His name was Captain Martin and he consulted me on the question whether It was necessary that his daughter sister should hazard offending the turnkey brother by being too ha too plain with the other brother Captain Martin was a gentleman and a man of honour and I put it to him first to give me his his own opinion Captain Martin highly respected in the army then unhesitatingly said that it appeared to him that his hem sister was not called upon to understand the young man too distinctly and that she might lead him on I am doubtful whether lead him on was Captain Martin s exact expression indeed I think he said tolerate him on her father s I should say brother s account I hardly know how I have strayed into this story I suppose it has been through being unable to account for Chivery but as to the connection between the two I don t see His voice died away as if she could not bear the pain of hearing him and her hand had gradually crept to his lips For a little while there was a dead silence and stillness and he remained shrunk in his chair and she remained with her arm round his neck and her head bowed down upon his shoulder His supper was cooking in a saucepan on the fire and when she moved it was to make it ready for him on the table He took his usual seat she took hers and he began his meal They did not as yet look at one another By little and little he began laying down his knife and fork with a noise taking things up sharply biting at his bread as if he were offended with it and in other similar ways showing that he was out of sorts At length he pushed his plate from him and spoke aloud with the strangest inconsistency What does it matter whether I eat or starve What does it matter whether such a blighted life as mine comes to an end now next week or next year What am I worth to anyone A poor prisoner fed on alms and broken victuals a squalid disgraced wretch Father father As he rose she went on her knees to him and held up her hands to him Amy he went on in a suppressed voice trembling violently and looking at her as wildly as if he had gone mad I tell you if you could see me as your mother saw me you wouldn t believe it to be the creature you have only looked at through the bars of this cage I was young I was accomplished I was good looking I was independent by God I was child and people sought me out and envied me Envied me Dear father She tried to take down the shaking arm that he flourished in the air but he resisted and put her hand away If I had but a picture of myself in those days though it was ever so ill done you would be proud of it you would be proud of it But I have no such thing Now let me be a warning Let no man he cried looking haggardly about fail to preserve at least that little of the times of his prosperity and respect Let his children have that clue to what he was Unless my face when I am dead subsides into the long departed look they say such things happen I don t know my children will have never seen me Father father O despise me despise me Look away from me don t listen to me stop me blush for me cry for me even you Amy Do it do it I do it to myself I am hardened now I have sunk too low to care long even for that Dear father loved father darling of my heart She was clinging to him with her arms and she got him to drop into his chair again and caught at the raised arm and tried to put it round her neck Let it lie there father Look at me father kiss me father Only think of me father for one little moment Still he went on in the same wild way though it was gradually breaking down into a miserable whining And yet I have some respect here I have made some stand against it I am not quite trodden down Go out and ask who is the chief person in the place They ll tell you it s your father Go out and ask who is never trifled with and who is always treated with some delicacy They ll say your father Go out and ask what funeral here it must be here I know it can be nowhere else will make more talk and perhaps more grief than any that has ever gone out at the gate They ll say your father s Well then Amy Amy Is your father so universally despised Is there nothing to redeem him Will you have nothing to remember him by but his ruin and decay Will you be able to have no affection for him when he is gone poor castaway gone He burst into tears of maudlin pity for himself and at length suffering her to embrace him and take charge of him let his grey head rest against her cheek and bewailed his wretchedness Presently he changed the subject of his lamentations and clasping his hands about her as she embraced him cried O Amy his motherless forlorn child O the days that he had seen her careful and laborious for him Then he reverted to himself and weakly told her how much better she would have loved him if she had known him in his vanished character and how he would have married her to a gentleman who should have been proud of her as his daughter and how at which he cried again she should first have ridden at his fatherly side on her own horse and how the crowd by which he meant in effect the people who had given him the twelve shillings he then had in his pocket should have trudged the dusty roads respectfully Thus now boasting now despairing in either fit a captive with the jail rot upon him and the impurity of his prison worn into the grain of his soul he revealed his degenerate state to his affectionate child No one else ever beheld him in the details of his humiliation Little recked the Collegians who were laughing in their rooms over his late address in the Lodge what a serious picture they had in their obscure gallery of the Marshalsea that Sunday night There was a classical daughter once perhaps who ministered to her father in his prison as her mother had ministered to her Little Dorrit though of the unheroic modern stock and mere English did much more in comforting her father s wasted heart upon her innocent breast and turning to it a fountain of love and fidelity that never ran dry or waned through all his years of famine She soothed him asked him for his forgiveness if she had been or seemed to have been undutiful told him Heaven knows truly that she could not honour him more if he were the favourite of Fortune and the whole world acknowledged him When his tears were dried and he sobbed in his weakness no longer and was free from that touch of shame and had recovered his usual bearing she prepared the remains of his supper afresh and sitting by his side rejoiced to see him eat and drink For now he sat in his black velvet cap and old grey gown magnanimous again and would have comported himself towards any Collegian who might have looked in to ask his advice like a great moral Lord Chesterfield or Master of the ethical ceremonies of the Marshalsea To keep his attention engaged she talked with him about his wardrobe when he was pleased to say that Yes indeed those shirts she proposed would be exceedingly acceptable for those he had were worn out and being ready made had never fitted him Being conversational and in a reasonable flow of spirits he then invited her attention to his coat as it hung behind the door remarking that the Father of the place would set an indifferent example to his children already disposed to be slovenly if he went among them out at elbows He was jocular too as to the heeling of his shoes but became grave on the subject of his cravat and promised her that when she could afford it she should buy him a new one While he smoked out his cigar in peace she made his bed and put the small room in order for his repose Being weary then owing to the advanced hour and his emotions he came out of his chair to bless her and wish her Good night All this time he had never once thought of HER dress her shoes her need of anything No other person upon earth save herself could have been so unmindful of her wants He kissed her many times with Bless you my love Good night MY dear But her gentle breast had been so deeply wounded by what she had seen of him that she was unwilling to leave him alone lest he should lament and despair again Father dear I am not tired let me come back presently when you are in bed and sit by you He asked her with an air of protection if she felt solitary Yes father Then come back by all means my love I shall be very quiet father Don t think of me my dear he said giving her his kind permission fully Come back by all means He seemed to be dozing when she returned and she put the low fire together very softly lest she should awake him But he overheard her and called out who was that Only Amy father Amy my child come here I want to say a word to you He raised himself a little in his low bed as she kneeled beside it to bring her face near him and put his hand between hers O Both the private father and the Father of the Marshalsea were strong within him then My love you have had a life of hardship here No companions no recreations many cares I am afraid Don t think of that dear I never do You know my position Amy I have not been able to do much for you but all I have been able to do I have done Yes my dear father she rejoined kissing him I know I know I am in the twenty third year of my life here he said with a catch in his breath that was not so much a sob as an irrepressible sound of self approval the momentary outburst of a noble consciousness It is all I could do for my children I have done it Amy my love you are by far the best loved of the three I have had you principally in my mind whatever I have done for your sake my dear child I have done freely and without murmuring Only the wisdom that holds the clue to all hearts and all mysteries can surely know to what extent a man especially a man brought down as this man had been can impose upon himself Enough for the present place that he lay down with wet eyelashes serene in a manner majestic after bestowing his life of degradation as a sort of portion on the devoted child upon whom its miseries had fallen so heavily and whose love alone had saved him to be even what he was That child had no doubts asked herself no question for she was but too content to see him with a lustre round his head Poor dear good dear truest kindest dearest were the only words she had for him as she hushed him to rest She never left him all that night As if she had done him a wrong which her tenderness could hardly repair she sat by him in his sleep at times softly kissing him with suspended breath and calling him in a whisper by some endearing name At times she stood aside so as not to intercept the low fire light and watching him when it fell upon his sleeping face wondered did he look now at all as he had looked when he was prosperous and happy as he had so touched her by imagining that he might look once more in that awful time At the thought of that time she kneeled beside his bed again and prayed O spare his life O save him to me O look down upon my dear long suffering unfortunate much changed dear dear father Not until the morning came to protect him and encourage him did she give him a last kiss and leave the small room When she had stolen down stairs and along the empty yard and had crept up to her own high garret the smokeless housetops and the distant country hills were discernible over the wall in the clear morning As she gently opened the window and looked eastward down the prison yard the spikes upon the wall were tipped with red then made a sullen purple pattern on the sun as it came flaming up into the heavens The spikes had never looked so sharp and cruel nor the bars so heavy nor the prison space so gloomy and contracted She thought of the sunrise on rolling rivers of the sunrise on wide seas of the sunrise on rich landscapes of the sunrise on great forests where the birds were waking and the trees were rustling and she looked down into the living grave on which the sun had risen with her father in it three and twenty years and said in a burst of sorrow and compassion No no I have never seen him in my life CHAPTER twenty Moving in Society If Young John Chivery had had the inclination and the power to write a satire on family pride he would have had no need to go for an avenging illustration out of the family of his beloved He would have found it amply in that gallant brother and that dainty sister so steeped in mean experiences and so loftily conscious of the family name so ready to beg or borrow from the poorest to eat of anybody s bread spend anybody s money drink from anybody s cup and break it afterwards To have painted the sordid facts of their lives and they throughout invoking the death s head apparition of the family gentility to come and scare their benefactors would have made Young John a satirist of the first water Tip had turned his liberty to hopeful account by becoming a billiard marker He had troubled himself so little as to the means of his release that Clennam scarcely needed to have been at the pains of impressing the mind of mister Plornish on that subject Whoever had paid him the compliment he very readily accepted the compliment with HIS compliments and there was an end of it Issuing forth from the gate on these easy terms he became a billiard marker and now occasionally looked in at the little skittle ground in a green Newmarket coat second hand with a shining collar and bright buttons new and drank the beer of the Collegians One solid stationary point in the looseness of this gentleman s character was that he respected and admired his sister Amy The feeling had never induced him to spare her a moment s uneasiness or to put himself to any restraint or inconvenience on her account but with that Marshalsea taint upon his love he loved her The same rank Marshalsea flavour was to be recognised in his distinctly perceiving that she sacrificed her life to her father and in his having no idea that she had done anything for himself When this spirited young man and his sister had begun systematically to produce the family skeleton for the overawing of the College this narrative cannot precisely state Probably at about the period when they began to dine on the College charity It is certain that the more reduced and necessitous they were the more pompously the skeleton emerged from its tomb and that when there was anything particularly shabby in the wind the skeleton always came out with the ghastliest flourish Little Dorrit was late on the Monday morning for her father slept late and afterwards there was his breakfast to prepare and his room to arrange She had no engagement to go out to work however and therefore stayed with him until with Maggy s help she had put everything right about him and had seen him off upon his morning walk of twenty yards or so to the coffee house to read the paper She then got on her bonnet and went out having been anxious to get out much sooner There was as usual a cessation of the small talk in the Lodge as she passed through it and a Collegian who had come in on Saturday night received the intimation from the elbow of a more seasoned Collegian Look out Here she is She wanted to see her sister but when she got round to mister Cripples s she found that both her sister and her uncle had gone to the theatre where they were engaged Having taken thought of this probability by the way and having settled that in such case she would follow them she set off afresh for the theatre which was on that side of the river and not very far away Little Dorrit was almost as ignorant of the ways of theatres as of the ways of gold mines and when she was directed to a furtive sort of door with a curious up all night air about it that appeared to be ashamed of itself and to be hiding in an alley she hesitated to approach it being further deterred by the sight of some half dozen close shaved gentlemen with their hats very strangely on who were lounging about the door looking not at all unlike Collegians On her applying to them reassured by this resemblance for a direction to Miss Dorrit they made way for her to enter a dark hall it was more like a great grim lamp gone out than anything else where she could hear the distant playing of music and the sound of dancing feet A man so much in want of airing that he had a blue mould upon him sat watching this dark place from a hole in a corner like a spider and he told her that he would send a message up to Miss Dorrit by the first lady or gentleman who went through The first lady who went through had a roll of music half in her muff and half out of it and was in such a tumbled condition altogether that it seemed as if it would be an act of kindness to iron her But as she was very good natured and said Come with me I ll soon find Miss Dorrit for you Miss Dorrit s sister went with her drawing nearer and nearer at every step she took in the darkness to the sound of music and the sound of dancing feet At last they came into a maze of dust where a quantity of people were tumbling over one another and where there was such a confusion of unaccountable shapes of beams bulkheads brick walls ropes and rollers and such a mixing of gaslight and daylight that they seemed to have got on the wrong side of the pattern of the universe Little Dorrit left to herself and knocked against by somebody every moment was quite bewildered when she heard her sister s voice Why good gracious Amy what ever brought you here I wanted to see you Fanny dear and as I am going out all day to morrow and knew you might be engaged all day to day I thought But the idea Amy of YOU coming behind I never did As her sister said this in no very cordial tone of welcome she conducted her to a more open part of the maze where various golden chairs and tables were heaped together and where a number of young ladies were sitting on anything they could find chattering All these young ladies wanted ironing and all had a curious way of looking everywhere while they chattered Just as the sisters arrived here a monotonous boy in a Scotch cap put his head round a beam on the left and said Less noise there ladies and disappeared Immediately after which a sprightly gentleman with a quantity of long black hair looked round a beam on the right and said Less noise there darlings and also disappeared The notion of you among professionals Amy is really the last thing I could have conceived said her sister Why how did you ever get here I don t know The lady who told you I was here was so good as to bring me in Like you quiet little things You can make your way anywhere I believe I couldn t have managed it Amy though I know so much more of the world It was the family custom to lay it down as family law that she was a plain domestic little creature without the great and sage experience of the rest This family fiction was the family assertion of itself against her services Not to make too much of them Well And what have you got on your mind Amy Of course you have got something on your mind about me said Fanny She spoke as if her sister between two and three years her junior were her prejudiced grandmother It is not much but since you told me of the lady who gave you the bracelet Fanny The monotonous boy put his head round the beam on the left and said Look out there ladies and disappeared The sprightly gentleman with the black hair as suddenly put his head round the beam on the right and said Look out there darlings and also disappeared Thereupon all the young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind Well Amy said Fanny doing as the rest did what were you going to say Since you told me a lady had given you the bracelet you showed me Fanny I have not been quite easy on your account and indeed want to know a little more if you will confide more to me Now ladies said the boy in the Scotch cap Now darlings said the gentleman with the black hair They were every one gone in a moment and the music and the dancing feet were heard again Little Dorrit sat down in a golden chair made quite giddy by these rapid interruptions Her sister and the rest were a long time gone and during their absence a voice it appeared to be that of the gentleman with the black hair was continually calling out through the music One two three four five six go One two three four five six go Steady darlings One two three four five six go Ultimately the voice stopped and they all came back again more or less out of breath folding themselves in their shawls and making ready for the streets Stop a moment Amy and let them get away before us whispered Fanny They were soon left alone nothing more important happening in the meantime than the boy looking round his old beam and saying Everybody at eleven to morrow ladies and the gentleman with the black hair looking round his old beam and saying Everybody at eleven to morrow darlings each in his own accustomed manner When they were alone something was rolled up or by other means got out of the way and there was a great empty well before them looking down into the depths of which Fanny said Now uncle Little Dorrit as her eyes became used to the darkness faintly made him out at the bottom of the well in an obscure corner by himself with his instrument in its ragged case under his arm The old man looked as if the remote high gallery windows with their little strip of sky might have been the point of his better fortunes from which he had descended until he had gradually sunk down below there to the bottom He had been in that place six nights a week for many years but had never been observed to raise his eyes above his music book and was confidently believed to have never seen a play There were legends in the place that he did not so much as know the popular heroes and heroines by sight and that the low comedian had mugged at him in his richest manner fifty nights for a wager and he had shown no trace of consciousness The carpenters had a joke to the effect that he was dead without being aware of it and the frequenters of the pit supposed him to pass his whole life night and day and Sunday and all in the orchestra They had tried him a few times with pinches of snuff offered over the rails and he had always responded to this attention with a momentary waking up of manner that had the pale phantom of a gentleman in it beyond this he never on any occasion had any other part in what was going on than the part written out for the clarionet in private life where there was no part for the clarionet he had no part at all Some said he was poor some said he was a wealthy miser but he said nothing never lifted up his bowed head never varied his shuffling gait by getting his springless foot from the ground Though expecting now to be summoned by his niece he did not hear her until she had spoken to him three or four times nor was he at all surprised by the presence of two nieces instead of one but merely said in his tremulous voice I am coming I am coming and crept forth by some underground way which emitted a cellarous smell And so Amy said her sister when the three together passed out at the door that had such a shame faced consciousness of being different from other doors the uncle instinctively taking Amy s arm as the arm to be relied on so Amy you are curious about me She was pretty and conscious and rather flaunting and the condescension with which she put aside the superiority of her charms and of her worldly experience and addressed her sister on almost equal terms had a vast deal of the family in it I am interested Fanny and concerned in anything that concerns you So you are so you are and you are the best of Amys If I am ever a little provoking I am sure you ll consider what a thing it is to occupy my position and feel a consciousness of being superior to it I shouldn t care said the Daughter of the Father of the Marshalsea if the others were not so common None of them have come down in the world as we have They are all on their own level Common Little Dorrit mildly looked at the speaker but did not interrupt her Fanny took out her handkerchief and rather angrily wiped her eyes I was not born where you were you know Amy and perhaps that makes a difference My dear child when we get rid of Uncle you shall know all about it We ll drop him at the cook s shop where he is going to dine They walked on with him until they came to a dirty shop window in a dirty street which was made almost opaque by the steam of hot meats vegetables and puddings But glimpses were to be caught of a roast leg of pork bursting into tears of sage and onion in a metal reservoir full of gravy of an unctuous piece of roast beef and blisterous Yorkshire pudding bubbling hot in a similar receptacle of a stuffed fillet of veal in rapid cut of a ham in a perspiration with the pace it was going at of a shallow tank of baked potatoes glued together by their own richness of a truss or two of boiled greens and other substantial delicacies Within were a few wooden partitions behind which such customers as found it more convenient to take away their dinners in stomachs than in their hands Packed their purchases in solitude Fanny opening her reticule as they surveyed these things produced from that repository a shilling and handed it to Uncle Uncle after not looking at it a little while divined its object and muttering Dinner Ha Yes yes yes slowly vanished from them into the mist Now Amy said her sister come with me if you are not too tired to walk to Harley Street Cavendish Square The air with which she threw off this distinguished address and the toss she gave to her new bonnet which was more gauzy than serviceable made her sister wonder however she expressed her readiness to go to Harley Street and thither they directed their steps Arrived at that grand destination Fanny singled out the handsomest house and knocking at the door inquired for missus Merdle The footman who opened the door although he had powder on his head and was backed up by two other footmen likewise powdered not only admitted missus Merdle to be at home but asked Fanny to walk in Fanny walked in taking her sister with her and they went up stairs with powder going before and powder stopping behind and were left in a spacious semicircular drawing room one of several drawing rooms where there was a parrot on the outside of a golden cage holding on by its beak with its scaly legs in the air and putting itself into many strange upside down postures This peculiarity has been observed in birds of quite another feather climbing upon golden wires The room was far more splendid than anything Little Dorrit had ever imagined and would have been splendid and costly in any eyes She looked in amazement at her sister and would have asked a question but that Fanny with a warning frown pointed to a curtained doorway of communication with another room The curtain shook next moment and a lady raising it with a heavily ringed hand dropped it behind her again as she entered The lady was not young and fresh from the hand of Nature but was young and fresh from the hand of her maid She had large unfeeling handsome eyes and dark unfeeling handsome hair and a broad unfeeling handsome bosom and was made the most of in every particular Either because she had a cold or because it suited her face she wore a rich white fillet tied over her head and under her chin And if ever there were an unfeeling handsome chin that looked as if for certain it had never been in familiar parlance chucked by the hand of man it was the chin curbed up so tight and close by that laced bridle missus Merdle said Fanny My sister ma am I am glad to see your sister Miss Dorrit I did not remember that you had a sister I did not mention that I had said Fanny Ah missus Merdle curled the little finger of her left hand as who should say I have caught you I know you didn t All her action was usually with her left hand because her hands were not a pair and left being much the whiter and plumper of the two Then she added Sit down and composed herself voluptuously in a nest of crimson and gold cushions on an ottoman near the parrot Also professional said missus Merdle looking at Little Dorrit through an eye glass Fanny answered No No said missus Merdle dropping her glass Has not a professional air Very pleasant but not professional My sister ma am said Fanny in whom there was a singular mixture of deference and hardihood has been asking me to tell her as between sisters how I came to have the honour of knowing you And as I had engaged to call upon you once more I thought I might take the liberty of bringing her with me when perhaps you would tell her I wish her to know and perhaps you will tell her Do you think at your sister s age hinted missus Merdle She is much older than she looks said Fanny almost as old as I am Society said missus Merdle with another curve of her little finger is so difficult to explain to young persons indeed is so difficult to explain to most persons that I am glad to hear that I wish Society was not so arbitrary I wish it was not so exacting Bird be quiet The parrot had given a most piercing shriek as if its name were Society and it asserted its right to its exactions But resumed missus Merdle we must take it as we find it We know it is hollow and conventional and worldly and very shocking but unless we are Savages in the Tropical seas I should have been charmed to be one myself most delightful life and perfect climate I am told we must consult it It is the common lot mister Merdle is a most extensive merchant his transactions are on the vastest scale his wealth and influence are very great but even he Bird be quiet The parrot had shrieked another shriek and it filled up the sentence so expressively that missus Merdle was under no necessity to end it Since your sister begs that I would terminate our personal acquaintance she began again addressing Little Dorrit by relating the circumstances that are much to her credit I cannot object to comply with her request I am sure I have a son I was first married extremely young of two or three and twenty Fanny set her lips and her eyes looked half triumphantly at her sister A son of two or three and twenty He is a little gay a thing Society is accustomed to in young men and he is very impressible Perhaps he inherits that misfortune I am very impressible myself by nature The weakest of creatures my feelings are touched in a moment She said all this and everything else as coldly as a woman of snow quite forgetting the sisters except at odd times and apparently addressing some abstraction of Society for whose behoof too she occasionally arranged her dress or the composition of her figure upon the ottoman So he is very impressible Not a misfortune in our natural state I dare say but we are not in a natural state Much to be lamented no doubt particularly by myself who am a child of nature if I could but show it but so it is Society suppresses us and dominates us Bird be quiet The parrot had broken into a violent fit of laughter after twisting divers bars of his cage with his crooked bill and licking them with his black tongue It is quite unnecessary to say to a person of your good sense wide range of experience and cultivated feeling said missus Merdle from her nest of crimson and gold and there put up her glass to refresh her memory as to whom she was addressing that the stage sometimes has a fascination for young men of that class of character In saying the stage I mean the people on it of the female sex Therefore when I heard that my son was supposed to be fascinated by a dancer I knew what that usually meant in Society and confided in her being a dancer at the Opera where young men moving in Society are usually fascinated She passed her white hands over one another observant of the sisters now and the rings upon her fingers grated against each other with a hard sound As your sister will tell you when I found what the theatre was I was much surprised and much distressed But when I found that your sister by rejecting my son s advances I must add in an unexpected manner had brought him to the point of proposing marriage my feelings were of the profoundest anguish acute She traced the outline of her left eyebrow and put it right In a distracted condition which only a mother moving in Society can be susceptible of I determined to go myself to the theatre and represent my state of mind to the dancer I made myself known to your sister I found her to my surprise in many respects different from my expectations and certainly in none more so than in meeting me with what shall I say a sort of family assertion on her own part missus Merdle smiled I told you ma am said Fanny with a heightening colour that although you found me in that situation I was so far above the rest that I considered my family as good as your son s and that I had a brother who knowing the circumstances would be of the same opinion and would not consider such a connection any honour Miss Dorrit said missus Merdle after frostily looking at her through her glass precisely what I was on the point of telling your sister in pursuance of your request Much obliged to you for recalling it so accurately and anticipating me I immediately addressing Little Dorrit for I am the creature of impulse took a bracelet from my arm and begged your sister to let me clasp it on hers in token of the delight I had in our being able to approach the subject so far on a common footing This was perfectly true the lady having bought a cheap and showy article on her way to the interview with a general eye to bribery And I told you missus Merdle said Fanny that we might be unfortunate but we are not common I think the very words Miss Dorrit assented missus Merdle And I told you missus Merdle said Fanny that if you spoke to me of the superiority of your son s standing in Society it was barely possible that you rather deceived yourself in your suppositions about my origin and that my father s standing even in the Society in which he now moved what that was was best known to myself was eminently superior and was acknowledged by every one Quite accurate rejoined missus Merdle A most admirable memory Thank you ma am Perhaps you will be so kind as to tell my sister the rest There is very little to tell said missus Merdle reviewing the breadth of bosom which seemed essential to her having room enough to be unfeeling in but it is to your sister s credit I pointed out to your sister the plain state of the case the impossibility of the Society in which we moved recognising the Society in which she moved though charming I have no doubt the immense disadvantage at which she would consequently place the family she had so high an opinion of upon which we should find ourselves compelled to look down with contempt and from which socially speaking we should feel obliged to recoil with abhorrence In short I made an appeal to that laudable pride in your sister Let my sister know if you please missus Merdle Fanny pouted with a toss of her gauzy bonnet that I had already had the honour of telling your son that I wished to have nothing whatever to say to him Well Miss Dorrit assented missus Merdle perhaps I might have mentioned that before If I did not think of it perhaps it was because my mind reverted to the apprehensions I had at the time that he might persevere and you might have something to say to him I also mentioned to your sister I again address the non professional Miss Dorrit that my son would have nothing in the event of such a marriage and would be an absolute beggar I mention that merely as a fact which is part of the narrative and not as supposing it to have influenced your sister except in the prudent and legitimate way in which constituted as our artificial system is we must all be influenced by such considerations Finally after some high words and high spirit on the part of your sister we came to the complete understanding that there was no danger and your sister was so obliging as to allow me to present her with a mark or two of my appreciation at my dressmaker s Little Dorrit looked sorry and glanced at Fanny with a troubled face Also said missus Merdle as to promise to give me the present pleasure of a closing interview and of parting with her on the best of terms On which occasion added missus Merdle quitting her nest and putting something in Fanny s hand Miss Dorrit will permit me to say Farewell with best wishes in my own dull manner The sisters rose at the same time and they all stood near the cage of the parrot as he tore at a claw full of biscuit and spat it out seemed to mock them with a pompous dance of his body without moving his feet and suddenly turned himself upside down and trailed himself all over the outside of his golden cage with the aid of his cruel beak and black tongue Adieu Miss Dorrit with best wishes said missus Merdle If we could only come to a Millennium or something of that sort I for one might have the pleasure of knowing a number of charming and talented persons from whom I am at present excluded A more primitive state of society would be delicious to me There used to be a poem when I learnt lessons something about Lo the poor Indians whose something mind If a few thousand persons moving in Society could only go and be Indians I would put my name down directly but as moving in Society we can t be Indians unfortunately Good morning They came down stairs with powder before them and powder behind the elder sister haughty and the younger sister humbled and were shut out into unpowdered Harley Street Cavendish Square Well said Fanny when they had gone a little way without speaking Have you nothing to say Amy Oh I don t know what to say she answered distressed You didn t like this young man Fanny Like him He is almost an idiot I am so sorry don t be hurt but since you ask me what I have to say I am so very sorry Fanny that you suffered this lady to give you anything You little Fool returned her sister shaking her with the sharp pull she gave her arm Have you no spirit at all But that s just the way You have no self respect you have no becoming pride just as you allow yourself to be followed about by a contemptible little Chivery of a thing with the scornfullest emphasis you would let your family be trodden on and never turn Don t say that dear Fanny I do what I can for them You do what you can for them repeated Fanny walking her on very fast Would you let a woman like this whom you could see if you had any experience of anything to be as false and insolent as a woman can be would you let her put her foot upon your family and thank her for it No Fanny I am sure Then make her pay for it you mean little thing What else can you make her do Make her pay for it you stupid child and do your family some credit with the money They spoke no more all the way back to the lodging where Fanny and her uncle lived When they arrived there they found the old man practising his clarionet in the dolefullest manner in a corner of the room Fanny had a composite meal to make of chops and porter and tea and indignantly pretended to prepare it for herself though her sister did all that in quiet reality When at last Fanny sat down to eat and drink she threw the table implements about and was angry with her bread much as her father had been last night If you despise me she said bursting into vehement tears because I am a dancer why did you put me in the way of being one It was your doing You would have me stoop as low as the ground before this missus Merdle and let her say what she liked and do what she liked and hold us all in contempt and tell me so to my face Because I am a dancer O Fanny And Tip too poor fellow She is to disparage him just as much as she likes without any check I suppose because he has been in the law and the docks and different things Why it was your doing Amy You might at least approve of his being defended All this time the uncle was dolefully blowing his clarionet in the corner sometimes taking it an inch or so from his mouth for a moment while he stopped to gaze at them with a vague impression that somebody had said something And your father your poor father Amy Because he is not free to show himself and to speak for himself you would let such people insult him with impunity If you don t feel for yourself because you go out to work you might at least feel for him I should think knowing what he has undergone so long Poor Little Dorrit felt the injustice of this taunt rather sharply The remembrance of last night added a barbed point to it She said nothing in reply but turned her chair from the table towards the fire Uncle after making one more pause blew a dismal wail and went on again Fanny was passionate with the tea cups and the bread as long as her passion lasted and then protested that she was the wretchedest girl in the world and she wished she was dead After that her crying became remorseful and she got up and put her arms round her sister Little Dorrit tried to stop her from saying anything but she answered that she would she must Thereupon she said again and again I beg your pardon Amy and Forgive me Amy almost as passionately as she had said what she regretted But indeed indeed Amy she resumed when they were seated in sisterly accord side by side I hope and I think you would have seen this differently if you had known a little more of Society Perhaps I might Fanny said the mild Little Dorrit You see while you have been domestic and resignedly shut up there Amy pursued her sister gradually beginning to patronise I have been out moving more in Society and may have been getting proud and spirited more than I ought to be perhaps Little Dorrit answered Yes O yes And while you have been thinking of the dinner or the clothes I may have been thinking you know of the family Now may it not be so Amy Little Dorrit again nodded Yes with a more cheerful face than heart Especially as we know said Fanny that there certainly is a tone in the place to which you have been so true which does belong to it and which does make it different from other aspects of Society So kiss me once again Amy dear and we will agree that we may both be right and that you are a tranquil domestic home loving good girl The clarionet had been lamenting most pathetically during this dialogue but was cut short now by Fanny s announcement that it was time to go which she conveyed to her uncle by shutting up his scrap of music and taking the clarionet out of his mouth Little Dorrit parted from them at the door and hastened back to the Marshalsea It fell dark there sooner than elsewhere and going into it that evening was like going into a deep trench The shadow of the wall was on every object Not least upon the figure in the old grey gown and the black velvet cap as it turned towards her when she opened the door of the dim room Why not upon me too thought Little Dorrit with the door Yet in her hand It was not unreasonable in Fanny CHAPTER twenty one mister Merdle s Complaint Upon that establishment of state the Merdle establishment in Harley Street Cavendish Square there was the shadow of no more common wall than the fronts of other establishments of state on the opposite side of the street Like unexceptionable Society the opposing rows of houses in Harley Street were very grim with one another Indeed the mansions and their inhabitants were so much alike in that respect that the people were often to be found drawn up on opposite sides of dinner tables in the shade of their own loftiness staring at the other side of the way with the dullness of the houses Everybody knows how like the street the two dinner rows of people who take their stand by the street will be The expressionless uniform twenty houses all to be knocked at and rung at in the same form all approachable by the same dull steps all fended off by the same pattern of railing all with the same impracticable fire escapes the same inconvenient fixtures in their heads and everything without exception to be taken at a high valuation who has not dined with these The house so drearily out of repair the occasional bow window the stuccoed house the newly fronted house the corner house with nothing but angular rooms the house with the blinds always down the house with the hatchment always up the house where the collector has called for one quarter of an Idea and found nobody at home who has not dined with these The house that nobody will take and is to be had a bargain who does not know her The showy house that was taken for life by the disappointed gentleman and which does not suit him at all who is unacquainted with that haunted habitation Harley Street Cavendish Square was more than aware of mister and missus Merdle Intruders there were in Harley Street of whom it was not aware but mister and missus Merdle it delighted to honour Society was aware of mister and missus Merdle Society had said Let us license them let us know them mister Merdle was immensely rich a man of prodigious enterprise a Midas without the ears who turned all he touched to gold He was in everything good from banking to building He was in Parliament of course He was in the City necessarily He was Chairman of this Trustee of that President of the other The weightiest of men had said to projectors Now what name have you got Have you got Merdle And the reply being in the negative had said Then I won t look at you This great and fortunate man had provided that extensive bosom which required so much room to be unfeeling enough in with a nest of crimson and gold some fifteen years before It was not a bosom to repose upon but it was a capital bosom to hang jewels upon mister Merdle wanted something to hang jewels upon and he bought it for the purpose Storr and Mortimer might have married on the same speculation Like all his other speculations it was sound and successful The jewels showed to the richest advantage The bosom moving in Society with the jewels displayed upon it attracted general admiration Society approving mister Merdle was satisfied He was the most disinterested of men did everything for Society and got as little for himself out of all his gain and care as a man might That is to say it may be supposed that he got all he wanted otherwise with unlimited wealth he would have got it But his desire was to the utmost to satisfy Society whatever that was and take up all its drafts upon him for tribute He did not shine in company he had not very much to say for himself he was a reserved man with a broad overhanging watchful head that particular kind of dull red colour in his cheeks which is rather stale than fresh and a somewhat uneasy expression about his coat cuffs as if they were in his confidence and had reasons for being anxious to hide his hands In the little he said he was a pleasant man enough plain emphatic about public and private confidence and tenacious of the utmost deference being shown by every one in all things to Society In this same Society if that were it which came to his dinners and to missus Merdle s receptions and concerts he hardly seemed to enjoy himself much and was mostly to be found against walls and behind doors Also when he went out to it instead of its coming home to him he seemed a little fatigued and upon the whole rather more disposed for bed but he was always cultivating it nevertheless and always moving in it and always laying out money on it with the greatest liberality missus Merdle s first husband had been a colonel under whose auspices the bosom had entered into competition with the snows of North America and had come off at little disadvantage in point of whiteness and at none in point of coldness The colonel s son was missus Merdle s only child He was of a chuckle headed high shouldered make with a general appearance of being not so much a young man as a swelled boy He had given so few signs of reason that a by word went among his companions that his brain had been frozen up in a mighty frost which prevailed at saint John s New Brunswick at the period of his birth there and had never thawed from that hour Another by word represented him as having in his infancy through the negligence of a nurse fallen out of a high window on his head which had been heard by responsible witnesses to crack It is probable that both these representations were of ex post facto origin the young gentleman whose expressive name was Sparkler being monomaniacal in offering marriage to all manner of undesirable young ladies and in remarking of every successive young lady to whom he tendered a matrimonial proposal that she was a doosed fine gal well educated too with no biggodd nonsense about her A son in law with these limited talents might have been a clog upon another man but mister Merdle did not want a son in law for himself he wanted a son in law for Society mister Sparkler having been in the Guards and being in the habit of frequenting all the races and all the lounges and all the parties and being well known Society was satisfied with its son in law This happy result mister Merdle would have considered well attained though mister Sparkler had been a more expensive article And he did not get mister Sparkler by any means cheap for Society even as it was There was a dinner giving in the Harley Street establishment while Little Dorrit was stitching at her father s new shirts by his side that night and there were magnates from the Court and magnates from the City magnates from the Commons and magnates from the Lords magnates from the bench and magnates from the bar Bishop magnates Treasury magnates Horse Guard magnates Admiralty magnates all the magnates that keep us going and sometimes trip us up I am told said Bishop magnate to Horse Guards that mister Merdle has made another enormous hit They say a hundred thousand pounds Horse Guards had heard two Treasury had heard three Bar handling his persuasive double eye glass was by no means clear but that it might be four It was one of those happy strokes of calculation and combination the result of which it was difficult to estimate It was one of those instances of a comprehensive grasp associated with habitual luck and characteristic boldness of which an age presented us but few But here was Brother Bellows who had been in the great Bank case and who could probably tell us more What did Brother Bellows put this new success at Brother Bellows was on his way to make his bow to the bosom and could only tell them in passing that he had heard it stated with great appearance of truth as being worth from first to last half a million of money Admiralty said mister Merdle was a wonderful man Treasury said he was a new power in the country and would be able to buy up the whole House of Commons Bishop said he was glad to think that this wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who was always disposed to maintain the best interests of Society mister Merdle himself was usually late on these occasions as a man still detained in the clutch of giant enterprises when other men had shaken off their dwarfs for the day On this occasion he was the last arrival Treasury said Merdle s work punished him a little Bishop said he was glad to think that this wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who accepted it with meekness Powder There was so much Powder in waiting that it flavoured the dinner Pulverous particles got into the dishes and Society s meats had a seasoning of first rate footmen mister Merdle took down a countess who was secluded somewhere in the core of an immense dress to which she was in the proportion of the heart to the overgrown cabbage If so low a simile may be admitted the dress went down the staircase like a richly brocaded Jack in the Green and nobody knew what sort of small person carried it Society had everything it could want and could not want for dinner It had everything to look at and everything to eat and everything to drink It is to be hoped it enjoyed itself for mister Merdle s own share of the repast might have been paid for with eighteenpence missus Merdle was magnificent The chief butler was the next magnificent institution of the day He was the stateliest man in the company He did nothing but he looked on as few other men could have done He was mister Merdle s last gift to Society mister Merdle didn t want him and was put out of countenance when the great creature looked at him but inappeasable Society would have him and had got him The invisible countess carried out the Green at the usual stage of the entertainment and the file of beauty was closed up by the bosom Treasury said Juno Bishop said Judith Bar fell into discussion with Horse Guards concerning courts martial Brothers Bellows and Bench struck in Other magnates paired off mister Merdle sat silent and looked at the table cloth Sometimes a magnate addressed him to turn the stream of his own particular discussion towards him but mister Merdle seldom gave much attention to it or did more than rouse himself from his calculations and pass the wine When they rose so many of the magnates had something to say to mister Merdle individually that he held little levees by the sideboard and checked them off as they went out at the door Treasury hoped he might venture to congratulate one of England s world famed capitalists and merchant princes he had turned that original sentiment in the house a few times and it came easy to him on a new achievement To extend the triumphs of such men was to extend the triumphs and resources of the nation and Treasury felt he gave mister Merdle to understand patriotic on the subject Thank you my lord said mister Merdle thank you I accept your congratulations with pride and I am glad you approve Why I don t unreservedly approve my dear mister Merdle Because smiling Treasury turned him by the arm towards the sideboard and spoke banteringly it never can be worth your while to come among us and help us mister Merdle felt honoured by the No no said Treasury that is not the light in which one so distinguished for practical knowledge and great foresight can be expected to regard it If we should ever be happily enabled by accidentally possessing the control over circumstances to propose to one so eminent to to come among us and give us the weight of his influence knowledge and character we could only propose it to him as a duty In fact as a duty that he owed to Society mister Merdle intimated that Society was the apple of his eye and that its claims were paramount to every other consideration Treasury moved on and Bar came up Bar with his little insinuating jury droop and fingering his persuasive double eye glass hoped he might be excused if he mentioned to one of the greatest converters of the root of all evil into the root of all good who had for a long time reflected a shining lustre on the annals even of our commercial country if he mentioned disinterestedly and as what we lawyers called in our pedantic way amicus curiae a fact that had come by accident within his knowledge He had been required to look over the title of a very considerable estate in one of the eastern counties lying in fact for mister Merdle knew we lawyers loved to be particular on the borders of two of the eastern counties Now the title was perfectly sound and the estate was to be purchased by one who had the command of Money jury droop and persuasive eye glass on remarkably advantageous terms This had come to Bar s knowledge only that day and it had occurred to him I shall have the honour of dining with my esteemed friend mister Merdle this evening and strictly between ourselves I will mention the opportunity Such a purchase would involve not only a great legitimate political influence but some half dozen church presentations of considerable annual value Now that mister Merdle was already at no loss to discover means of occupying even his capital and of fully employing even his active and vigorous intellect Bar well knew but he would venture to suggest that the question arose in his mind whether one who had deservedly gained so high a position and so European a reputation did not owe it we would not say to himself but we would say to Society to possess himself of such influences as these and to exercise them we would not say for his own or for his party s but we would say for Society s benefit mister Merdle again expressed himself as wholly devoted to that object of his constant consideration and Bar took his persuasive eye glass up the grand staircase Bishop then came undesignedly sidling in the direction of the sideboard Surely the goods of this world it occurred in an accidental way to Bishop to remark could scarcely be directed into happier channels than when they accumulated under the magic touch of the wise and sagacious who while they knew the just value of riches Bishop tried here to look as if he were rather poor himself were aware of their importance judiciously governed and rightly distributed to the welfare of our brethren at large mister Merdle with humility expressed his conviction that Bishop couldn t mean him and with inconsistency expressed his high gratification in Bishop s good opinion Bishop then jauntily stepping out a little with his well shaped right leg as though he said to mister Merdle don t mind the apron a mere form put this case to his good friend Whether it had occurred to his good friend that Society might not unreasonably hope that one so blest in his undertakings and whose example on his pedestal was so influential with it would shed a little money in the direction of a mission or so to Africa mister Merdle signifying that the idea should have his best attention Bishop put another case Whether his good friend had at all interested himself in the proceedings of our Combined Additional Endowed Dignitaries Committee and whether it had occurred to him that to shed a little money in that direction might be a great conception finely executed mister Merdle made a similar reply and Bishop explained his reason for inquiring Society looked to such men as his good friend to do such things It was not that HE looked to them but that Society looked to them Just as it was not Our Committee who wanted the Additional Endowed Dignitaries but it was Society that was in a state of the most agonising uneasiness of mind until it got them He begged to assure his good friend that he was extremely sensible of his good friend s regard on all occasions for the best interests of Society and he considered that he was at once consulting those interests and expressing the feeling of Society when he wished him continued prosperity continued increase of riches and continued things in general Bishop then betook himself up stairs and the other magnates gradually floated up after him until there was no one left below but mister Merdle That gentleman after looking at the table cloth until the soul of the chief butler glowed with a noble resentment went slowly up after the rest and became of no account in the stream of people on the grand staircase missus Merdle was at home the best of the jewels were hung out to be seen Society got what it came for mister Merdle drank twopennyworth of tea in a corner and got more than he wanted Among the evening magnates was a famous physician who knew everybody and whom everybody knew On entering at the door he came upon mister Merdle drinking his tea in a corner and touched him on the arm mister Merdle started Oh It s you Any better to day No said mister Merdle I am no better A pity I didn t see you this morning Pray come to me to morrow or let me come to you Well he replied I will come to morrow as I drive by Bar and Bishop had both been bystanders during this short dialogue and as mister Merdle was swept away by the crowd they made their remarks upon it to the Physician Bar said there was a certain point of mental strain beyond which no man could go that the point varied with various textures of brain and peculiarities of constitution as he had had occasion to notice in several of his learned brothers but the point of endurance passed by a line s breadth depression and dyspepsia ensued Not to intrude on the sacred mysteries of medicine he took it now with the jury droop and persuasive eye glass that this was Merdle s case Bishop said that when he was a young man and had fallen for a brief space into the habit of writing sermons on Saturdays a habit which all young sons of the church should sedulously avoid he had frequently been sensible of a depression arising as he supposed from an over taxed intellect upon which the yolk of a new laid egg beaten up by the good woman in whose house he at that time lodged with a glass of sound sherry nutmeg and powdered sugar acted like a charm Without presuming to offer so simple a remedy to the consideration of so profound a professor of the great healing art he would venture to inquire whether the strain being by way of intricate calculations the spirits might not humanly speaking be restored to their tone by a gentle and yet generous stimulant Yes said the physician yes you are both right But I may as well tell you that I can find nothing the matter with mister Merdle He has the constitution of a rhinoceros the digestion of an ostrich and the concentration of an oyster As to nerves mister Merdle is of a cool temperament and not a sensitive man is about as invulnerable I should say as Achilles How such a man should suppose himself unwell without reason you may think strange But I have found nothing the matter with him He may have some deep seated recondite complaint I can t say I only say that at present I have not found it out There was no shadow of mister Merdle s complaint on the bosom now displaying precious stones in rivalry with many similar superb jewel stands there was no shadow of mister Merdle s complaint on young Sparkler hovering about the rooms monomaniacally seeking any sufficiently ineligible young lady with no nonsense about her there was no shadow of mister Merdle s complaint on the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings of whom whole colonies were present or on any of the company Even on himself its shadow was faint enough as he moved about among the throng receiving homage mister Merdle s complaint Society and he had so much to do with one another in all things else that it is hard to imagine his complaint if he had one being solely his own affair Had he that deep seated recondite complaint and did any doctor find it out Patience in the meantime the shadow of the Marshalsea wall was a real darkening influence and could be seen on the Dorrit Family at any stage of the sun s course CHAPTER twenty two A Puzzle mister Clennam did not increase in favour with the Father of the Marshalsea in the ratio of his increasing visits His obtuseness on the great Testimonial question was not calculated to awaken admiration in the paternal breast but had rather a tendency to give offence in that sensitive quarter and to be regarded as a positive shortcoming in point of gentlemanly feeling An impression of disappointment occasioned by the discovery that mister Clennam scarcely possessed that delicacy for which in the confidence of his nature he had been inclined to give him credit began to darken the fatherly mind in connection with that gentleman The father went so far as to say in his private family circle that he feared mister Clennam was not a man of high instincts He was happy he observed in his public capacity as leader and representative of the College to receive mister Clennam when he called to pay his respects but he didn t find that he got on with him personally There appeared to be something he didn t know what it was wanting in him Howbeit the father did not fail in any outward show of politeness but on the contrary honoured him with much attention perhaps cherishing the hope that although not a man of a sufficiently brilliant and spontaneous turn of mind to repeat his former testimonial unsolicited it might still be within the compass of his nature to bear the part of a responsive gentleman in any correspondence that way tending In the threefold capacity of the gentleman from outside who had been accidentally locked in on the night of his first appearance of the gentleman from outside who had inquired into the affairs of the Father of the Marshalsea with the stupendous idea of getting him out and of the gentleman from outside who took an interest in the child of the Marshalsea Clennam soon became a visitor of mark He was not surprised by the attentions he received from mister Chivery when that officer was on the lock for he made little distinction between mister Chivery s politeness and that of the other turnkeys It was on one particular afternoon that mister Chivery surprised him all at once and stood forth from his companions in bold relief mister Chivery by some artful exercise of his power of clearing the Lodge had contrived to rid it of all sauntering Collegians so that Clennam coming out of the prison should find him on duty alone Private I ask your pardon sir said mister Chivery in a secret manner but which way might you be going I am going over the Bridge He saw in mister Chivery with some astonishment quite an Allegory of Silence as he stood with his key on his lips Private I ask your pardon again said mister Chivery but could you go round by Horsemonger Lane Could you by any means find time to look in at that address handing him a little card printed for circulation among the connection of Chivery and company Tobacconists Importers of pure Havannah Cigars Bengal Cheroots and fine flavoured Cubas Dealers in Fancy Snuffs C C Private It an t tobacco business said mister Chivery The truth is it s my wife She s wishful to say a word to you sir upon a point respecting yes said mister Chivery answering Clennam s look of apprehension with a nod respecting her I will make a point of seeing your wife directly Thank you sir Much obliged It an t above ten minutes out of your way Please to ask for missus Chivery These instructions mister Chivery who had already let him out cautiously called through a little slide in the outer door which he could draw back from within for the inspection of visitors when it pleased him Arthur Clennam with the card in his hand betook himself to the address set forth upon it and speedily arrived there It was a very small establishment wherein a decent woman sat behind the counter working at her needle Little jars of tobacco little boxes of cigars a little assortment of pipes a little jar or two of snuff and a little instrument like a shoeing horn for serving it out composed the retail stock in trade Arthur mentioned his name and his having promised to call on the solicitation of mister Chivery About something relating to Miss Dorrit he believed missus Chivery at once laid aside her work rose up from her seat behind the counter and deploringly shook her head You may see him now said she if you ll condescend to take a peep With these mysterious words she preceded the visitor into a little parlour behind the shop with a little window in it commanding a very little dull back yard In this yard a wash of sheets and table cloths tried in vain for want of air to get itself dried on a line or two and among those flapping articles was sitting in a chair like the last mariner left alive on the deck of a damp ship without the power of furling the sails a little woe begone young man Our John said missus Chivery Not to be deficient in interest Clennam asked what he might be doing there It s the only change he takes said missus Chivery shaking her head afresh He won t go out even in the back yard when there s no linen but when there s linen to keep the neighbours eyes off he ll sit there hours Hours he will Says he feels as if it was groves missus Chivery shook her head again put her apron in a motherly way to her eyes and reconducted her visitor into the regions of the business Please to take a seat sir said missus Chivery Miss Dorrit is the matter with Our John sir he s a breaking his heart for her and I would wish to take the liberty to ask how it s to be made good to his parents when bust missus Chivery who was a comfortable looking woman much respected about Horsemonger Lane for her feelings and her conversation uttered this speech with fell composure and immediately afterwards began again to shake her head and dry her eyes Sir said she in continuation you are acquainted with the family and have interested yourself with the family and are influential with the family If you can promote views calculated to make two young people happy let me for Our John s sake and for both their sakes implore you so to do I have been so habituated returned Arthur at a loss during the short time I have known her to consider Little I have been so habituated to consider Miss Dorrit in a light altogether removed from that in which you present her to me that you quite take me by surprise Does she know your son Brought up together sir said missus Chivery Played together Does she know your son as her admirer Oh bless you sir said missus Chivery with a sort of triumphant shiver she never could have seen him on a Sunday without knowing he was that His cane alone would have told it long ago if nothing else had Young men like John don t take to ivory hands a pinting for nothing How did I first know it myself Similarly Perhaps Miss Dorrit may not be so ready as you you see Then she knows it sir said missus Chivery by word of mouth Are you sure Sir said missus Chivery sure and certain as in this house I am I see my son go out with my own eyes when in this house I was and I see my son come in with my own eyes when in this house I was and I know he done it missus Chivery derived a surprising force of emphasis from the foregoing circumstantiality and repetition May I ask you how he came to fall into the desponding state which causes you so much uneasiness That said missus Chivery took place on that same day when to this house I see that John with these eyes return Never been himself in this house since Never was like what he has been since not from the hour when to this house seven year ago me and his father as tenants by the quarter came An effect in the nature of an affidavit was gained from this speech by missus Chivery s peculiar power of construction May I venture to inquire what is your version of the matter You may said missus Chivery and I will give it to you in honour and in word as true as in this shop I stand Our John has every one s good word and every one s good wish He played with her as a child when in that yard a child she played He has known her ever since He went out upon the Sunday afternoon when in this very parlour he had dined and met her with appointment or without appointment which I do not pretend to say He made his offer to her Her brother and sister is high in their views and against Our John Her father is all for himself in his views and against sharing her with any one Under which circumstances she has answered Our John No John I cannot have you I cannot have any husband it is not my intentions ever to become a wife it is my intentions to be always a sacrifice farewell find another worthy of you and forget me This is the way in which she is doomed to be a constant slave to them that are not worthy that a constant slave she unto them should be This is the way in which Our John has come to find no pleasure but in taking cold among the linen and in showing in that yard as in that yard I have myself shown you a broken down ruin that goes home to his mother s heart Here the good woman pointed to the little window whence her son might be seen sitting disconsolate in the tuneless groves and again shook her head and wiped her eyes and besought him for the united sakes of both the young people to exercise his influence towards the bright reversal of these dismal events She was so confident in her exposition of the case and it was so undeniably founded on correct premises in so far as the relative positions of Little Dorrit and her family were concerned that Clennam could not feel positive on the other side He had come to attach to Little Dorrit an interest so peculiar an interest that removed her from while it grew out of the common and coarse things surrounding her that he found it disappointing disagreeable almost painful to suppose her in love with young mister Chivery in the back yard or any such person On the other hand he reasoned with himself that she was just as good and just as true in love with him as not in love with him and that to make a kind of domesticated fairy of her on the penalty of isolation at heart from the only people she knew would be but a weakness of his own fancy and not a kind one Still her youthful and ethereal appearance her timid manner the charm of her sensitive voice and eyes the very many respects in which she had interested him out of her own individuality and the strong difference between herself and those about her were not in unison and were determined not to be in unison with this newly presented idea He told the worthy missus Chivery after turning these things over in his mind he did that indeed while she was yet speaking that he might be relied upon to do his utmost at all times to promote the happiness of Miss Dorrit and to further the wishes of her heart if it were in his power to do so and if he could discover what they were At the same time he cautioned her against assumptions and appearances enjoined strict silence and secrecy lest Miss Dorrit should be made unhappy and particularly advised her to endeavour to win her son s confidence and so to make quite sure of the state of the case missus Chivery considered the latter precaution superfluous but said she would try She shook her head as if she had not derived all the comfort she had fondly expected from this interview but thanked him nevertheless for the trouble he had kindly taken They then parted good friends and Arthur walked away The crowd in the street jostling the crowd in his mind and the two crowds making a confusion he avoided London Bridge and turned off in the quieter direction of the Iron Bridge He had scarcely set foot upon it when he saw Little Dorrit walking on before him It was a pleasant day with a light breeze blowing and she seemed to have that minute come there for air He had left her in her father s room within an hour It was a timely chance favourable to his wish of observing her face and manner when no one else was by He quickened his pace but before he reached her she turned her head Have I startled you he asked I thought I knew the step she answered hesitating And did you know it Little Dorrit You could hardly have expected mine I did not expect any But when I heard a step I thought it sounded like yours Are you going further No sir I am only walking her for a little change They walked together and she recovered her confiding manner with him and looked up in his face as she said after glancing around It is so strange Perhaps you can hardly understand it I sometimes have a sensation as if it was almost unfeeling to walk here Unfeeling To see the river and so much sky and so many objects and such change and motion Then to go back you know and find him in the same cramped place Ah yes But going back you must remember that you take with you the spirit and influence of such things to cheer him Do I I hope I may I am afraid you fancy too much sir and make me out too powerful If you were in prison could I bring such comfort to you Yes Little Dorrit I am sure of it He gathered from a tremor on her lip and a passing shadow of great agitation on her face that her mind was with her father He remained silent for a few moments that she might regain her composure The Little Dorrit trembling on his arm was less in unison than ever with missus Chivery s theory and yet was not irreconcilable with a new fancy which sprung up within him that there might be some one else in the hopeless newer fancy still in the hopeless unattainable distance They turned and Clennam said Here was Maggy coming Little Dorrit looked up surprised and they confronted Maggy who brought herself at sight of them to a dead stop She had been trotting along so preoccupied and busy that she had not recognised them until they turned upon her She was now in a moment so conscience stricken that her very basket partook of the change Maggy you promised me to stop near father So I would Little Mother only he wouldn t let me If he takes and sends me out I must go If he takes and says Maggy you hurry away and back with that letter and you shall have a sixpence if the answer s a good un I must take it Lor Little Mother what s a poor thing of ten year old to do And if mister Tip if he happens to be a coming in as I come out and if he says Where are you going Maggy and if I says I m a going So and So and if he says I ll have a Try too and if he goes into the George and writes a letter and if he gives it me and says Take that one to the same place and if the answer s a good un I ll give you a shilling it ain t my fault mother Arthur read in Little Dorrit s downcast eyes to whom she foresaw that the letters were addressed I m a going So and So There That s where I am a going to said Maggy I m a going So and So It ain t you Little Mother that s got anything to do with it it s you you know said Maggy addressing Arthur You d better come So and So and let me take and give em to you We will not be so particular as that Maggy Give them me here said Clennam in a low voice Well then come across the road answered Maggy in a very loud whisper Little Mother wasn t to know nothing of it and she would never have known nothing of it if you had only gone So and So instead of bothering and loitering about It ain t my fault I must do what I am told They ought to be ashamed of themselves for telling me Clennam crossed to the other side and hurriedly opened the letters That from the father mentioned that most unexpectedly finding himself in the novel position of having been disappointed of a remittance from the City on which he had confidently counted he took up his pen being restrained by the unhappy circumstance of his incarceration during three and twenty years doubly underlined from coming himself as he would otherwise certainly have done took up his pen to entreat mister Clennam to advance him the sum of Three Pounds Ten Shillings upon his I O U which he begged to enclose That from the son set forth that mister Clennam would he knew be gratified to hear that he had at length obtained permanent employment of a highly satisfactory nature accompanied with every prospect of complete success in life but that the temporary inability of his employer to pay him his arrears of salary to that date in which condition said employer had appealed to that generous forbearance in which he trusted he should never be wanting towards a fellow creature combined with the fraudulent conduct of a false friend and the present high price of provisions had reduced him to the verge of ruin unless he could by a quarter before six that evening raise the sum of eight pounds This sum mister Clennam would be happy to learn he had through the promptitude of several friends who had a lively confidence in his probity already raised with the exception of a trifling balance of one pound seventeen and fourpence the loan of which balance for the period of one month would be fraught with the usual beneficent consequences These letters Clennam answered with the aid of his pencil and pocket book on the spot sending the father what he asked for and excusing himself from compliance with the demand of the son He then commissioned Maggy to return with his replies and gave her the shilling of which the failure of her supplemental enterprise would have disappointed her otherwise When he rejoined Little Dorrit and they had begun walking as before she said all at once I think I had better go I had better go home Don t be distressed said Clennam I have answered the letters They were nothing You know what they were They were nothing But I am afraid she returned to leave him I am afraid to leave any of them When I am gone they pervert but they don t mean it even Maggy It was a very innocent commission that she undertook poor thing And in keeping it secret from you she supposed no doubt that she was only saving you uneasiness Yes I hope so I hope so But I had better go home It was but the other day that my sister told me I had become so used to the prison that I had its tone and character It must be so I am sure it must be when I see these things My place is there I am better there it is unfeeling in me to be here when I can do the least thing there Good bye I had far better stay at home The agonised way in which she poured this out as if it burst of itself from her suppressed heart made it difficult for Clennam to keep the tears from his eyes as he saw and heard her Don t call it home my child he entreated It is always painful to me to hear you call it home But it is home What else can I call home Why should I ever forget it for a single moment You never do dear Little Dorrit in any good and true service I hope not O I hope not But it is better for me to stay there much better much more dutiful much happier Please don t go with me let me go by myself Good bye God bless you Thank you thank you He felt that it was better to respect her entreaty and did not move while her slight form went quickly away from him When it had fluttered out of sight he turned his face towards the water and stood thinking She would have been distressed at any time by this discovery of the letters but so much so and in that unrestrainable way No When she had seen her father begging with his threadbare disguise on when she had entreated him not to give her father money she had been distressed but not like this Something had made her keenly and additionally sensitive just now Now was there some one in the hopeless unattainable distance Or had the suspicion been brought into his mind by his own associations of the troubled river running beneath the bridge with the same river higher up its changeless tune upon the prow of the ferry boat so many miles an hour the peaceful flowing of the stream here the rushes there the lilies nothing uncertain or unquiet He thought of his poor child Little Dorrit for a long time there he thought of her going home he thought of her in the night he thought of her when the day came round again And the poor child Little Dorrit thought of him too faithfully ah too faithfully in the shadow of the Marshalsea wall CHAPTER twenty three Machinery in Motion mister Meagles bestirred himself with such prompt activity in the matter of the negotiation with Daniel Doyce which Clennam had entrusted to him that he soon brought it into business train and called on Clennam at nine o clock one morning to make his report Doyce is highly gratified by your good opinion he opened the business by saying and desires nothing so much as that you should examine the affairs of the Works for yourself and entirely understand them He has handed me the keys of all his books and papers here they are jingling in this pocket and the only charge he has given me is Let mister Clennam have the means of putting himself on a perfect equality with me as to knowing whatever I know If it should come to nothing after all he will respect my confidence Unless I was sure of that to begin with I should have nothing to do with him And there you see said mister Meagles you have Daniel Doyce all over A very honourable character Oh yes to be sure Not a doubt of it Odd but very honourable Very odd though Now would you believe Clennam said mister Meagles with a hearty enjoyment of his friend s eccentricity that I had a whole morning in What s his name Yard Bleeding Heart A whole morning in Bleeding Heart Yard before I could induce him to pursue the subject at all How was that How was that my friend I no sooner mentioned your name in connection with it than he declared off Declared off on my account I no sooner mentioned your name Clennam than he said That will never do What did he mean by that I asked him No matter Meagles that would never do Why would it never do You ll hardly believe it Clennam said mister Meagles laughing within himself but it came out that it would never do because you and he walking down to Twickenham together had glided into a friendly conversation in the course of which he had referred to his intention of taking a partner supposing at the time that you were as firmly and finally settled as saint Paul s Cathedral Whereas says he mister Clennam might now believe if I entertained his proposition that I had a sinister and designing motive in what was open free speech Which I can t bear says he which I really am too proud to bear I should as soon suspect Of course you would interrupted mister Meagles and so I told him But it took a morning to scale that wall and I doubt if any other man than myself he likes me of old could have got his leg over it Well Clennam This business like obstacle surmounted he then stipulated that before resuming with you I should look over the books and form my own opinion I looked over the books and formed my own opinion Is it on the whole for or against says he For says I Then says he you may now my good friend give mister Clennam the means of forming his opinion To enable him to do which without bias and with perfect freedom I shall go out of town for a week And he s gone said mister Meagles that s the rich conclusion of the thing Leaving me said Clennam with a high sense I must say of his candour and his Oddity mister Meagles struck in I should think so It was not exactly the word on Clennam s lips but he forbore to interrupt his good humoured friend And now added mister Meagles you can begin to look into matters as soon as you think proper I have undertaken to explain where you may want explanation but to be strictly impartial and to do nothing more They began their perquisitions in Bleeding Heart Yard that same forenoon Little peculiarities were easily to be detected by experienced eyes in mister Doyce s way of managing his affairs but they almost always involved some ingenious simplification of a difficulty and some plain road to the desired end That his papers were in arrear and that he stood in need of assistance to develop the capacity of his business was clear enough but all the results of his undertakings during many years were distinctly set forth and were ascertainable with ease Nothing had been done for the purposes of the pending investigation everything was in its genuine working dress and in a certain honest rugged order The calculations and entries in his own hand of which there were many were bluntly written and with no very neat precision but were always plain and directed straight to the purpose It occurred to Arthur that a far more elaborate and taking show of business such as the records of the Circumlocution Office made perhaps might be far less serviceable as being meant to be far less intelligible Three or four days of steady application tendered him master of all the facts it was essential to become acquainted with mister Meagles was at hand the whole time always ready to illuminate any dim place with the bright little safety lamp belonging to the scales and scoop Between them they agreed upon the sum it would be fair to offer for the purchase of a half share in the business and then mister Meagles unsealed a paper in which Daniel Doyce had noted the amount at which he valued it which was even something less Thus when Daniel came back he found the affair as good as concluded And I may now avow mister Clennam said he with a cordial shake of the hand that if I had looked high and low for a partner I believe I could not have found one more to my mind I say the same said Clennam And I say of both of you added mister Meagles that you are well matched You keep him in check Clennam with your common sense and you stick to the Works Dan with your Uncommon sense suggested Daniel with his quiet smile You may call it so if you like and each of you will be a right hand to the other Here s my own right hand upon it as a practical man to both of you The purchase was completed within a month It left Arthur in possession of private personal means not exceeding a few hundred pounds but it opened to him an active and promising career The three friends dined together on the auspicious occasion the factory and the factory wives and children made holiday and dined too even Bleeding Heart Yard dined and was full of meat Two months had barely gone by in all when Bleeding Heart Yard had become so familiar with short commons again that the treat was forgotten there when nothing seemed new in the partnership but the paint of the inscription on the door posts DOYCE AND CLENNAM when it appeared even to Clennam himself that he had had the affairs of the firm in his mind for years The little counting house reserved for his own occupation was a room of wood and glass at the end of a long low workshop filled with benches and vices and tools and straps and wheels which when they were in gear with the steam engine went tearing round as though they had a suicidal mission to grind the business to dust and tear the factory to pieces A communication of great trap doors in the floor and roof with the workshop above and the workshop below made a shaft of light in this perspective which brought to Clennam s mind the child s old picture book where similar rays were the witnesses of Abel s murder The noises were sufficiently removed and shut out from the counting house to blend into a busy hum interspersed with periodical clinks and thumps The patient figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking The workshop was arrived at by a step ladder from the outer yard below where it served as a shelter for the large grindstone where tools were sharpened The whole had at once a fanciful and practical air in Clennam s eyes which was a welcome change and as often as he raised them from his first work of getting the array of business documents into perfect order he glanced at these things with a feeling of pleasure in his pursuit that was new to him Raising his eyes thus one day he was surprised to see a bonnet labouring up the step ladder The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet He then perceived that the first bonnet was on the head of mister F s Aunt and that the second bonnet was on the head of Flora who seemed to have propelled her legacy up the steep ascent with considerable difficulty Though not altogether enraptured at the sight of these visitors Clennam lost no time in opening the counting house door and extricating them from the workshop a rescue which was rendered the more necessary by mister F s Aunt already stumbling over some impediment and menacing steam power as an Institution with a stony reticule she carried Good gracious Arthur I should say mister Clennam far more proper the climb we have had to get up here and how ever to get down again without a fire escape and mister F s Aunt slipping through the steps and bruised all over and you in the machinery and foundry way too only think and never told us Thus Flora out of breath Meanwhile mister F s Aunt rubbed her esteemed insteps with her umbrella and vindictively glared Most unkind never to have come back to see us since that day though naturally it was not to be expected that there should be any attraction at our house and you were much more pleasantly engaged that s pretty certain and is she fair or dark blue eyes or black I wonder not that I expect that she should be anything but a perfect contrast to me in all particulars for I am a disappointment as I very well know and you are quite right to be devoted no doubt though what I am saying Arthur never mind I hardly know myself Good gracious By this time he had placed chairs for them in the counting house As Flora dropped into hers she bestowed the old look upon him And to think of Doyce and Clennam and who Doyce can be said Flora delightful man no doubt and married perhaps or perhaps a daughter now has he really then one understands the partnership and sees it all don t tell me anything about it for I know I have no claim to ask the question the golden chain that once was forged being snapped and very proper Flora put her hand tenderly on his and gave him another of the youthful glances Dear Arthur force of habit mister Clennam every way more delicate and adapted to existing circumstances I must beg to be excused for taking the liberty of this intrusion but I thought I might so far presume upon old times for ever faded never more to bloom as to call with mister F s Aunt to congratulate and offer best wishes A great deal superior to China not to be denied and much nearer though higher up I am very happy to see you said Clennam and I thank you Flora very much for your kind remembrance More than I can say myself at any rate returned Flora for I might have been dead and buried twenty distinct times over and no doubt whatever should have been before you had genuinely remembered Me or anything like it in spite of which one last remark I wish to make one last explanation I wish to offer My dear missus Finching Arthur remonstrated in alarm Oh not that disagreeable name say Flora Flora is it worth troubling yourself afresh to enter into explanations I assure you none are needed I am satisfied I am perfectly satisfied A diversion was occasioned here by mister F s Aunt making the following inexorable and awful statement There s mile stones on the Dover road With such mortal hostility towards the human race did she discharge this missile that Clennam was quite at a loss how to defend himself the rather as he had been already perplexed in his mind by the honour of a visit from this venerable lady when it was plain she held him in the utmost abhorrence He could not but look at her with disconcertment as she sat breathing bitterness and scorn and staring leagues away Flora however received the remark as if it had been of a most apposite and agreeable nature approvingly observing aloud that mister F s Aunt had a great deal of spirit Stimulated either by this compliment or by her burning indignation that illustrious woman then added Let him meet it if he can And with a rigid movement of her stony reticule an appendage of great size and of a fossil appearance indicated that Clennam was the unfortunate person at whom the challenge was hurled One last remark resumed Flora I was going to say I wish to make one last explanation I wish to offer mister F s Aunt and myself would not have intruded on business hours mister F having been in business and though the wine trade still business is equally business call it what you will and business habits are just the same as witness mister F himself who had his slippers always on the mat at ten minutes before six in the afternoon and his boots inside the fender at ten minutes before eight in the morning to the moment in all weathers light or dark would not therefore have intruded without a motive which being kindly meant it may be hoped will be kindly taken Arthur mister Clennam far more proper even Doyce and Clennam probably more business like Pray say nothing in the way of apology Arthur entreated You are always welcome Very polite of you to say so Arthur cannot remember mister Clennam until the word is out such is the habit of times for ever fled and so true it is that oft in the stilly night ere slumber s chain has bound people fond memory brings the light of other days around people very polite but more polite than true I am afraid for to go into the machinery business without so much as sending a line or a card to papa I don t say me though there was a time but that is past and stern reality has now my gracious never mind does not look like it you must confess Even Flora s commas seemed to have fled on this occasion she was so much more disjointed and voluble than in the preceding interview Though indeed she hurried on nothing else is to be expected and why should it be expected and if it s not to be expected why should it be and I am far from blaming you or any one When your mama and my papa worried us to death and severed the golden bowl I mean bond but I dare say you know what I mean and if you don t you don t lose much and care just as little I will venture to add when they severed the golden bond that bound us and threw us into fits of crying on the sofa nearly choked at least myself everything was changed and in giving my hand to mister F I know I did so with my eyes open but he was so very unsettled and in such low spirits that he had distractedly alluded to the river if not oil of something from the chemist s and I did it for the best My good Flora we settled that before It was all quite right It s perfectly clear you think so returned Flora for you take it very coolly if I hadn t known it to be China I should have guessed myself the Polar regions dear mister Clennam you are right however and I cannot blame you but as to Doyce and Clennam papa s property being about here we heard it from Pancks and but for him we never should have heard one word about it I am satisfied No no don t say that What nonsense not to say it Arthur Doyce and Clennam easier and less trying to me than mister Clennam when I know it and you know it too and can t deny it But I do deny it Flora I should soon have made you a friendly visit Ah said Flora tossing her head I dare say and she gave him another of the old looks However when Pancks told us I made up my mind that mister F s Aunt and I would come and call because when papa which was before that happened to mention her name to me and to say that you were interested in her I said at the moment Good gracious why not have her here then when there s anything to do instead of putting it out When you say Her observed Clennam by this time pretty well bewildered do you mean mister F s My goodness Arthur Doyce and Clennam really easier to me with old remembrances who ever heard of mister F s Aunt doing needlework and going out by the day Going out by the day Do you speak of Little Dorrit Why yes of course returned Flora and of all the strangest names I ever heard the strangest like a place down in the country with a turnpike or a favourite pony or a puppy or a bird or something from a seed shop to be put in a garden or a flower pot and come up speckled Then Flora said Arthur with a sudden interest in the conversation mister Casby was so kind as to mention Little Dorrit to you was he What did he say Oh you know what papa is rejoined Flora and how aggravatingly he sits looking beautiful and turning his thumbs over and over one another till he makes one giddy if one keeps one s eyes upon him he said when we were talking of you I don t know who began the subject Arthur Doyce and Clennam but I am sure it wasn t me at least I hope not but you really must excuse my confessing more on that point Certainly said Arthur By all means You are very ready pouted Flora coming to a sudden stop in a captivating bashfulness that I must admit Papa said you had spoken of her in an earnest way and I said what I have told you and that s all That s all said Arthur a little disappointed Except that when Pancks told us of your having embarked in this business and with difficulty persuaded us that it was really you I said to mister F s Aunt then we would come and ask you if it would be agreeable to all parties that she should be engaged at our house when required for I know she often goes to your mama s and I know that your mama has a very touchy temper Arthur Doyce and Clennam or I never might have married mister F and might have been at this hour but I am running into nonsense It was very kind of you Flora to think of this Poor Flora rejoined with a plain sincerity which became her better than her youngest glances that she was glad he thought so She said it with so much heart that Clennam would have given a great deal to buy his old character of her on the spot and throw it and the mermaid away for ever I think Flora he said that the employment you can give Little Dorrit and the kindness you can show her Yes and I will said Flora quickly I am sure of it will be a great assistance and support to her I do not feel that I have the right to tell you what I know of her for I acquired the knowledge confidentially and under circumstances that bind me to silence But I have an interest in the little creature and a respect for her that I cannot express to you Her life has been one of such trial and devotion and such quiet goodness as you can scarcely imagine I can hardly think of her far less speak of her without feeling moved Let that feeling represent what I could tell you and commit her to your friendliness with my thanks Once more he put out his hand frankly to poor Flora once more poor Flora couldn t accept it frankly found it worth nothing openly must make the old intrigue and mystery of it As much to her own enjoyment as to his dismay she covered it with a corner of her shawl as she took it Then looking towards the glass front of the counting house and seeing two figures approaching she cried with infinite relish Papa Hush Arthur for Mercy s sake and tottered back to her chair with an amazing imitation of being in danger of swooning in the dread surprise and maidenly flutter of her spirits The Patriarch meanwhile came inanely beaming towards the counting house in the wake of Pancks Pancks opened the door for him towed him in and retired to his own moorings in a corner I heard from Flora said the Patriarch with his benevolent smile that she was coming to call coming to call And being out I thought I d come also thought I d come also The benign wisdom he infused into this declaration not of itself profound by means of his blue eyes his shining head and his long white hair was most impressive It seemed worth putting down among the noblest sentiments enunciated by the best of men Also when he said to Clennam seating himself in the proffered chair And you are in a new business mister Clennam I wish you well sir I wish you well he seemed to have done benevolent wonders missus Finching has been telling me sir said Arthur after making his acknowledgments the relict of the late mister F meanwhile protesting with a gesture against his use of that respectable name that she hopes occasionally to employ the young needlewoman you recommended to my mother For which I have been thanking her The Patriarch turning his head in a lumbering way towards Pancks that assistant put up the note book in which he had been absorbed and took him in tow You didn t recommend her you know said Pancks how could you You knew nothing about her you didn t The name was mentioned to you and you passed it on That s what YOU did Well said Clennam As she justifies any recommendation it is much the same thing You are glad she turns out well said Pancks but it wouldn t have been your fault if she had turned out ill The credit s not yours as it is and the blame wouldn t have been yours as it might have been You gave no guarantee You knew nothing about her You are not acquainted then said Arthur hazarding a random question with any of her family Acquainted with any of her family returned Pancks How should you be acquainted with any of her family You never heard of em You can t be acquainted with people you never heard of can you You should think not All this time the Patriarch sat serenely smiling nodding or shaking his head benevolently as the case required As to being a reference said Pancks you know in a general way what being a reference means It s all your eye that is Look at your tenants down the Yard here They d all be references for one another if you d let em What would be the good of letting em It s no satisfaction to be done by two men instead of one One s enough A person who can t pay gets another person who can t pay to guarantee that he can pay Like a person with two wooden legs getting another person with two wooden legs to guarantee that he has got two natural legs It don t make either of them able to do a walking match And four wooden legs are more troublesome to you than two when you don t want any mister Pancks concluded by blowing off that steam of his A momentary silence that ensued was broken by mister F s Aunt who had been sitting upright in a cataleptic state since her last public remark She now underwent a violent twitch calculated to produce a startling effect on the nerves of the uninitiated and with the deadliest animosity observed You can t make a head and brains out of a brass knob with nothing in it You couldn t do it when your Uncle George was living much less when he s dead mister Pancks was not slow to reply with his usual calmness Indeed ma am Bless my soul I m surprised to hear it Despite his presence of mind however the speech of mister F s Aunt produced a depressing effect on the little assembly firstly because it was impossible to disguise that Clennam s unoffending head was the particular temple of reason depreciated and secondly because nobody ever knew on these occasions whose Uncle George was referred to or what spectral presence might be invoked under that appellation Therefore Flora said though still not without a certain boastfulness and triumph in her legacy that mister F s Aunt was very lively to day and she thought they had better go But mister F s Aunt proved so lively as to take the suggestion in unexpected dudgeon and declare that she would not go adding with several injurious expressions that if He too evidently meaning Clennam wanted to get rid of her let him chuck her out of winder and urgently expressing her desire to see Him perform that ceremony In this dilemma mister Pancks whose resources appeared equal to any emergency in the Patriarchal waters slipped on his hat slipped out at the counting house door and slipped in again a moment afterwards with an artificial freshness upon him as if he had been in the country for some weeks Why bless my heart ma am said mister Pancks rubbing up his hair in great astonishment is that you How do you do ma am You are looking charming to day I am delighted to see you Favour me with your arm ma am we ll have a little walk together you and me if you ll honour me with your company And so escorted mister F s Aunt down the private staircase of the counting house with great gallantry and success The patriarchal mister Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself and blandly followed leaving his daughter as she followed in her turn to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper which she very much enjoyed that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs and further to hint mysteriously that the late mister F was at the bottom of it Alone again Clennam became a prey to his old doubts in reference to his mother and Little Dorrit and revolved the old thoughts and suspicions They were all in his mind blending themselves with the duties he was mechanically discharging when a shadow on his papers caused him to look up for the cause The cause was mister Pancks With his hat thrown back upon his ears as if his wiry prongs of hair had darted up like springs and cast it off with his jet black beads of eyes inquisitively sharp with the fingers of his right hand in his mouth that he might bite the nails and with the fingers of his left hand in reserve in his pocket for another course mister Pancks cast his shadow through the glass upon the books and papers mister Pancks asked with a little inquiring twist of his head if he might come in again Clennam replied with a nod of his head in the affirmative mister Pancks worked his way in came alongside the desk made himself fast by leaning his arms upon it and started conversation with a puff and a snort mister F s Aunt is appeased I hope said Clennam All right sir said Pancks I am so unfortunate as to have awakened a strong animosity in the breast of that lady said Clennam Do you know why Does SHE know why said Pancks I suppose not I suppose not said Pancks He took out his note book opened it shut it dropped it into his hat which was beside him on the desk and looked in at it as it lay at the bottom of the hat all with a great appearance of consideration mister Clennam he then began I am in want of information sir Connected with this firm asked Clennam No said Pancks With what then mister Pancks That is to say assuming that you want it of me Yes sir yes I want it of you said Pancks if I can persuade you to furnish it A B C D DA DE DI DO Dictionary order Dorrit That s the name sir mister Pancks blew off his peculiar noise again and fell to at his right hand nails Arthur looked searchingly at him he returned the look I don t understand you mister Pancks That s the name that I want to know about And what do you want to know Whatever you can and will tell me This comprehensive summary of his desires was not discharged without some heavy labouring on the part of mister Pancks s machinery This is a singular visit mister Pancks It strikes me as rather extraordinary that you should come with such an object to me It may be all extraordinary together returned Pancks It may be out of the ordinary course and yet be business In short it is business I am a man of business What business have I in this present world except to stick to business No business With his former doubt whether this dry hard personage were quite in earnest Clennam again turned his eyes attentively upon his face It was as scrubby and dingy as ever and as eager and quick as ever and he could see nothing lurking in it that was at all expressive of a latent mockery that had seemed to strike upon his ear in the voice Now said Pancks to put this business on its own footing it s not my proprietor s Do you refer to mister Casby as your proprietor Pancks nodded My proprietor Put a case Say at my proprietor s I hear name name of young person mister Clennam wants to serve Say name first mentioned to my proprietor by Plornish in the Yard Say I go to Plornish Say I ask Plornish as a matter of business for information Say Plornish though six weeks in arrear to my proprietor declines Say missus Plornish declines Say both refer to mister Clennam Put the case Well Well sir returned Pancks say I come to him Say here I am With those prongs of hair sticking up all over his head and his breath coming and going very hard and short the busy Pancks fell back a step in Tug metaphor took half a turn astern as if to show his dingy hull complete then forged a head again and directed his quick glance by turns into his hat where his note book was and into Clennam s face mister Pancks not to trespass on your grounds of mystery I will be as plain with you as I can Let me ask two questions First All right said Pancks holding up his dirty forefinger with his broken nail I see What s your motive Exactly Motive said Pancks good Nothing to do with my proprietor not stateable at present ridiculous to state at present but good Desiring to serve young person name of Dorrit said Pancks with his forefinger still up as a caution Better admit motive to be good Secondly and lastly what do you want to know mister Pancks fished up his note book before the question was put and buttoning it with care in an inner breast pocket and looking straight at Clennam all the time replied with a pause and a puff I want supplementary information of any sort Clennam could not withhold a smile as the panting little steam tug so useful to that unwieldy ship the Casby waited on and watched him as if it were seeking an opportunity of running in and rifling him of all he wanted before he could resist its manoeuvres though there was that in mister Pancks s eagerness too which awakened many wondering speculations in his mind After a little consideration he resolved to supply mister Pancks with such leading information as it was in his power to impart him well knowing that mister Pancks if he failed in his present research was pretty sure to find other means of getting it He therefore first requesting mister Pancks to remember his voluntary declaration that his proprietor had no part in the disclosure and that his own intentions were good two declarations which that coaly little gentleman with the greatest ardour repeated openly told him that as to the Dorrit lineage or former place of habitation he had no information to communicate and that his knowledge of the family did not extend beyond the fact that it appeared to be now reduced to five members namely to two brothers of whom one was single and one a widower with three children The ages of the whole family he made known to mister Pancks as nearly as he could guess at them and finally he described to him the position of the Father of the Marshalsea and the course of time and events through which he had become invested with that character To all this mister Pancks snorting and blowing in a more and more portentous manner as he became more interested listened with great attention appearing to derive the most agreeable sensations from the painfullest parts of the narrative and particularly to be quite charmed by the account of William Dorrit s long imprisonment In conclusion mister Pancks said Arthur I have but to say this I have reasons beyond a personal regard for speaking as little as I can of the Dorrit family particularly at my mother s house mister Pancks nodded and for knowing as much as I can So devoted a man of business as you are eh For mister Pancks had suddenly made that blowing effort with unusual force It s nothing said Pancks So devoted a man of business as yourself has a perfect understanding of a fair bargain I wish to make a fair bargain with you that you shall enlighten me concerning the Dorrit family when you have it in your power as I have enlightened you It may not give you a very flattering idea of my business habits that I failed to make my terms beforehand continued Clennam but I prefer to make them a point of honour I have seen so much business done on sharp principles that to tell you the truth mister Pancks I am tired of them mister Pancks laughed It s a bargain sir said he You shall find me stick to it After that he stood a little while looking at Clennam and biting his ten nails all round evidently while he fixed in his mind what he had been told and went over it carefully before the means of supplying a gap in his memory should be no longer at hand It s all right he said at last and now I ll wish you good day as it s collecting day in the Yard By the bye though A lame foreigner with a stick Ay ay You do take a reference sometimes I see said Clennam When he can pay sir replied Pancks Take all you can get and keep back all you can t be forced to give up That s business The lame foreigner with the stick wants a top room down the Yard Is he good for it I am said Clennam and I will answer for him That s enough What I must have of Bleeding Heart Yard said Pancks making a note of the case in his book is my bond I want my bond you see Pay up or produce your property That s the watchword down the Yard The lame foreigner with the stick represented that you sent him but he could represent as far as that goes that the Great Mogul sent him He has been in the hospital I believe Yes Through having met with an accident He is only just now discharged It s pauperising a man sir I have been shown to let him into a hospital said Pancks And again blew off that remarkable sound I have been shown so too said Clennam coldly mister Pancks being by that time quite ready for a start got under steam in a moment and without any other signal or ceremony was snorting down the step ladder and working into Bleeding Heart Yard before he seemed to be well out of the counting house Throughout the remainder of the day Bleeding Heart Yard was in consternation as the grim Pancks cruised in it haranguing the inhabitants on their backslidings in respect of payment demanding his bond breathing notices to quit and executions running down defaulters sending a swell of terror on before him and leaving it in his wake Knots of people impelled by a fatal attraction lurked outside any house in which he was known to be listening for fragments of his discourses to the inmates and when he was rumoured to be coming down the stairs often could not disperse so quickly but that he would be prematurely in among them demanding their own arrears and rooting them to the spot Throughout the remainder of the day mister Pancks s What were they up to and What did they mean by it sounded all over the Yard mister Pancks wouldn t hear of excuses wouldn t hear of complaints wouldn t hear of repairs wouldn t hear of anything but unconditional money down Perspiring and puffing and darting about in eccentric directions and becoming hotter and dingier every moment he lashed the tide of the yard into a most agitated and turbid state It had not settled down into calm water again full two hours after he had been seen fuming away on the horizon at the top of the steps There were several small assemblages of the Bleeding Hearts at the popular points of meeting in the Yard that night among whom it was universally agreed that mister Pancks was a hard man to have to do with and that it was much to be regretted so it was that a gentleman like mister Casby should put his rents in his hands and never know him in his true light For said the Bleeding Hearts if a gentleman with that head of hair and them eyes took his rents into his own hands ma am there would be none of this worriting and wearing and things would be very different At which identical evening hour and minute the Patriarch who had floated serenely through the Yard in the forenoon before the harrying began with the express design of getting up this trustfulness in his shining bumps and silken locks at which identical hour and minute that first rate humbug of a thousand guns was heavily floundering in the little Dock of his exhausted Tug at home and was saying as he turned his thumbs A very bad day s work Pancks very bad day s work It seems to me sir and I must insist on making this observation forcibly in justice to myself that you ought to have got much more money much more money CHAPTER twenty four Fortune Telling Little Dorrit received a call that same evening from mister Plornish who having intimated that he wished to speak to her privately in a series of coughs so very noticeable as to favour the idea that her father as regarded her seamstress occupation was an illustration of the axiom that there are no such stone blind men as those who will not see obtained an audience with her on the common staircase outside the door There s been a lady at our place to day Miss Dorrit Plornish growled and another one along with her as is a old wixen if ever I met with such The way she snapped a person s head off dear me The mild Plornish was at first quite unable to get his mind away from mister F s Aunt For said he to excuse himself she is I do assure you the winegariest party At length by a great effort he detached himself from the subject sufficiently to observe But she s neither here nor there just at present The other lady she s mister Casby s daughter and if mister Casby an t well off none better it an t through any fault of Pancks For as to Pancks he does he really does he does indeed mister Plornish after his usual manner was a little obscure but conscientiously emphatic And what she come to our place for he pursued was to leave word that if Miss Dorrit would step up to that card which it s mister Casby s house that is and Pancks he has a office at the back where he really does beyond belief she would be glad for to engage her She was a old and a dear friend she said particular of mister Clennam and hoped for to prove herself a useful friend to his friend Them was her words Wishing to know whether Miss Dorrit could come to morrow morning I said I would see you Miss and inquire and look round there to night to say yes or if you was engaged to morrow when I can go to morrow thank you said Little Dorrit This is very kind of you but you are always kind mister Plornish with a modest disavowal of his merits opened the room door for her readmission and followed her in with such an exceedingly bald pretence of not having been out at all that her father might have observed it without being very suspicious In his affable unconsciousness however he took no heed Plornish after a little conversation in which he blended his former duty as a Collegian with his present privilege as a humble outside friend qualified again by his low estate as a plasterer took his leave making the tour of the prison before he left and looking on at a game of skittles with the mixed feelings of an old inhabitant who had his private reasons for believing that it might be his destiny to come back again Early in the morning Little Dorrit leaving Maggy in high domestic trust set off for the Patriarchal tent She went by the Iron Bridge though it cost her a penny and walked more slowly in that part of her journey than in any other At five minutes before eight her hand was on the Patriarchal knocker which was quite as high as she could reach She gave missus Finching s card to the young woman who opened the door and the young woman told her that Miss Flora Flora having on her return to the parental roof reinvested herself with the title under which she had lived there was not yet out of her bedroom but she was to please to walk up into Miss Flora s sitting room She walked up into Miss Flora s sitting room as in duty bound and there found a breakfast table comfortably laid for two with a supplementary tray upon it laid for one The young woman disappearing for a few moments returned to say that she was to please to take a chair by the fire and to take off her bonnet and make herself at home But Little Dorrit being bashful and not used to make herself at home on such occasions felt at a loss how to do it so she was still sitting near the door with her bonnet on when Flora came in in a hurry half an hour afterwards Flora was so sorry to have kept her waiting and good gracious why did she sit out there in the cold when she had expected to find her by the fire reading the paper and hadn t that heedless girl given her the message then and had she really been in her bonnet all this time and pray for goodness sake let Flora take it off Flora taking it off in the best natured manner in the world was so struck with the face disclosed that she said Why what a good little thing you are my dear and pressed her face between her hands like the gentlest of women It was the word and the action of a moment Little Dorrit had hardly time to think how kind it was when Flora dashed at the breakfast table full of business and plunged over head and ears into loquacity Really so sorry that I should happen to be late on this morning of all mornings because my intention and my wish was to be ready to meet you when you came in and to say that any one that interested Arthur Clennam half so much must interest me and that I gave you the heartiest welcome and was so glad instead of which they never called me and there I still am snoring I dare say if the truth was known and if you don t like either cold fowl or hot boiled ham which many people don t I dare say besides Jews and theirs are scruples of conscience which we must all respect though I must say I wish they had them equally strong when they sell us false articles for real that certainly ain t worth the money I shall be quite vexed said Flora Little Dorrit thanked her and said shyly bread and butter and tea was all she usually Oh nonsense my dear child I can never hear of that said Flora turning on the urn in the most reckless manner and making herself wink by splashing hot water into her eyes as she bent down to look into the teapot You are coming here on the footing of a friend and companion you know if you will let me take that liberty and I should be ashamed of myself indeed if you could come here upon any other besides which Arthur Clennam spoke in such terms you are tired my dear No ma am You turn so pale you have walked too far before breakfast and I dare say live a great way off and ought to have had a ride said Flora dear dear is there anything that would do you good Indeed I am quite well ma am I thank you again and again but I am quite well Then take your tea at once I beg said Flora and this wing of fowl and bit of ham don t mind me or wait for me because I always carry in this tray myself to mister F s Aunt who breakfasts in bed and a charming old lady too and very clever Portrait of mister F behind the door and very like though too much forehead and as to a pillar with a marble pavement and balustrades and a mountain I never saw him near it nor not likely in the wine trade excellent man but not at all in that way Little Dorrit glanced at the portrait very imperfectly following the references to that work of art mister F was so devoted to me that he never could bear me out of his sight said Flora though of course I am unable to say how long that might have lasted if he hadn t been cut short while I was a new broom worthy man but not poetical manly prose but not romance Little Dorrit glanced at the portrait again The artist had given it a head that would have been in an intellectual point of view top heavy for Shakespeare Romance however Flora went on busily arranging mister F s Aunt s toast as I openly said to mister F when he proposed to me and you will be surprised to hear that he proposed seven times once in a hackney coach once in a boat once in a pew once on a donkey at Tunbridge Wells and the rest on his knees Romance was fled with the early days of Arthur Clennam our parents tore us asunder we became marble and stern reality usurped the throne mister F said very much to his credit that he was perfectly aware of it and even preferred that state of things accordingly the word was spoken the fiat went forth and such is life you see my dear and yet we do not break but bend pray make a good breakfast while I go in with the tray She disappeared leaving Little Dorrit to ponder over the meaning of her scattered words She soon came back again and at last began to take her own breakfast talking all the while You see my dear said Flora measuring out a spoonful or two of some brown liquid that smelt like brandy and putting it into her tea I am obliged to be careful to follow the directions of my medical man though the flavour is anything but agreeable being a poor creature and it may be have never recovered the shock received in youth from too much giving way to crying in the next room when separated from Arthur have you known him long As soon as Little Dorrit comprehended that she had been asked this question for which time was necessary the galloping pace of her new patroness having left her far behind she answered that she had known mister Clennam ever since his return To be sure you couldn t have known him before unless you had been in China or had corresponded neither of which is likely returned Flora for travelling people usually get more or less mahogany and you are not at all so and as to corresponding what about that s very true unless tea so it was at his mother s was it really that you knew him first highly sensible and firm but dreadfully severe ought to be the mother of the man in the iron mask missus Clennam has been kind to me said Little Dorrit Really I am sure I am glad to hear it because as Arthur s mother it s naturally pleasant to my feelings to have a better opinion of her than I had before though what she thinks of me when I run on as I am certain to do and she sits glowering at me like Fate in a go cart shocking comparison really invalid and not her fault I never know or can imagine Shall I find my work anywhere ma am asked Little Dorrit looking timidly about can I get it You industrious little fairy returned Flora taking in another cup of tea another of the doses prescribed by her medical man there s not the slightest hurry and it s better that we should begin by being confidential about our mutual friend too cold a word for me at least I don t mean that very proper expression mutual friend than become through mere formalities not you but me like the Spartan boy with the fox biting him which I hope you ll excuse my bringing up for of all the tiresome boys that will go tumbling into every sort of company that boy s the tiresomest Little Dorrit her face very pale sat down again to listen Hadn t I better work the while she asked I can work and attend too I would rather if I may Her earnestness was so expressive of her being uneasy without her work that Flora answered Well my dear whatever you like best and produced a basket of white handkerchiefs Little Dorrit gladly put it by her side took out her little pocket housewife threaded the needle and began to hem What nimble fingers you have said Flora but are you sure you are well Oh yes indeed Flora put her feet upon the fender and settled herself for a thorough good romantic disclosure She started off at score tossing her head sighing in the most demonstrative manner making a great deal of use of her eyebrows and occasionally but not often glancing at the quiet face that bent over the work You must know my dear said Flora but that I have no doubt you know already not only because I have already thrown it out in a general way but because I feel I carry it stamped in burning what s his names upon my brow that before I was introduced to the late mister F I had been engaged to Arthur Clennam mister Clennam in public where reserve is necessary Arthur here we were all in all to one another it was the morning of life it was bliss it was frenzy it was everything else of that sort in the highest degree when rent asunder we turned to stone in which capacity Arthur went to China and I became the statue bride of the late mister F Flora uttering these words in a deep voice enjoyed herself immensely To paint said she the emotions of that morning when all was marble within and mister F s Aunt followed in a glass coach which it stands to reason must have been in shameful repair or it never could have broken down two streets from the house and mister F s Aunt brought home like the fifth of November in a rush bottomed chair I will not attempt suffice it to say that the hollow form of breakfast took place in the dining room downstairs that papa partaking too freely of pickled salmon was ill for weeks and that mister F and myself went upon a continental tour to Calais where the people fought for us on the pier until they separated us though not for ever that was not yet to be The statue bride hardly pausing for breath went on with the greatest complacency in a rambling manner sometimes incidental to flesh and blood I will draw a veil over that dreamy life mister F was in good spirits his appetite was good he liked the cookery he considered the wine weak but palatable and all was well we returned to the immediate neighbourhood of Number Thirty Little Gosling Street London Docks and settled down ere we had yet fully detected the housemaid in selling the feathers out of the spare bed Gout flying upwards soared with mister F to another sphere His relict with a glance at his portrait shook her head and wiped her eyes I revere the memory of mister F as an estimable man and most indulgent husband only necessary to mention Asparagus and it appeared or to hint at any little delicate thing to drink and it came like magic in a pint bottle it was not ecstasy but it was comfort I returned to papa s roof and lived secluded if not happy during some years until one day papa came smoothly blundering in and said that Arthur Clennam awaited me below I went below and found him ask me not what I found him except that he was still unmarried still unchanged The dark mystery with which Flora now enshrouded herself might have stopped other fingers than the nimble fingers that worked near her They worked on without pause and the busy head bent over them watching the stitches Ask me not said Flora if I love him still or if he still loves me or what the end is to be or when we are surrounded by watchful eyes and it may be that we are destined to pine asunder it may be never more to be reunited not a word not a breath not a look to betray us all must be secret as the tomb wonder not therefore that even if I should seem comparatively cold to Arthur or Arthur should seem comparatively cold to me we have fatal reasons it is enough if we understand them hush All of which Flora said with so much headlong vehemence as if she really believed it There is not much doubt that when she worked herself into full mermaid condition she did actually believe whatever she said in it Hush repeated Flora I have now told you all confidence is established between us hush for Arthur s sake I will always be a friend to you my dear girl and in Arthur s name you may always rely upon me The nimble fingers laid aside the work and the little figure rose and kissed her hand You are very cold said Flora changing to her own natural kind hearted manner and gaining greatly by the change Don t work to day I am sure you are not well I am sure you are not strong It is only that I feel a little overcome by your kindness and by mister Clennam s kindness in confiding me to one he has known and loved so long Well really my dear said Flora who had a decided tendency to be always honest when she gave herself time to think about it it s as well to leave that alone now for I couldn t undertake to say after all but it doesn t signify lie down a little I have always been strong enough to do what I want to do and I shall be quite well directly returned Little Dorrit with a faint smile You have overpowered me with gratitude that s all If I keep near the window for a moment I shall be quite myself Flora opened a window sat her in a chair by it and considerately retired to her former place It was a windy day and the air stirring on Little Dorrit s face soon brightened it In a very few minutes she returned to her basket of work and her nimble fingers were as nimble as ever Quietly pursuing her task she asked Flora if mister Clennam had told her where she lived When Flora replied in the negative Little Dorrit said that she understood why he had been so delicate but that she felt sure he would approve of her confiding her secret to Flora and that she would therefore do so now with Flora s permission Receiving an encouraging answer she condensed the narrative of her life into a few scanty words about herself and a glowing eulogy upon her father and Flora took it all in with a natural tenderness that quite understood it and in which there was no incoherence When dinner time came Flora drew the arm of her new charge through hers and led her down stairs and presented her to the Patriarch and mister Pancks who were already in the dining room waiting to begin mister F s Aunt was for the time laid up in ordinary in her chamber By those gentlemen she was received according to their characters the Patriarch appearing to do her some inestimable service in saying that he was glad to see her glad to see her and mister Pancks blowing off his favourite sound as a salute In that new presence she would have been bashful enough under any circumstances and particularly under Flora s insisting on her drinking a glass of wine and eating of the best that was there but her constraint was greatly increased by mister Pancks The demeanour of that gentleman at first suggested to her mind that he might be a taker of likenesses so intently did he look at her and so frequently did he glance at the little note book by his side Observing that he made no sketch however and that he talked about business only she began to have suspicions that he represented some creditor of her father s the balance due to whom was noted in that pocket volume Regarded from this point of view mister Pancks s puffings expressed injury and impatience and each of his louder snorts became a demand for payment But here again she was undeceived by anomalous and incongruous conduct on the part of mister Pancks himself She had left the table half an hour and was at work alone Flora had gone to lie down in the next room concurrently with which retirement a smell of something to drink had broken out in the house The Patriarch was fast asleep with his philanthropic mouth open under a yellow pocket handkerchief in the dining room At this quiet time mister Pancks softly appeared before her urbanely nodding Find it a little dull Miss Dorrit inquired Pancks in a low voice No thank you sir said Little Dorrit Busy I see observed mister Pancks stealing into the room by inches What are those now Miss Dorrit Handkerchiefs Are they though said Pancks I shouldn t have thought it Not in the least looking at them but looking at Little Dorrit Perhaps you wonder who I am Shall I tell you I am a fortune teller Little Dorrit now began to think he was mad I belong body and soul to my proprietor said Pancks you saw my proprietor having his dinner below But I do a little in the other way sometimes privately very privately Miss Dorrit Little Dorrit looked at him doubtfully and not without alarm I wish you d show me the palm of your hand said Pancks I should like to have a look at it Don t let me be troublesome He was so far troublesome that he was not at all wanted there but she laid her work in her lap for a moment and held out her left hand with her thimble on it Years of toil eh said Pancks softly touching it with his blunt forefinger But what else are we made for Nothing Hallo looking into the lines What s this with bars It s a College And what s this with a grey gown and a black velvet cap it s a father And what s this with a clarionet It s an uncle And what s this in dancing shoes It s a sister And what s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way It s a brother And what s this thinking for em all Why this is you Miss Dorrit Her eyes met his as she looked up wonderingly into his face and she thought that although his were sharp eyes he was a brighter and gentler looking man than she had supposed at dinner His eyes were on her hand again directly and her opportunity of confirming or correcting the impression was gone Now the deuce is in it muttered Pancks tracing out a line in her hand with his clumsy finger if this isn t me in the corner here What do I want here What s behind me He carried his finger slowly down to the wrist and round the wrist and affected to look at the back of the hand for what was behind him Is it any harm asked Little Dorrit smiling Deuce a bit said Pancks What do you think it s worth I ought to ask you that I am not the fortune teller True said Pancks What s it worth You shall live to see Miss Dorrit Releasing the hand by slow degrees he drew all his fingers through his prongs of hair so that they stood up in their most portentous manner and repeated slowly Remember what I say Miss Dorrit You shall live to see She could not help showing that she was much surprised if it were only by his knowing so much about her Ah That s it said Pancks pointing at her Miss Dorrit not that ever More surprised than before and a little more frightened she looked to him for an explanation of his last words Not that said Pancks making with great seriousness an imitation of a surprised look and manner that appeared to be unintentionally grotesque Don t do that Never on seeing me no matter when no matter where I am nobody Don t take on to mind me Don t mention me Take no notice Will you agree Miss Dorrit I hardly know what to say returned Little Dorrit quite astounded Why Because I am a fortune teller Pancks the gipsy I haven t told you so much of your fortune yet Miss Dorrit as to tell you what s behind me on that little hand I have told you you shall live to see Is it agreed Miss Dorrit Agreed that I am to To take no notice of me away from here unless I take on first Not to mind me when I come and go It s very easy I am no loss I am not handsome I am not good company I am only my proprietors grubber You need do no more than think Ah Pancks the gipsy at his fortune telling he ll tell the rest of my fortune one day I shall live to know it Is it agreed Miss Dorrit Ye es faltered Little Dorrit whom he greatly confused I suppose so while you do no harm Good mister Pancks glanced at the wall of the adjoining room and stooped forward Honest creature woman of capital points but heedless and a loose talker Miss Dorrit With that he rubbed his hands as if the interview had been very satisfactory to him panted away to the door and urbanely nodded himself out again If Little Dorrit were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct on the part of her new acquaintance and by finding herself involved in this singular treaty her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing circumstances Besides that mister Pancks took every opportunity afforded him in mister Casby s house of significantly glancing at her and snorting at her which was not much after what he had done already he began to pervade her daily life She saw him in the street constantly When she went to mister Casby s he was always there When she went to missus Clennam s he came there on any pretence as if to keep her in his sight A week had not gone by when she found him to her astonishment in the Lodge one night conversing with the turnkey on duty and to all appearance one of his familiar companions Her next surprise was to find him equally at his ease within the prison to hear of his presenting himself among the visitors at her father s Sunday levee to see him arm in arm with a Collegiate friend about the yard to learn from Fame that he had greatly distinguished himself one evening at the social club that held its meetings in the Snuggery by addressing a speech to the members of the institution singing a song and treating the company to five gallons of ale report madly added a bushel of shrimps The effect on mister Plornish of such of these phenomena as he became an eye witness of in his faithful visits made an impression on Little Dorrit only second to that produced by the phenomena themselves They seemed to gag and bind him He could only stare and sometimes weakly mutter that it wouldn t be believed down Bleeding Heart Yard that this was Pancks but he never said a word more or made a sign more even to Little Dorrit mister Pancks crowned his mysteries by making himself acquainted with Tip in some unknown manner and taking a Sunday saunter into the College on that gentleman s arm Throughout he never took any notice of Little Dorrit save once or twice when he happened to come close to her and there was no one very near on which occasions he said in passing with a friendly look and a puff of encouragement Pancks the gipsy fortune telling Little Dorrit worked and strove as usual wondering at all this but keeping her wonder as she had from her earliest years kept many heavier loads in her own breast A change had stolen and was stealing yet over the patient heart Every day found her something more retiring than the day before To pass in and out of the prison unnoticed and elsewhere to be overlooked and forgotten were for herself her chief desires To her own room too strangely assorted room for her delicate youth and character she was glad to retreat as often as she could without desertion of any duty There were afternoon times when she was unemployed when visitors dropped in to play a hand at cards with her father when she could be spared and was better away Then she would flit along the yard climb the scores of stairs that led to her room and take her seat at the window Many combinations did those spikes upon the wall assume many light shapes did the strong iron weave itself into many golden touches fell upon the rust while Little Dorrit sat there musing New zig zags sprung into the cruel pattern sometimes when she saw it through a burst of tears but beautified or hardened still always over it and under it and through it she was fain to look in her solitude seeing everything with that ineffaceable brand A garret and a Marshalsea garret without compromise was Little Dorrit s room Beautifully kept it was ugly in itself and had little but cleanliness and air to set it off for what embellishment she had ever been able to buy had gone to her father s room Howbeit for this poor place she showed an increasing love and to sit in it alone became her favourite rest Insomuch that on a certain afternoon during the Pancks mysteries when she was seated at her window and heard Maggy s well known step coming up the stairs she was very much disturbed by the apprehension of being summoned away As Maggy s step came higher up and nearer she trembled and faltered and it was as much as she could do to speak when Maggy at length appeared Please Little Mother said Maggy panting for breath you must come down and see him He s here Who Maggy Who o course mister Clennam He s in your father s room and he says to me Maggy will you be so kind and go and say it s only me I am not very well Maggy I had better not go I am going to lie down See I lie down now to ease my head Say with my grateful regard that you left me so or I would have come Well it an t very polite though Little Mother said the staring Maggy to turn your face away neither Maggy was very susceptible to personal slights and very ingenious in inventing them Putting both your hands afore your face too she went on If you can t bear the looks of a poor thing it would be better to tell her so at once and not go and shut her out like that hurting her feelings and breaking her heart at ten year old poor thing It s to ease my head Maggy Well and if you cry to ease your head Little Mother let me cry too Don t go and have all the crying to yourself expostulated Maggy that an t not being greedy And immediately began to blubber It was with some difficulty that she could be induced to go back with the excuse but the promise of being told a story of old her great delight on condition that she concentrated her faculties upon the errand and left her little mistress to herself for an hour longer combined with a misgiving on Maggy s part that she had left her good temper at the bottom of the staircase prevailed So away she went muttering her message all the way to keep it in her mind and at the appointed time came back He was very sorry I can tell you she announced and wanted to send a doctor And he s coming again to morrow he is and I don t think he ll have a good sleep to night along o hearing about your head Little Mother Oh my Ain t you been a crying I think I have a little Maggy A little Oh But it s all over now all over for good Maggy And my head is much better and cooler and I am quite comfortable I am very glad I did not go down Her great staring child tenderly embraced her and having smoothed her hair and bathed her forehead and eyes with cold water offices in which her awkward hands became skilful hugged her again exulted in her brighter looks and stationed her in her chair by the window Over against this chair Maggy with apoplectic exertions that were not at all required dragged the box which was her seat on story telling occasions sat down upon it hugged her own knees and said with a voracious appetite for stories and with widely opened eyes Now Little Mother let s have a good un What shall it be about Maggy Oh let s have a princess said Maggy and let her be a reg lar one Beyond all belief you know Little Dorrit considered for a moment and with a rather sad smile upon her face which was flushed by the sunset began Maggy there was once upon a time a fine King and he had everything he could wish for and a great deal more He had gold and silver diamonds and rubies riches of every kind He had palaces and he had Hospitals interposed Maggy still nursing her knees Let him have hospitals because they re so comfortable Hospitals with lots of Chicking Yes he had plenty of them and he had plenty of everything Plenty of baked potatoes for instance said Maggy Plenty of everything Lor chuckled Maggy giving her knees a hug Wasn t it prime This King had a daughter who was the wisest and most beautiful Princess that ever was seen When she was a child she understood all her lessons before her masters taught them to her and when she was grown up she was the wonder of the world Now near the Palace where this Princess lived there was a cottage in which there was a poor little tiny woman who lived all alone by herself An old woman said Maggy with an unctuous smack of her lips No not an old woman Quite a young one I wonder she warn t afraid said Maggy Go on please The Princess passed the cottage nearly every day and whenever she went by in her beautiful carriage she saw the poor tiny woman spinning at her wheel and she looked at the tiny woman and the tiny woman looked at her So one day she stopped the coachman a little way from the cottage and got out and walked on and peeped in at the door and there as usual was the tiny woman spinning at her wheel and she looked at the Princess and the Princess looked at her Like trying to stare one another out said Maggy Please go on Little Mother The Princess was such a wonderful Princess that she had the power of knowing secrets and she said to the tiny woman Why do you keep it there This showed her directly that the Princess knew why she lived all alone by herself spinning at her wheel and she kneeled down at the Princess s feet and asked her never to betray her So the Princess said I never will betray you Let me see it So the tiny woman closed the shutter of the cottage window and fastened the door and trembling from head to foot for fear that any one should suspect her opened a very secret place and showed the Princess a shadow Lor said Maggy It was the shadow of Some one who had gone by long before of Some one who had gone on far away quite out of reach never never to come back It was bright to look at and when the tiny woman showed it to the Princess she was proud of it with all her heart as a great great treasure When the Princess had considered it a little while she said to the tiny woman And you keep watch over this every day And she cast down her eyes and whispered Yes Then the Princess said Remind me why To which the other replied that no one so good and kind had ever passed that way and that was why in the beginning She said too that nobody missed it that nobody was the worse for it that Some one had gone on to those who were expecting him Some one was a man then interposed Maggy Little Dorrit timidly said Yes she believed so and resumed Had gone on to those who were expecting him and that this remembrance was stolen or kept back from nobody The Princess made answer Ah But when the cottager died it would be discovered there The tiny woman told her No when that time came it would sink quietly into her own grave and would never be found Well to be sure said Maggy Go on please The Princess was very much astonished to hear this as you may suppose Maggy And well she might be said Maggy So she resolved to watch the tiny woman and see what came of it Every day she drove in her beautiful carriage by the cottage door and there she saw the tiny woman always alone by herself spinning at her wheel and she looked at the tiny woman and the tiny woman looked at her At last one day the wheel was still and the tiny woman was not to be seen When the Princess made inquiries why the wheel had stopped and where the tiny woman was she was informed that the wheel had stopped because there was nobody to turn it the tiny woman being dead They ought to have took her to the Hospital said Maggy and then she d have got over it The Princess after crying a very little for the loss of the tiny woman dried her eyes and got out of her carriage at the place where she had stopped it before and went to the cottage and peeped in at the door There was nobody to look at her now and nobody for her to look at so she went in at once to search for the treasured shadow But there was no sign of it to be found anywhere and then she knew that the tiny woman had told her the truth and that it would never give anybody any trouble and that it had sunk quietly into her own grave and that she and it were at rest together That s all Maggy The sunset flush was so bright on Little Dorrit s face when she came thus to the end of her story that she interposed her hand to shade it Had she got to be old Maggy asked The tiny woman Ah I don t know said Little Dorrit But it would have been just the same if she had been ever so old Would it raly said Maggy Well I suppose it would though And sat staring and ruminating She sat so long with her eyes wide open that at length Little Dorrit to entice her from her box rose and looked out of window As she glanced down into the yard she saw Pancks come in and leer up with the corner of his eye as he went by Who s he Little Mother said Maggy She had joined her at the window and was leaning on her shoulder I see him come in and out often I have heard him called a fortune teller said Little Dorrit But I doubt if he could tell many people even their past or present fortunes Couldn t have told the Princess hers said Maggy Little Dorrit looking musingly down into the dark valley of the prison shook her head Nor the tiny woman hers said Maggy No said Little Dorrit with the sunset very bright upon her But let us come away from the window CHAPTER twenty five Conspirators and Others The private residence of mister Pancks was in Pentonville where he lodged on the second floor of a professional gentleman in an extremely small way who had an inner door within the street door poised on a spring and starting open with a click like a trap and who wrote up in the fan light RUGG GENERAL AGENT ACCOUNTANT DEBTS RECOVERED This scroll majestic in its severe simplicity illuminated a little slip of front garden abutting on the thirsty high road where a few of the dustiest of leaves hung their dismal heads and led a life of choking A professor of writing occupied the first floor and enlivened the garden railings with glass cases containing choice examples of what his pupils had been before six lessons and while the whole of his young family shook the table and what they had become after six lessons when the young family was under restraint The tenancy of mister Pancks was limited to one airy bedroom he covenanting and agreeing with mister Rugg his landlord that in consideration of a certain scale of payments accurately defined and on certain verbal notice duly given he should be at liberty to elect to share the Sunday breakfast dinner tea or supper or each or any or all of those repasts or meals of mister and Miss Rugg his daughter in the back parlour Miss Rugg was a lady of a little property which she had acquired together with much distinction in the neighbourhood by having her heart severely lacerated and her feelings mangled by a middle aged baker resident in the vicinity against whom she had by the agency of mister Rugg found it necessary to proceed at law to recover damages for a breach of promise of marriage The baker having been by the counsel for Miss Rugg witheringly denounced on that occasion up to the full amount of twenty guineas at the rate of about eighteen pence an epithet and having been cast in corresponding damages still suffered occasional persecution from the youth of Pentonville But Miss Rugg environed by the majesty of the law and having her damages invested in the public securities was regarded with consideration In the society of mister Rugg who had a round white visage as if all his blushes had been drawn out of him long ago and who had a ragged yellow head like a worn out hearth broom and in the society of Miss Rugg who had little nankeen spots like shirt buttons all over her face and whose own yellow tresses were rather scrubby than luxuriant mister Pancks had usually dined on Sundays for some few years and had twice a week or so enjoyed an evening collation of bread Dutch cheese and porter mister Pancks was one of the very few marriageable men for whom Miss Rugg had no terrors the argument with which he reassured himself being twofold that is to say firstly that it wouldn t do twice and secondly that he wasn t worth it Fortified within this double armour mister Pancks snorted at Miss Rugg on easy terms Up to this time mister Pancks had transacted little or no business at his quarters in Pentonville except in the sleeping line but now that he had become a fortune teller he was often closeted after midnight with mister Rugg in his little front parlour office and even after those untimely hours burnt tallow in his bed room Though his duties as his proprietor s grubber were in no wise lessened and though that service bore no greater resemblance to a bed of roses than was to be discovered in its many thorns some new branch of industry made a constant demand upon him When he cast off the Patriarch at night it was only to take an anonymous craft in tow and labour away afresh in other waters The advance from a personal acquaintance with the elder mister Chivery to an introduction to his amiable wife and disconsolate son may have been easy but easy or not mister Pancks soon made it He nestled in the bosom of the tobacco business within a week or two after his first appearance in the College and particularly addressed himself to the cultivation of a good understanding with Young John In this endeavour he so prospered as to lure that pining shepherd forth from the groves and tempt him to undertake mysterious missions on which he began to disappear at uncertain intervals for as long a space as two or three days together The prudent missus Chivery who wondered greatly at this change would have protested against it as detrimental to the Highland typification on the doorpost but for two forcible reasons one that her John was roused to take strong interest in the business which these starts were supposed to advance and this she held to be good for his drooping spirits the other that mister Pancks confidentially agreed to pay her for the occupation of her son s time at the handsome rate of seven and sixpence per day The proposal originated with himself and was couched in the pithy terms If your John is weak enough ma am not to take it that is no reason why you should be don t you see So quite between ourselves ma am business being business here it is What mister Chivery thought of these things or how much or how little he knew about them was never gathered from himself It has been already remarked that he was a man of few words and it may be here observed that he had imbibed a professional habit of locking everything up He locked himself up as carefully as he locked up the Marshalsea debtors Even his custom of bolting his meals may have been a part of an uniform whole but there is no question that as to all other purposes he kept his mouth as he kept the Marshalsea door He never opened it without occasion When it was necessary to let anything out he opened it a little way held it open just as long as sufficed for the purpose and locked it again Even as he would be sparing of his trouble at the Marshalsea door and would keep a visitor who wanted to go out waiting for a few moments if he saw another visitor coming down the yard so that one turn of the key should suffice for both similarly he would often reserve a remark if he perceived another on its way to his lips and would deliver himself of the two together As to any key to his inner knowledge being to be found in his face the Marshalsea key was as legible as an index to the individual characters and histories upon which it was turned That mister Pancks should be moved to invite any one to dinner at Pentonville was an unprecedented fact in his calendar But he invited Young John to dinner and even brought him within range of the dangerous because expensive fascinations of Miss Rugg The banquet was appointed for a Sunday and Miss Rugg with her own hands stuffed a leg of mutton with oysters on the occasion and sent it to the baker s not THE baker s but an opposition establishment Provision of oranges apples and nuts was also made And rum was brought home by mister Pancks on Saturday night to gladden the visitor s heart The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor s reception Its special feature was a foregone family confidence and sympathy When Young John appeared at half past one without the ivory hand and waistcoat of golden sprigs the sun shorn of his beams by disastrous clouds mister Pancks presented him to the yellow haired Ruggs as the young man he had so often mentioned who loved Miss Dorrit I am glad said mister Rugg challenging him specially in that character to have the distinguished gratification of making your acquaintance sir Your feelings do you honour You are young may you never outlive your feelings If I was to outlive my own feelings sir said mister Rugg who was a man of many words and was considered to possess a remarkably good address if I was to outlive my own feelings I d leave fifty pound in my will to the man who would put me out of existence Miss Rugg heaved a sigh My daughter sir said mister Rugg Anastatia you are no stranger to the state of this young man s affections My daughter has had her trials sir mister Rugg might have used the word more pointedly in the singular number and she can feel for you Young John almost overwhelmed by the touching nature of this greeting professed himself to that effect What I envy you sir is said mister Rugg allow me to take your hat we are rather short of pegs I ll put it in the corner nobody will tread on it there What I envy you sir is the luxury of your own feelings I belong to a profession in which that luxury is sometimes denied us Young John replied with acknowledgments that he only hoped he did what was right and what showed how entirely he was devoted to Miss Dorrit He wished to be unselfish and he hoped he was He wished to do anything as laid in his power to serve Miss Dorrit altogether putting himself out of sight and he hoped he did It was but little that he could do but he hoped he did it Sir said mister Rugg taking him by the hand you are a young man that it does one good to come across You are a young man that I should like to put in the witness box to humanise the minds of the legal profession I hope you have brought your appetite with you and intend to play a good knife and fork Thank you sir returned Young John I don t eat much at present mister Rugg drew him a little apart My daughter s case sir said he at the time when in vindication of her outraged feelings and her sex she became the plaintiff in Rugg and Bawkins I suppose I could have put it in evidence mister Chivery if I had thought it worth my while that the amount of solid sustenance my daughter consumed at that period did not exceed ten ounces per week I think I go a little beyond that sir returned the other hesitating as if he confessed it with some shame But in your case there s no fiend in human form said mister Rugg with argumentative smile and action of hand Observe mister Chivery No fiend in human form No sir certainly Young John added with simplicity I should be very sorry if there was The sentiment said mister Rugg is what I should have expected from your known principles It would affect my daughter greatly sir if she heard it As I perceive the mutton I am glad she didn t hear it mister Pancks on this occasion pray face me My dear face mister Chivery For what we are going to receive may we and Miss Dorrit be truly thankful But for a grave waggishness in mister Rugg s manner of delivering this introduction to the feast it might have appeared that Miss Dorrit was expected to be one of the company Pancks recognised the sally in his usual way and took in his provender in his usual way Miss Rugg perhaps making up some of her arrears likewise took very kindly to the mutton and it rapidly diminished to the bone A bread and butter pudding entirely disappeared and a considerable amount of cheese and radishes vanished by the same means Then came the dessert Then also and before the broaching of the rum and water came mister Pancks s note book The ensuing business proceedings were brief but curious and rather in the nature of a conspiracy mister Pancks looked over his note book which was now getting full studiously and picked out little extracts which he wrote on separate slips of paper on the table mister Rugg in the meanwhile looking at him with close attention and Young John losing his uncollected eye in mists of meditation When mister Pancks who supported the character of chief conspirator had completed his extracts he looked them over corrected them put up his note book and held them like a hand at cards Now there s a churchyard in Bedfordshire said Pancks Who takes it I ll take it sir returned mister Rugg if no one bids mister Pancks dealt him his card and looked at his hand again Now there s an Enquiry in York said Pancks Who takes it I m not good for York said mister Rugg Then perhaps pursued Pancks you ll be so obliging John Chivery Young John assenting Pancks dealt him his card and consulted his hand again There s a Church in London I may as well take that And a Family Bible I may as well take that too That s two to me Two to me repeated Pancks breathing hard over his cards Here s a Clerk at Durham for you John and an old seafaring gentleman at Dunstable for you mister Rugg Two to me was it Yes two to me Here s a Stone three to me And a Still born Baby four to me And all for the present told When he had thus disposed of his cards all being done very quietly and in a suppressed tone mister Pancks puffed his way into his own breast pocket and tugged out a canvas bag from which with a sparing hand he told forth money for travelling expenses in two little portions Cash goes out fast he said anxiously as he pushed a portion to each of his male companions very fast I can only assure you mister Pancks said Young John that I deeply regret my circumstances being such that I can t afford to pay my own charges or that it s not advisable to allow me the time necessary for my doing the distances on foot because nothing would give me greater satisfaction than to walk myself off my legs without fee or reward This young man s disinterestedness appeared so very ludicrous in the eyes of Miss Rugg that she was obliged to effect a precipitate retirement from the company and to sit upon the stairs until she had had her laugh out Meanwhile mister Pancks looking not without some pity at Young John slowly and thoughtfully twisted up his canvas bag as if he were wringing its neck The lady returning as he restored it to his pocket mixed rum and water for the party not forgetting her fair self and handed to every one his glass When all were supplied mister Rugg rose and silently holding out his glass at arm s length above the centre of the table by that gesture invited the other three to add theirs and to unite in a general conspiratorial clink The ceremony was effective up to a certain point and would have been wholly so throughout if Miss Rugg as she raised her glass to her lips in completion of it had not happened to look at Young John when she was again so overcome by the contemptible comicality of his disinterestedness as to splutter some ambrosial drops of rum and water around and withdraw in confusion Such was the dinner without precedent given by Pancks at Pentonville and such was the busy and strange life Pancks led The only waking moments at which he appeared to relax from his cares and to recreate himself by going anywhere or saying anything without a pervading object were when he showed a dawning interest in the lame foreigner with the stick down Bleeding Heart Yard The foreigner by name John Baptist Cavalletto they called him mister Baptist in the Yard was such a chirping easy hopeful little fellow that his attraction for Pancks was probably in the force of contrast Solitary weak and scantily acquainted with the most necessary words of the only language in which he could communicate with the people about him he went with the stream of his fortunes in a brisk way that was new in those parts With little to eat and less to drink and nothing to wear but what he wore upon him or had brought tied up in one of the smallest bundles that ever were seen he put as bright a face upon it as if he were in the most flourishing circumstances when he first hobbled up and down the Yard humbly propitiating the general good will with his white teeth It was uphill work for a foreigner lame or sound to make his way with the Bleeding Hearts In the first place they were vaguely persuaded that every foreigner had a knife about him in the second they held it to be a sound constitutional national axiom that he ought to go home to his own country They never thought of inquiring how many of their own countrymen would be returned upon their hands from divers parts of the world if the principle were generally recognised they considered it particularly and peculiarly British In the third place they had a notion that it was a sort of Divine visitation upon a foreigner that he was not an Englishman and that all kinds of calamities happened to his country because it did things that England did not and did not do things that England did In this belief to be sure they had long been carefully trained by the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings who were always proclaiming to them officially that no country which failed to submit itself to those two large families could possibly hope to be under the protection of Providence and who when they believed it disparaged them in private as the most prejudiced people under the sun This therefore might be called a political position of the Bleeding Hearts but they entertained other objections to having foreigners in the Yard They believed that foreigners were always badly off and though they were as ill off themselves as they could desire to be that did not diminish the force of the objection They believed that foreigners were dragooned and bayoneted and though they certainly got their own skulls promptly fractured if they showed any ill humour still it was with a blunt instrument and that didn t count They believed that foreigners were always immoral and though they had an occasional assize at home and now and then a divorce case or so that had nothing to do with it They believed that foreigners had no independent spirit as never being escorted to the poll in droves by Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle with colours flying and the tune of Rule Britannia playing Not to be tedious they had many other beliefs of a similar kind Against these obstacles the lame foreigner with the stick had to make head as well as he could not absolutely single handed because mister Arthur Clennam had recommended him to the Plornishes he lived at the top of the same house but still at heavy odds However the Bleeding Hearts were kind hearts and when they saw the little fellow cheerily limping about with a good humoured face doing no harm drawing no knives committing no outrageous immoralities living chiefly on farinaceous and milk diet and playing with missus Plornish s children of an evening they began to think that although he could never hope to be an Englishman still it would be hard to visit that affliction on his head They began to accommodate themselves to his level calling him mister Baptist but treating him like a baby and laughing immoderately at his lively gestures and his childish English more because he didn t mind it and laughed too They spoke to him in very loud voices as if he were stone deaf They constructed sentences by way of teaching him the language in its purity such as were addressed by the savages to Captain Cook or by Friday to Robinson Crusoe missus Plornish was particularly ingenious in this art and attained so much celebrity for saying Me ope you leg well soon that it was considered in the Yard but a very short remove indeed from speaking Italian Even missus Plornish herself began to think that she had a natural call towards that language As he became more popular household objects were brought into requisition for his instruction in a copious vocabulary and whenever he appeared in the Yard ladies would fly out at their doors crying mister Baptist tea pot mister Baptist dust pan mister Baptist flour dredger mister Baptist coffee biggin At the same time exhibiting those articles and penetrating him with a sense of the appalling difficulties of the Anglo Saxon tongue It was in this stage of his progress and in about the third week of his occupation that mister Pancks s fancy became attracted by the little man Mounting to his attic attended by missus Plornish as interpreter he found mister Baptist with no furniture but his bed on the ground a table and a chair carving with the aid of a few simple tools in the blithest way possible Now old chap said mister Pancks pay up He had his money ready folded in a scrap of paper and laughingly handed it in then with a free action threw out as many fingers of his right hand as there were shillings and made a cut crosswise in the air for an odd sixpence Oh said mister Pancks watching him wonderingly That s it is it You re a quick customer It s all right I didn t expect to receive it though missus Plornish here interposed with great condescension and explained to mister Baptist E please E glad get money The little man smiled and nodded His bright face seemed uncommonly attractive to mister Pancks How s he getting on in his limb he asked missus Plornish Oh he s a deal better sir said missus Plornish We expect next week he ll be able to leave off his stick entirely The opportunity being too favourable to be lost missus Plornish displayed her great accomplishment by explaining with pardonable pride to mister Baptist E ope you leg well soon He s a merry fellow too said mister Pancks admiring him as if he were a mechanical toy How does he live Why sir rejoined missus Plornish he turns out to have quite a power of carving them flowers that you see him at now mister Baptist watching their faces as they spoke held up his work missus Plornish interpreted in her Italian manner on behalf of mister Pancks E please Double good Can he live by that asked mister Pancks He can live on very little sir and it is expected as he will be able in time to make a very good living mister Clennam got it him to do and gives him odd jobs besides in at the Works next door makes em for him in short when he knows he wants em And what does he do with himself now when he ain t hard at it said mister Pancks Why not much as yet sir on accounts I suppose of not being able to walk much but he goes about the Yard and he chats without particular understanding or being understood and he plays with the children and he sits in the sun he ll sit down anywhere as if it was an arm chair and he ll sing and he ll laugh Laugh echoed mister Pancks He looks to me as if every tooth in his head was always laughing But whenever he gets to the top of the steps at t other end of the Yard said missus Plornish he ll peep out in the curiousest way So that some of us thinks he s peeping out towards where his own country is and some of us thinks he s looking for somebody he don t want to see and some of us don t know what to think mister Baptist seemed to have a general understanding of what she said or perhaps his quickness caught and applied her slight action of peeping In any case he closed his eyes and tossed his head with the air of a man who had sufficient reasons for what he did and said in his own tongue it didn t matter Altro What s Altro said Pancks Hem It s a sort of a general kind of expression sir said missus Plornish Is it said Pancks Why then Altro to you old chap Good afternoon Altro mister Baptist in his vivacious way repeating the word several times mister Pancks in his duller way gave it him back once From that time it became a frequent custom with Pancks the gipsy as he went home jaded at night to pass round by Bleeding Heart Yard go quietly up the stairs look in at mister Baptist s door and finding him in his room to say Hallo old chap Altro To which mister Baptist would reply with innumerable bright nods and smiles Altro signore altro altro altro After this highly condensed conversation mister Pancks would go his way with an appearance of being lightened and refreshed CHAPTER twenty six Nobody s State of Mind If Arthur Clennam had not arrived at that wise decision firmly to restrain himself from loving Pet he would have lived on in a state of much perplexity involving difficult struggles with his own heart Not the least of these would have been a contention always waging within it between a tendency to dislike mister Henry Gowan if not to regard him with positive repugnance and a whisper that the inclination was unworthy A generous nature is not prone to strong aversions and is slow to admit them even dispassionately but when it finds ill will gaining upon it and can discern between whiles that its origin is not dispassionate such a nature becomes distressed Therefore mister Henry Gowan would have clouded Clennam s mind and would have been far oftener present to it than more agreeable persons and subjects but for the great prudence of his decision aforesaid As it was mister Gowan seemed transferred to Daniel Doyce s mind at all events it so happened that it usually fell to mister Doyce s turn rather than to Clennam s to speak of him in the friendly conversations they held together These were of frequent occurrence now as the two partners shared a portion of a roomy house in one of the grave old fashioned City streets lying not far from the Bank of England by London Wall mister Doyce had been to Twickenham to pass the day Clennam had excused himself mister Doyce was just come home He put in his head at the door of Clennam s sitting room to say Good night Come in come in said Clennam I saw you were reading returned Doyce as he entered and thought you might not care to be disturbed But for the notable resolution he had made Clennam really might not have known what he had been reading really might not have had his eyes upon the book for an hour past though it lay open before him He shut it up rather quickly Are they well he asked Yes said Doyce they are well They are all well Daniel had an old workmanlike habit of carrying his pocket handkerchief in his hat He took it out and wiped his forehead with it slowly repeating They are all well Miss Minnie looking particularly well I thought Any company at the cottage No no company And how did you get on you four asked Clennam gaily There were five of us returned his partner There was What s his name He was there Who is he said Clennam mister Henry Gowan Ah to be sure cried Clennam with unusual vivacity Yes I forgot him As I mentioned you may remember said Daniel Doyce he is always there on Sunday Yes yes returned Clennam I remember now Daniel Doyce still wiping his forehead ploddingly repeated Yes He was there he was there Oh yes he was there And his dog He was there too Miss Meagles is quite attached to the dog observed Clennam Quite so assented his partner More attached to the dog than I am to the man You mean mister I mean mister Gowan most decidedly said Daniel Doyce There was a gap in the conversation which Clennam devoted to winding up his watch Perhaps you are a little hasty in your judgment he said Our judgments I am supposing a general case Of course said Doyce Are so liable to be influenced by many considerations which almost without our knowing it are unfair that it is necessary to keep a guard upon them For instance mister Gowan quietly said Doyce upon whom the utterance of the name almost always devolved Is young and handsome easy and quick has talent and has seen a good deal of various kinds of life It might be difficult to give an unselfish reason for being prepossessed against him Not difficult for me I think Clennam returned his partner I see him bringing present anxiety and I fear future sorrow into my old friend s house I see him wearing deeper lines into my old friend s face the nearer he draws to and the oftener he looks at the face of his daughter In short I see him with a net about the pretty and affectionate creature whom he will never make happy We don t know said Clennam almost in the tone of a man in pain that he will not make her happy We don t know returned his partner that the earth will last another hundred years but we think it highly probable Well well said Clennam we must be hopeful and we must at least try to be if not generous which in this case we have no opportunity of being just We will not disparage this gentleman because he is successful in his addresses to the beautiful object of his ambition and we will not question her natural right to bestow her love on one whom she finds worthy of it Maybe my friend said Doyce Maybe also that she is too young and petted too confiding and inexperienced to discriminate well That said Clennam would be far beyond our power of correction Daniel Doyce shook his head gravely and rejoined I fear so Therefore in a word said Clennam we should make up our minds that it is not worthy of us to say any ill of mister Gowan It would be a poor thing to gratify a prejudice against him And I resolve for my part not to depreciate him I am not quite so sure of myself and therefore I reserve my privilege of objecting to him returned the other But if I am not sure of myself I am sure of you Clennam and I know what an upright man you are and how much to be respected Good night MY friend and partner He shook his hand in saying this as if there had been something serious at the bottom of their conversation and they separated By this time they had visited the family on several occasions and had always observed that even a passing allusion to mister Henry Gowan when he was not among them brought back the cloud which had obscured mister Meagles s sunshine on the morning of the chance encounter at the Ferry If Clennam had ever admitted the forbidden passion into his breast this period might have been a period of real trial under the actual circumstances doubtless it was nothing nothing Equally if his heart had given entertainment to that prohibited guest his silent fighting of his way through the mental condition of this period might have been a little meritorious In the constant effort not to be betrayed into a new phase of the besetting sin of his experience the pursuit of selfish objects by low and small means and to hold instead to some high principle of honour and generosity there might have been a little merit In the resolution not even to avoid mister Meagles s house lest in the selfish sparing of himself he should bring any slight distress upon the daughter through making her the cause of an estrangement which he believed the father would regret there might have been a little merit In the modest truthfulness of always keeping in view the greater equality of mister Gowan s years and the greater attractions of his person and manner there might have been a little merit In doing all this and much more in a perfectly unaffected way and with a manful and composed constancy while the pain within him peculiar as his life and history was very sharp there might have been some quiet strength of character But after the resolution he had made of course he could have no such merits as these and such a state of mind was nobody s nobody s mister Gowan made it no concern of his whether it was nobody s or somebody s He preserved his perfect serenity of manner on all occasions as if the possibility of Clennam s presuming to have debated the great question were too distant and ridiculous to be imagined He had always an affability to bestow on Clennam and an ease to treat him with which might of itself in the supposititious case of his not having taken that sagacious course have been a very uncomfortable element in his state of mind I quite regret you were not with us yesterday said mister Henry Gowan calling on Clennam the next morning We had an agreeable day up the river there So he had heard Arthur said From your partner returned Henry Gowan What a dear old fellow he is I have a great regard for him By Jove he is the finest creature said Gowan So fresh so green trusts in such wonderful things Here was one of the many little rough points that had a tendency to grate on Clennam s hearing He put it aside by merely repeating that he had a high regard for mister Doyce He is charming To see him mooning along to that time of life laying down nothing by the way and picking up nothing by the way is delightful It warms a man So unspoilt so simple such a good soul Upon my life mister Clennam one feels desperately worldly and wicked in comparison with such an innocent creature I speak for myself let me add without including you You are genuine also Thank you for the compliment said Clennam ill at ease you are too I hope So so rejoined the other To be candid with you tolerably I am not a great impostor Buy one of my pictures and I assure you in confidence it will not be worth the money Buy one of another man s any great professor who beats me hollow and the chances are that the more you give him the more he ll impose upon you They all do it All painters Painters writers patriots all the rest who have stands in the market Give almost any man I know ten pounds and he will impose upon you to a corresponding extent a thousand pounds to a corresponding extent ten thousand pounds to a corresponding extent So great the success so great the imposition But what a capital world it is cried Gowan with warm enthusiasm What a jolly excellent lovable world it is I had rather thought said Clennam that the principle you mention was chiefly acted on by By the Barnacles interrupted Gowan laughing By the political gentlemen who condescend to keep the Circumlocution Office Ah Don t be hard upon the Barnacles said Gowan laughing afresh they are darling fellows Even poor little Clarence the born idiot of the family is the most agreeable and most endearing blockhead And by Jupiter with a kind of cleverness in him too that would astonish you It would Very much said Clennam drily And after all cried Gowan with that characteristic balancing of his which reduced everything in the wide world to the same light weight though I can t deny that the Circumlocution Office may ultimately shipwreck everybody and everything still that will probably not be in our time and it s a school for gentlemen It s a very dangerous unsatisfactory and expensive school to the people who pay to keep the pupils there I am afraid said Clennam shaking his head Ah You are a terrible fellow returned Gowan airily I can understand how you have frightened that little donkey Clarence the most estimable of moon calves I really love him nearly out of his wits But enough of him and of all the rest of them I want to present you to my mother mister Clennam Pray do me the favour to give me the opportunity In nobody s state of mind there was nothing Clennam would have desired less or would have been more at a loss how to avoid My mother lives in a most primitive manner down in that dreary red brick dungeon at Hampton Court said Gowan If you would make your own appointment suggest your own day for permitting me to take you there to dinner you would be bored and she would be charmed Really that s the state of the case What could Clennam say after this His retiring character included a great deal that was simple in the best sense because unpractised and unused and in his simplicity and modesty he could only say that he was happy to place himself at mister Gowan s disposal Accordingly he said it and the day was fixed And a dreaded day it was on his part and a very unwelcome day when it came and they went down to Hampton Court together The venerable inhabitants of that venerable pile seemed in those times to be encamped there like a sort of civilised gipsies There was a temporary air about their establishments as if they were going away the moment they could get anything better there was also a dissatisfied air about themselves as if they took it very ill that they had not already got something much better Genteel blinds and makeshifts were more or less observable as soon as their doors were opened screens not half high enough which made dining rooms out of arched passages and warded off obscure corners where footboys slept at nights with their heads among the knives and forks curtains which called upon you to believe that they didn t hide anything panes of glass which requested you not to see them many objects of various forms feigning to have no connection with their guilty secret a bed disguised traps in walls which were clearly coal cellars affectations of no thoroughfares which were evidently doors to little kitchens Mental reservations and artful mysteries grew out of these things Callers looking steadily into the eyes of their receivers pretended not to smell cooking three feet off people confronting closets accidentally left open pretended not to see bottles visitors with their heads against a partition of thin canvas and a page and a young female at high words on the other side made believe to be sitting in a primeval silence There was no end to the small social accommodation bills of this nature which the gipsies of gentility were constantly drawing upon and accepting for one another Some of these Bohemians were of an irritable temperament as constantly soured and vexed by two mental trials the first the consciousness that they had never got enough out of the public the second the consciousness that the public were admitted into the building Under the latter great wrong a few suffered dreadfully particularly on Sundays when they had for some time expected the earth to open and swallow the public up but which desirable event had not yet occurred in consequence of some reprehensible laxity in the arrangements of the Universe missus Gowan s door was attended by a family servant of several years standing who had his own crow to pluck with the public concerning a situation in the Post Office which he had been for some time expecting and to which he was not yet appointed He perfectly knew that the public could never have got him in but he grimly gratified himself with the idea that the public kept him out Under the influence of this injury and perhaps of some little straitness and irregularity in the matter of wages he had grown neglectful of his person and morose in mind and now beholding in Clennam one of the degraded body of his oppressors received him with ignominy missus Gowan however received him with condescension He found her a courtly old lady formerly a Beauty and still sufficiently well favoured to have dispensed with the powder on her nose and a certain impossible bloom under each eye She was a little lofty with him so was another old lady dark browed and high nosed and who must have had something real about her or she could not have existed but it was certainly not her hair or her teeth or her figure or her complexion so was a grey old gentleman of dignified and sullen appearance both of whom had come to dinner But as they had all been in the British Embassy way in sundry parts of the earth and as a British Embassy cannot better establish a character with the Circumlocution Office than by treating its compatriots with illimitable contempt else it would become like the Embassies of other countries Clennam felt that on the whole they let him off lightly The dignified old gentleman turned out to be Lord Lancaster Stiltstalking who had been maintained by the Circumlocution Office for many years as a representative of the Britannic Majesty abroad This noble Refrigerator had iced several European courts in his time and had done it with such complete success that the very name of Englishman yet struck cold to the stomachs of foreigners who had the distinguished honour of remembering him at a distance of a quarter of a century He was now in retirement and hence in a ponderous white cravat like a stiff snow drift was so obliging as to shade the dinner There was a whisper of the pervading Bohemian character in the nomadic nature of the service and its curious races of plates and dishes but the noble Refrigerator infinitely better than plate or porcelain made it superb He shaded the dinner cooled the wines chilled the gravy and blighted the vegetables There was only one other person in the room a microscopically small footboy who waited on the malevolent man who hadn t got into the Post Office Even this youth if his jacket could have been unbuttoned and his heart laid bare would have been seen as a distant adherent of the Barnacle family already to aspire to a situation under Government missus Gowan with a gentle melancholy upon her occasioned by her son s being reduced to court the swinish public as a follower of the low Arts instead of asserting his birthright and putting a ring through its nose as an acknowledged Barnacle headed the conversation at dinner on the evil days It was then that Clennam learned for the first time what little pivots this great world goes round upon If John Barnacle said missus Gowan after the degeneracy of the times had been fully ascertained if John Barnacle had but abandoned his most unfortunate idea of conciliating the mob all would have been well and I think the country would have been preserved The old lady with the high nose assented but added that if Augustus Stiltstalking had in a general way ordered the cavalry out with instructions to charge she thought the country would have been preserved The noble Refrigerator assented but added that if William Barnacle and Tudor Stiltstalking when they came over to one another and formed their ever memorable coalition had boldly muzzled the newspapers and rendered it penal for any Editor person to presume to discuss the conduct of any appointed authority abroad or at home he thought the country would have been preserved It was agreed that the country another word for the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings wanted preserving but how it came to want preserving was not so clear It was only clear that the question was all about John Barnacle Augustus Stiltstalking William Barnacle and Tudor Stiltstalking Tom Dick or Harry Barnacle or Stiltstalking because there was nobody else but mob And this was the feature of the conversation which impressed Clennam as a man not used to it very disagreeably making him doubt if it were quite right to sit there silently hearing a great nation narrowed to such little bounds Remembering however that in the Parliamentary debates whether on the life of that nation s body or the life of its soul the question was usually all about and between John Barnacle Augustus Stiltstalking William Barnacle and Tudor Stiltstalking Tom Dick or Harry Barnacle or Stiltstalking and nobody else he said nothing on the part of mob bethinking himself that mob was used to it mister Henry Gowan seemed to have a malicious pleasure in playing off the three talkers against each other and in seeing Clennam startled by what they said Having as supreme a contempt for the class that had thrown him off as for the class that had not taken him on he had no personal disquiet in anything that passed His healthy state of mind appeared even to derive a gratification from Clennam s position of embarrassment and isolation among the good company and if Clennam had been in that condition with which Nobody was incessantly contending he would have suspected it and would have struggled with the suspicion as a meanness even while he sat at the table In the course of a couple of hours the noble Refrigerator at no time less than a hundred years behind the period got about five centuries in arrears and delivered solemn political oracles appropriate to that epoch He finished by freezing a cup of tea for his own drinking and retiring at his lowest temperature Then missus Gowan who had been accustomed in her days of a vacant arm chair beside her to which to summon state to retain her devoted slaves one by one for short audiences as marks of her especial favour invited Clennam with a turn of her fan to approach the presence He obeyed and took the tripod recently vacated by Lord Lancaster Stiltstalking mister Clennam said missus Gowan apart from the happiness I have in becoming known to you though in this odiously inconvenient place a mere barrack there is a subject on which I am dying to speak to you It is the subject in connection with which my son first had I believe the pleasure of cultivating your acquaintance Clennam inclined his head as a generally suitable reply to what he did not yet quite understand First said missus Gowan now is she really pretty In nobody s difficulties he would have found it very difficult to answer very difficult indeed to smile and say Who Oh You know she returned This flame of Henry s This unfortunate fancy There If it is a point of honour that I should originate the name Miss Mickles Miggles Miss Meagles said Clennam is very beautiful Men are so often mistaken on those points returned missus Gowan shaking her head that I candidly confess to you I feel anything but sure of it even now though it is something to have Henry corroborated with so much gravity and emphasis He picked the people up at Rome I think The phrase would have given nobody mortal offence Clennam replied Excuse me I doubt if I understand your expression Picked the people up said missus Gowan tapping the sticks of her closed fan a large green one which she used as a hand screen on her little table Came upon them Found them out Stumbled UP against them The people Yes The Miggles people I really cannot say said Clennam where my friend mister Meagles first presented mister Henry Gowan to his daughter I am pretty sure he picked her up at Rome but never mind where somewhere Now this is entirely between ourselves is she very plebeian Really ma am returned Clennam I am so undoubtedly plebeian myself that I do not feel qualified to judge Very neat said missus Gowan coolly unfurling her screen Very happy From which I infer that you secretly think her manner equal to her looks Clennam after a moment s stiffness bowed That s comforting and I hope you may be right Did Henry tell me you had travelled with them I travelled with my friend mister Meagles and his wife and daughter during some months Nobody s heart might have been wrung by the remembrance Really comforting because you must have had a large experience of them You see mister Clennam this thing has been going on for a long time and I find no improvement in it Therefore to have the opportunity of speaking to one so well informed about it as yourself is an immense relief to me Quite a boon Quite a blessing I am sure Pardon me returned Clennam but I am not in mister Henry Gowan s confidence I am far from being so well informed as you suppose me to be Your mistake makes my position a very delicate one No word on this topic has ever passed between mister Henry Gowan and myself missus Gowan glanced at the other end of the room where her son was playing ecarte on a sofa with the old lady who was for a charge of cavalry Not in his confidence No said missus Gowan No word has passed between you No That I can imagine But there are unexpressed confidences mister Clennam and as you have been together intimately among these people I cannot doubt that a confidence of that sort exists in the present case Perhaps you have heard that I have suffered the keenest distress of mind from Henry s having taken to a pursuit which well shrugging her shoulders a very respectable pursuit I dare say and some artists are as artists quite superior persons still we never yet in our family have gone beyond an Amateur and it is a pardonable weakness to feel a little As missus Gowan broke off to heave a sigh Clennam however resolute to be magnanimous could not keep down the thought that there was mighty little danger of the family s ever going beyond an Amateur even as it was Henry the mother resumed is self willed and resolute and as these people naturally strain every nerve to catch him I can entertain very little hope mister Clennam that the thing will be broken off I apprehend the girl s fortune will be very small Henry might have done much better there is scarcely anything to compensate for the connection still he acts for himself and if I find no improvement within a short time I see no other course than to resign myself and make the best of these people I am infinitely obliged to you for what you have told me As she shrugged her shoulders Clennam stiffly bowed again With an uneasy flush upon his face and hesitation in his manner he then said in a still lower tone than he had adopted yet missus Gowan I scarcely know how to acquit myself of what I feel to be a duty and yet I must ask you for your kind consideration in attempting to discharge it A misconception on your part a very great misconception if I may venture to call it so seems to require setting right You have supposed mister Meagles and his family to strain every nerve I think you said Every nerve repeated missus Gowan looking at him in calm obstinacy with her green fan between her face and the fire To secure mister Henry Gowan The lady placidly assented Now that is so far said Arthur from being the case that I know mister Meagles to be unhappy in this matter and to have interposed all reasonable obstacles with the hope of putting an end to it missus Gowan shut up her great green fan tapped him on the arm with it and tapped her smiling lips Why of course said she Just what I mean Arthur watched her face for some explanation of what she did mean Are you really serious mister Clennam Don t you see Arthur did not see and said so Why don t I know my son and don t I know that this is exactly the way to hold him said missus Gowan contemptuously and do not these Miggles people know it at least as well as I Oh shrewd people mister Clennam evidently people of business I believe Miggles belonged to a Bank It ought to have been a very profitable Bank if he had much to do with its management This is very well done indeed I beg and entreat you ma am Arthur interposed Oh mister Clennam can you really be so credulous It made such a painful impression upon him to hear her talking in this haughty tone and to see her patting her contemptuous lips with her fan that he said very earnestly Believe me ma am this is unjust a perfectly groundless suspicion Suspicion repeated missus Gowan Not suspicion mister Clennam Certainty It is very knowingly done indeed and seems to have taken YOU in completely She laughed and again sat tapping her lips with her fan and tossing her head as if she added Don t tell me I know such people will do anything for the honour of such an alliance At this opportune moment the cards were thrown up and mister Henry Gowan came across the room saying Mother if you can spare mister Clennam for this time we have a long way to go and it s getting late mister Clennam thereupon rose as he had no choice but to do and missus Gowan showed him to the last the same look and the same tapped contemptuous lips You have had a portentously long audience of my mother said Gowan as the door closed upon them I fervently hope she has not bored you Not at all said Clennam They had a little open phaeton for the journey and were soon in it on the road home Gowan driving lighted a cigar Clennam declined one Do what he would he fell into such a mood of abstraction that Gowan said again I am very much afraid my mother has bored you To which he roused himself to answer Not at all and soon relapsed again In that state of mind which rendered nobody uneasy his thoughtfulness would have turned principally on the man at his side He would have thought of the morning when he first saw him rooting out the stones with his heel and would have asked himself Does he jerk me out of the path in the same careless cruel way He would have thought had this introduction to his mother been brought about by him because he knew what she would say and that he could thus place his position before a rival and loftily warn him off without himself reposing a word of confidence in him He would have thought even if there were no such design as that had he brought him there to play with his repressed emotions and torment him The current of these meditations would have been stayed sometimes by a rush of shame bearing a remonstrance to himself from his own open nature representing that to shelter such suspicions even for the passing moment was not to hold the high unenvious course he had resolved to keep At those times the striving within him would have been hardest and looking up and catching Gowan s eyes he would have started as if he had done him an injury Then looking at the dark road and its uncertain objects he would have gradually trailed off again into thinking Where are we driving he and I I wonder on the darker road of life How will it be with us and with her in the obscure distance Thinking of her he would have been troubled anew with a reproachful misgiving that it was not even loyal to her to dislike him and that in being so easily prejudiced against him he was less deserving of her than at first You are evidently out of spirits said Gowan I am very much afraid my mother must have bored you dreadfully Believe me not at all said Clennam It s nothing nothing CHAPTER twenty seven Five and Twenty A frequently recurring doubt whether mister Pancks s desire to collect information relative to the Dorrit family could have any possible bearing on the misgivings he had imparted to his mother on his return from his long exile caused Arthur Clennam much uneasiness at this period What mister Pancks already knew about the Dorrit family what more he really wanted to find out and why he should trouble his busy head about them at all were questions that often perplexed him mister Pancks was not a man to waste his time and trouble in researches prompted by idle curiosity That he had a specific object Clennam could not doubt And whether the attainment of that object by mister Pancks s industry might bring to light in some untimely way secret reasons which had induced his mother to take Little Dorrit by the hand was a serious speculation Not that he ever wavered either in his desire or his determination to repair a wrong that had been done in his father s time should a wrong come to light and be reparable The shadow of a supposed act of injustice which had hung over him since his father s death was so vague and formless that it might be the result of a reality widely remote from his idea of it But if his apprehensions should prove to be well founded he was ready at any moment to lay down all he had and begin the world anew As the fierce dark teaching of his childhood had never sunk into his heart so that first article in his code of morals was that he must begin in practical humility with looking well to his feet on Earth and that he could never mount on wings of words to Heaven Duty on earth restitution on earth action on earth these first as the first steep steps upward Strait was the gate and narrow was the way far straiter and narrower than the broad high road paved with vain professions and vain repetitions motes from other men s eyes and liberal delivery of others to the judgment all cheap materials costing absolutely nothing No It was not a selfish fear or hesitation that rendered him uneasy but a mistrust lest Pancks might not observe his part of the understanding between them and making any discovery might take some course upon it without imparting it to him On the other hand when he recalled his conversation with Pancks and the little reason he had to suppose that there was any likelihood of that strange personage being on that track at all there were times when he wondered that he made so much of it Labouring in this sea as all barks labour in cross seas he tossed about and came to no haven The removal of Little Dorrit herself from their customary association did not mend the matter She was so much out and so much in her own room that he began to miss her and to find a blank in her place He had written to her to inquire if she were better and she had written back very gratefully and earnestly telling him not to be uneasy on her behalf for she was quite well but he had not seen her for what in their intercourse was a long time He returned home one evening from an interview with her father who had mentioned that she was out visiting which was what he always said when she was hard at work to buy his supper and found mister Meagles in an excited state walking up and down his room On his opening the door mister Meagles stopped faced round and said Clennam Tattycoram What s the matter Lost Why bless my heart alive cried Clennam in amazement What do you mean Wouldn t count five and twenty sir couldn t be got to do it stopped at eight and took herself off Left your house Never to come back said mister Meagles shaking his head You don t know that girl s passionate and proud character A team of horses couldn t draw her back now the bolts and bars of the old Bastille couldn t keep her How did it happen Pray sit down and tell me As to how it happened it s not so easy to relate because you must have the unfortunate temperament of the poor impetuous girl herself before you can fully understand it But it came about in this way Pet and Mother and I have been having a good deal of talk together of late I ll not disguise from you Clennam that those conversations have not been of as bright a kind as I could wish they have referred to our going away again In proposing to do which I have had in fact an object Nobody s heart beat quickly An object said mister Meagles after a moment s pause that I will not disguise from you either Clennam There s an inclination on the part of my dear child which I am sorry for Perhaps you guess the person Henry Gowan I was not unprepared to hear it Well said mister Meagles with a heavy sigh I wish to God you had never had to hear it However so it is Mother and I have done all we could to get the better of it Clennam We have tried tender advice we have tried time we have tried absence As yet of no use Our late conversations have been upon the subject of going away for another year at least in order that there might be an entire separation and breaking off for that term Upon that question Pet has been unhappy and therefore Mother and I have been unhappy Clennam said that he could easily believe it Well continued mister Meagles in an apologetic way I admit as a practical man and I am sure Mother would admit as a practical woman that we do in families magnify our troubles and make mountains of our molehills in a way that is calculated to be rather trying to people who look on to mere outsiders you know Clennam Still Pet s happiness or unhappiness is quite a life or death question with us and we may be excused I hope for making much of it At all events it might have been borne by Tattycoram Now don t you think so I do indeed think so returned Clennam in most emphatic recognition of this very moderate expectation No sir said mister Meagles shaking his head ruefully She couldn t stand it The chafing and firing of that girl the wearing and tearing of that girl within her own breast has been such that I have softly said to her again and again in passing her Five and twenty Tattycoram five and twenty I heartily wish she could have gone on counting five and twenty day and night and then it wouldn t have happened mister Meagles with a despondent countenance in which the goodness of his heart was even more expressed than in his times of cheerfulness and gaiety stroked his face down from his forehead to his chin and shook his head again I said to Mother not that it was necessary for she would have thought it all for herself we are practical people my dear and we know her story we see in this unhappy girl some reflection of what was raging in her mother s heart before ever such a creature as this poor thing was in the world we ll gloss her temper over Mother we won t notice it at present my dear we ll take advantage of some better disposition in her another time So we said nothing But do what we would it seems as if it was to be she broke out violently one night How and why If you ask me Why said mister Meagles a little disturbed by the question for he was far more intent on softening her case than the family s I can only refer you to what I have just repeated as having been pretty near my words to Mother As to How we had said Good night to Pet in her presence very affectionately I must allow and she had attended Pet up stairs you remember she was her maid Perhaps Pet having been out of sorts may have been a little more inconsiderate than usual in requiring services of her but I don t know that I have any right to say so she was always thoughtful and gentle The gentlest mistress in the world Thank you Clennam said mister Meagles shaking him by the hand you have often seen them together Well We presently heard this unfortunate Tattycoram loud and angry and before we could ask what was the matter Pet came back in a tremble saying she was frightened of her Close after her came Tattycoram in a flaming rage I hate you all three says she stamping her foot at us I am bursting with hate of the whole house Upon which you I said mister Meagles with a plain good faith that might have commanded the belief of missus Gowan herself I said count five and twenty Tattycoram mister Meagles again stroked his face and shook his head with an air of profound regret She was so used to do it Clennam that even then such a picture of passion as you never saw she stopped short looked me full in the face and counted as I made out to eight But she couldn t control herself to go any further There she broke down poor thing and gave the other seventeen to the four winds Then it all burst out She detested us she was miserable with us she couldn t bear it she wouldn t bear it she was determined to go away She was younger than her young mistress and would she remain to see her always held up as the only creature who was young and interesting and to be cherished and loved No She wouldn t she wouldn t she wouldn t What did we think she Tattycoram might have been if she had been caressed and cared for in her childhood like her young mistress As good as her Ah Perhaps fifty times as good When we pretended to be so fond of one another we exulted over her that was what we did we exulted over her and shamed her And all in the house did the same They talked about their fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters they liked to drag them up before her face There was missus Tickit only yesterday when her little grandchild was with her had been amused by the child s trying to call her Tattycoram by the wretched name we gave her and had laughed at the name Why who didn t and who were we that we should have a right to name her like a dog or a cat But she didn t care She would take no more benefits from us she would fling us her name back again and she would go She would leave us that minute nobody should stop her and we should never hear of her again mister Meagles had recited all this with such a vivid remembrance of his original that he was almost as flushed and hot by this time as he described her to have been Ah well he said wiping his face It was of no use trying reason then with that vehement panting creature Heaven knows what her mother s story must have been so I quietly told her that she should not go at that late hour of night and I gave her MY hand and took her to her room and locked the house doors But she was gone this morning And you know no more of her No more returned mister Meagles I have been hunting about all day She must have gone very early and very silently I have found no trace of her down about us Stay You want said Clennam after a moment s reflection to see her I assume that Yes assuredly I want to give her another chance Mother and Pet want to give her another chance come You yourself said mister Meagles persuasively as if the provocation to be angry were not his own at all want to give the poor passionate girl another chance I know Clennam It would be strange and hard indeed if I did not said Clennam when you are all so forgiving What I was going to ask you was have you thought of that Miss Wade I have I did not think of her until I had pervaded the whole of our neighbourhood and I don t know that I should have done so then but for finding Mother and Pet when I went home full of the idea that Tattycoram must have gone to her Then of course I recalled what she said that day at dinner when you were first with US Have you any idea where Miss Wade is to be found To tell you the truth returned mister Meagles it s because I have an addled jumble of a notion on that subject that you found me waiting here There is one of those odd impressions in my house which do mysteriously get into houses sometimes which nobody seems to have picked up in a distinct form from anybody and yet which everybody seems to have got hold of loosely from somebody and let go again that she lives or was living thereabouts mister Meagles handed him a slip of paper on which was written the name of one of the dull by streets in the Grosvenor region near Park Lane Here is no number said Arthur looking over it No number my dear Clennam returned his friend No anything The very name of the street may have been floating in the air for as I tell you none of my people can say where they got it from However it s worth an inquiry and as I would rather make it in company than alone and as you too were a fellow traveller of that immovable woman s I thought perhaps Clennam finished the sentence for him by taking up his hat again and saying he was ready It was now summer time a grey hot dusty evening They rode to the top of Oxford Street and there alighting dived in among the great streets of melancholy stateliness and the little streets that try to be as stately and succeed in being more melancholy of which there is a labyrinth near Park Lane Wildernesses of corner houses with barbarous old porticoes and appurtenances horrors that came into existence under some wrong headed person in some wrong headed time still demanding the blind admiration of all ensuing generations and determined to do so until they tumbled down frowned upon the twilight Parasite little tenements with the cramp in their whole frame from the dwarf hall door on the giant model of His Grace s in the Square to the squeezed window of the boudoir commanding the dunghills in the Mews made the evening doleful Rickety dwellings of undoubted fashion but of a capacity to hold nothing comfortably except a dismal smell looked like the last result of the great mansions breeding in and in and where their little supplementary bows and balconies were supported on thin iron columns seemed to be scrofulously resting upon crutches Here and there a Hatchment with the whole science of Heraldry in it loomed down upon the street like an Archbishop discoursing on Vanity The shops few in number made no show for popular opinion was as nothing to them The pastrycook knew who was on his books and in that knowledge could be calm with a few glass cylinders of dowager peppermint drops in his window and half a dozen ancient specimens of currant jelly A few oranges formed the greengrocer s whole concession to the vulgar mind A single basket made of moss once containing plovers eggs held all that the poulterer had to say to the rabble Everybody in those streets seemed which is always the case at that hour and season to be gone out to dinner and nobody seemed to be giving the dinners they had gone to On the doorsteps there were lounging footmen with bright parti coloured plumage and white polls like an extinct race of monstrous birds and butlers solitary men of recluse demeanour each of whom appeared distrustful of all other butlers The roll of carriages in the Park was done for the day the street lamps were lighting and wicked little grooms in the tightest fitting garments with twists in their legs answering to the twists in their minds hung about in pairs chewing straws and exchanging fraudulent secrets The spotted dogs who went out with the carriages and who were so associated with splendid equipages that it looked like a condescension in those animals to come out without them accompanied helpers to and fro on messages Here and there was a retiring public house which did not require to be supported on the shoulders of the people and where gentlemen out of livery were not much wanted This last discovery was made by the two friends in pursuing their inquiries Nothing was there or anywhere known of such a person as Miss Wade in connection with the street they sought It was one of the parasite streets long regular narrow dull and gloomy like a brick and mortar funeral They inquired at several little area gates where a dejected youth stood spiking his chin on the summit of a precipitous little shoot of wooden steps but could gain no information They walked up the street on one side of the way and down it on the other what time two vociferous news sellers announcing an extraordinary event that had never happened and never would happen pitched their hoarse voices into the secret chambers but nothing came of it At length they stood at the corner from which they had begun and it had fallen quite dark and they were no wiser It happened that in the street they had several times passed a dingy house apparently empty with bills in the windows announcing that it was to let The bills as a variety in the funeral procession almost amounted to a decoration Perhaps because they kept the house separated in his mind or perhaps because mister Meagles and himself had twice agreed in passing It is clear she don t live there Clennam now proposed that they should go back and try that house before finally going away mister Meagles agreed and back they went They knocked once and they rang once without any response Empty said mister Meagles listening Once more said Clennam and knocked again After that knock they heard a movement below and somebody shuffling up towards the door The confined entrance was so dark that it was impossible to make out distinctly what kind of person opened the door but it appeared to be an old woman Excuse our troubling you said Clennam Pray can you tell us where Miss Wade lives The voice in the darkness unexpectedly replied Lives here Is she at home No answer coming mister Meagles asked again Pray is she at home After another delay I suppose she is said the voice abruptly you had better come in and I ll ask They were summarily shut into the close black house and the figure rustling away and speaking from a higher level said Come up if you please you can t tumble over anything They groped their way up stairs towards a faint light which proved to be the light of the street shining through a window and the figure left them shut in an airless room This is odd Clennam said mister Meagles softly Odd enough assented Clennam in the same tone but we have succeeded that s the main point Here s a light coming The light was a lamp and the bearer was an old woman very dirty very wrinkled and dry She s at home she said and the voice was the same that had spoken before she ll come directly Having set the lamp down on the table the old woman dusted her hands on her apron which she might have done for ever without cleaning them looked at the visitors with a dim pair of eyes and backed out The lady whom they had come to see if she were the present occupant of the house appeared to have taken up her quarters there as she might have established herself in an Eastern caravanserai A small square of carpet in the middle of the room a few articles of furniture that evidently did not belong to the room and a disorder of trunks and travelling articles formed the whole of her surroundings Under some former regular inhabitant the stifling little apartment had broken out into a pier glass and a gilt table but the gilding was as faded as last year s flowers and the glass was so clouded that it seemed to hold in magic preservation all the fogs and bad weather it had ever reflected The visitors had had a minute or two to look about them when the door opened and Miss Wade came in She was exactly the same as when they had parted just as handsome just as scornful just as repressed She manifested no surprise in seeing them nor any other emotion She requested them to be seated and declining to take a seat herself at once anticipated any introduction of their business I apprehend she said that I know the cause of your favouring me with this visit We may come to it at once The cause then ma am said mister Meagles is Tattycoram So I supposed Miss Wade said mister Meagles will you be so kind as to say whether you know anything of her Surely I know she is here with me Then ma am said mister Meagles allow me to make known to you that I shall be happy to have her back and that my wife and daughter will be happy to have her back She has been with us a long time we don t forget her claims upon us and I hope we know how to make allowances You hope to know how to make allowances she returned in a level measured voice For what I think my friend would say Miss Wade Arthur Clennam interposed seeing mister Meagles rather at a loss for the passionate sense that sometimes comes upon the poor girl of being at a disadvantage Which occasionally gets the better of better remembrances The lady broke into a smile as she turned her eyes upon him Indeed was all she answered She stood by the table so perfectly composed and still after this acknowledgment of his remark that mister Meagles stared at her under a sort of fascination and could not even look to Clennam to make another move After waiting awkwardly enough for some moments Arthur said Perhaps it would be well if mister Meagles could see her Miss Wade That is easily done said she Come here child She had opened a door while saying this and now led the girl in by the hand It was very curious to see them standing together the girl with her disengaged fingers plaiting the bosom of her dress half irresolutely half passionately Miss Wade with her composed face attentively regarding her and suggesting to an observer with extraordinary force in her composure itself as a veil will suggest the form it covers the unquenchable passion of her own nature See here she said in the same level way as before Here is your patron your master He is willing to take you back my dear if you are sensible of the favour and choose to go You can be again a foil to his pretty daughter a slave to her pleasant wilfulness and a toy in the house showing the goodness of the family You can have your droll name again playfully pointing you out and setting you apart as it is right that you should be pointed out and set apart Your birth you know you must not forget your birth You can again be shown to this gentleman s daughter Harriet and kept before her as a living reminder of her own superiority and her gracious condescension You can recover all these advantages and many more of the same kind which I dare say start up in your memory while I speak and which you lose in taking refuge with me you can recover them all by telling these gentlemen how humbled and penitent you are and by going back to them to be forgiven What do you say Harriet Will you go The girl who under the influence of these words had gradually risen in anger and heightened in colour answered raising her lustrous black eyes for the moment and clenching her hand upon the folds it had been puckering up I d die sooner Miss Wade still standing at her side holding her hand looked quietly round and said with a smile Gentlemen What do you do upon that Poor mister Meagles s inexpressible consternation in hearing his motives and actions so perverted had prevented him from interposing any word until now but now he regained the power of speech Tattycoram said he for I ll call you by that name still my good girl conscious that I meant nothing but kindness when I gave it to you and conscious that you know it I don t said she looking up again and almost rending herself with the same busy hand No not now perhaps said mister Meagles not with that lady s eyes so intent upon you Tattycoram she glanced at them for a moment and that power over you which we see she exercises not now perhaps but at another time Tattycoram I ll not ask that lady whether she believes what she has said even in the anger and ill blood in which I and my friend here equally know she has spoken though she subdues herself with a determination that any one who has once seen her is not likely to forget I ll not ask you with your remembrance of my house and all belonging to it whether you believe it I ll only say that you have no profession to make to me or mine and no forgiveness to entreat and that all in the world that I ask you to do is to count five and twenty Tattycoram She looked at him for an instant and then said frowningly I won t Miss Wade take me away please The contention that raged within her had no softening in it now it was wholly between passionate defiance and stubborn defiance Her rich colour her quick blood her rapid breath were all setting themselves against the opportunity of retracing their steps I won t I won t I won t she repeated in a low thick voice I d be torn to pieces first I d tear myself to pieces first Miss Wade who had released her hold laid her hand protectingly on the girl s neck for a moment and then said looking round with her former smile and speaking exactly in her former tone Gentlemen What do you do upon that Oh Tattycoram Tattycoram cried mister Meagles adjuring her besides with an earnest hand Hear that lady s voice look at that lady s face consider what is in that lady s heart and think what a future lies before you My child whatever you may think that lady s influence over you astonishing to us and I should hardly go too far in saying terrible to us to see is founded in passion fiercer than yours and temper more violent than yours What can you two be together What can come of it I am alone here gentlemen observed Miss Wade with no change of voice or manner Say anything you will Politeness must yield to this misguided girl ma am said mister Meagles at her present pass though I hope not altogether to dismiss it even with the injury you do her so strongly before me Excuse me for reminding you in her hearing I must say it that you were a mystery to all of us and had nothing in common with any of us when she unfortunately fell in your way I don t know what you are but you don t hide can t hide what a dark spirit you have within you If it should happen that you are a woman who from whatever cause has a perverted delight in making a sister woman as wretched as she is I am old enough to have heard of such I warn her against you and I warn you against yourself Gentlemen said Miss Wade calmly When you have concluded mister Clennam perhaps you will induce your friend Not without another effort said mister Meagles stoutly Tattycoram my poor dear girl count five and twenty Do not reject the hope the certainty this kind man offers you said Clennam in a low emphatic voice Turn to the friends you have not forgotten Think once more I won t Miss Wade said the girl with her bosom swelling high and speaking with her hand held to her throat take me away Tattycoram said mister Meagles Once more yet The only thing I ask of you in the world my child Count five and twenty She put her hands tightly over her ears confusedly tumbling down her bright black hair in the vehemence of the action and turned her face resolutely to the wall Miss Wade who had watched her under this final appeal with that strange attentive smile and that repressing hand upon her own bosom with which she had watched her in her struggle at Marseilles then put her arm about her waist as if she took possession of her for evermore And there was a visible triumph in her face when she turned it to dismiss the visitors As it is the last time I shall have the honour she said and as you have spoken of not knowing what I am and also of the foundation of my influence here you may now know that it is founded in a common cause What your broken plaything is as to birth I am She has no name I have no name Her wrong is my wrong I have nothing more to say to you This was addressed to mister Meagles who sorrowfully went out As Clennam followed she said to him with the same external composure and in the same level voice but with a smile that is only seen on cruel faces a very faint smile lifting the nostril scarcely touching the lips and not breaking away gradually but instantly dismissed when done with I hope the wife of your dear friend mister Gowan may be happy in the contrast of her extraction to this girl s and mine and in the high good fortune that awaits her CHAPTER twenty eight Nobody s Disappearance Not resting satisfied with the endeavours he had made to recover his lost charge mister Meagles addressed a letter of remonstrance breathing nothing but goodwill not only to her but to Miss Wade too No answer coming to these epistles or to another written to the stubborn girl by the hand of her late young mistress which might have melted her if anything could all three letters were returned weeks afterwards as having been refused at the house door he deputed missus Meagles to make the experiment of a personal interview That worthy lady being unable to obtain one and being steadfastly denied admission mister Meagles besought Arthur to essay once more what he could do All that came of his compliance was his discovery that the empty house was left in charge of the old woman that Miss Wade was gone that the waifs and strays of furniture were gone and that the old woman would accept any number of half crowns and thank the donor kindly but had no information whatever to exchange for those coins beyond constantly offering for perusal a memorandum relative to fixtures which the house agent s young man had left in the hall Unwilling even under this discomfiture to resign the ingrate and leave her hopeless in case of her better dispositions obtaining the mastery over the darker side of her character mister Meagles for six successive days published a discreetly covert advertisement in the morning papers to the effect that if a certain young person who had lately left home without reflection would at any time apply to his address at Twickenham everything would be as it had been before and no reproaches need be apprehended The unexpected consequences of this notification suggested to the dismayed mister Meagles for the first time that some hundreds of young persons must be leaving their homes without reflection every day for shoals of wrong young people came down to Twickenham who not finding themselves received with enthusiasm generally demanded compensation by way of damages in addition to coach hire there and back Nor were these the only uninvited clients whom the advertisement produced The swarm of begging letter writers who would seem to be always watching eagerly for any hook however small to hang a letter upon wrote to say that having seen the advertisement they were induced to apply with confidence for various sums ranging from ten shillings to fifty pounds not because they knew anything about the young person but because they felt that to part with those donations would greatly relieve the advertiser s mind Several projectors likewise availed themselves of the same opportunity to correspond with mister Meagles as for example to apprise him that their attention having been called to the advertisement by a friend they begged to state that if they should ever hear anything of the young person they would not fail to make it known to him immediately and that in the meantime if he would oblige them with the funds necessary for bringing to perfection a certain entirely novel description of Pump the happiest results would ensue to mankind mister Meagles and his family under these combined discouragements had begun reluctantly to give up Tattycoram as irrecoverable when the new and active firm of Doyce and Clennam in their private capacities went down on a Saturday to stay at the cottage until Monday The senior partner took the coach and the junior partner took his walking stick A tranquil summer sunset shone upon him as he approached the end of his walk and passed through the meadows by the river side He had that sense of peace and of being lightened of a weight of care which country quiet awakens in the breasts of dwellers in towns Everything within his view was lovely and placid The rich foliage of the trees the luxuriant grass diversified with wild flowers the little green islands in the river the beds of rushes the water lilies floating on the surface of the stream the distant voices in boats borne musically towards him on the ripple of the water and the evening air were all expressive of rest In the occasional leap of a fish or dip of an oar or twittering of a bird not yet at roost or distant barking of a dog or lowing of a cow in all such sounds there was the prevailing breath of rest which seemed to encompass him in every scent that sweetened the fragrant air The long lines of red and gold in the sky and the glorious track of the descending sun were all divinely calm Upon the purple tree tops far away and on the green height near at hand up which the shades were slowly creeping there was an equal hush Between the real landscape and its shadow in the water there was no division both were so untroubled and clear and while so fraught with solemn mystery of life and death so hopefully reassuring to the gazer s soothed heart because so tenderly and mercifully beautiful Clennam had stopped not for the first time by many times to look about him and suffer what he saw to sink into his soul as the shadows looked at seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the water He was slowly resuming his way when he saw a figure in the path before him which he had perhaps already associated with the evening and its impressions Minnie was there alone She had some roses in her hand and seemed to have stood still on seeing him waiting for him Her face was towards him and she appeared to have been coming from the opposite direction There was a flutter in her manner which Clennam had never seen in it before and as he came near her it entered his mind all at once that she was there of a set purpose to speak to him She gave him her hand and said You wonder to see me here by myself But the evening is so lovely I have strolled further than I meant at first I thought it likely I might meet you and that made me more confident You always come this way do you not As Clennam said that it was his favourite way he felt her hand falter on his arm and saw the roses shake Will you let me give you one mister Clennam I gathered them as I came out of the garden Indeed I almost gathered them for you thinking it so likely I might meet you mister Doyce arrived more than an hour ago and told us you were walking down His own hand shook as he accepted a rose or two from hers and thanked her They were now by an avenue of trees Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little He never knew how that was It is very grave here said Clennam but very pleasant at this hour Passing along this deep shade and out at that arch of light at the other end we come upon the ferry and the cottage by the best approach I think In her simple garden hat and her light summer dress with her rich brown hair naturally clustering about her and her wonderful eyes raised to his for a moment with a look in which regard for him and trustfulness in him were strikingly blended with a kind of timid sorrow for him she was so beautiful that it was well for his peace or ill for his peace he did not quite know which that he had made that vigorous resolution he had so often thought about She broke a momentary silence by inquiring if he knew that papa had been thinking of another tour abroad He said he had heard it mentioned She broke another momentary silence by adding with some hesitation that papa had abandoned the idea At this he thought directly they are to be married mister Clennam she said hesitating more timidly yet and speaking so low that he bent his head to hear her I should very much like to give you my confidence if you would not mind having the goodness to receive it I should have very much liked to have given it to you long ago because I felt that you were becoming so much our friend How can I be otherwise than proud of it at any time Pray give it to me Pray trust me I could never have been afraid of trusting you she returned raising her eyes frankly to his face I think I would have done so some time ago if I had known how But I scarcely know how even now mister Gowan said Arthur Clennam has reason to be very happy God bless his wife and him She wept as she tried to thank him He reassured her took her hand as it lay with the trembling roses in it on his arm took the remaining roses from it and put it to his lips At that time it seemed to him he first finally resigned the dying hope that had flickered in nobody s heart so much to its pain and trouble and from that time he became in his own eyes as to any similar hope or prospect a very much older man who had done with that part of life He put the roses in his breast and they walked on for a little while slowly and silently under the umbrageous trees Then he asked her in a voice of cheerful kindness was there anything else that she would say to him as her friend and her father s friend many years older than herself was there any trust she would repose in him any service she would ask of him any little aid to her happiness that she could give him the lasting gratification of believing it was in his power to render She was going to answer when she was so touched by some little hidden sorrow or sympathy what could it have been that she said bursting into tears again O mister Clennam Good generous mister Clennam pray tell me you do not blame me I blame you said Clennam My dearest girl I blame you No After clasping both her hands upon his arm and looking confidentially up into his face with some hurried words to the effect that she thanked him from her heart as she did if it be the source of earnestness she gradually composed herself with now and then a word of encouragement from him as they walked on slowly and almost silently under the darkening trees And now Minnie Gowan at length said Clennam smiling will you ask me nothing Oh I have very much to ask of you That s well I hope so I am not disappointed You know how I am loved at home and how I love home You can hardly think it perhaps dear mister Clennam she spoke with great agitation seeing me going from it of my own free will and choice but I do so dearly love it I am sure of that said Clennam Can you suppose I doubt it No no But it is strange even to me that loving it so much and being so much beloved in it I can bear to cast it away It seems so neglectful of it so unthankful My dear girl said Clennam it is in the natural progress and change of time All homes are left so Yes I know but all homes are not left with such a blank in them as there will be in mine when I am gone Not that there is any scarcity of far better and more endearing and more accomplished girls than I am not that I am much but that they have made so much of me Pet s affectionate heart was overcharged and she sobbed while she pictured what would happen I know what a change papa will feel at first and I know that at first I cannot be to him anything like what I have been these many years And it is then mister Clennam then more than at any time that I beg and entreat you to remember him and sometimes to keep him company when you can spare a little while and to tell him that you know I was fonder of him when I left him than I ever was in all my life For there is nobody he told me so himself when he talked to me this very day there is nobody he likes so well as you or trusts so much A clue to what had passed between the father and daughter dropped like a heavy stone into the well of Clennam s heart and swelled the water to his eyes He said cheerily but not quite so cheerily as he tried to say that it should be done that he gave her his faithful promise If I do not speak of mama said Pet more moved by and more pretty in her innocent grief than Clennam could trust himself even to consider for which reason he counted the trees between them and the fading light as they slowly diminished in number it is because mama will understand me better in this action and will feel my loss in a different way and will look forward in a different manner But you know what a dear devoted mother she is and you will remember her too will you not Let Minnie trust him Clennam said let Minnie trust him to do all she wished And dear mister Clennam said Minnie because papa and one whom I need not name do not fully appreciate and understand one another yet as they will by and by and because it will be the duty and the pride and pleasure of my new life to draw them to a better knowledge of one another and to be a happiness to one another and to be proud of one another and to love one another both loving me so dearly oh as you are a kind true man when I am first separated from home I am going a long distance away try to reconcile papa to him a little more and use your great influence to keep him before papa s mind free from prejudice and in his real form Will you do this for me as you are a noble hearted friend Poor Pet Self deceived mistaken child When were such changes ever made in men s natural relations to one another when was such reconcilement of ingrain differences ever effected It has been tried many times by other daughters Minnie it has never succeeded nothing has ever come of it but failure So Clennam thought So he did not say it was too late He bound himself to do all she asked and she knew full well that he would do it They were now at the last tree in the avenue She stopped and withdrew her arm Speaking to him with her eyes lifted up to his and with the hand that had lately rested on his sleeve trembling by touching one of the roses in his breast as an additional appeal to him she said Dear mister Clennam in my happiness for I am happy though you have seen me crying I cannot bear to leave any cloud between us If you have anything to forgive me not anything that I have wilfully done but any trouble I may have caused you without meaning it or having it in my power to help it forgive me to night out of your noble heart He stooped to meet the guileless face that met his without shrinking He kissed it and answered Heaven knew that he had nothing to forgive As he stooped to meet the innocent face once again she whispered Good bye and he repeated it It was taking leave of all his old hopes all nobody s old restless doubts They came out of the avenue next moment arm in arm as they had entered it and the trees seemed to close up behind them in the darkness like their own perspective of the past The voices of mister and missus Meagles and Doyce were audible directly speaking near the garden gate Hearing Pet s name among them Clennam called out She is here with me There was some little wondering and laughing until they came up but as soon as they had all come together it ceased and Pet glided away mister Meagles Doyce and Clennam without speaking walked up and down on the brink of the river in the light of the rising moon for a few minutes and then Doyce lingered behind and went into the house mister Meagles and Clennam walked up and down together for a few minutes more without speaking until at length the former broke silence Arthur said he using that familiar address for the first time in their communication do you remember my telling you as we walked up and down one hot morning looking over the harbour at Marseilles that Pet s baby sister who was dead seemed to Mother and me to have grown as she had grown and changed as she had changed Very well You remember my saying that our thoughts had never been able to separate those twin sisters and that in our fancy whatever Pet was the other was Yes very well Arthur said mister Meagles much subdued I carry that fancy further to night I feel to night my dear fellow as if you had loved my dead child very tenderly and had lost her when she was like what Pet is now Thank you murmured Clennam thank you And pressed his hand Will you come in said mister Meagles presently In a little while mister Meagles fell away and he was left alone When he had walked on the river s brink in the peaceful moonlight for some half an hour he put his hand in his breast and tenderly took out the handful of roses Perhaps he put them to his heart perhaps he put them to his lips but certainly he bent down on the shore and gently launched them on the flowing river Pale and unreal in the moonlight the river floated them away The lights were bright within doors when he entered and the faces on which they shone his own face not excepted were soon quietly cheerful They talked of many subjects his partner never had had such a ready store to draw upon for the beguiling of the time and so to bed and to sleep While the flowers pale and unreal in the moonlight floated away upon the river and thus do greater things that once were in our breasts and near our hearts flow from us to the eternal seas CHAPTER twenty nine missus Flintwinch goes on Dreaming The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life Morning noon and night morning noon and night each recurring with its accompanying monotony always the same reluctant return of the same sequences of machinery like a dragging piece of clockwork The wheeled chair had its associated remembrances and reveries one may suppose as every place that is made the station of a human being has Pictures of demolished streets and altered houses as they formerly were when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them images of people as they too used to be with little or no allowance made for the lapse of time since they were seen of these there must have been many in the long routine of gloomy days To stop the clock of busy existence at the hour when we were personally sequestered from it to suppose mankind stricken motionless when we were brought to a stand still to be unable to measure the changes beyond our view by any larger standard than the shrunken one of our own uniform and contracted existence is the infirmity of many invalids and the mental unhealthiness of almost all recluses What scenes and actors the stern woman most reviewed as she sat from season to season in her one dark room none knew but herself mister Flintwinch with his wry presence brought to bear upon her daily like some eccentric mechanical force would perhaps have screwed it out of her if there had been less resistance in her but she was too strong for him So far as Mistress Affery was concerned to regard her liege lord and her disabled mistress with a face of blank wonder to go about the house after dark with her apron over her head always to listen for the strange noises and sometimes to hear them and never to emerge from her ghostly dreamy sleep waking state was occupation enough for her There was a fair stroke of business doing as Mistress Affery made out for her husband had abundant occupation in his little office and saw more people than had been used to come there for some years This might easily be the house having been long deserted but he did receive letters and comers and keep books and correspond Moreover he went about to other counting houses and to wharves and docks and to the Custom House and to Garraway s Coffee House and the Jerusalem Coffee House and on Change so that he was much in and out He began too sometimes of an evening when missus Clennam expressed no particular wish for his society to resort to a tavern in the neighbourhood to look at the shipping news and closing prices in the evening paper and even to exchange Small socialities with mercantile Sea Captains who frequented that establishment At some period of every day he and missus Clennam held a council on matters of business and it appeared to Affery who was always groping about listening and watching that the two clever ones were making money The state of mind into which mister Flintwinch s dazed lady had fallen had now begun to be so expressed in all her looks and actions that she was held in very low account by the two clever ones as a person never of strong intellect who was becoming foolish Perhaps because her appearance was not of a commercial cast or perhaps because it occurred to him that his having taken her to wife might expose his judgment to doubt in the minds of customers mister Flintwinch laid his commands upon her that she should hold her peace on the subject of her conjugal relations and should no longer call him Jeremiah out of the domestic trio Her frequent forgetfulness of this admonition intensified her startled manner since mister Flintwinch s habit of avenging himself on her remissness by making springs after her on the staircase and shaking her occasioned her to be always nervously uncertain when she might be thus waylaid next Little Dorrit had finished a long day s work in missus Clennam s room and was neatly gathering up her shreds and odds and ends before going home mister Pancks whom Affery had just shown in was addressing an inquiry to missus Clennam on the subject of her health coupled with the remark that happening to find himself in that direction he had looked in to inquire on behalf of his proprietor how she found herself missus Clennam with a deep contraction of her brows was looking at him mister Casby knows said she that I am not subject to changes The change that I await here is the great change Indeed ma am returned mister Pancks with a wandering eye towards the figure of the little seamstress on her knee picking threads and fraying of her work from the carpet You look nicely ma am I bear what I have to bear she answered Do you what you have to do Thank you ma am said mister Pancks such is my endeavour You are often in this direction are you not asked missus Clennam Why yes ma am said Pancks rather so lately I have lately been round this way a good deal owing to one thing and another Beg mister Casby and his daughter not to trouble themselves by deputy about me When they wish to see me they know I am here to see them They have no need to trouble themselves to send You have no need to trouble yourself to come Not the least trouble ma am said mister Pancks You really are looking uncommonly nicely ma am Thank you Good evening The dismissal and its accompanying finger pointed straight at the door was so curt and direct that mister Pancks did not see his way to prolong his visit He stirred up his hair with his sprightliest expression glanced at the little figure again said Good evening ma am don t come down missus Affery I know the road to the door and steamed out missus Clennam her chin resting on her hand followed him with attentive and darkly distrustful eyes and Affery stood looking at her as if she were spell bound Slowly and thoughtfully missus Clennam s eyes turned from the door by which Pancks had gone out to Little Dorrit rising from the carpet With her chin drooping more heavily on her hand and her eyes vigilant and lowering the sick woman sat looking at her until she attracted her attention Little Dorrit coloured under such a gaze and looked down missus Clennam still sat intent Little Dorrit she said when she at last broke silence what do you know of that man I don t know anything of him ma am except that I have seen him about and that he has spoken to me What has he said to you I don t understand what he has said he is so strange But nothing rough or disagreeable Why does he come here to see you I don t know ma am said Little Dorrit with perfect frankness You know that he does come here to see you I have fancied so said Little Dorrit But why he should come here or anywhere for that ma am I can t think missus Clennam cast her eyes towards the ground and with her strong set face as intent upon a subject in her mind as it had lately been upon the form that seemed to pass out of her view sat absorbed Some minutes elapsed before she came out of this thoughtfulness and resumed her hard composure Little Dorrit in the meanwhile had been waiting to go but afraid to disturb her by moving She now ventured to leave the spot where she had been standing since she had risen and to pass gently round by the wheeled chair She stopped at its side to say Good night ma am missus Clennam put out her hand and laid it on her arm Little Dorrit confused under the touch stood faltering Perhaps some momentary recollection of the story of the Princess may have been in her mind Tell me Little Dorrit said missus Clennam have you many friends now Very few ma am Besides you only Miss Flora and one more Meaning said missus Clennam with her unbent finger again pointing to the door that man Oh no ma am Some friend of his perhaps No ma am Little Dorrit earnestly shook her head Oh no No one at all like him or belonging to him Well said missus Clennam almost smiling It is no affair of mine I ask because I take an interest in you and because I believe I was your friend when you had no other who could serve you Is that so Yes ma am indeed it is I have been here many a time when but for you and the work you gave me we should have wanted everything We repeated missus Clennam looking towards the watch once her dead husband s which always lay upon her table Are there many of you Only father and I now I mean only father and I to keep regularly out of what we get Have you undergone many privations You and your father and who else there may be of you asked missus Clennam speaking deliberately and meditatively turning the watch over and over Sometimes it has been rather hard to live said Little Dorrit in her soft voice and timid uncomplaining way but I think not harder as to that than many people find it That s well said missus Clennam quickly returned That s the truth You are a good thoughtful girl You are a grateful girl too or I much mistake you It is only natural to be that There is no merit in being that said Little Dorrit I am indeed missus Clennam with a gentleness of which the dreaming Affery had never dreamed her to be capable drew down the face of her little seamstress and kissed her on the forehead Now go Little Dorrit said she or you will be late poor child In all the dreams Mistress Affery had been piling up since she first became devoted to the pursuit she had dreamed nothing more astonishing than this Her head ached with the idea that she would find the other clever one kissing Little Dorrit next and then the two clever ones embracing each other and dissolving into tears of tenderness for all mankind The idea quite stunned her as she attended the light footsteps down the stairs that the house door might be safely shut On opening it to let Little Dorrit out she found mister Pancks instead of having gone his way as in any less wonderful place and among less wonderful phenomena he might have been reasonably expected to do fluttering up and down the court outside the house The moment he saw Little Dorrit he passed her briskly said with his finger to his nose as missus Affery distinctly heard Pancks the gipsy fortune telling and went away Lord save us here s a gipsy and a fortune teller in it now cried Mistress Affery What next She stood at the open door staggering herself with this enigma on a rainy thundery evening The clouds were flying fast and the wind was coming up in gusts banging some neighbouring shutters that had broken loose twirling the rusty chimney cowls and weather cocks and rushing round and round a confined adjacent churchyard as if it had a mind to blow the dead citizens out of their graves The low thunder muttering in all quarters of the sky at once seemed to threaten vengeance for this attempted desecration and to mutter Let them rest Let them rest Mistress Affery whose fear of thunder and lightning was only to be equalled by her dread of the haunted house with a premature and preternatural darkness in it stood undecided whether to go in or not until the question was settled for her by the door blowing upon her in a violent gust of wind and shutting her out What s to be done now what s to be done now cried Mistress Affery wringing her hands in this last uneasy dream of all when she s all alone by herself inside and can no more come down to open it than the churchyard dead themselves In this dilemma Mistress Affery with her apron as a hood to keep the rain off ran crying up and down the solitary paved enclosure several times Why she should then stoop down and look in at the keyhole of the door as if an eye would open it it would be difficult to say but it is none the less what most people would have done in the same situation and it is what she did From this posture she started up suddenly with a half scream feeling something on her shoulder It was the touch of a hand of a man s hand The man was dressed like a traveller in a foraging cap with fur about it and a heap of cloak He looked like a foreigner He had a quantity of hair and moustache jet black except at the shaggy ends where it had a tinge of red and a high hook nose He laughed at Mistress Affery s start and cry and as he laughed his moustache went up under his nose and his nose came down over his moustache What s the matter he asked in plain English What are you frightened at At you panted Affery Me madam And the dismal evening and and everything said Affery And here The wind has been and blown the door to and I can t get in Hah said the gentleman who took that very coolly Indeed Do you know such a name as Clennam about here Lord bless us I should think I did I should think I did cried Affery exasperated into a new wringing of hands by the inquiry Where about here Where cried Affery goaded into another inspection of the keyhole Where but here in this house And she s all alone in her room and lost the use of her limbs and can t stir to help herself or me and t other clever one s out and Lord forgive me cried Affery driven into a frantic dance by these accumulated considerations if I ain t a going headlong out of my mind Taking a warmer view of the matter now that it concerned himself the gentleman stepped back to glance at the house and his eye soon rested on the long narrow window of the little room near the hall door Where may the lady be who has lost the use of her limbs madam he inquired with that peculiar smile which Mistress Affery could not choose but keep her eyes upon Up there said Affery Them two windows Hah I am of a fair size but could not have the honour of presenting myself in that room without a ladder Now madam frankly frankness is a part of my character shall I open the door for you Yes bless you sir for a dear creetur and do it at once cried Affery for she may be a calling to me at this very present minute or may be setting herself a fire and burning herself to death or there s no knowing what may be happening to her and me a going out of my mind at thinking of it Stay my good madam He restrained her impatience with a smooth white hand Business hours I apprehend are over for the day Yes yes yes cried Affery Long ago Let me make then a fair proposal Fairness is a part of my character I am just landed from the packet boat as you may see He showed her that his cloak was very wet and that his boots were saturated with water she had previously observed that he was dishevelled and sallow as if from a rough voyage and so chilled that he could not keep his teeth from chattering I am just landed from the packet boat madam and have been delayed by the weather the infernal weather In consequence of this madam some necessary business that I should otherwise have transacted here within the regular hours necessary business because money business still remains to be done Now if you will fetch any authorised neighbouring somebody to do it in return for my opening the door I ll open the door If this arrangement should be objectionable I ll and with the same smile he made a significant feint of backing away Mistress Affery heartily glad to effect the proposed compromise gave in her willing adhesion to it The gentleman at once requested her to do him the favour of holding his cloak took a short run at the narrow window made a leap at the sill clung his way up the bricks and in a moment had his hand at the sash raising it His eyes looked so very sinister as he put his leg into the room and glanced round at Mistress Affery that she thought with a sudden coldness if he were to go straight up stairs to murder the invalid what could she do to prevent him Happily he had no such purpose for he reappeared in a moment at the house door Now my dear madam he said as he took back his cloak and threw it on if you have the goodness to what the Devil s that The strangest of sounds Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock it communicated to the air yet subdued as if it were far off A tremble a rumble and a fall of some light dry matter What the Devil is it I don t know what it is but I ve heard the like of it over and over again said Affery who had caught his arm He could hardly be a very brave man even she thought in her dreamy start and fright for his trembling lips had turned colourless After listening a few moments he made light of it Bah Nothing Now my dear madam I think you spoke of some clever personage Will you be so good as to confront me with that genius He held the door in his hand as though he were quite ready to shut her out again if she failed Don t you say anything about the door and me then whispered Affery Not a word And don t you stir from here or speak if she calls while I run round the corner Madam I am a statue Affery had so vivid a fear of his going stealthily up stairs the moment her back was turned that after hurrying out of sight she returned to the gateway to peep at him Seeing him still on the threshold more out of the house than in it as if he had no love for darkness and no desire to probe its mysteries she flew into the next street and sent a message into the tavern to mister Flintwinch who came out directly The two returning together the lady in advance and mister Flintwinch coming up briskly behind animated with the hope of shaking her before she could get housed saw the gentleman standing in the same place in the dark and heard the strong voice of missus Clennam calling from her room Who is it What is it Why does no one answer Who is that down there CHAPTER thirty The Word of a Gentleman When mister and missus Flintwinch panted up to the door of the old house in the twilight Jeremiah within a second of Affery the stranger started back Death of my soul he exclaimed Why how did you get here mister Flintwinch to whom these words were spoken repaid the stranger s wonder in full He gazed at him with blank astonishment he looked over his own shoulder as expecting to see some one he had not been aware of standing behind him he gazed at the stranger again speechlessly at a loss to know what he meant he looked to his wife for explanation receiving none he pounced upon her and shook her with such heartiness that he shook her cap off her head saying between his teeth with grim raillery as he did it Affery my woman you must have a dose my woman This is some of your tricks You have been dreaming again mistress What s it about Who is it What does it mean Speak out or be choked It s the only choice I ll give you Supposing Mistress Affery to have any power of election at the moment her choice was decidedly to be choked for she answered not a syllable to this adjuration but with her bare head wagging violently backwards and forwards resigned herself to her punishment The stranger however picking up her cap with an air of gallantry interposed Permit me said he laying his hand on the shoulder of Jeremiah who stopped and released his victim Thank you Excuse me Husband and wife I know from this playfulness Haha Always agreeable to see that relation playfully maintained Listen May I suggest that somebody up stairs in the dark is becoming energetically curious to know what is going on here This reference to missus Clennam s voice reminded mister Flintwinch to step into the hall and call up the staircase It s all right I am here Affery is coming with your light Then he said to the latter flustered woman who was putting her cap on Get out with you and get up stairs and then turned to the stranger and said to him Now sir what might you please to want I am afraid said the stranger I must be so troublesome as to propose a candle True assented Jeremiah I was going to do so Please to stand where you are while I get one The visitor was standing in the doorway but turned a little into the gloom of the house as mister Flintwinch turned and pursued him with his eyes into the little room where he groped about for a phosphorus box When he found it it was damp or otherwise out of order and match after match that he struck into it lighted sufficiently to throw a dull glare about his groping face and to sprinkle his hands with pale little spots of fire but not sufficiently to light the candle The stranger taking advantage of this fitful illumination of his visage looked intently and wonderingly at him Jeremiah when he at last lighted the candle knew he had been doing this by seeing the last shade of a lowering watchfulness clear away from his face as it broke into the doubtful smile that was a large ingredient in its expression Be so good said Jeremiah closing the house door and taking a pretty sharp survey of the smiling visitor in his turn as to step into my counting house It s all right I tell you petulantly breaking off to answer the voice up stairs still unsatisfied though Affery was there speaking in persuasive tones Don t I tell you it s all right Preserve the woman has she no reason at all in her Timorous remarked the stranger Timorous said mister Flintwinch turning his head to retort as he went before with the candle More courageous than ninety men in a hundred sir let me tell you Though an invalid Many years an invalid missus Clennam The only one of that name left in the House now My partner Saying something apologetically as he crossed the hall to the effect that at that time of night they were not in the habit of receiving any one and were always shut up mister Flintwinch led the way into his own office which presented a sufficiently business like appearance Here he put the light on his desk and said to the stranger with his wryest twist upon him Your commands MY name is Blandois Blandois I don t know it said Jeremiah I thought it possible resumed the other that you might have been advised from Paris We have had no advice from Paris respecting anybody of the name of Blandois said Jeremiah No No Jeremiah stood in his favourite attitude The smiling mister Blandois opening his cloak to get his hand to a breast pocket paused to say with a laugh in his glittering eyes which it occurred to mister Flintwinch were too near together You are so like a friend of mine Not so identically the same as I supposed when I really did for the moment take you to be the same in the dusk for which I ought to apologise permit me to do so a readiness to confess my errors is I hope a part of the frankness of my character still however uncommonly like Indeed said Jeremiah perversely But I have not received any letter of advice from anywhere respecting anybody of the name of Blandois Just so said the stranger JUST so said Jeremiah mister Blandois not at all put out by this omission on the part of the correspondents of the house of Clennam and company took his pocket book from his breast pocket selected a letter from that receptacle and handed it to mister Flintwinch No doubt you are well acquainted with the writing Perhaps the letter speaks for itself and requires no advice You are a far more competent judge of such affairs than I am It is my misfortune to be not so much a man of business as what the world calls arbitrarily a gentleman mister Flintwinch took the letter and read under date of Paris We have to present to you on behalf of a highly esteemed correspondent of our Firm M Blandois of this city c c Such facilities as he may require and such attentions as may lie in your power c c Also have to add that if you will honour M Blandois drafts at sight to the extent of say Fifty Pounds sterling fifty c c Very good sir said mister Flintwinch Take a chair To the extent of anything that our House can do we are in a retired old fashioned steady way of business sir we shall be happy to render you our best assistance I observe from the date of this that we could not yet be advised of it Probably you came over with the delayed mail that brings the advice That I came over with the delayed mail sir returned mister Blandois passing his white hand down his high hooked nose I know to the cost of my head and stomach the detestable and intolerable weather having racked them both You see me in the plight in which I came out of the packet within this half hour I ought to have been here hours ago and then I should not have to apologise permit me to apologise for presenting myself so unreasonably and frightening no by the bye you said not frightening permit me to apologise again the esteemed lady missus Clennam in her invalid chamber above stairs Swagger and an air of authorised condescension do so much that mister Flintwinch had already begun to think this a highly gentlemanly personage Not the less unyielding with him on that account he scraped his chin and said what could he have the honour of doing for mister Blandois to night out of business hours Faith returned that gentleman shrugging his cloaked shoulders I must change and eat and drink and be lodged somewhere Have the kindness to advise me a total stranger where and money is a matter of perfect indifference until to morrow The nearer the place the better Next door if that s all mister Flintwinch was slowly beginning For a gentleman of your habits there is not in this immediate neighbourhood any hotel when mister Blandois took him up So much for my habits my dear sir snapping his fingers A citizen of the world has no habits That I am in my poor way a gentleman by Heaven I will not deny but I have no unaccommodating prejudiced habits A clean room a hot dish for dinner and a bottle of not absolutely poisonous wine are all I want tonight But I want that much without the trouble of going one unnecessary inch to get it There is said mister Flintwinch with more than his usual deliberation as he met for a moment mister Blandois shining eyes which were restless there is a coffee house and tavern close here which so far I can recommend but there s no style about it I dispense with style said mister Blandois waving his hand Do me the honour to show me the house and introduce me there if I am not too troublesome and I shall be infinitely obliged mister Flintwinch upon this looked up his hat and lighted mister Blandois across the hall again As he put the candle on a bracket where the dark old panelling almost served as an extinguisher for it he bethought himself of going up to tell the invalid that he would not be absent five minutes Oblige me said the visitor on his saying so by presenting my card of visit Do me the favour to add that I shall be happy to wait on missus Clennam to offer my personal compliments and to apologise for having occasioned any agitation in this tranquil corner if it should suit her convenience to endure the presence of a stranger for a few minutes after he shall have changed his wet clothes and fortified himself with something to eat and drink Jeremiah made all despatch and said on his return She ll be glad to see you sir but being conscious that her sick room has no attractions wishes me to say that she won t hold you to your offer in case you should think better of it To think better of it returned the gallant Blandois would be to slight a lady to slight a lady would be to be deficient in chivalry towards the sex and chivalry towards the sex is a part of my character Thus expressing himself he threw the draggled skirt of his cloak over his shoulder and accompanied mister Flintwinch to the tavern taking up on the road a porter who was waiting with his portmanteau on the outer side of the gateway The house was kept in a homely manner and the condescension of mister Blandois was infinite It seemed to fill to inconvenience the little bar in which the widow landlady and her two daughters received him it was much too big for the narrow wainscoted room with a bagatelle board in it that was first proposed for his reception it perfectly swamped the little private holiday sitting room of the family which was finally given up to him Here in dry clothes and scented linen with sleeked hair a great ring on each forefinger and a massive show of watch chain mister Blandois waiting for his dinner lolling on a window seat with his knees drawn up looked for all the difference in the setting of the jewel fearfully and wonderfully like a certain Monsieur Rigaud who had once so waited for his breakfast lying on the stone ledge of the iron grating of a cell in a villainous dungeon at Marseilles His greed at dinner too was closely in keeping with the greed of Monsieur Rigaud at breakfast His avaricious manner of collecting all the eatables about him and devouring some with his eyes while devouring others with his jaws was the same manner His utter disregard of other people as shown in his way of tossing the little womanly toys of furniture about flinging favourite cushions under his boots for a softer rest and crushing delicate coverings with his big body and his great black head had the same brute selfishness at the bottom of it The softly moving hands that were so busy among the dishes had the old wicked facility of the hands that had clung to the bars And when he could eat no more and sat sucking his delicate fingers one by one and wiping them on a cloth there wanted nothing but the substitution of vine leaves to finish the picture On this man with his moustache going up and his nose coming down in that most evil of smiles and with his surface eyes looking as if they belonged to his dyed hair and had had their natural power of reflecting light stopped by some similar process Nature always true and never working in vain had set the mark Beware It was not her fault if the warning were fruitless She is never to blame in any such instance mister Blandois having finished his repast and cleaned his fingers took a cigar from his pocket and lying on the window seat again smoked it out at his leisure occasionally apostrophising the smoke as it parted from his thin lips in a thin stream Blandois you shall turn the tables on society my little child Haha Holy blue you have begun well Blandois At a pinch an excellent master in English or French a man for the bosom of families You have a quick perception you have humour you have ease you have insinuating manners you have a good appearance in effect you are a gentleman A gentleman you shall live my small boy and a gentleman you shall die You shall win however the game goes They shall all confess your merit Blandois You shall subdue the society which has grievously wronged you to your own high spirit Death of my soul You are high spirited by right and by nature my Blandois To such soothing murmurs did this gentleman smoke out his cigar and drink out his bottle of wine Both being finished he shook himself into a sitting attitude and with the concluding serious apostrophe Hold then Blandois you ingenious one have all your wits about you arose and went back to the house of Clennam and company He was received at the door by Mistress Affery who under instructions from her lord had lighted up two candles in the hall and a third on the staircase and who conducted him to missus Clennam s room Tea was prepared there and such little company arrangements had been made as usually attended the reception of expected visitors They were slight on the greatest occasion never extending beyond the production of the China tea service and the covering of the bed with a sober and sad drapery For the rest there was the bier like sofa with the block upon it and the figure in the widow s dress as if attired for execution the fire topped by the mound of damped ashes the grate with its second little mound of ashes the kettle and the smell of black dye all as they had been for fifteen years mister Flintwinch presented the gentleman commended to the consideration of Clennam and company missus Clennam who had the letter lying before her bent her head and requested him to sit They looked very closely at one another That was but natural curiosity I thank you sir for thinking of a disabled woman like me Few who come here on business have any remembrance to bestow on one so removed from observation It would be idle to expect that they should have Out of sight out of mind While I am grateful for the exception I don t complain of the rule mister Blandois in his most gentlemanly manner was afraid he had disturbed her by unhappily presenting himself at such an unconscionable time For which he had already offered his best apologies to mister he begged pardon but by name had not the distinguished honour mister Flintwinch has been connected with the House many years mister Blandois was mister Flintwinch s most obedient humble servant He entreated mister Flintwinch to receive the assurance of his profoundest consideration My husband being dead said missus Clennam and my son preferring another pursuit our old House has no other representative in these days than mister Flintwinch What do you call yourself was the surly demand of that gentleman You have the head of two men My sex disqualifies me she proceeded with merely a slight turn of her eyes in Jeremiah s direction from taking a responsible part in the business even if I had the ability and therefore mister Flintwinch combines my interest with his own and conducts it It is not what it used to be but some of our old friends principally the writers of this letter have the kindness not to forget us and we retain the power of doing what they entrust to us as efficiently as we ever did This however is not interesting to you You are English sir Faith madam no I am neither born nor bred in England In effect I am of no country said mister Blandois stretching out his leg and smiting it I descend from half a dozen countries You have been much about the world It is true By Heaven madam I have been here and there and everywhere You have no ties probably Are not married Madam said mister Blandois with an ugly fall of his eyebrows I adore your sex but I am not married never was Mistress Affery who stood at the table near him pouring out the tea happened in her dreamy state to look at him as he said these words and to fancy that she caught an expression in his eyes which attracted her own eyes so that she could not get them away The effect of this fancy was to keep her staring at him with the tea pot in her hand not only to her own great uneasiness but manifestly to his too and through them both to missus Clennam s and mister Flintwinch s Thus a few ghostly moments supervened when they were all confusedly staring without knowing why Affery her mistress was the first to say what is the matter with you I don t know said Mistress Affery with her disengaged left hand extended towards the visitor It ain t me It s him What does this good woman mean cried mister Blandois turning white hot and slowly rising with a look of such deadly wrath that it contrasted surprisingly with the slight force of his words How is it possible to understand this good creature It s NOT possible said mister Flintwinch screwing himself rapidly in that direction She don t know what she means She s an idiot a wanderer in her mind She shall have a dose she shall have such a dose Get along with you my woman he added in her ear get along with you while you know you re Affery and before you re shaken to yeast Mistress Affery sensible of the danger in which her identity stood relinquished the tea pot as her husband seized it put her apron over her head and in a twinkling vanished The visitor gradually broke into a smile and sat down again You ll excuse her mister Blandois said Jeremiah pouring out the tea himself she s failing and breaking up that s what she s about Do you take sugar sir Thank you no tea for me Pardon my observing it but that s a very remarkable watch The tea table was drawn up near the sofa with a small interval between it and missus Clennam s own particular table mister Blandois in his gallantry had risen to hand that lady her tea her dish of toast was already there and it was in placing the cup conveniently within her reach that the watch lying before her as it always did attracted his attention missus Clennam looked suddenly up at him May I be permitted Thank you A fine old fashioned watch he said taking it in his hand Heavy for use but massive and genuine I have a partiality for everything genuine Such as I am I am genuine myself Hah A gentleman s watch with two cases in the old fashion May I remove it from the outer case Thank you Aye An old silk watch lining worked with beads I have often seen these among old Dutch people and Belgians Quaint things They are old fashioned too said missus Clennam Very But this is not so old as the watch I think I think not Extraordinary how they used to complicate these cyphers remarked mister Blandois glancing up with his own smile again Now is this D N F It might be almost anything Those are the letters mister Flintwinch who had been observantly pausing all this time with a cup of tea in his hand and his mouth open ready to swallow the contents began to do so always entirely filling his mouth before he emptied it at a gulp and always deliberating again before he refilled it D N F was some tender lovely fascinating fair creature I make no doubt observed mister Blandois as he snapped on the case again I adore her memory on the assumption Unfortunately for my peace of mind I adore but too readily It may be a vice it may be a virtue but adoration of female beauty and merit constitutes three parts of my character madam mister Flintwinch had by this time poured himself out another cup of tea which he was swallowing in gulps as before with his eyes directed to the invalid You may be heart free here sir she returned to mister Blandois Those letters are not intended I believe for the initials of any name Of a motto perhaps said mister Blandois casually Of a sentence They have always stood I believe for Do Not Forget And naturally said mister Blandois replacing the watch and stepping backward to his former chair you do not forget mister Flintwinch finishing his tea not only took a longer gulp than he had taken yet but made his succeeding pause under new circumstances that is to say with his head thrown back and his cup held still at his lips while his eyes were still directed at the invalid She had that force of face and that concentrated air of collecting her firmness or obstinacy which represented in her case what would have been gesture and action in another as she replied with her deliberate strength of speech No sir I do not forget To lead a life as monotonous as mine has been during many years is not the way to forget To lead a life of self correction is not the way to forget To be sensible of having as we all have every one of us all the children of Adam offences to expiate and peace to make does not justify the desire to forget Therefore I have long dismissed it and I neither forget nor wish to forget mister Flintwinch who had latterly been shaking the sediment at the bottom of his tea cup round and round here gulped it down and putting the cup in the tea tray as done with turned his eyes upon mister Blandois as if to ask him what he thought of that All expressed madam said mister Blandois with his smoothest bow and his white hand on his breast by the word naturally which I am proud to have had sufficient apprehension and appreciation but without appreciation I could not be Blandois to employ Pardon me sir she returned if I doubt the likelihood of a gentleman of pleasure and change and politeness accustomed to court and to be courted Oh madam By Heaven If I doubt the likelihood of such a character quite comprehending what belongs to mine in my circumstances Not to obtrude doctrine upon you she looked at the rigid pile of hard pale books before her for you go your own way and the consequences are on your own head I will say this much that I shape my course by pilots strictly by proved and tried pilots under whom I cannot be shipwrecked can not be and that if I were unmindful of the admonition conveyed in those three letters I should not be half as chastened as I am It was curious how she seized the occasion to argue with some invisible opponent Perhaps with her own better sense always turning upon herself and her own deception If I forgot my ignorances in my life of health and freedom I might complain of the life to which I am now condemned I never do I never have done If I forgot that this scene the Earth is expressly meant to be a scene of gloom and hardship and dark trial for the creatures who are made out of its dust I might have some tenderness for its vanities But I have no such tenderness If I did not know that we are every one the subject most justly the subject of a wrath that must be satisfied and against which mere actions are nothing I might repine at the difference between me imprisoned here and the people who pass that gateway yonder But I take it as a grace and favour to be elected to make the satisfaction I am making here to know what I know for certain here and to work out what I have worked out here My affliction might otherwise have had no meaning to me Hence I would forget and I do forget nothing Hence I am contented and say it is better with me than with millions As she spoke these words she put her hand upon the watch and restored it to the precise spot on her little table which it always occupied With her touch lingering upon it she sat for some moments afterwards looking at it steadily and half defiantly mister Blandois during this exposition had been strictly attentive keeping his eyes fastened on the lady and thoughtfully stroking his moustache with his two hands mister Flintwinch had been a little fidgety and now struck in There there there said he That is quite understood missus Clennam and you have spoken piously and well mister Blandois I suspect is not of a pious cast On the contrary sir that gentleman protested snapping his fingers Your pardon It s a part of my character I am sensitive ardent conscientious and imaginative A sensitive ardent conscientious and imaginative man mister Flintwinch must be that or nothing There was an inkling of suspicion in mister Flintwinch s face that he might be nothing as he swaggered out of his chair it was characteristic of this man as it is of all men similarly marked that whatever he did he overdid though it were sometimes by only a hairsbreadth and approached to take his leave of missus Clennam With what will appear to you the egotism of a sick old woman sir she then said though really through your accidental allusion I have been led away into the subject of myself and my infirmities Being so considerate as to visit me I hope you will be likewise so considerate as to overlook that Don t compliment me if you please For he was evidently going to do it mister Flintwinch will be happy to render you any service and I hope your stay in this city may prove agreeable mister Blandois thanked her and kissed his hand several times This is an old room he remarked with a sudden sprightliness of manner looking round when he got near the door I have been so interested that I have not observed it But it s a genuine old room It is a genuine old house said missus Clennam with her frozen smile A place of no pretensions but a piece of antiquity Faith cried the visitor If mister Flintwinch would do me the favour to take me through the rooms on my way out he could hardly oblige me more An old house is a weakness with me I have many weaknesses but none greater I love and study the picturesque in all its varieties I have been called picturesque myself It is no merit to be picturesque I have greater merits perhaps but I may be by an accident Sympathy sympathy I tell you beforehand mister Blandois that you ll find it very dingy and very bare said Jeremiah taking up the candle It s not worth your looking at But mister Blandois smiting him in a friendly manner on the back only laughed so the said Blandois kissed his hand again to missus Clennam and they went out of the room together You don t care to go up stairs said Jeremiah on the landing On the contrary mister Flintwinch if not tiresome to you I shall be ravished mister Flintwinch therefore wormed himself up the staircase and mister Blandois followed close They ascended to the great garret bed room which Arthur had occupied on the night of his return There mister Blandois said Jeremiah showing it I hope you may think that worth coming so high to see I confess I don t mister Blandois being enraptured they walked through other garrets and passages and came down the staircase again By this time mister Flintwinch had remarked that he never found the visitor looking at any room after throwing one quick glance around but always found the visitor looking at him mister Flintwinch With this discovery in his thoughts he turned about on the staircase for another experiment He met his eyes directly and on the instant of their fixing one another the visitor with that ugly play of nose and moustache laughed as he had done at every similar moment since they left missus Clennam s chamber a diabolically silent laugh As a much shorter man than the visitor mister Flintwinch was at the physical disadvantage of being thus disagreeably leered at from a height and as he went first down the staircase and was usually a step or two lower than the other this disadvantage was at the time increased He postponed looking at mister Blandois again until this accidental inequality was removed by their having entered the late mister Clennam s room But then twisting himself suddenly round upon him he found his look unchanged A most admirable old house smiled mister Blandois So mysterious Do you never hear any haunted noises here Noises returned mister Flintwinch No Nor see any devils Not said mister Flintwinch grimly screwing himself at his questioner not any that introduce themselves under that name and in that capacity Haha A portrait here I see Still looking at mister Flintwinch as if he were the portrait It s a portrait sir as you observe May I ask the subject mister Flintwinch mister Clennam deceased Her husband Former owner of the remarkable watch perhaps said the visitor mister Flintwinch who had cast his eyes towards the portrait twisted himself about again and again found himself the subject of the same look and smile Yes mister Blandois he replied tartly It was his and his uncle s before him and Lord knows who before him and that s all I can tell you of its pedigree That s a strongly marked character mister Flintwinch our friend up stairs Yes sir said Jeremiah twisting himself at the visitor again as he did during the whole of this dialogue like some screw machine that fell short of its grip for the other never changed and he always felt obliged to retreat a little She is a remarkable woman Great fortitude great strength of mind They must have been very happy said Blandois Who demanded mister Flintwinch with another screw at him mister Blandois shook his right forefinger towards the sick room and his left forefinger towards the portrait and then putting his arms akimbo and striding his legs wide apart stood smiling down at mister Flintwinch with the advancing nose and the retreating moustache As happy as most other married people I suppose returned mister Flintwinch I can t say I don t know There are secrets in all families Secrets cried mister Blandois quickly Say it again my son I say replied mister Flintwinch upon whom he had swelled himself so suddenly that mister Flintwinch found his face almost brushed by the dilated chest I say there are secrets in all families So there are cried the other clapping him on both shoulders and rolling him backwards and forwards Haha you are right So there are Secrets Holy Blue There are the devil s own secrets in some families mister Flintwinch With that after clapping mister Flintwinch on both shoulders several times as if in a friendly and humorous way he were rallying him on a joke he had made he threw up his arms threw back his head hooked his hands together behind it and burst into a roar of laughter It was in vain for mister Flintwinch to try another screw at him He had his laugh out But favour me with the candle a moment he said when he had done Let us have a look at the husband of the remarkable lady Hah holding up the light at arm s length A decided expression of face here too though not of the same character Looks as if he were saying what is it Do Not Forget does he not mister Flintwinch By Heaven sir he does As he returned the candle he looked at him once more and then leisurely strolling out with him into the hall declared it to be a charming old house indeed and one which had so greatly pleased him that he would not have missed inspecting it for a hundred pounds Throughout these singular freedoms on the part of mister Blandois which involved a general alteration in his demeanour making it much coarser and rougher much more violent and audacious than before mister Flintwinch whose leathern face was not liable to many changes preserved its immobility intact Beyond now appearing perhaps to have been left hanging a trifle too long before that friendly operation of cutting down he outwardly maintained an equable composure They had brought their survey to a close in the little room at the side of the hall and he stood there eyeing mister Blandois I am glad you are so well satisfied sir was his calm remark I didn t expect it You seem to be quite in good spirits In admirable spirits returned Blandois Word of honour never more refreshed in spirits Do you ever have presentiments mister Flintwinch I am not sure that I know what you mean by the term sir replied that gentleman Say in this case mister Flintwinch undefined anticipations of pleasure to come I can t say I m sensible of such a sensation at present returned mister Flintwinch with the utmost gravity If I should find it coming on I ll mention it Now I said Blandois I my son have a presentiment to night that we shall be well acquainted Do you find it coming on N no returned mister Flintwinch deliberately inquiring of himself I can t say I do I have a strong presentiment that we shall become intimately acquainted You have no feeling of that sort yet Not yet said mister Flintwinch mister Blandois taking him by both shoulders again rolled him about a little in his former merry way then drew his arm through his own and invited him to come off and drink a bottle of wine like a dear deep old dog as he was Without a moment s indecision mister Flintwinch accepted the invitation and they went out to the quarters where the traveller was lodged through a heavy rain which had rattled on the windows roofs and pavements ever since nightfall The thunder and lightning had long ago passed over but the rain was furious On their arrival at mister Blandois room a bottle of port wine was ordered by that gallant gentleman who crushing every pretty thing he could collect in the soft disposition of his dainty figure coiled himself upon the window seat while mister Flintwinch took a chair opposite to him with the table between them mister Blandois proposed having the largest glasses in the house to which mister Flintwinch assented The bumpers filled mister Blandois with a roystering gaiety clinked the top of his glass against the bottom of mister Flintwinch s and the bottom of his glass against the top of mister Flintwinch s and drank to the intimate acquaintance he foresaw mister Flintwinch gravely pledged him and drank all the wine he could get and said nothing As often as mister Blandois clinked glasses which was at every replenishment mister Flintwinch stolidly did his part of the clinking and would have stolidly done his companion s part of the wine as well as his own being except in the article of palate a mere cask In short mister Blandois found that to pour port wine into the reticent Flintwinch was not to open him but to shut him up Moreover he had the appearance of a perfect ability to go on all night or if occasion were all next day and all next night whereas mister Blandois soon grew indistinctly conscious of swaggering too fiercely and boastfully He therefore terminated the entertainment at the end of the third bottle You will draw upon us to morrow sir said mister Flintwinch with a business like face at parting My Cabbage returned the other taking him by the collar with both hands I ll draw upon you have no fear Adieu my Flintwinch Receive at parting here he gave him a southern embrace and kissed him soundly on both cheeks the word of a gentleman By a thousand Thunders you shall see me again He did not present himself next day though the letter of advice came duly to hand Inquiring after him at night mister Flintwinch found with surprise that he had paid his bill and gone back to the Continent by way of Calais Nevertheless Jeremiah scraped out of his cogitating face a lively conviction that mister Blandois would keep his word on this occasion and would be seen again CHAPTER thirty one Spirit Anybody may pass any day in the thronged thoroughfares of the metropolis some meagre wrinkled yellow old man who might be supposed to have dropped from the stars if there were any star in the Heavens dull enough to be suspected of casting off so feeble a spark creeping along with a scared air as though bewildered and a little frightened by the noise and bustle This old man is always a little old man If he were ever a big old man he has shrunk into a little old man if he were always a little old man he has dwindled into a less old man His coat is a colour and cut that never was the mode anywhere at any period Clearly it was not made for him or for any individual mortal Some wholesale contractor measured Fate for five thousand coats of such quality and Fate has lent this old coat to this old man as one of a long unfinished line of many old men It has always large dull metal buttons similar to no other buttons This old man wears a hat a thumbed and napless and yet an obdurate hat which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor head His coarse shirt and his coarse neckcloth have no more individuality than his coat and hat they have the same character of not being his of not being anybody s Yet this old man wears these clothes with a certain unaccustomed air of being dressed and elaborated for the public ways as though he passed the greater part of his time in a nightcap and gown And so like the country mouse in the second year of a famine come to see the town mouse and timidly threading his way to the town mouse s lodging through a city of cats this old man passes in the streets Sometimes on holidays towards evening he will be seen to walk with a slightly increased infirmity and his old eyes will glimmer with a moist and marshy light Then the little old man is drunk A very small measure will overset him he may be bowled off his unsteady legs with a half pint pot Some pitying acquaintance chance acquaintance very often has warmed up his weakness with a treat of beer and the consequence will be the lapse of a longer time than usual before he shall pass again For the little old man is going home to the Workhouse and on his good behaviour they do not let him out often though methinks they might considering the few years he has before him to go out in under the sun and on his bad behaviour they shut him up closer than ever in a grove of two score and nineteen more old men every one of whom smells of all the others missus Plornish s father a poor little reedy piping old gentleman like a worn out bird who had been in what he called the music binding business and met with great misfortunes and who had seldom been able to make his way or to see it or to pay it or to do anything at all with it but find it no thoroughfare had retired of his own accord to the Workhouse which was appointed by law to be the Good Samaritan of his district without the twopence which was bad political economy on the settlement of that execution which had carried mister Plornish to the Marshalsea College Previous to his son in law s difficulties coming to that head Old Nandy he was always so called in his legal Retreat but he was Old mister Nandy among the Bleeding Hearts had sat in a corner of the Plornish fireside and taken his bite and sup out of the Plornish cupboard He still hoped to resume that domestic position when Fortune should smile upon his son in law in the meantime while she preserved an immovable countenance he was and resolved to remain one of these little old men in a grove of little old men with a community of flavour But no poverty in him and no coat on him that never was the mode and no Old Men s Ward for his dwelling place could quench his daughter s admiration missus Plornish was as proud of her father s talents as she could possibly have been if they had made him Lord Chancellor She had as firm a belief in the sweetness and propriety of his manners as she could possibly have had if he had been Lord Chamberlain The poor little old man knew some pale and vapid little songs long out of date about Chloe and Phyllis and Strephon being wounded by the son of Venus and for missus Plornish there was no such music at the Opera as the small internal flutterings and chirpings wherein he would discharge himself of these ditties like a weak little broken barrel organ ground by a baby On his days out those flecks of light in his flat vista of pollard old men it was at once missus Plornish s delight and sorrow when he was strong with meat and had taken his full halfpenny worth of porter to say Sing us a song Father Then he would give them Chloe and if he were in pretty good spirits Phyllis also Strephon he had hardly been up to since he went into retirement and then would missus Plornish declare she did believe there never was such a singer as Father and wipe her eyes If he had come from Court on these occasions nay if he had been the noble Refrigerator come home triumphantly from a foreign court to be presented and promoted on his last tremendous failure missus Plornish could not have handed him with greater elevation about Bleeding Heart Yard Here s Father she would say presenting him to a neighbour Father will soon be home with us for good now Ain t Father looking well Father s a sweeter singer than ever you d never have forgotten it if you d aheard him just now As to mister Plornish he had married these articles of belief in marrying mister Nandy s daughter and only wondered how it was that so gifted an old gentleman had not made a fortune This he attributed after much reflection to his musical genius not having been scientifically developed in his youth For why argued mister Plornish why go a binding music when you ve got it in yourself That s where it is I consider Old Nandy had a patron one patron He had a patron who in a certain sumptuous way an apologetic way as if he constantly took an admiring audience to witness that he really could not help being more free with this old fellow than they might have expected on account of his simplicity and poverty was mightily good to him Old Nandy had been several times to the Marshalsea College communicating with his son in law during his short durance there and had happily acquired to himself and had by degrees and in course of time much improved the patronage of the Father of that national institution mister Dorrit was in the habit of receiving this old man as if the old man held of him in vassalage under some feudal tenure He made little treats and teas for him as if he came in with his homage from some outlying district where the tenantry were in a primitive state It seemed as if there were moments when he could by no means have sworn but that the old man was an ancient retainer of his who had been meritoriously faithful When he mentioned him he spoke of him casually as his old pensioner He had a wonderful satisfaction in seeing him and in commenting on his decayed condition after he was gone It appeared to him amazing that he could hold up his head at all poor creature In the Workhouse sir the Union no privacy no visitors no station no respect no speciality Most deplorable It was Old Nandy s birthday and they let him out He said nothing about its being his birthday or they might have kept him in for such old men should not be born He passed along the streets as usual to Bleeding Heart Yard and had his dinner with his daughter and son in law and gave them Phyllis He had hardly concluded when Little Dorrit looked in to see how they all were Miss Dorrit said missus Plornish here s Father Ain t he looking nice And such voice he s in Little Dorrit gave him her hand and smilingly said she had not seen him this long time No they re rather hard on poor Father said missus Plornish with a lengthening face and don t let him have half as much change and fresh air as would benefit him But he ll soon be home for good now Won t you Father Yes my dear I hope so In good time please God Here mister Plornish delivered himself of an oration which he invariably made word for word the same on all such opportunities It was couched in the following terms John Edward Nandy Sir While there s a ounce of wittles or drink of any sort in this present roof you re fully welcome to your share on it While there s a handful of fire or a mouthful of bed in this present roof you re fully welcome to your share on it If so be as there should be nothing in this present roof you should be as welcome to your share on it as if it was something much or little And this is what I mean and so I don t deceive you and consequently which is to stand out is to entreat of you and therefore why not do it To this lucid address which mister Plornish always delivered as if he had composed it as no doubt he had with enormous labour missus Plornish s father pipingly replied I thank you kindly Thomas and I know your intentions well which is the same I thank you kindly for But no Thomas Until such times as it s not to take it out of your children s mouths which take it is and call it by what name you will it do remain and equally deprive though may they come and too soon they can not come no Thomas no missus Plornish who had been turning her face a little away with a corner of her apron in her hand brought herself back to the conversation again by telling Miss Dorrit that Father was going over the water to pay his respects unless she knew of any reason why it might not be agreeable Her answer was I am going straight home and if he will come with me I shall be so glad to take care of him so glad said Little Dorrit always thoughtful of the feelings of the weak of his company There Father cried missus Plornish Ain t you a gay young man to be going for a walk along with Miss Dorrit Let me tie your neck handkerchief into a regular good bow for you re a regular beau yourself Father if ever there was one With this filial joke his daughter smartened him up and gave him a loving hug and stood at the door with her weak child in her arms and her strong child tumbling down the steps looking after her little old father as he toddled away with his arm under Little Dorrit s They walked at a slow pace and Little Dorrit took him by the Iron Bridge and sat him down there for a rest and they looked over at the water and talked about the shipping and the old man mentioned what he would do if he had a ship full of gold coming home to him his plan was to take a noble lodging for the Plornishes and himself at a Tea Gardens and live there all the rest of their lives attended on by the waiter and it was a special birthday of the old man They were within five minutes of their destination when at the corner of her own street they came upon Fanny in her new bonnet bound for the same port Why good gracious me Amy cried that young lady starting You never mean it Mean what Fanny dear Well I could have believed a great deal of you returned the young lady with burning indignation but I don t think even I could have believed this of even you Fanny cried Little Dorrit wounded and astonished Oh Don t Fanny me you mean little thing don t The idea of coming along the open streets in the broad light of day with a Pauper firing off the last word as if it were a ball from an air gun O Fanny I tell you not to Fanny me for I ll not submit to it I never knew such a thing The way in which you are resolved and determined to disgrace us on all occasions is really infamous You bad little thing Does it disgrace anybody said Little Dorrit very gently to take care of this poor old man Yes miss returned her sister and you ought to know it does And you do know it does and you do it because you know it does The principal pleasure of your life is to remind your family of their misfortunes And the next great pleasure of your existence is to keep low company But however if you have no sense of decency I have You ll please to allow me to go on the other side of the way unmolested With this she bounced across to the opposite pavement The old disgrace who had been deferentially bowing a pace or two off for Little Dorrit had let his arm go in her wonder when Fanny began and who had been hustled and cursed by impatient passengers for stopping the way rejoined his companion rather giddy and said I hope nothing s wrong with your honoured father Miss I hope there s nothing the matter in the honoured family No no returned Little Dorrit No thank you Give me your arm again mister Nandy We shall soon be there now So she talked to him as she had talked before and they came to the Lodge and found mister Chivery on the lock and went in Now it happened that the Father of the Marshalsea was sauntering towards the Lodge at the moment when they were coming out of it entering the prison arm in arm As the spectacle of their approach met his view he displayed the utmost agitation and despondency of mind and altogether regardless of Old Nandy who making his reverence stood with his hat in his hand as he always did in that gracious presence turned about and hurried in at his own doorway and up the staircase Leaving the old unfortunate whom in an evil hour she had taken under her protection with a hurried promise to return to him directly Little Dorrit hastened after her father and on the staircase found Fanny following her and flouncing up with offended dignity The three came into the room almost together and the Father sat down in his chair buried his face in his hands and uttered a groan Of course said Fanny Very proper Poor afflicted Pa Now I hope you believe me Miss What is it father cried Little Dorrit bending over him Have I made you unhappy father Not I I hope You hope indeed I dare say Oh you Fanny paused for a sufficiently strong expression you Common minded little Amy You complete prison child He stopped these angry reproaches with a wave of his hand and sobbed out raising his face and shaking his melancholy head at his younger daughter Amy I know that you are innocent in intention But you have cut me to the soul Innocent in intention the implacable Fanny struck in Stuff in intention Low in intention Lowering of the family in intention Father cried Little Dorrit pale and trembling I am very sorry Pray forgive me Tell me how it is that I may not do it again How it is you prevaricating little piece of goods cried Fanny You know how it is I have told you already so don t fly in the face of Providence by attempting to deny it Hush Amy said the father passing his pocket handkerchief several times across his face and then grasping it convulsively in the hand that dropped across his knee I have done what I could to keep you select here I have done what I could to retain you a position here I may have succeeded I may not You may know it you may not I give no opinion I have endured everything here but humiliation That I have happily been spared until this day Here his convulsive grasp unclosed itself and he put his pocket handkerchief to his eyes again Little Dorrit on the ground beside him with her imploring hand upon his arm watched him remorsefully Coming out of his fit of grief he clenched his pocket handkerchief once more Humiliation I have happily been spared until this day Through all my troubles there has been that Spirit in myself and that that submission to it if I may use the term in those about me which has spared me ha humiliation But this day this minute I have keenly felt it Of course How could it be otherwise exclaimed the irrepressible Fanny Careering and prancing about with a Pauper air gun again But dear father cried Little Dorrit I don t justify myself for having wounded your dear heart no Heaven knows I don t She clasped her hands in quite an agony of distress I do nothing but beg and pray you to be comforted and overlook it But if I had not known that you were kind to the old man yourself and took much notice of him and were always glad to see him I would not have come here with him father I would not indeed What I have been so unhappy as to do I have done in mistake I would not wilfully bring a tear to your eyes dear love said Little Dorrit her heart well nigh broken for anything the world could give me or anything it could take away Fanny with a partly angry and partly repentant sob began to cry herself and to say as this young lady always said when she was half in passion and half out of it half spiteful with herself and half spiteful with everybody else that she wished she were dead The Father of the Marshalsea in the meantime took his younger daughter to his breast and patted her head There there Say no more Amy say no more my child I will forget it as soon as I can I with hysterical cheerfulness I shall soon be able to dismiss it It is perfectly true my dear that I am always glad to see my old pensioner as such as such and that I do ha extend as much protection and kindness to the hum the bruised reed I trust I may so call him without impropriety as in my circumstances I can It is quite true that this is the case my dear child At the same time I preserve in doing this if I may ha if I may use the expression Spirit Becoming Spirit And there are some things which are he stopped to sob irreconcilable with that and wound that wound it deeply It is not that I have seen my good Amy attentive and ha condescending to my old pensioner it is not that that hurts me It is if I am to close the painful subject by being explicit that I have seen my child my own child my own daughter coming into this College out of the public streets smiling smiling arm in arm with O my God a livery This reference to the coat of no cut and no time the unfortunate gentleman gasped forth in a scarcely audible voice and with his clenched pocket handkerchief raised in the air His excited feelings might have found some further painful utterance but for a knock at the door which had been already twice repeated and to which Fanny still wishing herself dead and indeed now going so far as to add buried cried Come in Ah Young John said the Father in an altered and calmed voice What is it Young John A letter for you sir being left in the Lodge just this minute and a message with it I thought happening to be there myself sir I would bring it to your room The speaker s attention was much distracted by the piteous spectacle of Little Dorrit at her father s feet with her head turned away Indeed John Thank you The letter is from mister Clennam sir it s the answer and the message was sir that mister Clennam also sent his compliments and word that he would do himself the pleasure of calling this afternoon hoping to see you and likewise attention more distracted than before Miss Amy Oh As the Father glanced into the letter there was a bank note in it he reddened a little and patted Amy on the head afresh Thank you Young John Quite right Much obliged to you for your attention No one waiting No sir no one waiting Thank you John How is your mother Young John Thank you sir she s not quite as well as we could wish in fact we none of us are except father but she s pretty well sir Say we sent our remembrances will you Say kind remembrances if you please Young John Thank you sir I will And mister Chivery junior went his way having spontaneously composed on the spot an entirely new epitaph for himself to the effect that Here lay the body of John Chivery Who Having at such a date Beheld the idol of his life In grief and tears And feeling unable to bear the harrowing spectacle Immediately repaired to the abode of his inconsolable parents And terminated his existence by his own rash act There there Amy said the Father when Young John had closed the door let us say no more about it The last few minutes had improved his spirits remarkably and he was quite lightsome Where is my old pensioner all this while We must not leave him by himself any longer or he will begin to suppose he is not welcome and that would pain me Will you fetch him my child or shall I If you wouldn t mind father said Little Dorrit trying to bring her sobbing to a close Certainly I will go my dear I forgot your eyes are rather red There Cheer up Amy Don t be uneasy about me I am quite myself again my love quite myself Go to your room Amy and make yourself look comfortable and pleasant to receive mister Clennam I would rather stay in my own room Father returned Little Dorrit finding it more difficult than before to regain her composure I would far rather not see mister Clennam Oh fie fie my dear that s folly mister Clennam is a very gentlemanly man very gentlemanly A little reserved at times but I will say extremely gentlemanly I couldn t think of your not being here to receive mister Clennam my dear especially this afternoon So go and freshen yourself up Amy go and freshen yourself up like a good girl Thus directed Little Dorrit dutifully rose and obeyed only pausing for a moment as she went out of the room to give her sister a kiss of reconciliation Upon which that young lady feeling much harassed in her mind and having for the time worn out the wish with which she generally relieved it conceived and executed the brilliant idea of wishing Old Nandy dead rather than that he should come bothering there like a disgusting tiresome wicked wretch and making mischief between two sisters The Father of the Marshalsea even humming a tune and wearing his black velvet cap a little on one side so much improved were his spirits went down into the yard and found his old pensioner standing there hat in hand just within the gate as he had stood all this time Come Nandy said he with great suavity Come up stairs Nandy you know the way why don t you come up stairs He went the length on this occasion of giving him his hand and saying How are you Nandy Are you pretty well To which that vocalist returned I thank you honoured sir I am all the better for seeing your honour As they went along the yard the Father of the Marshalsea presented him to a Collegian of recent date An old acquaintance of mine sir an old pensioner And then said Be covered my good Nandy put your hat on with great consideration His patronage did not stop here for he charged Maggy to get the tea ready and instructed her to buy certain tea cakes fresh butter eggs cold ham and shrimps to purchase which collation he gave her a bank note for ten pounds laying strict injunctions on her to be careful of the change These preparations were in an advanced stage of progress and his daughter Amy had come back with her work when Clennam presented himself whom he most graciously received and besought to join their meal Amy my love you know mister Clennam even better than I have the happiness of doing Fanny my dear you are acquainted with mister Clennam Fanny acknowledged him haughtily the position she tacitly took up in all such cases being that there was a vast conspiracy to insult the family by not understanding it or sufficiently deferring to it and here was one of the conspirators This mister Clennam you must know is an old pensioner of mine Old Nandy a very faithful old man He always spoke of him as an object of great antiquity but he was two or three years younger than himself Let me see You know Plornish I think I think my daughter Amy has mentioned to me that you know poor Plornish O yes said Arthur Clennam Well sir this is missus Plornish s father Indeed I am glad to see him You would be more glad if you knew his many good qualities mister Clennam I hope I shall come to know them through knowing him said Arthur secretly pitying the bowed and submissive figure It is a holiday with him and he comes to see his old friends who are always glad to see him observed the Father of the Marshalsea Then he added behind his hand Union poor old fellow Out for the day By this time Maggy quietly assisted by her Little Mother had spread the board and the repast was ready It being hot weather and the prison very close the window was as wide open as it could be pushed If Maggy will spread that newspaper on the window sill my dear remarked the Father complacently and in a half whisper to Little Dorrit my old pensioner can have his tea there while we are having ours So with a gulf between him and the good company of about a foot in width standard measure missus Plornish s father was handsomely regaled Clennam had never seen anything like his magnanimous protection by that other Father he of the Marshalsea and was lost in the contemplation of its many wonders The most striking of these was perhaps the relishing manner in which he remarked on the pensioner s infirmities and failings as if he were a gracious Keeper making a running commentary on the decline of the harmless animal he exhibited Not ready for more ham yet Nandy Why how slow you are His last teeth he explained to the company are going poor old boy At another time he said No shrimps Nandy and on his not instantly replying observed His hearing is becoming very defective He ll be deaf directly At another time he asked him Do you walk much Nandy about the yard within the walls of that place of yours No sir no I haven t any great liking for that No to be sure he assented Very natural Then he privately informed the circle Legs going Once he asked the pensioner in that general clemency which asked him anything to keep him afloat how old his younger grandchild was John Edward said the pensioner slowly laying down his knife and fork to consider How old sir Let me think now The Father of the Marshalsea tapped his forehead Memory weak John Edward sir Well I really forget I couldn t say at this minute sir whether it s two and two months or whether it s two and five months It s one or the other Don t distress yourself by worrying your mind about it he returned with infinite forbearance Faculties evidently decaying old man rusts in the life he leads The more of these discoveries that he persuaded himself he made in the pensioner the better he appeared to like him and when he got out of his chair after tea to bid the pensioner good bye on his intimating that he feared honoured sir his time was running out he made himself look as erect and strong as possible We don t call this a shilling Nandy you know he said putting one in his hand We call it tobacco Honoured sir I thank you It shall buy tobacco My thanks and duty to Miss Amy and Miss Fanny I wish you good night mister Clennam And mind you don t forget us you know Nandy said the Father You must come again mind whenever you have an afternoon You must not come out without seeing us or we shall be jealous Good night Nandy Be very careful how you descend the stairs Nandy they are rather uneven and worn With that he stood on the landing watching the old man down and when he came into the room again said with a solemn satisfaction on him A melancholy sight that mister Clennam though one has the consolation of knowing that he doesn t feel it himself The poor old fellow is a dismal wreck Spirit broken and gone pulverised crushed out of him sir completely As Clennam had a purpose in remaining he said what he could responsive to these sentiments and stood at the window with their enunciator while Maggy and her Little Mother washed the tea service and cleared it away He noticed that his companion stood at the window with the air of an affable and accessible Sovereign and that when any of his people in the yard below looked up his recognition of their salutes just stopped short of a blessing When Little Dorrit had her work on the table and Maggy hers on the bedstead Fanny fell to tying her bonnet as a preliminary to her departure Arthur still having his purpose still remained At this time the door opened without any notice and mister Tip came in He kissed Amy as she started up to meet him nodded to Fanny nodded to his father gloomed on the visitor without further recognition and sat down Tip dear said Little Dorrit mildly shocked by this don t you see Yes I see Amy If you refer to the presence of any visitor you have here I say if you refer to that answered Tip jerking his head with emphasis towards his shoulder nearest Clennam I see Is that all you say That s all I say And I suppose added the lofty young man after a moment s pause that visitor will understand me when I say that s all I say In short I suppose the visitor will understand that he hasn t used me like a gentleman I do not understand that observed the obnoxious personage referred to with tranquillity No Why then to make it clearer to you sir I beg to let you know that when I address what I call a properly worded appeal and an urgent appeal and a delicate appeal to an individual for a small temporary accommodation easily within his power easily within his power mind and when that individual writes back word to me that he begs to be excused I consider that he doesn t treat me like a gentleman The Father of the Marshalsea who had surveyed his son in silence no sooner heard this sentiment than he began in angry voice How dare you But his son stopped him Now don t ask me how I dare father because that s bosh As to the fact of the line of conduct I choose to adopt towards the individual present you ought to be proud of my showing a proper spirit I should think so cried Fanny A proper spirit said the Father Yes a proper spirit a becoming spirit Is it come to this that my son teaches me ME spirit Now don t let us bother about it father or have any row on the subject I have fully made up my mind that the individual present has not treated me like a gentleman And there s an end of it But there is not an end of it sir returned the Father But there shall not be an end of it You have made up your mind You have made up your mind Yes I have What s the good of keeping on like that Because returned the Father in a great heat you had no right to make up your mind to what is monstrous to what is ha immoral to what is hum parricidal No mister Clennam I beg sir Don t ask me to desist there is a hum a general principle involved here which rises even above considerations of ha hospitality I object to the assertion made by my son I ha I personally repel it Why what is it to you father returned the son over his shoulder What is it to me sir I have a hum a spirit sir that will not endure it I he took out his pocket handkerchief again and dabbed his face I am outraged and insulted by it Let me suppose the case that I myself may at a certain time ha or times have made a hum an appeal and a properly worded appeal and a delicate appeal and an urgent appeal to some individual for a small temporary accommodation Let me suppose that that accommodation could have been easily extended and was not extended and that that individual informed me that he begged to be excused Am I to be told by my own son that I therefore received treatment not due to a gentleman and that I ha I submitted to it His daughter Amy gently tried to calm him but he would not on any account be calmed He said his spirit was up and wouldn t endure this Was he to be told that he wished to know again by his own son on his own hearth to his own face Was that humiliation to be put upon him by his own blood You are putting it on yourself father and getting into all this injury of your own accord said the young gentleman morosely What I have made up my mind about has nothing to do with you What I said had nothing to do with you Why need you go trying on other people s hats I reply it has everything to do with me returned the Father I point out to you sir with indignation that hum the ha delicacy and peculiarity of your father s position should strike you dumb sir if nothing else should in laying down such ha such unnatural principles Besides if you are not filial sir if you discard that duty you are at least hum not a Christian Are you ha an Atheist And is it Christian let me ask you to stigmatise and denounce an individual for begging to be excused this time when the same individual may ha respond with the required accommodation next time Is it the part of a Christian not to hum not to try him again He had worked himself into quite a religious glow and fervour I see precious well said mister Tip rising that I shall get no sensible or fair argument here to night and so the best thing I can do is to cut Good night Amy Don t be vexed I am very sorry it happens here and you here upon my soul I am but I can t altogether part with my spirit even for your sake old girl With those words he put on his hat and went out accompanied by Miss Fanny who did not consider it spirited on her part to take leave of Clennam with any less opposing demonstration than a stare importing that she had always known him for one of the large body of conspirators When they were gone the Father of the Marshalsea was at first inclined to sink into despondency again and would have done so but that a gentleman opportunely came up within a minute or two to attend him to the Snuggery It was the gentleman Clennam had seen on the night of his own accidental detention there who had that impalpable grievance about the misappropriated Fund on which the Marshal was supposed to batten He presented himself as deputation to escort the Father to the Chair it being an occasion on which he had promised to preside over the assembled Collegians in the enjoyment of a little Harmony Such you see mister Clennam said the Father are the incongruities of my position here But a public duty No man I am sure would more readily recognise a public duty than yourself Clennam besought him not to delay a moment Amy my dear if you can persuade mister Clennam to stay longer I can leave the honours of our poor apology for an establishment with confidence in your hands and perhaps you may do something towards erasing from mister Clennam s mind the ha untoward and unpleasant circumstance which has occurred since tea time Clennam assured him that it had made no impression on his mind and therefore required no erasure My dear sir said the Father with a removal of his black cap and a grasp of Clennam s hand combining to express the safe receipt of his note and enclosure that afternoon Heaven ever bless you So at last Clennam s purpose in remaining was attained and he could speak to Little Dorrit with nobody by Maggy counted as nobody and she was by CHAPTER thirty two More Fortune Telling Maggy sat at her work in her great white cap with its quantity of opaque frilling hiding what profile she had she had none to spare and her serviceable eye brought to bear upon her occupation on the window side of the room What with her flapping cap and what with her unserviceable eye she was quite partitioned off from her Little Mother whose seat was opposite the window The tread and shuffle of feet on the pavement of the yard had much diminished since the taking of the Chair the tide of Collegians having set strongly in the direction of Harmony Some few who had no music in their souls or no money in their pockets dawdled about and the old spectacle of the visitor wife and the depressed unseasoned prisoner still lingered in corners as broken cobwebs and such unsightly discomforts draggle in corners of other places It was the quietest time the College knew saving the night hours when the Collegians took the benefit of the act of sleep The occasional rattle of applause upon the tables of the Snuggery denoted the successful termination of a morsel of Harmony or the responsive acceptance by the united children of some toast or sentiment offered to them by their Father Occasionally a vocal strain more sonorous than the generality informed the listener that some boastful bass was in blue water or in the hunting field or with the reindeer or on the mountain or among the heather but the Marshal of the Marshalsea knew better and had got him hard and fast As Arthur Clennam moved to sit down by the side of Little Dorrit she trembled so that she had much ado to hold her needle Clennam gently put his hand upon her work and said Dear Little Dorrit let me lay it down She yielded it to him and he put it aside Her hands were then nervously clasping together but he took one of them How seldom I have seen you lately Little Dorrit I have been busy sir But I heard only to day said Clennam by mere accident of your having been with those good people close by me Why not come to me then I I don t know Or rather I thought you might be busy too You generally are now are you not He saw her trembling little form and her downcast face and the eyes that drooped the moment they were raised to his he saw them almost with as much concern as tenderness My child your manner is so changed The trembling was now quite beyond her control Softly withdrawing her hand and laying it in her other hand she sat before him with her head bent and her whole form trembling My own Little Dorrit said Clennam compassionately She burst into tears Maggy looked round of a sudden and stared for at least a minute but did not interpose Clennam waited some little while before he spoke again I cannot bear he said then to see you weep but I hope this is a relief to an overcharged heart Yes it is sir Nothing but that Well well I feared you would think too much of what passed here just now It is of no moment not the least I am only unfortunate to have come in the way Let it go by with these tears It is not worth one of them One of them Such an idle thing should be repeated with my glad consent fifty times a day to save you a moment s heart ache Little Dorrit She had taken courage now and answered far more in her usual manner You are so good But even if there was nothing else in it to be sorry for and ashamed of it is such a bad return to you Hush said Clennam smiling and touching her lips with his hand Forgetfulness in you who remember so many and so much would be new indeed Shall I remind you that I am not and that I never was anything but the friend whom you agreed to trust No You remember it don t you I try to do so or I should have broken the promise just now when my mistaken brother was here You will consider his bringing up in this place and will not judge him hardly poor fellow I know In raising her eyes with these words she observed his face more nearly than she had done yet and said with a quick change of tone You have not been ill mister Clennam No Nor tried Nor hurt she asked him anxiously It fell to Clennam now to be not quite certain how to answer He said in reply To speak the truth I have been a little troubled but it is over Do I show it so plainly I ought to have more fortitude and self command than that I thought I had I must learn them of you Who could teach me better He never thought that she saw in him what no one else could see He never thought that in the whole world there were no other eyes that looked upon him with the same light and strength as hers But it brings me to something that I wish to say he continued and therefore I will not quarrel even with my own face for telling tales and being unfaithful to me Besides it is a privilege and pleasure to confide in my Little Dorrit Let me confess then that forgetting how grave I was and how old I was and how the time for such things had gone by me with the many years of sameness and little happiness that made up my long life far away without marking it that forgetting all this I fancied I loved some one Do I know her sir asked Little Dorrit No my child Not the lady who has been kind to me for your sake Flora No no Do you think I never quite thought so said Little Dorrit more to herself than him I did wonder at it a little Well said Clennam abiding by the feeling that had fallen on him in the avenue on the night of the roses the feeling that he was an older man who had done with that tender part of life I found out my mistake and I thought about it a little in short a good deal and got wiser Being wiser I counted up my years and considered what I am and looked back and looked forward and found that I should soon be grey I found that I had climbed the hill and passed the level ground upon the top and was descending quickly If he had known the sharpness of the pain he caused the patient heart in speaking thus While doing it too with the purpose of easing and serving her I found that the day when any such thing would have been graceful in me or good in me or hopeful or happy for me or any one in connection with me was gone and would never shine again O If he had known if he had known If he could have seen the dagger in his hand and the cruel wounds it struck in the faithful bleeding breast of his Little Dorrit All that is over and I have turned my face from it Why do I speak of this to Little Dorrit Why do I show you my child the space of years that there is between us and recall to you that I have passed by the amount of your whole life the time that is present to you Because you trust me I hope Because you know that nothing can touch you without touching me that nothing can make you happy or unhappy but it must make me who am so grateful to you the same He heard the thrill in her voice he saw her earnest face he saw her clear true eyes he saw the quickened bosom that would have joyfully thrown itself before him to receive a mortal wound directed at his breast with the dying cry I love him and the remotest suspicion of the truth never dawned upon his mind No He saw the devoted little creature with her worn shoes in her common dress in her jail home a slender child in body a strong heroine in soul and the light of her domestic story made all else dark to him For those reasons assuredly Little Dorrit but for another too So far removed so different and so much older I am the better fitted for your friend and adviser I mean I am the more easily to be trusted and any little constraint that you might feel with another may vanish before me Why have you kept so retired from me Tell me I am better here My place and use are here I am much better here said Little Dorrit faintly So you said that day upon the bridge I thought of it much afterwards Have you no secret you could entrust to me with hope and comfort if you would Secret No I have no secret said Little Dorrit in some trouble They had been speaking in low voices more because it was natural to what they said to adopt that tone than with any care to reserve it from Maggy at her work All of a sudden Maggy stared again and this time spoke I say Little Mother Yes Maggy If you an t got no secret of your own to tell him tell him that about the Princess She had a secret you know The Princess had a secret said Clennam in some surprise What Princess was that Maggy Lor How you do go and bother a gal of ten said Maggy catching the poor thing up in that way Whoever said the Princess had a secret I never said so I beg your pardon I thought you did No I didn t How could I when it was her as wanted to find it out It was the little woman as had the secret and she was always a spinning at her wheel And so she says to her why do you keep it there And so the t other one says to her no I don t and so the t other one says to her yes you do and then they both goes to the cupboard and there it is And she wouldn t go into the Hospital and so she died You know Little Mother tell him that For it was a reg lar good secret that was cried Maggy hugging herself Arthur looked at Little Dorrit for help to comprehend this and was struck by seeing her so timid and red But when she told him that it was only a Fairy Tale she had one day made up for Maggy and that there was nothing in it which she wouldn t be ashamed to tell again to anybody else even if she could remember it he left the subject where it was However he returned to his own subject by first entreating her to see him oftener and to remember that it was impossible to have a stronger interest in her welfare than he had or to be more set upon promoting it than he was When she answered fervently she well knew that she never forgot it he touched upon his second and more delicate point the suspicion he had formed Little Dorrit he said taking her hand again and speaking lower than he had spoken yet so that even Maggy in the small room could not hear him another word I have wanted very much to say this to you I have tried for opportunities Don t mind me who for the matter of years might be your father or your uncle Always think of me as quite an old man I know that all your devotion centres in this room and that nothing to the last will ever tempt you away from the duties you discharge here If I were not sure of it I should before now have implored you and implored your father to let me make some provision for you in a more suitable place But you may have an interest I will not say now though even that might be may have at another time an interest in some one else an interest not incompatible with your affection here She was very very pale and silently shook her head It may be dear Little Dorrit No No No She shook her head after each slow repetition of the word with an air of quiet desolation that he remembered long afterwards The time came when he remembered it well long afterwards within those prison walls within that very room But if it ever should be tell me so my dear child Entrust the truth to me point out the object of such an interest to me and I will try with all the zeal and honour and friendship and respect that I feel for you good Little Dorrit of my heart to do you a lasting service O thank you thank you But O no O no O no She said this looking at him with her work worn hands folded together and in the same resigned accents as before I press for no confidence now I only ask you to repose unhesitating trust in me Can I do less than that when you are so good Then you will trust me fully Will have no secret unhappiness or anxiety concealed from me Almost none And you have none now She shook her head But she was very pale When I lie down to night and my thoughts come back as they will for they do every night even when I have not seen you to this sad place I may believe that there is no grief beyond this room now and its usual occupants which preys on Little Dorrit s mind She seemed to catch at these words that he remembered too long afterwards and said more brightly Yes mister Clennam yes you may The crazy staircase usually not slow to give notice when any one was coming up or down here creaked under a quick tread and a further sound was heard upon it as if a little steam engine with more steam than it knew what to do with were working towards the room As it approached which it did very rapidly it laboured with increased energy and after knocking at the door it sounded as if it were stooping down and snorting in at the keyhole Before Maggy could open the door mister Pancks opening it from without stood without a hat and with his bare head in the wildest condition looking at Clennam and Little Dorrit over her shoulder He had a lighted cigar in his hand and brought with him airs of ale and tobacco smoke Pancks the gipsy he observed out of breath fortune telling He stood dingily smiling and breathing hard at them with a most curious air as if instead of being his proprietor s grubber he were the triumphant proprietor of the Marshalsea the Marshal all the turnkeys and all the Collegians In his great self satisfaction he put his cigar to his lips being evidently no smoker and took such a pull at it with his right eye shut up tight for the purpose that he underwent a convulsion of shuddering and choking But even in the midst of that paroxysm he still essayed to repeat his favourite introduction of himself Pa ancks the gi ipsy fortune telling I am spending the evening with the rest of em said Pancks I ve been singing I ve been taking a part in White sand and grey sand I don t know anything about it Never mind I ll take any part in anything It s all the same if you re loud enough At first Clennam supposed him to be intoxicated But he soon perceived that though he might be a little the worse or better for ale the staple of his excitement was not brewed from malt or distilled from any grain or berry How d ye do Miss Dorrit said Pancks I thought you wouldn t mind my running round and looking in for a moment mister Clennam I heard was here from mister Dorrit How are you Sir Clennam thanked him and said he was glad to see him so gay Gay said Pancks I m in wonderful feather sir I can t stop a minute or I shall be missed and I don t want em to miss me Eh Miss Dorrit He seemed to have an insatiate delight in appealing to her and looking at her excitedly sticking his hair up at the same moment like a dark species of cockatoo I haven t been here half an hour I knew mister Dorrit was in the chair and I said I ll go and support him I ought to be down in Bleeding Heart Yard by rights but I can worry them to morrow Eh Miss Dorrit His little black eyes sparkled electrically His very hair seemed to sparkle as he roughened it He was in that highly charged state that one might have expected to draw sparks and snaps from him by presenting a knuckle to any part of his figure Capital company here said Pancks Eh Miss Dorrit She was half afraid of him and irresolute what to say He laughed with a nod towards Clennam Don t mind him Miss Dorrit He s one of us We agreed that you shouldn t take on to mind me before people but we didn t mean mister Clennam He s one of us He s in it An t you mister Clennam Eh Miss Dorrit The excitement of this strange creature was fast communicating itself to Clennam Little Dorrit with amazement saw this and observed that they exchanged quick looks I was making a remark said Pancks but I declare I forget what it was Oh I know Capital company here I ve been treating em all round Eh Miss Dorrit Very generous of you she returned noticing another of the quick looks between the two Not at all said Pancks Don t mention it I m coming into my property that s the fact I can afford to be liberal I think I ll give em a treat here Tables laid in the yard Bread in stacks Pipes in faggots Tobacco in hayloads Roast beef and plum pudding for every one Quart of double stout a head Pint of wine too if they like it and the authorities give permission Eh Miss Dorrit She was thrown into such a confusion by his manner or rather by Clennam s growing understanding of his manner for she looked to him after every fresh appeal and cockatoo demonstration on the part of mister Pancks that she only moved her lips in answer without forming any word And oh by the bye said Pancks you were to live to know what was behind us on that little hand of yours And so you shall you shall my darling Eh Miss Dorrit He had suddenly checked himself Where he got all the additional black prongs from that now flew up all over his head like the myriads of points that break out in the large change of a great firework was a wonderful mystery But I shall be missed he came back to that and I don t want em to miss me mister Clennam you and I made a bargain I said you should find me stick to it You shall find me stick to it now sir if you ll step out of the room a moment Miss Dorrit I wish you good night Miss Dorrit I wish you good fortune He rapidly shook her by both hands and puffed down stairs Arthur followed him with such a hurried step that he had very nearly tumbled over him on the last landing and rolled him down into the yard What is it for Heaven s sake Arthur demanded when they burst out there both together Stop a moment sir mister Rugg Let me introduce him With those words he presented another man without a hat and also with a cigar and also surrounded with a halo of ale and tobacco smoke which man though not so excited as himself was in a state which would have been akin to lunacy but for its fading into sober method when compared with the rampancy of mister Pancks mister Clennam mister Rugg said Pancks Stop a moment Come to the pump They adjourned to the pump mister Pancks instantly putting his head under the spout requested mister Rugg to take a good strong turn at the handle mister Rugg complying to the letter mister Pancks came forth snorting and blowing to some purpose and dried himself on his handkerchief I am the clearer for that he gasped to Clennam standing astonished But upon my soul to hear her father making speeches in that chair knowing what we know and to see her up in that room in that dress knowing what we know is enough to give me a back mister Rugg a little higher sir that ll do Then and there on that Marshalsea pavement in the shades of evening did mister Pancks of all mankind fly over the head and shoulders of mister Rugg of Pentonville General Agent Accountant and Recoverer of Debts Alighting on his feet he took Clennam by the button hole led him behind the pump and pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers mister Rugg also pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers Stay said Clennam in a whisper You have made a discovery mister Pancks answered with an unction which there is no language to convey We rather think so Does it implicate any one How implicate sir In any suppression or wrong dealing of any kind Not a bit of it Thank God said Clennam to himself Now show me You are to understand snorted Pancks feverishly unfolding papers and speaking in short high pressure blasts of sentences Where s the Pedigree Where s Schedule number four mister Rugg Oh all right Here we are You are to understand that we are this very day virtually complete We shan t be legally for a day or two Call it at the outside a week We ve been at it night and day for I don t know how long mister Rugg you know how long Never mind Don t say You ll only confuse me You shall tell her mister Clennam Not till we give you leave Where s that rough total mister Rugg Oh Here we are There sir That s what you ll have to break to her That man s your Father of the Marshalsea CHAPTER thirty three missus Merdle s Complaint Resigning herself to inevitable fate by making the best of those people the Miggleses and submitting her philosophy to the draught upon it of which she had foreseen the likelihood in her interview with Arthur missus Gowan handsomely resolved not to oppose her son s marriage In her progress to and happy arrival at this resolution she was possibly influenced not only by her maternal affections but by three politic considerations Of these the first may have been that her son had never signified the smallest intention to ask her consent or any mistrust of his ability to dispense with it the second that the pension bestowed upon her by a grateful country and a Barnacle would be freed from any little filial inroads when her Henry should be married to the darling only child of a man in very easy circumstances the third that Henry s debts must clearly be paid down upon the altar railing by his father in law When to these three fold points of prudence there is added the fact that missus Gowan yielded her consent the moment she knew of mister Meagles having yielded his and that mister Meagles s objection to the marriage had been the sole obstacle in its way all along it becomes the height of probability that the relict of the deceased Commissioner of nothing particular turned these ideas in her sagacious mind Among her connections and acquaintances however she maintained her individual dignity and the dignity of the blood of the Barnacles by diligently nursing the pretence that it was a most unfortunate business that she was sadly cut up by it that this was a perfect fascination under which Henry laboured that she had opposed it for a long time but what could a mother do and the like She had already called Arthur Clennam to bear witness to this fable as a friend of the Meagles family and she followed up the move by now impounding the family itself for the same purpose In the first interview she accorded to mister Meagles she slided herself into the position of disconsolately but gracefully yielding to irresistible pressure With the utmost politeness and good breeding she feigned that it was she not he who had made the difficulty and who at length gave way and that the sacrifice was hers not his The same feint with the same polite dexterity she foisted on missus Meagles as a conjuror might have forced a card on that innocent lady and when her future daughter in law was presented to her by her son she said on embracing her My dear what have you done to Henry that has bewitched him so at the same time allowing a few tears to carry before them in little pills the cosmetic powder on her nose as a delicate but touching signal that she suffered much inwardly for the show of composure with which she bore her misfortune Among the friends of missus Gowan who piqued herself at once on being Society and on maintaining intimate and easy relations with that Power missus Merdle occupied a front row True the Hampton Court Bohemians without exception turned up their noses at Merdle as an upstart but they turned them down again by falling flat on their faces to worship his wealth In which compensating adjustment of their noses they were pretty much like Treasury Bar and Bishop and all the rest of them To missus Merdle missus Gowan repaired on a visit of self condolence after having given the gracious consent aforesaid She drove into town for the purpose in a one horse carriage irreverently called at that period of English history a pill box It belonged to a job master in a small way who drove it himself and who jobbed it by the day or hour to most of the old ladies in Hampton Court Palace but it was a point of ceremony in that encampment that the whole equipage should be tacitly regarded as the private property of the jobber for the time being and that the job master should betray personal knowledge of nobody but the jobber in possession So the Circumlocution Barnacles who were the largest job masters in the universe always pretended to know of no other job but the job immediately in hand missus Merdle was at home and was in her nest of crimson and gold with the parrot on a neighbouring stem watching her with his head on one side as if he took her for another splendid parrot of a larger species To whom entered missus Gowan with her favourite green fan which softened the light on the spots of bloom My dear soul said missus Gowan tapping the back of her friend s hand with this fan after a little indifferent conversation you are my only comfort That affair of Henry s that I told you of is to take place Now how does it strike you I am dying to know because you represent and express Society so well missus Merdle reviewed the bosom which Society was accustomed to review and having ascertained that show window of mister Merdle s and the London jewellers to be in good order replied As to marriage on the part of a man my dear Society requires that he should retrieve his fortunes by marriage Society requires that he should gain by marriage Society requires that he should found a handsome establishment by marriage Society does not see otherwise what he has to do with marriage Bird be quiet For the parrot on his cage above them presiding over the conference as if he were a judge and indeed he looked rather like one had wound up the exposition with a shriek Cases there are said missus Merdle delicately crooking the little finger of her favourite hand and making her remarks neater by that neat action cases there are where a man is not young or elegant and is rich and has a handsome establishment already Those are of a different kind In such cases missus Merdle shrugged her snowy shoulders and put her hand upon the jewel stand checking a little cough as though to add why a man looks out for this sort of thing my dear Then the parrot shrieked again and she put up her glass to look at him and said Bird Do be quiet But young men resumed missus Merdle and by young men you know what I mean my love I mean people s sons who have the world before them they must place themselves in a better position towards Society by marriage or Society really will not have any patience with their making fools of themselves Dreadfully worldly all this sounds said missus Merdle leaning back in her nest and putting up her glass again does it not But it is true said missus Gowan with a highly moral air My dear it is not to be disputed for a moment returned missus Merdle because Society has made up its mind on the subject and there is nothing more to be said If we were in a more primitive state if we lived under roofs of leaves and kept cows and sheep and creatures instead of banker s accounts which would be delicious my dear I am pastoral to a degree by nature well and good But we don t live under leaves and keep cows and sheep and creatures I perfectly exhaust myself sometimes in pointing out the distinction to Edmund Sparkler missus Gowan looking over her green fan when this young gentleman s name was mentioned replied as follows My love you know the wretched state of the country those unfortunate concessions of John Barnacle s and you therefore know the reasons for my being as poor as Thingummy A church mouse missus Merdle suggested with a smile I was thinking of the other proverbial church person Job said missus Gowan Either will do It would be idle to disguise consequently that there is a wide difference between the position of your son and mine I may add too that Henry has talent Which Edmund certainly has not said missus Merdle with the greatest suavity and that his talent combined with disappointment missus Gowan went on has led him into a pursuit which ah dear me You know my dear Such being Henry s different position the question is what is the most inferior class of marriage to which I can reconcile myself missus Merdle was so much engaged with the contemplation of her arms beautiful formed arms and the very thing for bracelets that she omitted to reply for a while Roused at length by the silence she folded the arms and with admirable presence of mind looked her friend full in the face and said interrogatively Ye es And then And then my dear said missus Gowan not quite so sweetly as before I should be glad to hear what you have to say to it Here the parrot who had been standing on one leg since he screamed last burst into a fit of laughter bobbed himself derisively up and down on both legs and finished by standing on one leg again and pausing for a reply with his head as much awry as he could possibly twist it Sounds mercenary to ask what the gentleman is to get with the lady said missus Merdle but Society is perhaps a little mercenary you know my dear From what I can make out said missus Gowan I believe I may say that Henry will be relieved from debt Much in debt asked missus Merdle through her eyeglass Why tolerably I should think said missus Gowan Meaning the usual thing I understand just so missus Merdle observed in a comfortable sort of way And that the father will make them an allowance of three hundred a year or perhaps altogether something more which in Italy Oh Going to Italy said missus Merdle For Henry to study You need be at no loss to guess why my dear That dreadful Art True missus Merdle hastened to spare the feelings of her afflicted friend She understood Say no more And that said missus Gowan shaking her despondent head that s all That repeated missus Gowan furling her green fan for the moment and tapping her chin with it it was on the way to being a double chin might be called a chin and a half at present that s all On the death of the old people I suppose there will be more to come but how it may be restricted or locked up I don t know And as to that they may live for ever My dear they are just the kind of people to do it Now missus Merdle who really knew her friend Society pretty well and who knew what Society s mothers were and what Society s daughters were and what Society s matrimonial market was and how prices ruled in it and what scheming and counter scheming took place for the high buyers and what bargaining and huckstering went on thought in the depths of her capacious bosom that this was a sufficiently good catch Knowing however what was expected of her and perceiving the exact nature of the fiction to be nursed she took it delicately in her arms and put her required contribution of gloss upon it And that is all my dear said she heaving a friendly sigh Well well The fault is not yours You have nothing to reproach yourself with You must exercise the strength of mind for which you are renowned and make the best of it The girl s family have made said missus Gowan of course the most strenuous endeavours to as the lawyers say to have and to hold Henry Of course they have my dear said missus Merdle I have persisted in every possible objection and have worried myself morning noon and night for means to detach Henry from the connection No doubt you have my dear said missus Merdle And all of no use All has broken down beneath me Now tell me my love Am I justified in at last yielding my most reluctant consent to Henry s marrying among people not in Society or have I acted with inexcusable weakness In answer to this direct appeal missus Merdle assured missus Gowan speaking as a Priestess of Society that she was highly to be commended that she was much to be sympathised with that she had taken the highest of parts and had come out of the furnace refined And missus Gowan who of course saw through her own threadbare blind perfectly and who knew that missus Merdle saw through it perfectly and who knew that Society would see through it perfectly came out of this form notwithstanding as she had gone into it with immense complacency and gravity The conference was held at four or five o clock in the afternoon when all the region of Harley Street Cavendish Square was resonant of carriage wheels and double knocks It had reached this point when mister Merdle came home from his daily occupation of causing the British name to be more and more respected in all parts of the civilised globe capable of the appreciation of world wide commercial enterprise and gigantic combinations of skill and capital For though nobody knew with the least precision what mister Merdle s business was except that it was to coin money these were the terms in which everybody defined it on all ceremonious occasions and which it was the last new polite reading of the parable of the camel and the needle s eye to accept without inquiry For a gentleman who had this splendid work cut out for him mister Merdle looked a little common and rather as if in the course of his vast transactions he had accidentally made an interchange of heads with some inferior spirit He presented himself before the two ladies in the course of a dismal stroll through his mansion which had no apparent object but escape from the presence of the chief butler I beg your pardon he said stopping short in confusion I didn t know there was anybody here but the parrot However as missus Merdle said You can come in and as missus Gowan said she was just going and had already risen to take her leave he came in and stood looking out at a distant window with his hands crossed under his uneasy coat cuffs clasping his wrists as if he were taking himself into custody In this attitude he fell directly into a reverie from which he was only aroused by his wife s calling to him from her ottoman when they had been for some quarter of an hour alone Eh Yes said mister Merdle turning towards her What is it What is it repeated missus Merdle It is I suppose that you have not heard a word of my complaint Your complaint missus Merdle said mister Merdle I didn t know that you were suffering from a complaint What complaint A complaint of you said missus Merdle Oh A complaint of me said mister Merdle What is the what have I what may you have to complain of in me missus Merdle In his withdrawing abstracted pondering way it took him some time to shape this question As a kind of faint attempt to convince himself that he was the master of the house he concluded by presenting his forefinger to the parrot who expressed his opinion on that subject by instantly driving his bill into it You were saying missus Merdle said mister Merdle with his wounded finger in his mouth that you had a complaint against me A complaint which I could scarcely show the justice of more emphatically than by having to repeat it said missus Merdle I might as well have stated it to the wall I had far better have stated it to the bird He would at least have screamed You don t want me to scream missus Merdle I suppose said mister Merdle taking a chair Indeed I don t know retorted missus Merdle but that you had better do that than be so moody and distraught One would at least know that you were sensible of what was going on around you A man might scream and yet not be that missus Merdle said mister Merdle heavily And might be dogged as you are at present without screaming returned missus Merdle That s very true If you wish to know the complaint I make against you it is in so many plain words that you really ought not to go into Society unless you can accommodate yourself to Society mister Merdle so twisting his hands into what hair he had upon his head that he seemed to lift himself up by it as he started out of his chair cried Why in the name of all the infernal powers missus Merdle who does more for Society than I do Do you see these premises missus Merdle Do you see this furniture missus Merdle Do you look in the glass and see yourself missus Merdle Do you know the cost of all this and who it s all provided for And yet will you tell me that I oughtn t to go into Society I who shower money upon it in this way I who might always be said to to to harness myself to a watering cart full of money and go about saturating Society every day of my life Pray don t be violent mister Merdle said missus Merdle Violent said mister Merdle You are enough to make me desperate You don t know half of what I do to accommodate Society You don t know anything of the sacrifices I make for it I know returned missus Merdle that you receive the best in the land I know that you move in the whole Society of the country And I believe I know indeed not to make any ridiculous pretence about it I know I know who sustains you in it mister Merdle missus Merdle retorted that gentleman wiping his dull red and yellow face I know that as well as you do If you were not an ornament to Society and if I was not a benefactor to Society you and I would never have come together When I say a benefactor to it I mean a person who provides it with all sorts of expensive things to eat and drink and look at But to tell me that I am not fit for it after all I have done for it after all I have done for it repeated mister Merdle with a wild emphasis that made his wife lift up her eyelids after all all to tell me I have no right to mix with it after all is a pretty reward I say answered missus Merdle composedly that you ought to make yourself fit for it by being more degage and less preoccupied There is a positive vulgarity in carrying your business affairs about with you as you do How do I carry them about missus Merdle asked mister Merdle How do you carry them about said missus Merdle Look at yourself in the glass mister Merdle involuntarily turned his eyes in the direction of the nearest mirror and asked with a slow determination of his turbid blood to his temples whether a man was to be called to account for his digestion You have a physician said missus Merdle He does me no good said mister Merdle missus Merdle changed her ground Besides said she your digestion is nonsense I don t speak of your digestion I speak of your manner missus Merdle returned her husband I look to you for that You supply manner and I supply money I don t expect you said missus Merdle reposing easily among her cushions to captivate people I don t want you to take any trouble upon yourself or to try to be fascinating I simply request you to care about nothing or seem to care about nothing as everybody else does Do I ever say I care about anything asked mister Merdle Say No Nobody would attend to you if you did But you show it Show what What do I show demanded mister Merdle hurriedly I have already told you You show that you carry your business cares an projects about instead of leaving them in the City or wherever else they belong to said missus Merdle Or seeming to Seeming would be quite enough I ask no more Whereas you couldn t be more occupied with your day s calculations and combinations than you habitually show yourself to be if you were a carpenter A carpenter repeated mister Merdle checking something like a groan I shouldn t so much mind being a carpenter missus Merdle And my complaint is pursued the lady disregarding the low remark that it is not the tone of Society and that you ought to correct it mister Merdle If you have any doubt of my judgment ask even Edmund Sparkler The door of the room had opened and missus Merdle now surveyed the head of her son through her glass Edmund we want you here mister Sparkler who had merely put in his head and looked round the room without entering as if he were searching the house for that young lady with no nonsense about her upon this followed up his head with his body and stood before them To whom in a few easy words adapted to his capacity missus Merdle stated the question at issue The young gentleman after anxiously feeling his shirt collar as if it were his pulse and he were hypochondriacal observed That he had heard it noticed by fellers Edmund Sparkler has heard it noticed said missus Merdle with languid triumph Why no doubt everybody has heard it noticed Which in truth was no unreasonable inference seeing that mister Sparkler would probably be the last person in any assemblage of the human species to receive an impression from anything that passed in his presence And Edmund Sparkler will tell you I dare say said missus Merdle waving her favourite hand towards her husband how he has heard it noticed I couldn t said mister Sparkler after feeling his pulse as before couldn t undertake to say what led to it cause memory desperate loose But being in company with the brother of a doosed fine gal well educated too with no biggodd nonsense about her at the period alluded to There Never mind the sister remarked missus Merdle a little impatiently What did the brother say Didn t say a word ma am answered mister Sparkler As silent a feller as myself Equally hard up for a remark Somebody said something returned missus Merdle Never mind who it was Assure you I don t in the least said mister Sparkler But tell us what it was mister Sparkler referred to his pulse again and put himself through some severe mental discipline before he replied Fellers referring to my Governor expression not my own occasionally compliment my Governor in a very handsome way on being immensely rich and knowing perfect phenomenon of Buyer and Banker and that but say the Shop sits heavily on him Say he carried the Shop about on his back rather like Jew clothesmen with too much business Which said missus Merdle rising with her floating drapery about her is exactly my complaint Edmund give me your arm up stairs mister Merdle left alone to meditate on a better conformation of himself to Society looked out of nine windows in succession and appeared to see nine wastes of space When he had thus entertained himself he went down stairs and looked intently at all the carpets on the ground floor and then came up stairs again and looked intently at all the carpets on the first floor as if they were gloomy depths in unison with his oppressed soul Through all the rooms he wandered as he always did like the last person on earth who had any business to approach them Let missus Merdle announce with all her might that she was at Home ever so many nights in a season she could not announce more widely and unmistakably than mister Merdle did that he was never at home At last he met the chief butler the sight of which splendid retainer always finished him Extinguished by this great creature he sneaked to his dressing room and there remained shut up until he rode out to dinner with missus Merdle in her own handsome chariot At dinner he was envied and flattered as a being of might was Treasuried Barred and Bishoped as much as he would and an hour after midnight came home alone and being instantly put out again in his own hall like a rushlight by the chief butler went sighing to bed CHAPTER thirty four A Shoal of Barnacles mister Henry Gowan and the dog were established frequenters of the cottage and the day was fixed for the wedding There was to be a convocation of Barnacles on the occasion in order that that very high and very large family might shed as much lustre on the marriage as so dim an event was capable of receiving To have got the whole Barnacle family together would have been impossible for two reasons Firstly because no building could have held all the members and connections of that illustrious house Secondly because wherever there was a square yard of ground in British occupation under the sun or moon with a public post upon it sticking to that post was a Barnacle No intrepid navigator could plant a flag staff upon any spot of earth and take possession of it in the British name but to that spot of earth so soon as the discovery was known the Circumlocution Office sent out a Barnacle and a despatch box Thus the Barnacles were all over the world in every direction despatch boxing the compass But while the so potent art of Prospero himself would have failed in summoning the Barnacles from every speck of ocean and dry land on which there was nothing except mischief to be done and anything to be pocketed it was perfectly feasible to assemble a good many Barnacles This missus Gowan applied herself to do calling on mister Meagles frequently with new additions to the list and holding conferences with that gentleman when he was not engaged as he generally was at this period in examining and paying the debts of his future son in law in the apartment of scales and scoops One marriage guest there was in reference to whose presence mister Meagles felt a nearer interest and concern than in the attendance of the most elevated Barnacle expected though he was far from insensible of the honour of having such company This guest was Clennam But Clennam had made a promise he held sacred among the trees that summer night and in the chivalry of his heart regarded it as binding him to many implied obligations In forgetfulness of himself and delicate service to her on all occasions he was never to fail to begin it he answered mister Meagles cheerfully I shall come of course His partner Daniel Doyce was something of a stumbling block in mister Meagles s way the worthy gentleman being not at all clear in his own anxious mind but that the mingling of Daniel with official Barnacleism might produce some explosive combination even at a marriage breakfast The national offender however lightened him of his uneasiness by coming down to Twickenham to represent that he begged with the freedom of an old friend and as a favour to one that he might not be invited For said he as my business with this set of gentlemen was to do a public duty and a public service and as their business with me was to prevent it by wearing my soul out I think we had better not eat and drink together with a show of being of one mind mister Meagles was much amused by his friend s oddity and patronised him with a more protecting air of allowance than usual when he rejoined Well well Dan you shall have your own crotchety way To mister Henry Gowan as the time approached Clennam tried to convey by all quiet and unpretending means that he was frankly and disinterestedly desirous of tendering him any friendship he would accept mister Gowan treated him in return with his usual ease and with his usual show of confidence which was no confidence at all You see Clennam he happened to remark in the course of conversation one day when they were walking near the Cottage within a week of the marriage I am a disappointed man That you know already Upon my word said Clennam a little embarrassed I scarcely know how Why returned Gowan I belong to a clan or a clique or a family or a connection or whatever you like to call it that might have provided for me in any one of fifty ways and that took it into its head not to do it at all So here I am a poor devil of an artist Clennam was beginning But on the other hand when Gowan took him up Yes yes I know I have the good fortune of being beloved by a beautiful and charming girl whom I love with all my heart Is there much of it Clennam thought And as he thought it felt ashamed of himself And of finding a father in law who is a capital fellow and a liberal good old boy Still I had other prospects washed and combed into my childish head when it was washed and combed for me and I took them to a public school when I washed and combed it for myself and I am here without them and thus I am a disappointed man Clennam thought and as he thought it again felt ashamed of himself was this notion of being disappointed in life an assertion of station which the bridegroom brought into the family as his property having already carried it detrimentally into his pursuit And was it a hopeful or a promising thing anywhere Not bitterly disappointed I think he said aloud Hang it no not bitterly laughed Gowan My people are not worth that though they are charming fellows and I have the greatest affection for them Besides it s pleasant to show them that I can do without them and that they may all go to the Devil And besides again most men are disappointed in life somehow or other and influenced by their disappointment But it s a dear good world and I love it It lies fair before you now said Arthur Fair as this summer river cried the other with enthusiasm and by Jove I glow with admiration of it and with ardour to run a race in it It s the best of old worlds And my calling The best of old callings isn t it Full of interest and ambition I conceive said Clennam And imposition added Gowan laughing we won t leave out the imposition I hope I may not break down in that but there my being a disappointed man may show itself I may not be able to face it out gravely enough Between you and me I think there is some danger of my being just enough soured not to be able to do that To do what asked Clennam To keep it up To help myself in my turn as the man before me helps himself in his and pass the bottle of smoke To keep up the pretence as to labour and study and patience and being devoted to my art and giving up many solitary days to it and abandoning many pleasures for it and living in it and all the rest of it in short to pass the bottle of smoke according to rule But it is well for a man to respect his own vocation whatever it is and to think himself bound to uphold it and to claim for it the respect it deserves is it not Arthur reasoned And your vocation Gowan may really demand this suit and service I confess I should have thought that all Art did What a good fellow you are Clennam exclaimed the other stopping to look at him as if with irrepressible admiration What a capital fellow You have never been disappointed That s easy to see It would have been so cruel if he had meant it that Clennam firmly resolved to believe he did not mean it Gowan without pausing laid his hand upon his shoulder and laughingly and lightly went on Clennam I don t like to dispel your generous visions and I would give any money if I had any to live in such a rose coloured mist But what I do in my trade I do to sell What all we fellows do we do to sell If we didn t want to sell it for the most we can get for it we shouldn t do it Being work it has to be done but it s easily enough done All the rest is hocus pocus Now here s one of the advantages or disadvantages of knowing a disappointed man You hear the truth Whatever he had heard and whether it deserved that name or another it sank into Clennam s mind It so took root there that he began to fear Henry Gowan would always be a trouble to him and that so far he had gained little or nothing from the dismissal of Nobody with all his inconsistencies anxieties and contradictions He found a contest still always going on in his breast between his promise to keep Gowan in none but good aspects before the mind of mister Meagles and his enforced observation of Gowan in aspects that had no good in them Nor could he quite support his own conscientious nature against misgivings that he distorted and discoloured himself by reminding himself that he never sought those discoveries and that he would have avoided them with willingness and great relief For he never could forget what he had been and he knew that he had once disliked Gowan for no better reason than that he had come in his way Harassed by these thoughts he now began to wish the marriage over Gowan and his young wife gone and himself left to fulfil his promise and discharge the generous function he had accepted This last week was in truth an uneasy interval for the whole house Before Pet or before Gowan mister Meagles was radiant but Clennam had more than once found him alone with his view of the scales and scoop much blurred and had often seen him look after the lovers in the garden or elsewhere when he was not seen by them with the old clouded face on which Gowan had fallen like a shadow In the arrangement of the house for the great occasion many little reminders of the old travels of the father and mother and daughter had to be disturbed and passed from hand to hand and sometimes in the midst of these mute witnesses to the life they had had together even Pet herself would yield to lamenting and weeping missus Meagles the blithest and busiest of mothers went about singing and cheering everybody but she honest soul had her flights into store rooms where she would cry until her eyes were red and would then come out attributing that appearance to pickled onions and pepper and singing clearer than ever missus Tickit finding no balsam for a wounded mind in Buchan s Domestic Medicine suffered greatly from low spirits and from moving recollections of Minnie s infancy When the latter was powerful with her she usually sent up secret messages importing that she was not in parlour condition as to her attire and that she solicited a sight of her child in the kitchen there she would bless her child s face and bless her child s heart and hug her child in a medley of tears and congratulations chopping boards rolling pins and pie crust with the tenderness of an old attached servant which is a very pretty tenderness indeed But all days come that are to be and the marriage day was to be and it came and with it came all the Barnacles who were bidden to the feast There was mister Tite Barnacle from the Circumlocution Office and Mews Street Grosvenor Square with the expensive missus Tite Barnacle NEE Stiltstalking who made the Quarter Days so long in coming and the three expensive Miss Tite Barnacles double loaded with accomplishments and ready to go off and yet not going off with the sharpness of flash and bang that might have been expected but rather hanging fire There was Barnacle junior also from the Circumlocution Office leaving the Tonnage of the country which he was somehow supposed to take under his protection to look after itself and sooth to say not at all impairing the efficiency of its protection by leaving it alone There was the engaging Young Barnacle deriving from the sprightly side of the family also from the Circumlocution Office gaily and agreeably helping the occasion along and treating it in his sparkling way as one of the official forms and fees of the Church Department of How not to do it There were three other Young Barnacles from three other offices insipid to all the senses and terribly in want of seasoning doing the marriage as they would have done the Nile Old Rome the new singer or Jerusalem But there was greater game than this There was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself in the odour of Circumlocution with the very smell of Despatch Boxes upon him Yes there was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle who had risen to official heights on the wings of one indignant idea and that was My Lords that I am yet to be told that it behoves a Minister of this free country to set bounds to the philanthropy to cramp the charity to fetter the public spirit to contract the enterprise to damp the independent self reliance of its people That was in other words that this great statesman was always yet to be told that it behoved the Pilot of the ship to do anything but prosper in the private loaf and fish trade ashore the crew being able by dint of hard pumping to keep the ship above water without him On this sublime discovery in the great art How not to do it Lord Decimus had long sustained the highest glory of the Barnacle family and let any ill advised member of either House but try How to do it by bringing in a Bill to do it that Bill was as good as dead and buried when Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle rose up in his place and solemnly said soaring into indignant majesty as the Circumlocution cheering soared around him that he was yet to be told My Lords that it behoved him as the Minister of this free country to set bounds to the philanthropy to cramp the charity to fetter the public spirit to contract the enterprise to damp the independent self reliance of its people The discovery of this Behoving Machine was the discovery of the political perpetual motion It never wore out though it was always going round and round in all the State Departments And there with his noble friend and relative Lord Decimus was William Barnacle who had made the ever famous coalition with Tudor Stiltstalking and who always kept ready his own particular recipe for How not to do it sometimes tapping the Speaker and drawing it fresh out of him with a First I will beg you sir to inform the House what Precedent we have for the course into which the honourable gentleman would precipitate us sometimes asking the honourable gentleman to favour him with his own version of the Precedent sometimes telling the honourable gentleman that he William Barnacle would search for a Precedent and oftentimes crushing the honourable gentleman flat on the spot by telling him there was no Precedent But Precedent and Precipitate were under all circumstances the well matched pair of battle horses of this able Circumlocutionist No matter that the unhappy honourable gentleman had been trying in vain for twenty five years to precipitate William Barnacle into this William Barnacle still put it to the House and at second hand or so to the country whether he was to be precipitated into this No matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could possibly produce a Precedent for this William Barnacle would nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer and would close with him upon that issue and would tell him to his teeth that there Was NO Precedent for this It might perhaps have been objected that the William Barnacle wisdom was not high wisdom or the earth it bamboozled would never have been made or if made in a rash mistake would have remained blank mud But Precedent and Precipitate together frightened all objection out of most people And there too was another Barnacle a lively one who had leaped through twenty places in quick succession and was always in two or three at once and who was the much respected inventor of an art which he practised with great success and admiration in all Barnacle Governments This was when he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic to return an answer on any other It had done immense service and brought him into high esteem with the Circumlocution Office And there too was a sprinkling of less distinguished Parliamentary Barnacles who had not as yet got anything snug and were going through their probation to prove their worthiness These Barnacles perched upon staircases and hid in passages waiting their orders to make houses or not to make houses and they did all their hearing and ohing and cheering and barking under directions from the heads of the family and they put dummy motions on the paper in the way of other men s motions and they stalled disagreeable subjects off until late in the night and late in the session and then with virtuous patriotism cried out that it was too late and they went down into the country whenever they were sent and swore that Lord Decimus had revived trade from a swoon and commerce from a fit and had doubled the harvest of corn quadrupled the harvest of hay and prevented no end of gold from flying out of the Bank Also these Barnacles were dealt by the heads of the family like so many cards below the court cards to public meetings and dinners where they bore testimony to all sorts of services on the part of their noble and honourable relatives and buttered the Barnacles on all sorts of toasts And they stood under similar orders at all sorts of elections and they turned out of their own seats on the shortest notice and the most unreasonable terms to let in other men and they fetched and carried and toadied and jobbed and corrupted and ate heaps of dirt and were indefatigable in the public service And there was not a list in all the Circumlocution Office of places that might fall vacant anywhere within half a century from a lord of the Treasury to a Chinese consul and up again to a governor general of India but as applicants for such places the names of some or of every one of these hungry and adhesive Barnacles were down It was necessarily but a sprinkling of any class of Barnacles that attended the marriage for there were not two score in all and what is that subtracted from Legion But the sprinkling was a swarm in the Twickenham cottage and filled it A Barnacle assisted by a Barnacle married the happy pair and it behoved Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself to conduct missus Meagles to breakfast The entertainment was not as agreeable and natural as it might have been mister Meagles hove down by his good company while he highly appreciated it was not himself missus Gowan was herself and that did not improve him The fiction that it was not mister Meagles who had stood in the way but that it was the Family greatness and that the Family greatness had made a concession and there was now a soothing unanimity pervaded the affair though it was never openly expressed Then the Barnacles felt that they for their parts would have done with the Meagleses when the present patronising occasion was over and the Meagleses felt the same for their parts Then Gowan asserting his rights as a disappointed man who had his grudge against the family and who perhaps had allowed his mother to have them there as much in the hope it might give them some annoyance as with any other benevolent object aired his pencil and his poverty ostentatiously before them and told them he hoped in time to settle a crust of bread and cheese on his wife and that he begged such of them as more fortunate than himself came in for any good thing and could buy a picture to please to remember the poor painter Then Lord Decimus who was a wonder on his own Parliamentary pedestal turned out to be the windiest creature here proposing happiness to the bride and bridegroom in a series of platitudes that would have made the hair of any sincere disciple and believer stand on end and trotting with the complacency of an idiotic elephant among howling labyrinths of sentences which he seemed to take for high roads and never so much as wanted to get out of Then mister Tite Barnacle could not but feel that there was a person in company who would have disturbed his life long sitting to Sir Thomas Lawrence in full official character if such disturbance had been possible while Barnacle junior did with indignation communicate to two vapid gentlemen his relatives that there was a feller here look here who had come to our Department without an appointment and said he wanted to know you know and that look here if he was to break out now as he might you know for you never could tell what an ungentlemanly Radical of that sort would be up to next and was to say look here that he wanted to know this moment you know that would be jolly wouldn t it The pleasantest part of the occasion by far to Clennam was the painfullest When mister and missus Meagles at last hung about Pet in the room with the two pictures where the company were not before going with her to the threshold which she could never recross to be the old Pet and the old delight nothing could be more natural and simple than the three were Gowan himself was touched and answered mister Meagles s O Gowan take care of her take care of her with an earnest Don t be so broken hearted sir By Heaven I will And so with the last sobs and last loving words and a last look to Clennam of confidence in his promise Pet fell back in the carriage and her husband waved his hand and they were away for Dover though not until the faithful missus Tickit in her silk gown and jet black curls had rushed out from some hiding place and thrown both her shoes after the carriage an apparition which occasioned great surprise to the distinguished company at the windows The said company being now relieved from further attendance and the chief Barnacles being rather hurried for they had it in hand just then to send a mail or two which was in danger of going straight to its destination beating about the seas like the Flying Dutchman and to arrange with complexity for the stoppage of a good deal of important business otherwise in peril of being done went their several ways with all affability conveying to mister and missus Meagles that general assurance that what they had been doing there they had been doing at a sacrifice for mister and missus Meagles s good which they always conveyed to mister John Bull in their official condescension to that most unfortunate creature A miserable blank remained in the house and in the hearts of the father and mother and Clennam mister Meagles called only one remembrance to his aid that really did him good It s very gratifying Arthur he said after all to look back upon The past said Clennam Yes but I mean the company It had made him much more low and unhappy at the time but now it really did him good It s very gratifying he said often repeating the remark in the course of the evening Such high company CHAPTER thirty five What was behind mister Pancks on Little Dorrit s Hand It was at this time that mister Pancks in discharge of his compact with Clennam revealed to him the whole of his gipsy story and told him Little Dorrit s fortune Her father was heir at law to a great estate that had long lain unknown of unclaimed and accumulating His right was now clear nothing interposed in his way the Marshalsea gates stood open the Marshalsea walls were down a few flourishes of his pen and he was extremely rich In his tracking out of the claim to its complete establishment mister Pancks had shown a sagacity that nothing could baffle and a patience and secrecy that nothing could tire I little thought sir said Pancks when you and I crossed Smithfield that night and I told you what sort of a Collector I was that this would come of it I little thought sir when I told you you were not of the Clennams of Cornwall that I was ever going to tell you who were of the Dorrits of Dorsetshire He then went on to detail How having that name recorded in his note book he was first attracted by the name alone How having often found two exactly similar names even belonging to the same place to involve no traceable consanguinity near or distant he did not at first give much heed to this except in the way of speculation as to what a surprising change would be made in the condition of a little seamstress if she could be shown to have any interest in so large a property How he rather supposed himself to have pursued the idea into its next degree because there was something uncommon in the quiet little seamstress which pleased him and provoked his curiosity How he had felt his way inch by inch and Moled it out sir that was mister Pancks s expression grain by grain How in the beginning of the labour described by this new verb and to render which the more expressive mister Pancks shut his eyes in pronouncing it and shook his hair over them he had alternated from sudden lights and hopes to sudden darkness and no hopes and back again and back again How he had made acquaintances in the Prison expressly that he might come and go there as all other comers and goers did and how his first ray of light was unconsciously given him by mister Dorrit himself and by his son to both of whom he easily became known with both of whom he talked much casually but always Moleing you ll observe said mister Pancks and from whom he derived without being at all suspected two or three little points of family history which as he began to hold clues of his own suggested others How it had at length become plain to mister Pancks that he had made a real discovery of the heir at law to a great fortune and that his discovery had but to be ripened to legal fulness and perfection How he had thereupon sworn his landlord mister Rugg to secrecy in a solemn manner and taken him into Moleing partnership How they had employed John Chivery as their sole clerk and agent seeing to whom he was devoted And how until the present hour when authorities mighty in the Bank and learned in the law declared their successful labours ended they had confided in no other human being So if the whole thing had broken down sir concluded Pancks at the very last say the day before the other day when I showed you our papers in the Prison yard or say that very day nobody but ourselves would have been cruelly disappointed or a penny the worse Clennam who had been almost incessantly shaking hands with him throughout the narrative was reminded by this to say in an amazement which even the preparation he had had for the main disclosure smoothed down My dear mister Pancks this must have cost you a great sum of money Pretty well sir said the triumphant Pancks No trifle though we did it as cheap as it could be done And the outlay was a difficulty let me tell you A difficulty repeated Clennam But the difficulties you have so wonderfully conquered in the whole business shaking his hand again I ll tell you how I did it said the delighted Pancks putting his hair into a condition as elevated as himself First I spent all I had of my own That wasn t much I am sorry for it said Clennam not that it matters now though Then what did you do Then answered Pancks I borrowed a sum of my proprietor Of mister Casby said Clennam He s a fine old fellow Noble old boy an t he said mister Pancks entering on a series of the dryest snorts Generous old buck Confiding old boy Philanthropic old buck Benevolent old boy Twenty per cent I engaged to pay him sir But we never do business for less at our shop Arthur felt an awkward consciousness of having in his exultant condition been a little premature I said to that boiling over old Christian mister Pancks pursued appearing greatly to relish this descriptive epithet that I had got a little project on hand a hopeful one I told him a hopeful one which wanted a certain small capital I proposed to him to lend me the money on my note Which he did at twenty sticking the twenty on in a business like way and putting it into the note to look like a part of the principal If I had broken down after that I should have been his grubber for the next seven years at half wages and double grind But he s a perfect Patriarch and it would do a man good to serve him on such terms on any terms Arthur for his life could not have said with confidence whether Pancks really thought so or not When that was gone sir resumed Pancks and it did go though I dribbled it out like so much blood I had taken mister Rugg into the secret I proposed to borrow of mister Rugg or of Miss Rugg it s the same thing she made a little money by a speculation in the Common Pleas once He lent it at ten and thought that pretty high But mister Rugg s a red haired man sir and gets his hair cut And as to the crown of his hat it s high And as to the brim of his hat it s narrow And there s no more benevolence bubbling out of him than out of a ninepin Your own recompense for all this mister Pancks said Clennam ought to be a large one I don t mistrust getting it sir said Pancks I have made no bargain I owed you one on that score now I have paid it Money out of pocket made good time fairly allowed for and mister Rugg s bill settled a thousand pounds would be a fortune to me That matter I place in your hands I authorize you now to break all this to the family in any way you think best Miss Amy Dorrit will be with missus Finching this morning The sooner done the better Can t be done too soon This conversation took place in Clennam s bed room while he was yet in bed For mister Pancks had knocked up the house and made his way in very early in the morning and without once sitting down or standing still had delivered himself of the whole of his details illustrated with a variety of documents at the bedside He now said he would go and look up mister Rugg from whom his excited state of mind appeared to require another back and bundling up his papers and exchanging one more hearty shake of the hand with Clennam he went at full speed down stairs and steamed off Clennam of course resolved to go direct to mister Casby s He dressed and got out so quickly that he found himself at the corner of the patriarchal street nearly an hour before her time but he was not sorry to have the opportunity of calming himself with a leisurely walk When he returned to the street and had knocked at the bright brass knocker he was informed that she had come and was shown up stairs to Flora s breakfast room Little Dorrit was not there herself but Flora was and testified the greatest amazement at seeing him Good gracious Arthur Doyce and Clennam cried that lady who would have ever thought of seeing such a sight as this and pray excuse a wrapper for upon my word I really never and a faded check too which is worse but our little friend is making me not that I need mind mentioning it to you for you must know that there are such things a skirt and having arranged that a trying on should take place after breakfast is the reason though I wish not so badly starched I ought to make an apology said Arthur for so early and abrupt a visit but you will excuse it when I tell you the cause In times for ever fled Arthur returned missus Finching pray excuse me Doyce and Clennam infinitely more correct and though unquestionably distant still tis distance lends enchantment to the view at least I don t mean that and if I did I suppose it would depend considerably on the nature of the view but I m running on again and you put it all out of my head She glanced at him tenderly and resumed In times for ever fled I was going to say it would have sounded strange indeed for Arthur Clennam Doyce and Clennam naturally quite different to make apologies for coming here at any time but that is past and what is past can never be recalled except in his own case as poor mister F said when he was in spirits Cucumber and therefore never ate it She was making the tea when Arthur came in and now hastily finished that operation Papa she said all mystery and whisper as she shut down the tea pot lid is sitting prosingly breaking his new laid egg in the back parlour over the City article exactly like the Woodpecker Tapping and need never know that you are here and our little friend you are well aware may be fully trusted when she comes down from cutting out on the large table overhead Arthur then told her in the fewest words that it was their little friend he came to see and what he had to announce to their little friend At which astounding intelligence Flora clasped her hands fell into a tremble and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure like the good natured creature she really was For goodness sake let me get out of the way first said Flora putting her hands to her ears and moving towards the door or I know I shall go off dead and screaming and make everybody worse and the dear little thing only this morning looking so nice and neat and good and yet so poor and now a fortune is she really and deserves it too and might I mention it to mister F s Aunt Arthur not Doyce and Clennam for this once or if objectionable not on any account Arthur nodded his free permission since Flora shut out all verbal communication Flora nodded in return to thank him and hurried out of the room Little Dorrit s step was already on the stairs and in another moment she was at the door Do what he could to compose his face he could not convey so much of an ordinary expression into it but that the moment she saw it she dropped her work and cried mister Clennam What s the matter Nothing nothing That is no misfortune has happened I have come to tell you something but it is a piece of great good fortune Good fortune Wonderful fortune They stood in a window and her eyes full of light were fixed upon his face He put an arm about her seeing her likely to sink down She put a hand upon that arm partly to rest upon it and partly so to preserve their relative positions as that her intent look at him should be shaken by no change of attitude in either of them Her lips seemed to repeat Wonderful fortune He repeated it again aloud Dear Little Dorrit Your father The ice of the pale face broke at the word and little lights and shoots of expression passed all over it They were all expressions of pain Her breath was faint and hurried Her heart beat fast He would have clasped the little figure closer but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to be moved Your father can be free within this week He does not know it we must go to him from here to tell him of it Your father will be free within a few days Your father will be free within a few hours Remember we must go to him from here to tell him of it That brought her back Her eyes were closing but they opened again This is not all the good fortune This is not all the wonderful good fortune my dear Little Dorrit Shall I tell you more Her lips shaped Yes Your father will be no beggar when he is free He will want for nothing Shall I tell you more Remember He knows nothing of it we must go to him from here to tell him of it She seemed to entreat him for a little time He held her in his arm and after a pause bent down his ear to listen Did you ask me to go on Yes He will be a rich man He is a rich man A great sum of money is waiting to be paid over to him as his inheritance you are all henceforth very wealthy Bravest and best of children I thank Heaven that you are rewarded As he kissed her she turned her head towards his shoulder and raised her arm towards his neck cried out Father Father Father and swooned away Upon which Flora returned to take care of her and hovered about her on a sofa intermingling kind offices and incoherent scraps of conversation in a manner so confounding that whether she pressed the Marshalsea to take a spoonful of unclaimed dividends for it would do her good or whether she congratulated Little Dorrit s father on coming into possession of a hundred thousand smelling bottles or whether she explained that she put seventy five thousand drops of spirits of lavender on fifty thousand pounds of lump sugar and that she entreated Little Dorrit to take that gentle restorative or whether she bathed the foreheads of Doyce and Clennam in vinegar and gave the late mister F more air no one with any sense of responsibility could have undertaken to decide A tributary stream of confusion moreover poured in from an adjoining bedroom where mister F s Aunt appeared from the sound of her voice to be in a horizontal posture awaiting her breakfast and from which bower that inexorable lady snapped off short taunts whenever she could get a hearing as Don t believe it s his doing and He needn t take no credit to himself for it and It ll be long enough I expect afore he ll give up any of his own money all designed to disparage Clennam s share in the discovery and to relieve those inveterate feelings with which mister F s Aunt regarded him But Little Dorrit s solicitude to get to her father and to carry the joyful tidings to him and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this happiness in store for him and still unknown to him did more for her speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have done Come with me to my dear father Pray come and tell my dear father were the first words she said Her father her father She spoke of nothing but him thought of nothing but him Kneeling down and pouring out her thankfulness with uplifted hands her thanks were for her father Flora s tenderness was quite overcome by this and she launched out among the cups and saucers into a wonderful flow of tears and speech I declare she sobbed I never was so cut up since your mama and my papa not Doyce and Clennam for this once but give the precious little thing a cup of tea and make her put it to her lips at least pray Arthur do not even mister F s last illness for that was of another kind and gout is not a child s affection though very painful for all parties and mister F a martyr with his leg upon a rest and the wine trade in itself inflammatory for they will do it more or less among themselves and who can wonder it seems like a dream I am sure to think of nothing at all this morning and now Mines of money is it really but you must know my darling love because you never will be strong enough to tell him all about it upon teaspoons mightn t it be even best to try the directions of my own medical man for though the flavour is anything but agreeable still I force myself to do it as a prescription and find the benefit you d rather not why no my dear I d rather not but still I do it as a duty everybody will congratulate you some in earnest and some not and many will congratulate you with all their hearts but none more so I do assure you from the bottom of my own I do myself though sensible of blundering and being stupid and will be judged by Arthur not Doyce and Clennam for this once so good bye darling and God bless you and may you be very happy and excuse the liberty vowing that the dress shall never be finished by anybody else but shall be laid by for a keepsake just as it is and called Little Dorrit though why that strangest of denominations at any time I never did myself and now I never shall Thus Flora in taking leave of her favourite Little Dorrit thanked her and embraced her over and over again and finally came out of the house with Clennam and took coach for the Marshalsea It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets with a sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and grandeur When Arthur told her that she would soon ride in her own carriage through very different scenes when all the familiar experiences would have vanished away she looked frightened But when he substituted her father for herself and told her how he would ride in his carriage and how great and grand he would be her tears of joy and innocent pride fell fast Seeing that the happiness her mind could realise was all shining upon him Arthur kept that single figure before her and so they rode brightly through the poor streets in the prison neighbourhood to carry him the great news When mister Chivery who was on duty admitted them into the Lodge he saw something in their faces which filled him with astonishment He stood looking after them when they hurried into the prison as though he perceived that they had come back accompanied by a ghost a piece Two or three Collegians whom they passed looked after them too and presently joining mister Chivery formed a little group on the Lodge steps in the midst of which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the Father was going to get his discharge Within a few minutes it was heard in the remotest room in the College Little Dorrit opened the door from without and they both entered He was sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap in the sunlight by the window reading his newspaper His glasses were in his hand and he had just looked round surprised at first no doubt by her step upon the stairs not expecting her until night surprised again by seeing Arthur Clennam in her company As they came in the same unwonted look in both of them which had already caught attention in the yard below struck him He did not rise or speak but laid down his glasses and his newspaper on the table beside him and looked at them with his mouth a little open and his lips trembling When Arthur put out his hand he touched it but not with his usual state and then he turned to his daughter who had sat down close beside him with her hands upon his shoulder and looked attentively in her face Father I have been made so happy this morning You have been made so happy my dear By mister Clennam father He brought me such joyful and wonderful intelligence about you If he had not with his great kindness and gentleness prepared me for it father prepared me for it father I think I could not have borne it Her agitation was exceedingly great and the tears rolled down her face He put his hand suddenly to his heart and looked at Clennam Compose yourself sir said Clennam and take a little time to think To think of the brightest and most fortunate accidents of life We have all heard of great surprises of joy They are not at an end sir They are rare but not at an end mister Clennam Not at an end Not at an end for He touched himself upon the breast instead of saying me No returned Clennam What surprise he asked keeping his left hand over his heart and there stopping in his speech while with his right hand he put his glasses exactly level on the table what such surprise can be in store for me Let me answer with another question Tell me mister Dorrit what surprise would be the most unlooked for and the most acceptable to you Do not be afraid to imagine it or to say what it would be He looked steadfastly at Clennam and so looking at him seemed to change into a very old haggard man The sun was bright upon the wall beyond the window and on the spikes at top He slowly stretched out the hand that had been upon his heart and pointed at the wall It is down said Clennam Gone He remained in the same attitude looking steadfastly at him And in its place said Clennam slowly and distinctly are the means to possess and enjoy the utmost that they have so long shut out mister Dorrit there is not the smallest doubt that within a few days you will be free and highly prosperous I congratulate you with all my soul on this change of fortune and on the happy future into which you are soon to carry the treasure you have been blest with here the best of all the riches you can have elsewhere the treasure at your side With those words he pressed his hand and released it and his daughter laying her face against his encircled him in the hour of his prosperity with her arms as she had in the long years of his adversity encircled him with her love and toil and truth and poured out her full heart in gratitude hope joy blissful ecstasy and all for him I shall see him as I never saw him yet I shall see my dear love with the dark cloud cleared away I shall see him as my poor mother saw him long ago O my dear my dear O father father O thank God thank God He yielded himself to her kisses and caresses but did not return them except that he put an arm about her Neither did he say one word His steadfast look was now divided between her and Clennam and he began to shake as if he were very cold Explaining to Little Dorrit that he would run to the coffee house for a bottle of wine Arthur fetched it with all the haste he could use While it was being brought from the cellar to the bar a number of excited people asked him what had happened when he hurriedly informed them that mister Dorrit had succeeded to a fortune On coming back with the wine in his hand he found that she had placed her father in his easy chair and had loosened his shirt and neckcloth They filled a tumbler with wine and held it to his lips When he had swallowed a little he took the glass himself and emptied it Soon after that he leaned back in his chair and cried with his handkerchief before his face After this had lasted a while Clennam thought it a good season for diverting his attention from the main surprise by relating its details Slowly therefore and in a quiet tone of voice he explained them as best he could and enlarged on the nature of Pancks s service He shall be ha he shall be handsomely recompensed sir said the Father starting up and moving hurriedly about the room Assure yourself mister Clennam that everybody concerned shall be ha shall be nobly rewarded No one my dear sir shall say that he has an unsatisfied claim against me I shall repay the hum the advances I have had from you sir with peculiar pleasure I beg to be informed at your earliest convenience what advances you have made my son He had no purpose in going about the room but he was not still a moment Everybody he said shall be remembered I will not go away from here in anybody s debt All the people who have been ha well behaved towards myself and my family shall be rewarded Chivery shall be rewarded Young John shall be rewarded I particularly wish and intend to act munificently mister Clennam Will you allow me said Arthur laying his purse on the table to supply any present contingencies mister Dorrit I thought it best to bring a sum of money for the purpose Thank you sir thank you I accept with readiness at the present moment what I could not an hour ago have conscientiously taken I am obliged to you for the temporary accommodation Exceedingly temporary but well timed well timed His hand had closed upon the money and he carried it about with him Be so kind sir as to add the amount to those former advances to which I have already referred being careful if you please not to omit advances made to my son A mere verbal statement of the gross amount is all I shall ha all I shall require His eye fell upon his daughter at this point and he stopped for a moment to kiss her and to pat her head It will be necessary to find a milliner my love and to make a speedy and complete change in your very plain dress Something must be done with Maggy too who at present is ha barely respectable barely respectable And your sister Amy and your brother And my brother your uncle poor soul I trust this will rouse him messengers must be despatched to fetch them They must be informed of this We must break it to them cautiously but they must be informed directly We owe it as a duty to them and to ourselves from this moment not to let them hum not to let them do anything This was the first intimation he had ever given that he was privy to the fact that they did something for a livelihood He was still jogging about the room with the purse clutched in his hand when a great cheering arose in the yard The news has spread already said Clennam looking down from the window Will you show yourself to them mister Dorrit They are very earnest and they evidently wish it I hum ha I confess I could have desired Amy my dear he said jogging about in a more feverish flutter than before to have made some change in my dress first and to have bought a hum a watch and chain But if it must be done as it is it ha it must be done Fasten the collar of my shirt my dear mister Clennam would you oblige me hum with a blue neckcloth you will find in that drawer at your elbow Button my coat across at the chest my love It looks ha it looks broader buttoned With his trembling hand he pushed his grey hair up and then taking Clennam and his daughter for supporters appeared at the window leaning on an arm of each The Collegians cheered him very heartily and he kissed his hand to them with great urbanity and protection When he withdrew into the room again he said Poor creatures in a tone of much pity for their miserable condition Little Dorrit was deeply anxious that he should lie down to compose himself On Arthur s speaking to her of his going to inform Pancks that he might now appear as soon as he would and pursue the joyful business to its close she entreated him in a whisper to stay with her until her father should be quite calm and at rest He needed no second entreaty and she prepared her father s bed and begged him to lie down For another half hour or more he would be persuaded to do nothing but go about the room discussing with himself the probabilities for and against the Marshal s allowing the whole of the prisoners to go to the windows of the official residence which commanded the street to see himself and family depart for ever in a carriage which he said he thought would be a Sight for them But gradually he began to droop and tire and at last stretched himself upon the bed She took her faithful place beside him fanning him and cooling his forehead and he seemed to be falling asleep always with the money in his hand when he unexpectedly sat up and said mister Clennam I beg your pardon Am I to understand my dear sir that I could ha could pass through the Lodge at this moment and hum take a walk I think not mister Dorrit was the unwilling reply There are certain forms to be completed and although your detention here is now in itself a form I fear it is one that for a little longer has to be observed too At this he shed tears again It is but a few hours sir Clennam cheerfully urged upon him A few hours sir he returned in a sudden passion You talk very easily of hours sir How long do you suppose sir that an hour is to a man who is choking for want of air It was his last demonstration for that time as after shedding some more tears and querulously complaining that he couldn t breathe he slowly fell into a slumber Clennam had abundant occupation for his thoughts as he sat in the quiet room watching the father on his bed and the daughter fanning his face Little Dorrit had been thinking too After softly putting his grey hair aside and touching his forehead with her lips she looked towards Arthur who came nearer to her and pursued in a low whisper the subject of her thoughts mister Clennam will he pay all his debts before he leaves here No doubt All All the debts for which he had been imprisoned here all my life and longer No doubt There was something of uncertainty and remonstrance in her look something that was not all satisfaction He wondered to detect it and said You are glad that he should do so Are you asked Little Dorrit wistfully Am I Most heartily glad Then I know I ought to be And are you not It seems to me hard said Little Dorrit that he should have lost so many years and suffered so much and at last pay all the debts as well It seems to me hard that he should pay in life and money both My dear child Clennam was beginning Yes I know I am wrong she pleaded timidly don t think any worse of me it has grown up with me here The prison which could spoil so many things had tainted Little Dorrit s mind no more than this Engendered as the confusion was in compassion for the poor prisoner her father it was the first speck Clennam had ever seen it was the last speck Clennam ever saw of the prison atmosphere upon her He thought this and forebore to say another word With the thought her purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light The little spot made them the more beautiful Worn out with her own emotions and yielding to the silence of the room her hand slowly slackened and failed in its fanning movement and her head dropped down on the pillow at her father s side Clennam rose softly opened and closed the door without a sound and passed from the prison carrying the quiet with him into the turbulent streets CHAPTER thirty six The Marshalsea becomes an Orphan And now the day arrived when mister Dorrit and his family were to leave the prison for ever and the stones of its much trodden pavement were to know them no more The interval had been short but he had greatly complained of its length and had been imperious with mister Rugg touching the delay He had been high with mister Rugg and had threatened to employ some one else He had requested mister Rugg not to presume upon the place in which he found him but to do his duty sir and to do it with promptitude He had told mister Rugg that he knew what lawyers and agents were and that he would not submit to imposition On that gentleman s humbly representing that he exerted himself to the utmost Miss Fanny was very short with him desiring to know what less he could do when he had been told a dozen times that money was no object and expressing her suspicion that he forgot whom he talked to Towards the Marshal who was a Marshal of many years standing and with whom he had never had any previous difference mister Dorrit comported himself with severity That officer on personally tendering his congratulations offered the free use of two rooms in his house for mister Dorrit s occupation until his departure mister Dorrit thanked him at the moment and replied that he would think of it but the Marshal was no sooner gone than he sat down and wrote him a cutting note in which he remarked that he had never on any former occasion had the honour of receiving his congratulations which was true though indeed there had not been anything particular to congratulate him upon and that he begged on behalf of himself and family to repudiate the Marshal s offer with all those thanks which its disinterested character and its perfect independence of all worldly considerations demanded Although his brother showed so dim a glimmering of interest in their altered fortunes that it was very doubtful whether he understood them mister Dorrit caused him to be measured for new raiment by the hosiers tailors hatters and bootmakers whom he called in for himself and ordered that his old clothes should be taken from him and burned Miss Fanny and mister Tip required no direction in making an appearance of great fashion and elegance and the three passed this interval together at the best hotel in the neighbourhood though truly as Miss Fanny said the best was very indifferent In connection with that establishment mister Tip hired a cabriolet horse and groom a very neat turn out which was usually to be observed for two or three hours at a time gracing the Borough High Street outside the Marshalsea court yard A modest little hired chariot and pair was also frequently to be seen there in alighting from and entering which vehicle Miss Fanny fluttered the Marshal s daughters by the display of inaccessible bonnets A great deal of business was transacted in this short period Among other items Messrs Peddle and Pool solicitors of Monument Yard were instructed by their client Edward Dorrit Esquire to address a letter to mister Arthur Clennam enclosing the sum of twenty four pounds nine shillings and eightpence being the amount of principal and interest computed at the rate of five per cent per annum in which their client believed himself to be indebted to mister Clennam In making this communication and remittance Messrs Peddle and Pool were further instructed by their client to remind mister Clennam that the favour of the advance now repaid including gate fees had not been asked of him and to inform him that it would not have been accepted if it had been openly proffered in his name With which they requested a stamped receipt and remained his obedient servants A great deal of business had likewise to be done within the so soon to be orphaned Marshalsea by mister Dorrit so long its Father chiefly arising out of applications made to him by Collegians for small sums of money To these he responded with the greatest liberality and with no lack of formality always first writing to appoint a time at which the applicant might wait upon him in his room and then receiving him in the midst of a vast accumulation of documents and accompanying his donation for he said in every such case it is a donation not a loan with a great deal of good counsel to the effect that he the expiring Father of the Marshalsea hoped to be long remembered as an example that a man might preserve his own and the general respect even there The Collegians were not envious Besides that they had a personal and traditional regard for a Collegian of so many years standing the event was creditable to the College and made it famous in the newspapers Perhaps more of them thought too than were quite aware of it that the thing might in the lottery of chances have happened to themselves or that something of the sort might yet happen to themselves some day or other They took it very well A few were low at the thought of being left behind and being left poor but even these did not grudge the family their brilliant reverse There might have been much more envy in politer places It seems probable that mediocrity of fortune would have been disposed to be less magnanimous than the Collegians who lived from hand to mouth from the pawnbroker s hand to the day s dinner They got up an address to him which they presented in a neat frame and glass though it was not afterwards displayed in the family mansion or preserved among the family papers and to which he returned a gracious answer In that document he assured them in a Royal manner that he received the profession of their attachment with a full conviction of its sincerity and again generally exhorted them to follow his example which at least in so far as coming into a great property was concerned there is no doubt they would have gladly imitated He took the same occasion of inviting them to a comprehensive entertainment to be given to the whole College in the yard and at which he signified he would have the honour of taking a parting glass to the health and happiness of all those whom he was about to leave behind He did not in person dine at this public repast it took place at two in the afternoon and his dinners now came in from the hotel at six but his son was so good as to take the head of the principal table and to be very free and engaging He himself went about among the company and took notice of individuals and saw that the viands were of the quality he had ordered and that all were served On the whole he was like a baron of the olden time in a rare good humour At the conclusion of the repast he pledged his guests in a bumper of old Madeira and told them that he hoped they had enjoyed themselves and what was more that they would enjoy themselves for the rest of the evening that he wished them well and that he bade them welcome His health being drunk with acclamations he was not so baronial after all but that in trying to return thanks he broke down in the manner of a mere serf with a heart in his breast and wept before them all After this great success which he supposed to be a failure he gave them mister Chivery and his brother officers whom he had beforehand presented with ten pounds each and who were all in attendance mister Chivery spoke to the toast saying What you undertake to lock up lock up but remember that you are in the words of the fettered African a man and a brother ever The list of toasts disposed of mister Dorrit urbanely went through the motions of playing a game of skittles with the Collegian who was the next oldest inhabitant to himself and left the tenantry to their diversions But all these occurrences preceded the final day And now the day arrived when he and his family were to leave the prison for ever and when the stones of its much trodden pavement were to know them no more Noon was the hour appointed for the departure As it approached there was not a Collegian within doors nor a turnkey absent The latter class of gentlemen appeared in their Sunday clothes and the greater part of the Collegians were brightened up as much as circumstances allowed Two or three flags were even displayed and the children put on odds and ends of ribbon mister Dorrit himself at this trying time preserved a serious but graceful dignity Much of his great attention was given to his brother as to whose bearing on the great occasion he felt anxious My dear Frederick said he if you will give me your arm we will pass among our friends together I think it is right that we should go out arm in arm my dear Frederick Hah said Frederick Yes yes yes yes And if my dear Frederick if you could without putting any great constraint upon yourself throw a little pray excuse me Frederick a little Polish into your usual demeanour William William said the other shaking his head it s for you to do all that I don t know how All forgotten forgotten But my dear fellow returned William for that very reason if for no other you must positively try to rouse yourself What you have forgotten you must now begin to recall my dear Frederick Your position Eh said Frederick Your position my dear Frederick Mine He looked first at his own figure and then at his brother s and then drawing a long breath cried Hah to be sure Yes yes yes Your position my dear Frederick is now a fine one Your position as my brother is a very fine one And I know that it belongs to your conscientious nature to try to become worthy of it my dear Frederick and to try to adorn it To be no discredit to it but to adorn it William said the other weakly and with a sigh I will do anything you wish my brother provided it lies in my power Pray be so kind as to recollect what a limited power mine is What would you wish me to do to day brother Say what it is only say what it is My dearest Frederick nothing It is not worth troubling so good a heart as yours with Pray trouble it returned the other It finds it no trouble William to do anything it can for you William passed his hand across his eyes and murmured with august satisfaction Blessings on your attachment my poor dear fellow Then he said aloud Well my dear Frederick if you will only try as we walk out to show that you are alive to the occasion that you think about it What would you advise me to think about it returned his submissive brother Oh my dear Frederick how can I answer you I can only say what in leaving these good people I think myself That s it cried his brother That will help me I find that I think my dear Frederick and with mixed emotions in which a softened compassion predominates What will they do without me True returned his brother Yes yes yes yes I ll think that as we go What will they do without my brother Poor things What will they do without him Twelve o clock having just struck and the carriage being reported ready in the outer court yard the brothers proceeded down stairs arm in arm Edward Dorrit Esquire once Tip and his sister Fanny followed also arm in arm mister Plornish and Maggy to whom had been entrusted the removal of such of the family effects as were considered worth removing followed bearing bundles and burdens to be packed in a cart In the yard were the Collegians and turnkeys In the yard were mister Pancks and mister Rugg come to see the last touch given to their work In the yard was Young John making a new epitaph for himself on the occasion of his dying of a broken heart In the yard was the Patriarchal Casby looking so tremendously benevolent that many enthusiastic Collegians grasped him fervently by the hand and the wives and female relatives of many more Collegians kissed his hand nothing doubting that he had done it all In the yard was the man with the shadowy grievance respecting the Fund which the Marshal embezzled who had got up at five in the morning to complete the copying of a perfectly unintelligible history of that transaction which he had committed to mister Dorrit s care as a document of the last importance calculated to stun the Government and effect the Marshal s downfall In the yard was the insolvent whose utmost energies were always set on getting into debt who broke into prison with as much pains as other men have broken out of it and who was always being cleared and complimented while the insolvent at his elbow a mere little snivelling striving tradesman half dead of anxious efforts to keep out of debt found it a hard matter indeed to get a Commissioner to release him with much reproof and reproach In the yard was the man of many children and many burdens whose failure astonished everybody in the yard was the man of no children and large resources whose failure astonished nobody There were the people who were always going out to morrow and always putting it off there were the people who had come in yesterday and who were much more jealous and resentful of this freak of fortune than the seasoned birds There were some who in pure meanness of spirit cringed and bowed before the enriched Collegian and his family there were others who did so really because their eyes accustomed to the gloom of their imprisonment and poverty could not support the light of such bright sunshine There were many whose shillings had gone into his pocket to buy him meat and drink but none who were now obtrusively Hail fellow well met with him on the strength of that assistance It was rather to be remarked of the caged birds that they were a little shy of the bird about to be so grandly free and that they had a tendency to withdraw themselves towards the bars and seem a little fluttered as he passed Through these spectators the little procession headed by the two brothers moved slowly to the gate mister Dorrit yielding to the vast speculation how the poor creatures were to get on without him was great and sad but not absorbed He patted children on the head like Sir Roger de Coverley going to church he spoke to people in the background by their Christian names he condescended to all present and seemed for their consolation to walk encircled by the legend in golden characters Be comforted my people Bear it At last three honest cheers announced that he had passed the gate and that the Marshalsea was an orphan Before they had ceased to ring in the echoes of the prison walls the family had got into their carriage and the attendant had the steps in his hand Then and not before Good Gracious cried Miss Fanny all at once Where s Amy Her father had thought she was with her sister Her sister had thought she was somewhere or other They had all trusted to finding her as they had always done quietly in the right place at the right moment This going away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had got through without her A minute might have been consumed in the ascertaining of these points when Miss Fanny who from her seat in the carriage commanded the long narrow passage leading to the Lodge flushed indignantly Now I do say Pa cried she that this is disgraceful What is disgraceful Fanny I do say she repeated this is perfectly infamous Really almost enough even at such a time as this to make one wish one was dead Here is that child Amy in her ugly old shabby dress which she was so obstinate about Pa which I over and over again begged and prayed her to change and which she over and over again objected to and promised to change to day saying she wished to wear it as long as ever she remained in there with you which was absolutely romantic nonsense of the lowest kind here is that child Amy disgracing us to the last moment and at the last moment by being carried out in that dress after all And by that mister Clennam too The offence was proved as she delivered the indictment Clennam appeared at the carriage door bearing the little insensible figure in his arms She has been forgotten he said in a tone of pity not free from reproach I ran up to her room which mister Chivery showed me and found the door open and that she had fainted on the floor dear child She appeared to have gone to change her dress and to have sunk down overpowered It may have been the cheering or it may have happened sooner Take care of this poor cold hand Miss Dorrit Don t let it fall Thank you sir returned Miss Dorrit bursting into tears I believe I know what to do if you will give me leave Dear Amy open your eyes that s a love Oh Amy Amy I really am so vexed and ashamed Do rouse yourself darling Oh why are they not driving on Pray Pa do drive on The attendant getting between Clennam and the carriage door with a sharp By your leave sir bundled up the steps and they drove away BOOK THE SECOND RICHES CHAPTER one Fellow Travellers In the autumn of the year Darkness and Night were creeping up to the highest ridges of the Alps It was vintage time in the valleys on the Swiss side of the Pass of the Great Saint Bernard and along the banks of the Lake of Geneva The air there was charged with the scent of gathered grapes Baskets troughs and tubs of grapes stood in the dim village doorways stopped the steep and narrow village streets and had been carrying all day along the roads and lanes Grapes split and crushed under foot lay about everywhere The child carried in a sling by the laden peasant woman toiling home was quieted with picked up grapes the idiot sunning his big goitre under the leaves of the wooden chalet by the way to the Waterfall sat Munching grapes the breath of the cows and goats was redolent of leaves and stalks of grapes the company in every little cabaret were eating drinking talking grapes A pity that no ripe touch of this generous abundance could be given to the thin hard stony wine which after all was made from the grapes The air had been warm and transparent through the whole of the bright day Shining metal spires and church roofs distant and rarely seen had sparkled in the view and the snowy mountain tops had been so clear that unaccustomed eyes cancelling the intervening country and slighting their rugged heights for something fabulous would have measured them as within a few hours easy reach Mountain peaks of great celebrity in the valleys whence no trace of their existence was visible sometimes for months together had been since morning plain and near in the blue sky And now when it was dark below though they seemed solemnly to recede like spectres who were going to vanish as the red dye of the sunset faded out of them and left them coldly white they were yet distinctly defined in their loneliness above the mists and shadows Seen from these solitudes and from the Pass of the Great Saint Bernard which was one of them the ascending Night came up the mountain like a rising water When it at last rose to the walls of the convent of the Great Saint Bernard it was as if that weather beaten structure were another Ark and floated on the shadowy waves Darkness outstripping some visitors on mules had risen thus to the rough convent walls when those travellers were yet climbing the mountain As the heat of the glowing day when they had stopped to drink at the streams of melted ice and snow was changed to the searching cold of the frosty rarefied night air at a great height so the fresh beauty of the lower journey had yielded to barrenness and desolation A craggy track up which the mules in single file scrambled and turned from block to block as though they were ascending the broken staircase of a gigantic ruin was their way now No trees were to be seen nor any vegetable growth save a poor brown scrubby moss freezing in the chinks of rock Blackened skeleton arms of wood by the wayside pointed upward to the convent as if the ghosts of former travellers overwhelmed by the snow haunted the scene of their distress Icicle hung caves and cellars built for refuges from sudden storms were like so many whispers of the perils of the place never resting wreaths and mazes of mist wandered about hunted by a moaning wind and snow the besetting danger of the mountain against which all its defences were taken drifted sharply down The file of mules jaded by their day s work turned and wound slowly up the deep ascent the foremost led by a guide on foot in his broad brimmed hat and round jacket carrying a mountain staff or two upon his shoulder with whom another guide conversed There was no speaking among the string of riders The sharp cold the fatigue of the journey and a new sensation of a catching in the breath partly as if they had just emerged from very clear crisp water and partly as if they had been sobbing kept them silent At length a light on the summit of the rocky staircase gleamed through the snow and mist The guides called to the mules the mules pricked up their drooping heads the travellers tongues were loosened and in a sudden burst of slipping climbing jingling clinking and talking they arrived at the convent door Other mules had arrived not long before some with peasant riders and some with goods and had trodden the snow about the door into a pool of mud Riding saddles and bridles pack saddles and strings of bells mules and men lanterns torches sacks provender barrels cheeses kegs of honey and butter straw bundles and packages of many shapes were crowded confusedly together in this thawed quagmire and about the steps Up here in the clouds everything was seen through cloud and seemed dissolving into cloud The breath of the men was cloud the breath of the mules was cloud the lights were encircled by cloud speakers close at hand were not seen for cloud though their voices and all other sounds were surprisingly clear Of the cloudy line of mules hastily tied to rings in the wall one would bite another or kick another and then the whole mist would be disturbed with men diving into it and cries of men and beasts coming out of it and no bystander discerning what was wrong In the midst of this the great stable of the convent occupying the basement story and entered by the basement door outside which all the disorder was poured forth its contribution of cloud as if the whole rugged edifice were filled with nothing else and would collapse as soon as it had emptied itself leaving the snow to fall upon the bare mountain summit While all this noise and hurry were rife among the living travellers there too silently assembled in a grated house half a dozen paces removed with the same cloud enfolding them and the same snow flakes drifting in upon them were the dead travellers found upon the mountain The mother storm belated many winters ago still standing in the corner with her baby at her breast the man who had frozen with his arm raised to his mouth in fear or hunger still pressing it with his dry lips after years and years An awful company mysteriously come together A wild destiny for that mother to have foreseen Surrounded by so many and such companions upon whom I never looked and never shall look I and my child will dwell together inseparable on the Great Saint Bernard outlasting generations who will come to see us and will never know our name or one word of our story but the end The living travellers thought little or nothing of the dead just then They thought much more of alighting at the convent door and warming themselves at the convent fire Disengaged from the turmoil which was already calming down as the crowd of mules began to be bestowed in the stable they hurried shivering up the steps and into the building There was a smell within coming up from the floor of tethered beasts like the smell of a menagerie of wild animals There were strong arched galleries within huge stone piers great staircases and thick walls pierced with small sunken windows fortifications against the mountain storms as if they had been human enemies There were gloomy vaulted sleeping rooms within intensely cold but clean and hospitably prepared for guests Finally there was a parlour for guests to sit in and sup in where a table was already laid and where a blazing fire shone red and high In this room after having had their quarters for the night allotted to them by two young Fathers the travellers presently drew round the hearth They were in three parties of whom the first as the most numerous and important was the slowest and had been overtaken by one of the others on the way up It consisted of an elderly lady two grey haired gentlemen two young ladies and their brother These were attended not to mention four guides by a courier two footmen and two waiting maids which strong body of inconvenience was accommodated elsewhere under the same roof The party that had overtaken them and followed in their train consisted of only three members one lady and two gentlemen The third party which had ascended from the valley on the Italian side of the Pass and had arrived first were four in number a plethoric hungry and silent German tutor in spectacles on a tour with three young men his pupils all plethoric hungry and silent and all in spectacles These three groups sat round the fire eyeing each other drily and waiting for supper Only one among them one of the gentlemen belonging to the party of three made advances towards conversation Throwing out his lines for the Chief of the important tribe while addressing himself to his own companions he remarked in a tone of voice which included all the company if they chose to be included that it had been a long day and that he felt for the ladies That he feared one of the young ladies was not a strong or accustomed traveller and had been over fatigued two or three hours ago That he had observed from his station in the rear that she sat her mule as if she were exhausted That he had twice or thrice afterwards done himself the honour of inquiring of one of the guides when he fell behind how the lady did That he had been enchanted to learn that she had recovered her spirits and that it had been but a passing discomfort That he trusted by this time he had secured the eyes of the Chief and addressed him he might be permitted to express his hope that she was now none the worse and that she would not regret having made the journey My daughter I am obliged to you sir returned the Chief is quite restored and has been greatly interested New to mountains perhaps said the insinuating traveller New to ha to mountains said the Chief But you are familiar with them sir the insinuating traveller assumed I am hum tolerably familiar Not of late years Not of late years replied the Chief with a flourish of his hand The insinuating traveller acknowledging the flourish with an inclination of his head passed from the Chief to the second young lady who had not yet been referred to otherwise than as one of the ladies in whose behalf he felt so sensitive an interest He hoped she was not incommoded by the fatigues of the day Incommoded certainly returned the young lady but not tired The insinuating traveller complimented her on the justice of the distinction It was what he had meant to say Every lady must doubtless be incommoded by having to do with that proverbially unaccommodating animal the mule We have had of course said the young lady who was rather reserved and haughty to leave the carriages and fourgon at Martigny And the impossibility of bringing anything that one wants to this inaccessible place and the necessity of leaving every comfort behind is not convenient A savage place indeed said the insinuating traveller The elderly lady who was a model of accurate dressing and whose manner was perfect considered as a piece of machinery here interposed a remark in a low soft voice But like other inconvenient places she observed it must be seen As a place much spoken of it is necessary to see it O I have not the least objection to seeing it I assure you missus General returned the other carelessly You madam said the insinuating traveller have visited this spot before Yes returned missus General I have been here before Let me commend you my dear to the former young lady to shade your face from the hot wood after exposure to the mountain air and snow You too my dear to the other and younger lady who immediately did so while the former merely said Thank you missus General I am Perfectly comfortable and prefer remaining as I am The brother who had left his chair to open a piano that stood in the room and who had whistled into it and shut it up again now came strolling back to the fire with his glass in his eye He was dressed in the very fullest and completest travelling trim The world seemed hardly large enough to yield him an amount of travel proportionate to his equipment These fellows are an immense time with supper he drawled I wonder what they ll give us Has anybody any idea Not roast man I believe replied the voice of the second gentleman of the party of three I suppose not What d ye mean he inquired That as you are not to be served for the general supper perhaps you will do us the favour of not cooking yourself at the general fire returned the other The young gentleman who was standing in an easy attitude on the hearth cocking his glass at the company with his back to the blaze and his coat tucked under his arms something as if he were Of the Poultry species and were trussed for roasting lost countenance at this reply he seemed about to demand further explanation when it was discovered through all eyes turning on the speaker that the lady with him who was young and beautiful had not heard what had passed through having fainted with her head upon his shoulder I think said the gentleman in a subdued tone I had best carry her straight to her room Will you call to some one to bring a light addressing his companion and to show the way In this strange rambling place I don t know that I could find it Pray let me call my maid cried the taller of the young ladies Pray let me put this water to her lips said the shorter who had not spoken yet Each doing what she suggested there was no want of assistance Indeed when the two maids came in escorted by the courier lest any one should strike them dumb by addressing a foreign language to them on the road there was a prospect of too much assistance Seeing this and saying as much in a few words to the slighter and younger of the two ladies the gentleman put his wife s arm over his shoulder lifted her up and carried her away His friend being left alone with the other visitors walked slowly up and down the room without coming to the fire again pulling his black moustache in a contemplative manner as if he felt himself committed to the late retort While the subject of it was breathing injury in a corner the Chief loftily addressed this gentleman Your friend sir said he is ha is a little impatient and in his impatience is not perhaps fully sensible of what he owes to hum to but we will waive that we will waive that Your friend is a little impatient sir It may be so sir returned the other But having had the honour of making that gentleman s acquaintance at the hotel at Geneva where we and much good company met some time ago and having had the honour of exchanging company and conversation with that gentleman on several subsequent excursions I can hear nothing no not even from one of your appearance and station sir detrimental to that gentleman You are in no danger sir of hearing any such thing from me In remarking that your friend has shown impatience I say no such thing I make that remark because it is not to be doubted that my son being by birth and by ha by education a hum a gentleman would have readily adapted himself to any obligingly expressed wish on the subject of the fire being equally accessible to the whole of the present circle Which in principle I ha for all are hum equal on these occasions I consider right Good was the reply And there it ends I am your son s obedient servant I beg your son to receive the assurance of my profound consideration And now sir I may admit freely admit that my friend is sometimes of a sarcastic temper The lady is your friend s wife sir The lady is my friend s wife sir She is very handsome Sir she is peerless They are still in the first year of their marriage They are still partly on a marriage and partly on an artistic tour Your friend is an artist sir The gentleman replied by kissing the fingers of his right hand and wafting the kiss the length of his arm towards Heaven As who should say I devote him to the celestial Powers as an immortal artist But he is a man of family he added His connections are of the best He is more than an artist he is highly connected He may in effect have repudiated his connections proudly impatiently sarcastically I make the concession of both words but he has them Sparks that have been struck out during our intercourse have shown me this Well I hope said the lofty gentleman with the air of finally disposing of the subject that the lady s indisposition may be only temporary Sir I hope so Mere fatigue I dare say Not altogether mere fatigue sir for her mule stumbled to day and she fell from the saddle She fell lightly and was up again without assistance and rode from us laughing but she complained towards evening of a slight bruise in the side She spoke of it more than once as we followed your party up the mountain The head of the large retinue who was gracious but not familiar appeared by this time to think that he had condescended more than enough He said no more and there was silence for some quarter of an hour until supper appeared With the supper came one of the young Fathers there seemed to be no old Fathers to take the head of the table It was like the supper of an ordinary Swiss hotel and good red wine grown by the convent in more genial air was not wanting The artist traveller calmly came and took his place at table when the rest sat down with no apparent sense upon him of his late skirmish with the completely dressed traveller Pray he inquired of the host over his soup has your convent many of its famous dogs now Monsieur it has three I saw three in the gallery below Doubtless the three in question The host a slender bright eyed dark young man of polite manners whose garment was a black gown with strips of white crossed over it like braces and who no more resembled the conventional breed of Saint Bernard monks than he resembled the conventional breed of Saint Bernard dogs replied doubtless those were the three in question And I think said the artist traveller I have seen one of them before It was possible He was a dog sufficiently well known Monsieur might have easily seen him in the valley or somewhere on the lake when he the dog had gone down with one of the order to solicit aid for the convent Which is done in its regular season of the year I think Monsieur was right And never without a dog The dog is very important Again Monsieur was right The dog was very important People were justly interested in the dog As one of the dogs celebrated everywhere Ma amselle would observe Ma amselle was a little slow to observe it as though she were not yet well accustomed to the French tongue missus General however observed it for her Ask him if he has saved many lives said in his native English the young man who had been put out of countenance The host needed no translation of the question He promptly replied in French No Not this one Why not the same gentleman asked Pardon returned the host composedly give him the opportunity and he will do it without doubt For example I am well convinced smiling sedately as he cut up the dish of veal to be handed round on the young man who had been put out of countenance that if you Monsieur would give him the opportunity he would hasten with great ardour to fulfil his duty The artist traveller laughed The insinuating traveller who evinced a provident anxiety to get his full share of the supper wiping some drops of wine from his moustache with a piece of bread joined the conversation It is becoming late in the year my Father said he for tourist travellers is it not Yes it is late Yet two or three weeks at most and we shall be left to the winter snows And then said the insinuating traveller for the scratching dogs and the buried children according to the pictures Pardon said the host not quite understanding the allusion How then the scratching dogs and the buried children according to the pictures The artist traveller struck in again before an answer could be given Don t you know he coldly inquired across the table of his companion that none but smugglers come this way in the winter or can have any possible business this way Holy blue No never heard of it So it is I believe And as they know the signs of the weather tolerably well they don t give much employment to the dogs who have consequently died out rather though this house of entertainment is conveniently situated for themselves Their young families I am told they usually leave at home But it s a grand idea cried the artist traveller unexpectedly rising into a tone of enthusiasm It s a sublime idea It s the finest idea in the world and brings tears into a man s eyes by Jupiter He then went on eating his veal with great composure There was enough of mocking inconsistency at the bottom of this speech to make it rather discordant though the manner was refined and the person well favoured and though the depreciatory part of it was so skilfully thrown off as to be very difficult for one not perfectly acquainted with the English language to understand or even understanding to take offence at so simple and dispassionate was its tone After finishing his veal in the midst of silence the speaker again addressed his friend Look said he in his former tone at this gentleman our host not yet in the prime of life who in so graceful a way and with such courtly urbanity and modesty presides over us Manners fit for a crown Dine with the Lord Mayor of London if you can get an invitation and observe the contrast This dear fellow with the finest cut face I ever saw a face in perfect drawing leaves some laborious life and comes up here I don t know how many feet above the level of the sea for no other purpose on earth except enjoying himself I hope in a capital refectory than to keep an hotel for idle poor devils like you and me and leave the bill to our consciences Why isn t it a beautiful sacrifice What do we want more to touch us Because rescued people of interesting appearance are not for eight or nine months out of every twelve holding on here round the necks of the most sagacious of dogs carrying wooden bottles shall we disparage the place No Bless the place It s a great place a glorious place The chest of the grey haired gentleman who was the Chief of the important party had swelled as if with a protest against his being numbered among poor devils No sooner had the artist traveller ceased speaking than he himself spoke with great dignity as having it incumbent on him to take the lead in most places and having deserted that duty for a little while He weightily communicated his opinion to their host that his life must be a very dreary life here in the winter The host allowed to Monsieur that it was a little monotonous The air was difficult to breathe for a length of time consecutively The cold was very severe One needed youth and strength to bear it However having them and the blessing of Heaven Yes that was very good But the confinement said the grey haired gentleman There were many days even in bad weather when it was possible to walk about outside It was the custom to beat a little track and take exercise there But the space urged the grey haired gentleman So small So ha very limited Monsieur would recall to himself that there were the refuges to visit and that tracks had to be made to them also Monsieur still urged on the other hand that the space was so ha hum so very contracted More than that it was always the same always the same With a deprecating smile the host gently raised and gently lowered his shoulders That was true he remarked but permit him to say that almost all objects had their various points of view Monsieur and he did not see this poor life of his from the same point of view Monsieur was not used to confinement I ha yes very true said the grey haired gentleman He seemed to receive quite a shock from the force of the argument Monsieur as an English traveller surrounded by all means of travelling pleasantly doubtless possessing fortune carriages and servants Perfectly perfectly Without doubt said the gentleman Monsieur could not easily place himself in the position of a person who had not the power to choose I will go here to morrow or there next day I will pass these barriers I will enlarge those bounds Monsieur could not realise perhaps how the mind accommodated itself in such things to the force of necessity It is true said Monsieur We will ha not pursue the subject You are hum quite accurate I have no doubt We will say no more The supper having come to a close he drew his chair away as he spoke and moved back to his former place by the fire As it was very cold at the greater part of the table the other guests also resumed their former seats by the fire designing to toast themselves well before going to bed The host when they rose from the table bowed to all present wished them good night and withdrew But first the insinuating traveller had asked him if they could have some wine made hot and as he had answered Yes and had presently afterwards sent it in that traveller seated in the centre of the group and in the full heat of the fire was soon engaged in serving it out to the rest At this time the younger of the two young ladies who had been silently attentive in her dark corner the fire light was the chief light in the sombre room the lamp being smoky and dull to what had been said of the absent lady glided out She was at a loss which way to turn when she had softly closed the door but after a little hesitation among the sounding passages and the many ways came to a room in a corner of the main gallery where the servants were at their supper From these she obtained a lamp and a direction to the lady s room It was up the great staircase on the story above Here and there the bare white walls were broken by an iron grate and she thought as she went along that the place was something like a prison The arched door of the lady s room or cell was not quite shut After knocking at it two or three times without receiving an answer she pushed it gently open and looked in The lady lay with closed eyes on the outside of the bed protected from the cold by the blankets and wrappers with which she had been covered when she revived from her fainting fit A dull light placed in the deep recess of the window made little impression on the arched room The visitor timidly stepped to the bed and said in a soft whisper Are you better The lady had fallen into a slumber and the whisper was too low to awake her Her visitor standing quite still looked at her attentively She is very pretty she said to herself I never saw so beautiful a face O how unlike me It was a curious thing to say but it had some hidden meaning for it filled her eyes with tears I know I must be right I know he spoke of her that evening I could very easily be wrong on any other subject but not on this not on this With a quiet and tender hand she put aside a straying fold of the sleeper s hair and then touched the hand that lay outside the covering I like to look at her she breathed to herself I like to see what has affected him so much She had not withdrawn her hand when the sleeper opened her eyes and started Pray don t be alarmed I am only one of the travellers from down stairs I came to ask if you were better and if I could do anything for you I think you have already been so kind as to send your servants to my assistance No not I that was my sister Are you better Much better It is only a slight bruise and has been well looked to and is almost easy now It made me giddy and faint in a moment It had hurt me before but at last it overpowered me all at once May I stay with you until some one comes Would you like it I should like it for it is lonely here but I am afraid you will feel the cold too much I don t mind cold I am not delicate if I look so She quickly moved one of the two rough chairs to the bedside and sat down The other as quickly moved a part of some travelling wrapper from herself and drew it over her so that her arm in keeping it about her rested on her shoulder You have so much the air of a kind nurse said the lady smiling on her that you seem as if you had come to me from home I am very glad of it I was dreaming of home when I woke just now Of my old home I mean before I was married And before you were so far away from it I have been much farther away from it than this but then I took the best part of it with me and missed nothing I felt solitary as I dropped asleep here and missing it a little wandered back to it There was a sorrowfully affectionate and regretful sound in her voice which made her visitor refrain from looking at her for the moment It is a curious chance which at last brings us together under this covering in which you have wrapped me said the visitor after a pause for do you know I think I have been looking for you some time Looking for me I believe I have a little note here which I was to give to you whenever I found you This is it Unless I greatly mistake it is addressed to you Is it not The lady took it and said yes and read it Her visitor watched her as she did so It was very short She flushed a little as she put her lips to her visitor s cheek and pressed her hand The dear young friend to whom he presents me may be a comfort to me at some time he says She is truly a comfort to me the first time I see her Perhaps you don t said the visitor hesitating perhaps you don t know my story Perhaps he never told you my story No Oh no why should he I have scarcely the right to tell it myself at present because I have been entreated not to do so There is not much in it but it might account to you for my asking you not to say anything about the letter here You saw my family with me perhaps Some of them I only say this to you are a little proud a little prejudiced You shall take it back again said the other and then my husband is sure not to see it He might see it and speak of it otherwise by some accident Will you put it in your bosom again to be certain She did so with great care Her small slight hand was still upon the letter when they heard some one in the gallery outside I promised said the visitor rising that I would write to him after seeing you I could hardly fail to see you sooner or later and tell him if you were well and happy I had better say you were well and happy Yes yes yes Say I was very well and very happy And that I thanked him affectionately and would never forget him I shall see you in the morning After that we are sure to meet again before very long Good night Good night Thank you thank you Good night my dear Both of them were hurried and fluttered as they exchanged this parting and as the visitor came out of the door She had expected to meet the lady s husband approaching it but the person in the gallery was not he it was the traveller who had wiped the wine drops from his moustache with the piece of bread When he heard the step behind him he turned round for he was walking away in the dark His politeness which was extreme would not allow of the young lady s lighting herself down stairs or going down alone He took her lamp held it so as to throw the best light on the stone steps and followed her all the way to the supper room She went down not easily hiding how much she was inclined to shrink and tremble for the appearance of this traveller was particularly disagreeable to her She had sat in her quiet corner before supper imagining what he would have been in the scenes and places within her experience until he inspired her with an aversion that made him little less than terrific He followed her down with his smiling politeness followed her in and resumed his seat in the best place in the hearth There with the wood fire which was beginning to burn low rising and falling upon him in the dark room he sat with his legs thrust out to warm drinking the hot wine down to the lees with a monstrous shadow imitating him on the wall and ceiling The tired company had broken up and all the rest were gone to bed except the young lady s father who dozed in his chair by the fire The traveller had been at the pains of going a long way up stairs to his sleeping room to fetch his pocket flask of brandy He told them so as he poured its contents into what was left of the wine and drank with a new relish May I ask sir if you are on your way to Italy The grey haired gentleman had roused himself and was preparing to withdraw He answered in the affirmative I also said the traveller I shall hope to have the honour of offering my compliments in fairer scenes and under softer circumstances than on this dismal mountain The gentleman bowed distantly enough and said he was obliged to him We poor gentlemen sir said the traveller pulling his moustache dry with his hand for he had dipped it in the wine and brandy we poor gentlemen do not travel like princes but the courtesies and graces of life are precious to us To your health sir Sir I thank you To the health of your distinguished family of the fair ladies your daughters Sir I thank you again I wish you good night My dear are our ha our people in attendance They are close by father Permit me said the traveller rising and holding the door open as the gentleman crossed the room towards it with his arm drawn through his daughter s Good repose To the pleasure of seeing you once more To to morrow As he kissed his hand with his best manner and his daintiest smile the young lady drew a little nearer to her father and passed him with a dread of touching him Humph said the insinuating traveller whose manner shrunk and whose voice dropped when he was left alone If they all go to bed why I must go They are in a devil of a hurry One would think the night would be long enough in this freezing silence and solitude if one went to bed two hours hence Throwing back his head in emptying his glass he cast his eyes upon the travellers book which lay on the piano open with pens and ink beside it as if the night s names had been registered when he was absent Taking it in his hand he read these entries William Dorrit Esquire Frederick Dorrit Esquire Edward Dorrit Esquire Miss Dorrit Miss Amy Dorrit missus General and Suite From France to Italy mister and missus Henry Gowan From France to Italy To which he added in a small complicated hand ending with a long lean flourish not unlike a lasso thrown at all the rest of the names Blandois Paris From France to Italy And then with his nose coming down over his moustache and his moustache going up and under his nose repaired to his allotted cell CHAPTER two missus General 
2288-155711-0000	train-other-500	It is indispensable to present the accomplished lady who was of sufficient importance in the suite of the Dorrit Family to have a line to herself in the Travellers Book missus General was the daughter of a clerical dignitary in a cathedral town
2288-155711-0001	train-other-500	where she had led the fashion until she was as near forty five as a single lady can be A stiff commissariat officer of sixty famous as a martinet
none	none	 had then become enamoured of the gravity with which she drove the proprieties four in hand through the cathedral town society 
2288-155711-0002	train-other-500	and had solicited to be taken beside her on the box of the cool coach of ceremony to which that team was harnessed His proposal of marriage being accepted by the lady the commissary took his seat behind the proprieties with great decorum
2288-155711-0003	train-other-500	and missus General drove until the commissary died In the course of their united journey they ran over several people who came in the way of the proprieties but always in a high style and with composure
none	none	 The commissary having been buried with all the decorations suitable to the service the whole team of proprieties were harnessed to his hearse 
2288-155711-0004	train-other-500	and they all had feathers and black velvet housings with his coat of arms in the corner missus General began to inquire what quantity of dust and ashes was deposited at the bankers
none	none	 It then transpired that the commissary had so far stolen a march on missus General as to have bought himself an annuity some years before his marriage and to have reserved that circumstance in mentioning at the period of his proposal that his income was derived from the interest of his money missus General consequently found her means so much diminished that 
2288-155711-0005	train-other-500	but for the perfect regulation of her mind she might have felt disposed to question the accuracy of that portion of the late service which had declared that the commissary could take nothing away with him
2288-155711-0006	train-other-500	In this state of affairs it occurred to missus General that she might form the mind and eke the manners of some young lady of distinction Or that she might harness the proprieties to the carriage of some rich young heiress or widow
2288-155711-0007	train-other-500	and become at once the driver and guard of such vehicle through the social mazes missus General s communication of this idea to her clerical and commissariat connection was so warmly applauded that but for the lady s undoubted merit
2288-155711-0008	train-other-500	it might have appeared as though they wanted to get rid of her Testimonials representing missus General as a prodigy of piety learning virtue and gentility were lavishly contributed from influential quarters
none	none	 and one venerable archdeacon even shed tears in recording his testimony to her perfections described to him by persons on whom he could rely though he had never had the honour and moral gratification of setting eyes on missus General in all his life 
2288-155711-0009	train-other-500	Thus delegated on her mission as it were by Church and State
none	none	 missus General who had always occupied high ground felt in a condition to keep it and began by putting herself up at a very high figure An interval of some duration elapsed in which there was no bid for missus General At length a county widower with a daughter of fourteen 
2288-155711-0010	train-other-500	opened negotiations with the lady and as it was a part either of the native dignity or of the artificial policy of missus General but certainly one or the other to comport herself as if she were much more sought than seeking
2288-155711-0011	train-other-500	the widower pursued missus General until he prevailed upon her to form his daughter s mind
none	none	 and manners 
2288-155711-0012	train-other-500	The execution of this trust occupied missus General about seven years in the course of which time she made the tour of Europe and saw most of that extensive miscellany of objects which it is essential that all persons of polite cultivation should see
2288-155711-0013	train-other-500	with other people s eyes and never with their own When her charge was at length formed the marriage not only of the young lady but likewise of her father the widower was resolved on
none	none	 The widower then finding missus General both inconvenient and expensive became of a sudden almost as much affected by her merits as the archdeacon had been and circulated such praises of her surpassing worth 
2288-155711-0014	train-other-500	in all quarters where he thought an opportunity might arise of transferring the blessing to somebody else that missus General was a name more honourable than ever The phoenix was to let on this elevated perch
2288-155711-0015	train-other-500	when mister Dorrit who had lately succeeded to his property mentioned to his bankers that he wished to discover a lady well bred accomplished well connected well accustomed to good society who was qualified at once to complete the education of his daughters
none	none	 and to be their matron or chaperon mister Dorrit s bankers as bankers of the county widower instantly said missus General 
2288-155711-0016	train-other-500	Pursuing the light so fortunately hit upon and finding the concurrent testimony of the whole of missus General s acquaintance to be of the pathetic nature already recorded mister Dorrit took the trouble of going down to the county of the county widower
2288-155711-0017	train-other-500	to see missus General in whom he found a lady of a quality superior to his highest expectations Might I be excused said mister Dorrit
none	none	 if I inquired ha what remune 
2288-155711-0018	train-other-500	Why indeed returned missus General stopping the word it is a subject on which I prefer to avoid entering I have never entered on it with my friends here and I cannot overcome the delicacy mister Dorrit
2288-155711-0019	train-other-500	with which I have always regarded it I am not as I hope you are aware a governess O dear no said mister Dorrit Pray madam do not imagine for a moment that I think so
2288-155711-0020	train-other-500	He really blushed to be suspected of it missus General gravely inclined her head I cannot therefore put a price upon services which it is a pleasure to me to render if I can render them spontaneously
2288-155711-0021	train-other-500	but which I could not render in mere return for any consideration Neither do I know how or where to find a case parallel to my own It is peculiar No doubt But how then
2288-155711-0022	train-other-500	mister Dorrit not unnaturally hinted could the subject be approached I cannot object said missus General
none	none	 though even that is disagreeable to me 
2288-155711-0023	train-other-500	to mister Dorrit s inquiring in confidence of my friends here what amount they have been accustomed at quarterly intervals to pay to my credit at my bankers mister Dorrit bowed his acknowledgements Permit me to add
2288-155711-0024	train-other-500	said missus General that beyond this I can never resume the topic Also that I can accept no second or inferior position
none	none	 If the honour were proposed to me of becoming known to mister Dorrit s family 
2288-155711-0025	train-other-500	I think two daughters were mentioned Two daughters I could only accept it on terms of perfect equality as a companion protector Mentor and friend
none	none	 mister Dorrit in spite of his sense of his importance felt as if it would be quite a kindness in her to accept it on any conditions He almost said as much I think repeated missus General 
2288-155711-0026	train-other-500	two daughters were mentioned Two daughters said mister Dorrit again It would therefore said missus General be necessary to add a third more to the payment whatever its amount may prove to be
2288-155711-0027	train-other-500	which my friends here have been accustomed to make to my bankers mister Dorrit lost no time in referring the delicate question to the county widower and finding that he had been accustomed to pay three hundred pounds a year to the credit of missus General
2288-155711-0028	train-other-500	arrived without any severe strain on his arithmetic at the conclusion that he himself must pay four missus General being an article of that lustrous surface which suggests that it is worth any money
none	none	 he made a formal proposal to be allowed to have the honour and pleasure of regarding her as a member of his family 
2288-155711-0029	train-other-500	missus General conceded that high privilege and here she was In person missus General including her skirts which had much to do with it was of a dignified and imposing appearance ample rustling
2288-155711-0030	train-other-500	gravely voluminous always upright behind the proprieties She might have been taken had been taken to the top of the Alps and the bottom of Herculaneum without disarranging a fold in her dress or displacing a pin
2288-155711-0031	train-other-500	If her countenance and hair had rather a floury appearance as though from living in some transcendently genteel Mill it was rather because she was a chalky creation altogether than because she mended her complexion with violet powder
2288-155711-0032	train-other-500	or had turned grey If her eyes had no expression it was probably because they had nothing to express If she had few wrinkles it was because her mind had never traced its name or any other inscription on her face A cool
2288-155711-0033	train-other-500	waxy blown out woman who had never lighted well missus General had no opinions Her way of forming a mind was to prevent it from forming opinions She had a little circular set of mental grooves or rails
2288-155711-0034	train-other-500	on which she started little trains of other people s opinions which never overtook one another and never got anywhere Even her propriety could not dispute that there was impropriety in the world
2288-155711-0035	train-other-500	but missus General s way of getting rid of it was to put it out of sight and make believe that there was no such thing This was another of her ways of forming a mind to cram all articles of difficulty into cupboards
none	none	 lock them up and say they had no existence It was the easiest way and beyond all comparison the properest missus General was not to be told of anything shocking 
2288-155711-0036	train-other-500	Accidents miseries and offences were never to be mentioned before her Passion was to go to sleep in the presence of missus General and blood was to change to milk and water
none	none	 The little that was left in the world 
2288-155711-0037	train-other-500	when all these deductions were made it was missus General s province to varnish
none	none	 In that formation process of hers 
2288-155711-0038	train-other-500	she dipped the smallest of brushes into the largest of pots and varnished the surface of every object that came under consideration The more cracked it was the more missus General varnished it
2288-155711-0039	train-other-500	There was varnish in missus General s voice varnish in missus General s touch an atmosphere of varnish round missus General s figure missus General s dreams ought to have been varnished
none	none	 if she had any lying asleep in the arms of the good Saint Bernard with the feathery snow falling on his house top CHAPTER three On the Road The bright morning sun dazzled the eyes the snow had ceased the mists had vanished the mountain air was so clear and light that the new sensation of breathing it was like the having entered on a new existence To help the delusion the solid ground itself seemed gone and the mountain a shining waste of immense white heaps and masses to be a region of cloud floating between the blue sky above and the earth far below Some dark specks in the snow like knots upon a little thread beginning at the convent door and winding away down the descent in broken lengths which were not yet pieced together showed where the Brethren were at work in several places clearing the track Already the snow had begun to be foot thawed again about the door Mules were busily brought out tied to the rings in the wall and laden strings of bells were buckled on burdens were adjusted the voices of drivers and riders sounded musically Some of the earliest had even already resumed their journey and both on the level summit by the dark water near the convent and on the downward way of yesterday s ascent little moving figures of men and mules reduced to miniatures by the immensity around went with a clear tinkling of bells and a pleasant harmony of tongues In the supper room of last night a new fire piled upon the feathery ashes of the old one shone upon a homely breakfast of loaves butter and milk It also shone on the courier of the Dorrit family making tea for his party from a supply he had brought up with him together with several other small stores which were chiefly laid in for the use of the strong body of inconvenience mister Gowan and Blandois of Paris had already breakfasted and were walking up and down by the lake smoking their cigars Gowan eh muttered Tip otherwise Edward Dorrit Esquire turning over the leaves of the book when the courier had left them to breakfast Then Gowan is the name of a puppy that s all I have got to say If it was worth my while I d pull his nose But it isn t worth my while fortunately for him How s his wife Amy I suppose you know You generally know things of that sort She is better Edward But they are not going to day Oh They are not going to day Fortunately for that fellow too said Tip or he and I might have come into collision It is thought better here that she should lie quiet to day and not be fatigued and shaken by the ride down until to morrow With all my heart But you talk as if you had been nursing her You haven t been relapsing into missus General is not here into old habits have you Amy He asked her the question with a sly glance of observation at Miss Fanny and at his father too I have only been in to ask her if I could do anything for her Tip said Little Dorrit You needn t call me Tip Amy child returned that young gentleman with a frown because that s an old habit and one you may as well lay aside I didn t mean to say so Edward dear I forgot It was so natural once that it seemed at the moment the right word Oh yes Miss Fanny struck in Natural and right word and once and all the rest of it Nonsense you little thing I know perfectly well why you have been taking such an interest in this missus Gowan You can t blind me I will not try to Fanny Don t be angry Oh angry returned that young lady with a flounce I have no patience which indeed was the truth Pray Fanny said mister Dorrit raising his eyebrows what do you mean Explain yourself Oh Never mind Pa replied Miss Fanny it s no great matter Amy will understand me She knew or knew of this missus Gowan before yesterday and she may as well admit that she did My child said mister Dorrit turning to his younger daughter has your sister any ha authority for this curious statement However meek we are Miss Fanny struck in before she could answer we don t go creeping into people s rooms on the tops of cold mountains and sitting perishing in the frost with people unless we know something about them beforehand It s not very hard to divine whose friend missus Gowan is Whose friend inquired her father Pa I am sorry to say returned Miss Fanny who had by this time succeeded in goading herself into a state of much ill usage and grievance which she was often at great pains to do that I believe her to be a friend of that very objectionable and unpleasant person who with a total absence of all delicacy which our experience might have led us to expect from him insulted us and outraged our feelings in so public and wilful a manner on an occasion to which it is understood among us that we will not more pointedly allude Amy my child said mister Dorrit tempering a bland severity with a dignified affection is this the case Little Dorrit mildly answered yes it was Yes it is cried Miss Fanny Of course I said so And now Pa I do declare once for all this young lady was in the habit of declaring the same thing once for all every day of her life and even several times in a day that this is shameful I do declare once for all that it ought to be put a stop to Is it not enough that we have gone through what is only known to ourselves but are we to have it thrown in our faces perseveringly and systematically by the very person who should spare our feelings most Are we to be exposed to this unnatural conduct every moment of our lives Are we never to be permitted to forget I say again it is absolutely infamous Well Amy observed her brother shaking his head you know I stand by you whenever I can and on most occasions But I must say that upon my soul I do consider it rather an unaccountable mode of showing your sisterly affection that you should back up a man who treated me in the most ungentlemanly way in which one man can treat another And who he added convincingly must be a low minded thief you know or he never could have conducted himself as he did And see said Miss Fanny see what is involved in this Can we ever hope to be respected by our servants Never Here are our two women and Pa s valet and a footman and a courier and all sorts of dependents and yet in the midst of these we are to have one of ourselves rushing about with tumblers of cold water like a menial Why a policeman said Miss Fanny if a beggar had a fit in the street could but go plunging about with tumblers as this very Amy did in this very room before our very eyes last night I don t so much mind that once in a way remarked mister Edward but your Clennam as he thinks proper to call himself is another thing He is part of the same thing returned Miss Fanny and of a piece with all the rest He obtruded himself upon us in the first instance We never wanted him I always showed him for one that I could have dispensed with his company with the greatest pleasure He then commits that gross outrage upon our feelings which he never could or would have committed but for the delight he took in exposing us and then we are to be demeaned for the service of his friends Why I don t wonder at this mister Gowan s conduct towards you What else was to be expected when he was enjoying our past misfortunes gloating over them at the moment Father Edward no indeed pleaded Little Dorrit Neither mister nor missus Gowan had ever heard our name They were and they are quite ignorant of our history So much the worse retorted Fanny determined not to admit anything in extenuation for then you have no excuse If they had known about us you might have felt yourself called upon to conciliate them That would have been a weak and ridiculous mistake but I can respect a mistake whereas I can t respect a wilful and deliberate abasing of those who should be nearest and dearest to us No I can t respect that I can do nothing but denounce that I never offend you wilfully Fanny said Little Dorrit though you are so hard with me Then you should be more careful Amy returned her sister If you do such things by accident you should be more careful If I happened to have been born in a peculiar place and under peculiar circumstances that blunted my knowledge of propriety I fancy I should think myself bound to consider at every step Am I going ignorantly to compromise any near and dear relations That is what I fancy I should do if it was my case mister Dorrit now interposed at once to stop these painful subjects by his authority and to point their moral by his wisdom My dear said he to his younger daughter I beg you to ha to say no more Your sister Fanny expresses herself strongly but not without considerable reason You have now a hum a great position to support That great position is not occupied by yourself alone but by ha by me and ha hum by us Us Now it is incumbent upon all people in an exalted position but it is particularly so on this family for reasons which I ha will not dwell upon to make themselves respected To be vigilant in making themselves respected Dependants to respect us must be ha kept at a distance and hum kept down Down Therefore your not exposing yourself to the remarks of our attendants by appearing to have at any time dispensed with their services and performed them for yourself is ha highly important Why who can doubt it cried Miss Fanny It s the essence of everything Fanny returned her father grandiloquently give me leave my dear We then come to ha to mister Clennam I am free to say that I do not Amy share your sister s sentiments that is to say altogether hum altogether in reference to mister Clennam I am content to regard that individual in the light of ha generally a well behaved person Hum A well behaved person Nor will I inquire whether mister Clennam did at any time obtrude himself on ha my society He knew my society to be hum sought and his plea might be that he regarded me in the light of a public character But there were circumstances attending my ha slight knowledge of mister Clennam it was very slight which here mister Dorrit became extremely grave and impressive would render it highly indelicate in mister Clennam to ha to seek to renew communication with me or with any member of my family under existing circumstances If mister Clennam has sufficient delicacy to perceive the impropriety of any such attempt I am bound as a responsible gentleman to ha defer to that delicacy on his part If on the other hand mister Clennam has not that delicacy I cannot for a moment ha hold any correspondence with so hum coarse a mind In either case it would appear that mister Clennam is put altogether out of the question and that we have nothing to do with him or he with us Ha missus General The entrance of the lady whom he announced to take her place at the breakfast table terminated the discussion Shortly afterwards the courier announced that the valet and the footman and the two maids and the four guides and the fourteen mules were in readiness so the breakfast party went out to the convent door to join the cavalcade mister Gowan stood aloof with his cigar and pencil but mister Blandois was on the spot to pay his respects to the ladies When he gallantly pulled off his slouched hat to Little Dorrit she thought he had even a more sinister look standing swart and cloaked in the snow than he had in the fire light over night But as both her father and her sister received his homage with some favour she refrained from expressing any distrust of him lest it should prove to be a new blemish derived from her prison birth Nevertheless as they wound down the rugged way while the convent was yet in sight she more than once looked round and descried mister Blandois backed by the convent smoke which rose straight and high from the chimneys in a golden film always standing on one jutting point looking down after them Long after he was a mere black stick in the snow she felt as though she could yet see that smile of his that high nose and those eyes that were too near it And even after that when the convent was gone and some light morning clouds veiled the pass below it the ghastly skeleton arms by the wayside seemed to be all pointing up at him More treacherous than snow perhaps colder at heart and harder to melt Blandois of Paris by degrees passed out of her mind as they came down into the softer regions Again the sun was warm again the streams descending from glaciers and snowy caverns were refreshing to drink at again they came among the pine trees the rocky rivulets the verdant heights and dales the wooden chalets and rough zigzag fences of Swiss country Sometimes the way so widened that she and her father could ride abreast And then to look at him handsomely clothed in his fur and broadcloths rich free numerously served and attended his eyes roving far away among the glories of the landscape no miserable screen before them to darken his sight and cast its shadow on him was enough Her uncle was so far rescued from that shadow of old that he wore the clothes they gave him and performed some ablutions as a sacrifice to the family credit and went where he was taken with a certain patient animal enjoyment which seemed to express that the air and change did him good In all other respects save one he shone with no light but such as was reflected from his brother His brother s greatness wealth freedom and grandeur pleased him without any reference to himself Silent and retiring he had no use for speech when he could hear his brother speak no desire to be waited on so that the servants devoted themselves to his brother The only noticeable change he originated in himself was an alteration in his manner to his younger niece Every day it refined more and more into a marked respect very rarely shown by age to youth and still more rarely susceptible one would have said of the fitness with which he invested it On those occasions when Miss Fanny did declare once for all he would take the next opportunity of baring his grey head before his younger niece and of helping her to alight or handing her to the carriage or showing her any other attention with the profoundest deference Yet it never appeared misplaced or forced being always heartily simple spontaneous and genuine Neither would he ever consent even at his brother s request to be helped to any place before her or to take precedence of her in anything So jealous was he of her being respected that on this very journey down from the Great Saint Bernard he took sudden and violent umbrage at the footman s being remiss to hold her stirrup though standing near when she dismounted and unspeakably astonished the whole retinue by charging at him on a hard headed mule riding him into a corner and threatening to trample him to death They were a goodly company and the Innkeepers all but worshipped them Wherever they went their importance preceded them in the person of the courier riding before to see that the rooms of state were ready He was the herald of the family procession The great travelling carriage came next containing inside mister Dorrit Miss Dorrit Miss Amy Dorrit and missus General outside some of the retainers and in fine weather Edward Dorrit Esquire for whom the box was reserved Then came the chariot containing Frederick Dorrit Esquire and an empty place occupied by Edward Dorrit Esquire in wet weather Then came the fourgon with the rest of the retainers the heavy baggage and as much as it could carry of the mud and dust which the other vehicles left behind These equipages adorned the yard of the hotel at Martigny on the return of the family from their mountain excursion Other vehicles were there much company being on the road from the patched Italian Vettura like the body of a swing from an English fair put upon a wooden tray on wheels and having another wooden tray without wheels put atop of it to the trim English carriage But there was another adornment of the hotel which mister Dorrit had not bargained for Two strange travellers embellished one of his rooms The Innkeeper hat in hand in the yard swore to the courier that he was blighted that he was desolated that he was profoundly afflicted that he was the most miserable and unfortunate of beasts that he had the head of a wooden pig He ought never to have made the concession he said but the very genteel lady had so passionately prayed him for the accommodation of that room to dine in only for a little half hour that he had been vanquished The little half hour was expired the lady and gentleman were taking their little dessert and half cup of coffee the note was paid the horses were ordered they would depart immediately but owing to an unhappy destiny and the curse of Heaven they were not yet gone Nothing could exceed mister Dorrit s indignation as he turned at the foot of the staircase on hearing these apologies He felt that the family dignity was struck at by an assassin s hand He had a sense of his dignity which was of the most exquisite nature He could detect a design upon it when nobody else had any perception of the fact His life was made an agony by the number of fine scalpels that he felt to be incessantly engaged in dissecting his dignity Is it possible sir said mister Dorrit reddening excessively that you have ha had the audacity to place one of my rooms at the disposition of any other person Thousands of pardons It was the host s profound misfortune to have been overcome by that too genteel lady He besought Monseigneur not to enrage himself He threw himself on Monseigneur for clemency If Monseigneur would have the distinguished goodness to occupy the other salon especially reserved for him for but five minutes all would go well No sir said mister Dorrit I will not occupy any salon I will leave your house without eating or drinking or setting foot in it How do you dare to act like this Who am I that you ha separate me from other gentlemen Alas The host called all the universe to witness that Monseigneur was the most amiable of the whole body of nobility the most important the most estimable the most honoured If he separated Monseigneur from others it was only because he was more distinguished more cherished more generous more renowned Don t tell me so sir returned mister Dorrit in a mighty heat You have affronted me You have heaped insults upon me How dare you Explain yourself Ah just Heaven then how could the host explain himself when he had nothing more to explain when he had only to apologise and confide himself to the so well known magnanimity of Monseigneur I tell you sir said mister Dorrit panting with anger that you separate me ha from other gentlemen that you make distinctions between me and other gentlemen of fortune and station I demand of you why I wish to know on ha what authority on whose authority Reply sir Explain Answer why Permit the landlord humbly to submit to Monsieur the Courier then that Monseigneur ordinarily so gracious enraged himself without cause There was no why Monsieur the Courier would represent to Monseigneur that he deceived himself in suspecting that there was any why but the why his devoted servant had already had the honour to present to him The very genteel lady Silence cried mister Dorrit Hold your tongue I will hear no more of the very genteel lady I will hear no more of you Look at this family my family a family more genteel than any lady You have treated this family with disrespect you have been insolent to this family I ll ruin you Ha send for the horses pack the carriages I ll not set foot in this man s house again No one had interfered in the dispute which was beyond the French colloquial powers of Edward Dorrit Esquire and scarcely within the province of the ladies Miss Fanny however now supported her father with great bitterness declaring in her native tongue that it was quite clear there was something special in this man s impertinence and that she considered it important that he should be by some means forced to give up his authority for making distinctions between that family and other wealthy families What the reasons of his presumption could be she was at a loss to imagine but reasons he must have and they ought to be torn from him All the guides mule drivers and idlers in the yard had made themselves parties to the angry conference and were much impressed by the courier s now bestirring himself to get the carriages out With the aid of some dozen people to each wheel this was done at a great cost of noise and then the loading was proceeded with pending the arrival of the horses from the post house But the very genteel lady s English chariot being already horsed and at the inn door the landlord had slipped up stairs to represent his hard case This was notified to the yard by his now coming down the staircase in attendance on the gentleman and the lady and by his pointing out the offended majesty of mister Dorrit to them with a significant motion of his hand Beg your pardon said the gentleman detaching himself from the lady and coming forward I am a man of few words and a bad hand at an explanation but lady here is extremely anxious that there should be no Row Lady a mother of mine in point of fact wishes me to say that she hopes no Row mister Dorrit still panting under his injury saluted the gentleman and saluted the lady in a distant final and invincible manner No but really here old feller you This was the gentleman s way of appealing to Edward Dorrit Esquire on whom he pounced as a great and providential relief Let you and I try to make this all right Lady so very much wishes no Row Edward Dorrit Esquire led a little apart by the button assumed a diplomatic expression of countenance in replying Why you must confess that when you bespeak a lot of rooms beforehand and they belong to you it s not pleasant to find other people in em No said the other I know it isn t I admit it Still let you and I try to make it all right and avoid Row The fault is not this chap s at all but my mother s Being a remarkably fine woman with no bigodd nonsense about her well educated too she was too many for this chap Regularly pocketed him If that s the case Edward Dorrit Esquire began Assure you pon my soul tis the case Consequently said the other gentleman retiring on his main position why Row Edmund said the lady from the doorway I hope you have explained or are explaining to the satisfaction of this gentleman and his family that the civil landlord is not to blame Assure you ma am returned Edmund perfectly paralysing myself with trying it on He then looked steadfastly at Edward Dorrit Esquire for some seconds and suddenly added in a burst of confidence Old feller Is it all right I don t know after all said the lady gracefully advancing a step or two towards mister Dorrit but that I had better say myself at once that I assured this good man I took all the consequences on myself of occupying one of a stranger s suite of rooms during his absence for just as much or as little time as I could dine in I had no idea the rightful owner would come back so soon nor had I any idea that he had come back or I should have hastened to make restoration of my ill gotten chamber and to have offered my explanation and apology I trust in saying this For a moment the lady with a glass at her eye stood transfixed and speechless before the two Miss Dorrits At the same moment Miss Fanny in the foreground of a grand pictorial composition formed by the family the family equipages and the family servants held her sister tight under one arm to detain her on the spot and with the other arm fanned herself with a distinguished air and negligently surveyed the lady from head to foot The lady recovering herself quickly for it was missus Merdle and she was not easily dashed went on to add that she trusted in saying this she apologised for her boldness and restored this well behaved landlord to the favour that was so very valuable to him mister Dorrit on the altar of whose dignity all this was incense made a gracious reply and said that his people should ha countermand his horses and he would hum overlook what he had at first supposed to be an affront but now regarded as an honour Upon this the bosom bent to him and its owner with a wonderful command of feature addressed a winning smile of adieu to the two sisters as young ladies of fortune in whose favour she was much prepossessed and whom she had never had the gratification of seeing before Not so however mister Sparkler This gentleman becoming transfixed at the same moment as his lady mother could not by any means unfix himself again but stood stiffly staring at the whole composition with Miss Fanny in the Foreground On his mother saying Edmund we are quite ready will you give me your arm he seemed by the motion of his lips to reply with some remark comprehending the form of words in which his shining talents found the most frequent utterance but he relaxed no muscle So fixed was his figure that it would have been matter of some difficulty to bend him sufficiently to get him in the carriage door if he had not received the timely assistance of a maternal pull from within He was no sooner within than the pad of the little window in the back of the chariot disappeared and his eye usurped its place There it remained as long as so small an object was discernible and probably much longer staring as though something inexpressibly surprising should happen to a codfish like an ill executed eye in a large locket This encounter was so highly agreeable to Miss Fanny and gave her so much to think of with triumph afterwards that it softened her asperities exceedingly When the procession was again in motion next day she occupied her place in it with a new gaiety and showed such a flow of spirits indeed that missus General looked rather surprised Little Dorrit was glad to be found no fault with and to see that Fanny was pleased but her part in the procession was a musing part and a quiet one Sitting opposite her father in the travelling carriage and recalling the old Marshalsea room her present existence was a dream All that she saw was new and wonderful but it was not real it seemed to her as if those visions of mountains and picturesque countries might melt away at any moment and the carriage turning some abrupt corner bring up with a jolt at the old Marshalsea gate To have no work to do was strange but not half so strange as having glided into a corner where she had no one to think for nothing to plan and contrive no cares of others to load herself with Strange as that was it was far stranger yet to find a space between herself and her father where others occupied themselves in taking care of him and where she was never expected to be At first this was so much more unlike her old experience than even the mountains themselves that she had been unable to resign herself to it and had tried to retain her old place about him But he had spoken to her alone and had said that people ha people in an exalted position my dear must scrupulously exact respect from their dependents and that for her his daughter Miss Amy Dorrit of the sole remaining branch of the Dorrits of Dorsetshire to be known to hum to occupy herself in fulfilling the functions of ha hum a valet would be incompatible with that respect Therefore my dear he ha he laid his parental injunctions upon her to remember that she was a lady who had now to conduct herself with hum a proper pride and to preserve the rank of a lady and consequently he requested her to abstain from doing what would occasion ha unpleasant and derogatory remarks She had obeyed without a murmur Thus it had been brought about that she now sat in her corner of the luxurious carriage with her little patient hands folded before her quite displaced even from the last point of the old standing ground in life on which her feet had lingered It was from this position that all she saw appeared unreal the more surprising the scenes the more they resembled the unreality of her own inner life as she went through its vacant places all day long The gorges of the Simplon its enormous depths and thundering waterfalls the wonderful road the points of danger where a loose wheel or a faltering horse would have been destruction the descent into Italy the opening of that beautiful land as the rugged mountain chasm widened and let them out from a gloomy and dark imprisonment all a dream only the old mean Marshalsea a reality Nay even the old mean Marshalsea was shaken to its foundations when she pictured it without her father She could scarcely believe that the prisoners were still lingering in the close yard that the mean rooms were still every one tenanted and that the turnkey still stood in the Lodge letting people in and out all just as she well knew it to be With a remembrance of her father s old life in prison hanging about her like the burden of a sorrowful tune Little Dorrit would wake from a dream of her birth place into a whole day s dream The painted room in which she awoke often a humbled state chamber in a dilapidated palace would begin it with its wild red autumnal vine leaves overhanging the glass its orange trees on the cracked white terrace outside the window a group of monks and peasants in the little street below misery and magnificence wrestling with each other upon every rood of ground in the prospect no matter how widely diversified and misery throwing magnificence with the strength of fate To this would succeed a labyrinth of bare passages and pillared galleries with the family procession already preparing in the quadrangle below through the carriages and luggage being brought together by the servants for the day s journey Then breakfast in another painted chamber damp stained and of desolate proportions and then the departure which to her timidity and sense of not being grand enough for her place in the ceremonies was always an uneasy thing For then the courier who himself would have been a foreign gentleman of high mark in the Marshalsea would present himself to report that all was ready and then her father s valet would pompously induct him into his travelling cloak and then Fanny s maid and her own maid who was a weight on Little Dorrit s mind absolutely made her cry at first she knew so little what to do with her would be in attendance and then her brother s man would complete his master s equipment and then her father would give his arm to missus General and her uncle would give his to her and escorted by the landlord and Inn servants they would swoop down stairs There a crowd would be collected to see them enter their carriages which amidst much bowing and begging and prancing and lashing and clattering they would do and so they would be driven madly through narrow unsavoury streets and jerked out at the town gate Among the day s unrealities would be roads where the bright red vines were looped and garlanded together on trees for many miles woods of olives white villages and towns on hill sides lovely without but frightful in their dirt and poverty within crosses by the way deep blue lakes with fairy islands and clustering boats with awnings of bright colours and sails of beautiful forms vast piles of building mouldering to dust hanging gardens where the weeds had grown so strong that their stems like wedges driven home had split the arch and rent the wall stone terraced lanes with the lizards running into and out of every chink beggars of all sorts everywhere pitiful picturesque hungry merry children beggars and aged beggars Often at posting houses and other halting places these miserable creatures would appear to her the only realities of the day and many a time when the money she had brought to give them was all given away she would sit with her folded hands thoughtfully looking after some diminutive girl leading her grey father as if the sight reminded her of something in the days that were gone Again there would be places where they stayed the week together in splendid rooms had banquets every day rode out among heaps of wonders walked through miles of palaces and rested in dark corners of great churches where there were winking lamps of gold and silver among pillars and arches kneeling figures dotted about at confessionals and on the pavements where there was the mist and scent of incense where there were pictures fantastic images gaudy altars great heights and distances all softly lighted through stained glass and the massive curtains that hung in the doorways From these cities they would go on again by the roads of vines and olives through squalid villages where there was not a hovel without a gap in its filthy walls not a window with a whole inch of glass or paper where there seemed to be nothing to support life nothing to eat nothing to make nothing to grow nothing to hope nothing to do but die Again they would come to whole towns of palaces whose proper inmates were all banished and which were all changed into barracks troops of idle soldiers leaning out of the state windows where their accoutrements hung drying on the marble architecture and showing to the mind like hosts of rats who were happily eating away the props of the edifices that supported them and must soon with them be smashed on the heads of the other swarms of soldiers and the swarms of priests and the swarms of spies who were all the ill looking population left to be ruined in the streets below Through such scenes the family procession moved on to Venice And here it dispersed for a time as they were to live in Venice some few months in a palace itself six times as big as the whole Marshalsea on the Grand Canal In this crowning unreality where all the streets were paved with water and where the deathlike stillness of the days and nights was broken by no sound but the softened ringing of church bells the rippling of the current and the cry of the gondoliers turning the corners of the flowing streets Little Dorrit quite lost by her task being done sat down to muse The family began a gay life went here and there and turned night into day but she was timid of joining in their gaieties and only asked leave to be left alone Sometimes she would step into one of the gondolas that were always kept in waiting moored to painted posts at the door when she could escape from the attendance of that oppressive maid who was her mistress and a very hard one and would be taken all over the strange city Social people in other gondolas began to ask each other who the little solitary girl was whom they passed sitting in her boat with folded hands looking so pensively and wonderingly about her Never thinking that it would be worth anybody s while to notice her or her doings Little Dorrit in her quiet scared lost manner went about the city none the less But her favourite station was the balcony of her own room overhanging the canal with other balconies below and none above It was of massive stone darkened by ages built in a wild fancy which came from the East to that collection of wild fancies and Little Dorrit was little indeed leaning on the broad cushioned ledge and looking over As she liked no place of an evening half so well she soon began to be watched for and many eyes in passing gondolas were raised and many people said There was the little figure of the English girl who was always alone Such people were not realities to the little figure of the English girl such people were all unknown to her She would watch the sunset in its long low lines of purple and red and its burning flush high up into the sky so glowing on the buildings and so lightening their structure that it made them look as if their strong walls were transparent and they shone from within She would watch those glories expire and then after looking at the black gondolas underneath taking guests to music and dancing would raise her eyes to the shining stars Was there no party of her own in other times on which the stars had shone To think of that old gate now She would think of that old gate and of herself sitting at it in the dead of the night pillowing Maggy s head and of other places and of other scenes associated with those different times And then she would lean upon her balcony and look over at the water as though they all lay underneath it When she got to that she would musingly watch its running as if in the general vision it might run dry and show her the prison again and herself and the old room and the old inmates and the old visitors all lasting realities that had never changed CHAPTER four A Letter from Little Dorrit Dear mister Clennam I write to you from my own room at Venice thinking you will be glad to hear from me But I know you cannot be so glad to hear from me as I am to write to you for everything about you is as you have been accustomed to see it and you miss nothing unless it should be me which can only be for a very little while together and very seldom while everything in my life is so strange and I miss so much When we were in Switzerland which appears to have been years ago though it was only weeks I met young missus Gowan who was on a mountain excursion like ourselves She told me she was very well and very happy She sent you the message by me that she thanked you affectionately and would never forget you She was quite confiding with me and I loved her almost as soon as I spoke to her But there is nothing singular in that who could help loving so beautiful and winning a creature I could not wonder at any one loving her No indeed It will not make you uneasy on missus Gowan s account I hope for I remember that you said you had the interest of a true friend in her if I tell you that I wish she could have married some one better suited to her mister Gowan seems fond of her and of course she is very fond of him but I thought he was not earnest enough I don t mean in that respect I mean in anything I could not keep it out of my mind that if I was missus Gowan what a change that would be and how I must alter to become like her I should feel that I was rather lonely and lost for the want of some one who was steadfast and firm in purpose I even thought she felt this want a little almost without knowing it But mind you are not made uneasy by this for she was very well and very happy And she looked most beautiful I expect to meet her again before long and indeed have been expecting for some days past to see her here I will ever be as good a friend to her as I can for your sake Dear mister Clennam I dare say you think little of having been a friend to me when I had no other not that I have any other now for I have made no new friends but I think much of it and I never can forget it I wish I knew but it is best for no one to write to me how mister and missus Plornish prosper in the business which my dear father bought for them and that old mister Nandy lives happily with them and his two grandchildren and sings all his songs over and over again I cannot quite keep back the tears from my eyes when I think of my poor Maggy and of the blank she must have felt at first however kind they all are to her without her Little Mother Will you go and tell her as a strict secret with my love that she never can have regretted our separation more than I have regretted it And will you tell them all that I have thought of them every day and that my heart is faithful to them everywhere O if you could know how faithful you would almost pity me for being so far away and being so grand You will be glad I am sure to know that my dear father is very well in health and that all these changes are highly beneficial to him and that he is very different indeed from what he used to be when you used to see him There is an improvement in my uncle too I think though he never complained of old and never exults now Fanny is very graceful quick and clever It is natural to her to be a lady she has adapted herself to our new fortunes with wonderful ease This reminds me that I have not been able to do so and that I sometimes almost despair of ever being able to do so I find that I cannot learn missus General is always with us and we speak French and speak Italian and she takes pains to form us in many ways When I say we speak French and Italian I mean they do As for me I am so slow that I scarcely get on at all As soon as I begin to plan and think and try all my planning thinking and trying go in old directions and I begin to feel careful again about the expenses of the day and about my dear father and about my work and then I remember with a start that there are no such cares left and that in itself is so new and improbable that it sets me wandering again I should not have the courage to mention this to any one but you It is the same with all these new countries and wonderful sights They are very beautiful and they astonish me but I am not collected enough not familiar enough with myself if you can quite understand what I mean to have all the pleasure in them that I might have What I knew before them blends with them too so curiously For instance when we were among the mountains I often felt I hesitate to tell such an idle thing dear mister Clennam even to you as if the Marshalsea must be behind that great rock or as if missus Clennam s room where I have worked so many days and where I first saw you must be just beyond that snow Do you remember one night when I came with Maggy to your lodging in Covent Garden That room I have often and often fancied I have seen before me travelling along for miles by the side of our carriage when I have looked out of the carriage window after dark We were shut out that night and sat at the iron gate and walked about till morning I often look up at the stars even from the balcony of this room and believe that I am in the street again shut out with Maggy It is the same with people that I left in England When I go about here in a gondola I surprise myself looking into other gondolas as if I hoped to see them It would overcome me with joy to see them but I don t think it would surprise me much at first In my fanciful times I fancy that they might be anywhere and I almost expect to see their dear faces on the bridges or the quays Another difficulty that I have will seem very strange to you It must seem very strange to any one but me and does even to me I often feel the old sad pity for I need not write the word for him Changed as he is and inexpressibly blest and thankful as I always am to know it the old sorrowful feeling of compassion comes upon me sometimes with such strength that I want to put my arms round his neck tell him how I love him and cry a little on his breast I should be glad after that and proud and happy But I know that I must not do this that he would not like it that Fanny would be angry that missus General would be amazed and so I quiet myself Yet in doing so I struggle with the feeling that I have come to be at a distance from him and that even in the midst of all the servants and attendants he is deserted and in want of me Dear mister Clennam I have written a great deal about myself but I must write a little more still or what I wanted most of all to say in this weak letter would be left out of it In all these foolish thoughts of mine which I have been so hardy as to confess to you because I know you will understand me if anybody can and will make more allowance for me than anybody else would if you cannot in all these thoughts there is one thought scarcely ever never out of my memory and that is that I hope you sometimes in a quiet moment have a thought for me I must tell you that as to this I have felt ever since I have been away an anxiety which I am very anxious to relieve I have been afraid that you may think of me in a new light or a new character Don t do that I could not bear that it would make me more unhappy than you can suppose It would break my heart to believe that you thought of me in any way that would make me stranger to you than I was when you were so good to me What I have to pray and entreat of you is that you will never think of me as the daughter of a rich person that you will never think of me as dressing any better or living any better than when you first knew me That you will remember me only as the little shabby girl you protected with so much tenderness from whose threadbare dress you have kept away the rain and whose wet feet you have dried at your fire That you will think of me when you think of me at all and of my true affection and devoted gratitude always without change as of your poor child LITTLE DORRIT P S Particularly remember that you are not to be uneasy about missus Gowan Her words were Very well and very happy And she looked most beautiful CHAPTER five Something Wrong Somewhere The family had been a month or two at Venice when mister Dorrit who was much among Counts and Marquises and had but scant leisure set an hour of one day apart beforehand for the purpose of holding some conference with missus General The time he had reserved in his mind arriving he sent mister Tinkler his valet to missus General s apartment which would have absorbed about a third of the area of the Marshalsea to present his compliments to that lady and represent him as desiring the favour of an interview It being that period of the forenoon when the various members of the family had coffee in their own chambers some couple of hours before assembling at breakfast in a faded hall which had once been sumptuous but was now the prey of watery vapours and a settled melancholy missus General was accessible to the valet That envoy found her on a little square of carpet so extremely diminutive in reference to the size of her stone and marble floor that she looked as if she might have had it spread for the trying on of a ready made pair of shoes or as if she had come into possession of the enchanted piece of carpet bought for forty purses by one of the three princes in the Arabian Nights and had that moment been transported on it at a wish into a palatial saloon with which it had no connection missus General replying to the envoy as she set down her empty coffee cup that she was willing at once to proceed to mister Dorrit s apartment and spare him the trouble of coming to her which in his gallantry he had proposed the envoy threw open the door and escorted missus General to the presence It was quite a walk by mysterious staircases and corridors from missus General s apartment hoodwinked by a narrow side street with a low gloomy bridge in it and dungeon like opposite tenements their walls besmeared with a thousand downward stains and streaks as if every crazy aperture in them had been weeping tears of rust into the Adriatic for centuries to mister Dorrit s apartment with a whole English house front of window a prospect of beautiful church domes rising into the blue sky sheer out of the water which reflected them and a hushed murmur of the Grand Canal laving the doorways below where his gondolas and gondoliers attended his pleasure drowsily swinging in a little forest of piles mister Dorrit in a resplendent dressing gown and cap the dormant grub that had so long bided its time among the Collegians had burst into a rare butterfly rose to receive missus General A chair to missus General An easier chair sir what are you doing what are you about what do you mean Now leave us missus General said mister Dorrit I took the liberty By no means missus General interposed I was quite at your disposition I had had my coffee I took the liberty said mister Dorrit again with the magnificent placidity of one who was above correction to solicit the favour of a little private conversation with you because I feel rather worried respecting my ha my younger daughter You will have observed a great difference of temperament madam between my two daughters Said missus General in response crossing her gloved hands she was never without gloves and they never creased and always fitted There is a great difference May I ask to be favoured with your view of it said mister Dorrit with a deference not incompatible with majestic serenity Fanny returned missus General has force of character and self reliance Amy none None O missus General ask the Marshalsea stones and bars O missus General ask the milliner who taught her to work and the dancing master who taught her sister to dance O missus General missus General ask me her father what I owe her and hear my testimony touching the life of this slighted little creature from her childhood up No such adjuration entered mister Dorrit s head He looked at missus General seated in her usual erect attitude on her coach box behind the proprieties and he said in a thoughtful manner True madam I would not said missus General be understood to say observe that there is nothing to improve in Fanny But there is material there perhaps indeed a little too much Will you be kind enough madam said mister Dorrit to be ha more explicit I do not quite understand my elder daughter s having hum too much material What material Fanny returned missus General at present forms too many opinions Perfect breeding forms none and is never demonstrative Lest he himself should be found deficient in perfect breeding mister Dorrit hastened to reply Unquestionably madam you are right missus General returned in her emotionless and expressionless manner I believe so But you are aware my dear madam said mister Dorrit that my daughters had the misfortune to lose their lamented mother when they were very young and that in consequence of my not having been until lately the recognised heir to my property they have lived with me as a comparatively poor though always proud gentleman in ha hum retirement I do not said missus General lose sight of the circumstance Madam pursued mister Dorrit of my daughter Fanny under her present guidance and with such an example constantly before her missus General shut her eyes I have no misgivings There is adaptability of character in Fanny But my younger daughter missus General rather worries and vexes my thoughts I must inform you that she has always been my favourite There is no accounting said missus General for these partialities Ha no assented mister Dorrit No Now madam I am troubled by noticing that Amy is not so to speak one of ourselves She does not Care to go about with us she is lost in the society we have here our tastes are evidently not her tastes Which said mister Dorrit summing up with judicial gravity is to say in other words that there is something wrong in ha Amy May we incline to the supposition said missus General with a little touch of varnish that something is referable to the novelty of the position Excuse me madam observed mister Dorrit rather quickly The daughter of a gentleman though ha himself at one time comparatively far from affluent comparatively and herself reared in hum retirement need not of necessity find this position so very novel True said missus General true Therefore madam said mister Dorrit I took the liberty he laid an emphasis on the phrase and repeated it as though he stipulated with urbane firmness that he must not be contradicted again I took the liberty of requesting this interview in order that I might mention the topic to you and inquire how you would advise me mister Dorrit returned missus General I have conversed with Amy several times since we have been residing here on the general subject of the formation of a demeanour She has expressed herself to me as wondering exceedingly at Venice I have mentioned to her that it is better not to wonder I have pointed out to her that the celebrated mister Eustace the classical tourist did not think much of it and that he compared the Rialto greatly to its disadvantage with Westminster and Blackfriars Bridges I need not add after what you have said that I have not yet found my arguments successful You do me the honour to ask me what to advise It always appears to me if this should prove to be a baseless assumption I shall be pardoned that mister Dorrit has been accustomed to exercise influence over the minds of others Hum madam said mister Dorrit I have been at the head of ha of a considerable community You are right in supposing that I am not unaccustomed to an influential position I am happy returned missus General to be so corroborated I would therefore the more confidently recommend that mister Dorrit should speak to Amy himself and make his observations and wishes known to her Being his favourite besides and no doubt attached to him she is all the more likely to yield to his influence I had anticipated your suggestion madam said mister Dorrit but ha was not sure that I might hum not encroach on On my province mister Dorrit said missus General graciously Do not mention it Then with your leave madam resumed mister Dorrit ringing his little bell to summon his valet I will send for her at once Does mister Dorrit wish me to remain Perhaps if you have no other engagement you would not object for a minute or two Not at all So Tinkler the valet was instructed to find Miss Amy s maid and to request that subordinate to inform Miss Amy that mister Dorrit wished to see her in his own room In delivering this charge to Tinkler mister Dorrit looked severely at him and also kept a jealous eye upon him until he went out at the door mistrusting that he might have something in his mind prejudicial to the family dignity that he might have even got wind of some Collegiate joke before he came into the service and might be derisively reviving its remembrance at the present moment If Tinkler had happened to smile however faintly and innocently nothing would have persuaded mister Dorrit to the hour of his death but that this was the case As Tinkler happened however very fortunately for himself to be of a serious and composed countenance he escaped the secret danger that threatened him And as on his return when mister Dorrit eyed him again he announced Miss Amy as if she had come to a funeral he left a vague impression on mister Dorrit s mind that he was a well conducted young fellow who had been brought up in the study of his Catechism by a widowed mother Amy said mister Dorrit you have just now been the subject of some conversation between myself and missus General We agree that you scarcely seem at home here Ha how is this A pause I think father I require a little time Papa is a preferable mode of address observed missus General Father is rather vulgar my dear The word Papa besides gives a pretty form to the lips Papa potatoes poultry prunes and prism are all very good words for the lips especially prunes and prism You will find it serviceable in the formation of a demeanour if you sometimes say to yourself in company on entering a room for instance Papa potatoes poultry prunes and prism prunes and prism Pray my child said mister Dorrit attend to the hum precepts of missus General Poor Little Dorrit with a rather forlorn glance at that eminent varnisher promised to try You say Amy pursued mister Dorrit that you think you require time Time for what Another pause To become accustomed to the novelty of my life was all I meant said Little Dorrit with her loving eyes upon her father whom she had very nearly addressed as poultry if not prunes and prism too in her desire to submit herself to missus General and please him mister Dorrit frowned and looked anything but pleased Amy he returned it appears to me I must say that you have had abundance of time for that Ha you surprise me You disappoint me Fanny has conquered any such little difficulties and hum why not you I hope I shall do better soon said Little Dorrit I hope so returned her father I ha I most devoutly hope so Amy I sent for you in order that I might say hum impressively say in the presence of missus General to whom we are all so much indebted for obligingly being present among us on ha on this or any other occasion missus General shut her eyes that I ha hum am not pleased with you You make missus General s a thankless task You ha embarrass me very much You have always as I have informed missus General been my favourite child I have always made you a hum a friend and companion in return I beg I ha I do beg that you accommodate yourself better to hum circumstances and dutifully do what becomes your your station mister Dorrit was even a little more fragmentary than usual being excited on the subject and anxious to make himself particularly emphatic I do beg he repeated that this may be attended to and that you will seriously take pains and try to conduct yourself in a manner both becoming your position as ha Miss Amy Dorrit and satisfactory to myself and missus General That lady shut her eyes again on being again referred to then slowly opening them and rising added these words If Miss Amy Dorrit will direct her own attention to and will accept of my poor assistance in the formation of a surface mister Dorrit will have no further cause of anxiety May I take this opportunity of remarking as an instance in point that it is scarcely delicate to look at vagrants with the attention which I have seen bestowed upon them by a very dear young friend of mine They should not be looked at Nothing disagreeable should ever be looked at Apart from such a habit standing in the way of that graceful equanimity of surface which is so expressive of good breeding it hardly seems compatible with refinement of mind A truly refined mind will seem to be ignorant of the existence of anything that is not perfectly proper placid and pleasant Having delivered this exalted sentiment missus General made a sweeping obeisance and retired with an expression of mouth indicative of Prunes and Prism Little Dorrit whether speaking or silent had preserved her quiet earnestness and her loving look It had not been clouded except for a passing moment until now But now that she was left alone with him the fingers of her lightly folded hands were agitated and there was repressed emotion in her face Not for herself She might feel a little wounded but her care was not for herself Her thoughts still turned as they always had turned to him A faint misgiving which had hung about her since their accession to fortune that even now she could never see him as he used to be before the prison days had gradually begun to assume form in her mind She felt that in what he had just now said to her and in his whole bearing towards her there was the well known shadow of the Marshalsea wall It took a new shape but it was the old sad shadow She began with sorrowful unwillingness to acknowledge to herself that she was not strong enough to keep off the fear that no space in the life of man could overcome that quarter of a century behind the prison bars She had no blame to bestow upon him therefore nothing to reproach him with no emotions in her faithful heart but great compassion and unbounded tenderness This is why it was that even as he sat before her on his sofa in the brilliant light of a bright Italian day the wonderful city without and the splendours of an old palace within she saw him at the moment in the long familiar gloom of his Marshalsea lodging and wished to take her seat beside him and comfort him and be again full of confidence with him and of usefulness to him If he divined what was in her thoughts his own were not in tune with it After some uneasy moving in his seat he got up and walked about looking very much dissatisfied Is there anything else you wish to say to me dear father No no Nothing else I am sorry you have not been pleased with me dear I hope you will not think of me with displeasure now I am going to try more than ever to adapt myself as you wish to what surrounds me for indeed I have tried all along though I have failed I know Amy he returned turning short upon her You ha habitually hurt me Hurt you father I There is a hum a topic said mister Dorrit looking all about the ceiling of the room and never at the attentive uncomplainingly shocked face a painful topic a series of events which I wish ha altogether to obliterate This is understood by your sister who has already remonstrated with you in my presence it is understood by your brother it is understood by ha hum by every one of delicacy and sensitiveness except yourself ha I am sorry to say except yourself You Amy hum you alone and only you constantly revive the topic though not in words She laid her hand on his arm She did nothing more She gently touched him The trembling hand may have said with some expression Think of me think how I have worked think of my many cares But she said not a syllable herself There was a reproach in the touch so addressed to him that she had not foreseen or she would have withheld her hand He began to justify himself in a heated stumbling angry manner which made nothing of it I was there all those years I was ha universally acknowledged as the head of the place I hum I caused you to be respected there Amy I ha hum I gave my family a position there I deserve a return I claim a return I say sweep it off the face of the earth and begin afresh Is that much I ask is that much He did not once look at her as he rambled on in this way but gesticulated at and appealed to the empty air I have suffered Probably I know how much I have suffered better than any one ha I say than any one If I can put that aside if I can eradicate the marks of what I have endured and can emerge before the world a ha gentleman unspoiled unspotted is it a great deal to expect I say again is it a great deal to expect that my children should hum do the same and sweep that accursed experience off the face of the earth In spite of his flustered state he made all these exclamations in a carefully suppressed voice lest the valet should overhear anything Accordingly they do it Your sister does it Your brother does it You alone my favourite child whom I made the friend and companion of my life when you were a mere hum Baby do not do it You alone say you can t do it I provide you with valuable assistance to do it I attach an accomplished and highly bred lady ha missus General to you for the purpose of doing it Is it surprising that I should be displeased Is it necessary that I should defend myself for expressing my displeasure No Notwithstanding which he continued to defend himself without any abatement of his flushed mood I am careful to appeal to that lady for confirmation before I express any displeasure at all I hum I necessarily make that appeal within limited bounds or I ha should render legible by that lady what I desire to be blotted out Am I selfish Do I complain for my own sake No No Principally for ha hum your sake Amy This last consideration plainly appeared from his manner of pursuing it to have just that instant come into his head I said I was hurt So I am So I ha am determined to be whatever is advanced to the contrary I am hurt that my daughter seated in the hum lap of fortune should mope and retire and proclaim herself unequal to her destiny I am hurt that she should ha systematically reproduce what the rest of us blot out and seem hum I had almost said positively anxious to announce to wealthy and distinguished society that she was born and bred in ha hum a place that I myself decline to name But there is no inconsistency ha not the least in my feeling hurt and yet complaining principally for your sake Amy I do I say again I do It is for your sake that I wish you under the auspices of missus General to form a hum a surface It is for your sake that I wish you to have a ha truly refined mind and in the striking words of missus General to be ignorant of everything that is not perfectly proper placid and pleasant He had been running down by jerks during his last speech like a sort of ill adjusted alarum The touch was still upon his arm He fell silent and after looking about the ceiling again for a little while looked down at her Her head drooped and he could not see her face but her touch was tender and quiet and in the expression of her dejected figure there was no blame nothing but love He began to whimper just as he had done that night in the prison when she afterwards sat at his bedside till morning exclaimed that he was a poor ruin and a poor wretch in the midst of his wealth and clasped her in his arms Hush hush my own dear Kiss me was all she said to him His tears were soon dried much sooner than on the former occasion and he was presently afterwards very high with his valet as a way of righting himself for having shed any With one remarkable exception to be recorded in its place this was the only time in his life of freedom and fortune when he spoke to his daughter Amy of the old days But now the breakfast hour arrived and with it Miss Fanny from her apartment and mister Edward from his apartment Both these young persons of distinction were something the worse for late hours As to Miss Fanny she had become the victim of an insatiate mania for what she called going into society and would have gone into it head foremost fifty times between sunset and sunrise if so many opportunities had been at her disposal As to mister Edward he too had a large acquaintance and was generally engaged for the most part in diceing circles or others of a kindred nature during the greater part of every night For this gentleman when his fortunes changed had stood at the great advantage of being already prepared for the highest associates and having little to learn so much was he indebted to the happy accidents which had made him acquainted with horse dealing and billiard marking At breakfast mister Frederick Dorrit likewise appeared As the old gentleman inhabited the highest story of the palace where he might have practised pistol shooting without much chance of discovery by the other inmates his younger niece had taken courage to propose the restoration to him of his clarionet which mister Dorrit had ordered to be confiscated but which she had ventured to preserve Notwithstanding some objections from Miss Fanny that it was a low instrument and that she detested the sound of it the concession had been made But it was then discovered that he had had enough of it and never played it now that it was no longer his means of getting bread He had insensibly acquired a new habit of shuffling into the picture galleries always with his twisted paper of snuff in his hand much to the indignation of Miss Fanny who had proposed the purchase of a gold box for him that the family might not be discredited which he had absolutely refused to carry when it was bought and of passing hours and hours before the portraits of renowned Venetians It was never made out what his dazed eyes saw in them whether he had an interest in them merely as pictures or whether he confusedly identified them with a glory that was departed like the strength of his own mind But he paid his court to them with great exactness and clearly derived pleasure from the pursuit After the first few days Little Dorrit happened one morning to assist at these attentions It so evidently heightened his gratification that she often accompanied him afterwards and the greatest delight of which the old man had shown himself susceptible since his ruin arose out of these excursions when he would carry a chair about for her from picture to picture and stand behind it in spite of all her remonstrances silently presenting her to the noble Venetians It fell out that at this family breakfast he referred to their having seen in a gallery on the previous day the lady and gentleman whom they had encountered on the Great Saint Bernard I forget the name said he I dare say you remember them William I dare say you do Edward I remember em well enough said the latter I should think so observed Miss Fanny with a toss of her head and a glance at her sister But they would not have been recalled to our remembrance I suspect if Uncle hadn t tumbled over the subject My dear what a curious phrase said missus General Would not inadvertently lighted upon or accidentally referred to be better Thank you very much missus General returned the young lady no I think not On the whole I prefer my own expression This was always Miss Fanny s way of receiving a suggestion from missus General But she always stored it up in her mind and adopted it at another time I should have mentioned our having met mister and missus Gowan Fanny said Little Dorrit even if Uncle had not I have scarcely seen you since you know I meant to have spoken of it at breakfast because I should like to pay a visit to missus Gowan and to become better acquainted with her if Papa and missus General do not object Well Amy said Fanny I am sure I am glad to find you at last expressing a wish to become better acquainted with anybody in Venice Though whether mister and missus Gowan are desirable acquaintances remains to be determined missus Gowan I spoke of dear No doubt said Fanny But you can t separate her from her husband I believe without an Act of Parliament Do you think Papa inquired Little Dorrit with diffidence and hesitation there is any objection to my making this visit Really he replied I ha what is missus General s view missus General s view was that not having the honour of any acquaintance with the lady and gentleman referred to she was not in a position to varnish the present article She could only remark as a general principle observed in the varnishing trade that much depended on the quarter from which the lady under consideration was accredited to a family so conspicuously niched in the social temple as the family of Dorrit At this remark the face of mister Dorrit gloomed considerably He was about connecting the accrediting with an obtrusive person of the name of Clennam whom he imperfectly remembered in some former state of existence to black ball the name of Gowan finally when Edward Dorrit Esquire came into the conversation with his glass in his eye and the preliminary remark of I say you there Go out will you which was addressed to a couple of men who were handing the dishes round as a courteous intimation that their services could be temporarily dispensed with Those menials having obeyed the mandate Edward Dorrit Esquire proceeded Perhaps it s a matter of policy to let you all know that these Gowans in whose favour or at least the gentleman s I can t be supposed to be much prepossessed myself are known to people of importance if that makes any difference That I would say observed the fair varnisher Makes the greatest difference The connection in question being really people of importance and consideration As to that said Edward Dorrit Esquire I ll give you the means of judging for yourself You are acquainted perhaps with the famous name of Merdle The great Merdle exclaimed missus General THE Merdle said Edward Dorrit Esquire They are known to him missus Gowan I mean the dowager my polite friend s mother is intimate with missus Merdle and I know these two to be on their visiting list If so a more undeniable guarantee could not be given said missus General to mister Dorrit raising her gloves and bowing her head as if she were doing homage to some visible graven image I beg to ask my son from motives of ah curiosity mister Dorrit observed with a decided change in his manner how he becomes possessed of this hum timely information It s not a long story sir returned Edward Dorrit Esquire and you shall have it out of hand To begin with missus Merdle is the lady you had the parley with at what s his name place Martigny interposed Miss Fanny with an air of infinite languor Martigny assented her brother with a slight nod and a slight wink in acknowledgment of which Miss Fanny looked surprised and laughed and reddened How can that be Edward said mister Dorrit You informed me that the name of the gentleman with whom you conferred was ha Sparkler Indeed you showed me his card Hum Sparkler No doubt of it father but it doesn t follow that his mother s name must be the same missus Merdle was married before and he is her son She is in Rome now where probably we shall know more of her as you decide to winter there Sparkler is just come here I passed last evening in company with Sparkler Sparkler is a very good fellow on the whole though rather a bore on one subject in consequence of being tremendously smitten with a certain young lady Here Edward Dorrit Esquire eyed Miss Fanny through his glass across the table We happened last night to compare notes about our travels and I had the information I have given you from Sparkler himself Here he ceased continuing to eye Miss Fanny through his glass with a face much twisted and not ornamentally so in part by the action of keeping his glass in his eye and in part by the great subtlety of his smile Under these circumstances said mister Dorrit I believe I express the sentiments of ha missus General no less than my own when I say that there is no objection but ha hum quite the contrary to your gratifying your desire Amy I trust I may ha hail this desire said mister Dorrit in an encouraging and forgiving manner as an auspicious omen It is quite right to know these people It is a very proper thing mister Merdle s is a name of ha world wide repute mister Merdle s undertakings are immense They bring him in such vast sums of money that they are regarded as hum national benefits mister Merdle is the man of this time The name of Merdle is the name of the age Pray do everything on my behalf that is civil to mister and missus Gowan for we will ha we will certainly notice them This magnificent accordance of mister Dorrit s recognition settled the matter It was not observed that Uncle had pushed away his plate and forgotten his breakfast but he was not much observed at any time except by Little Dorrit The servants were recalled and the meal proceeded to its conclusion missus General rose and left the table Little Dorrit rose and left the table When Edward and Fanny remained whispering together across it and when mister Dorrit remained eating figs and reading a French newspaper Uncle suddenly fixed the attention of all three by rising out of his chair striking his hand upon the table and saying Brother I protest against it If he had made a proclamation in an unknown tongue and given up the ghost immediately afterwards he could not have astounded his audience more The paper fell from mister Dorrit s hand and he sat petrified with a fig half way to his mouth Brother said the old man conveying a surprising energy into his trembling voice I protest against it I love you you know I love you dearly In these many years I have never been untrue to you in a single thought Weak as I am I would at any time have struck any man who spoke ill of you But brother brother brother I protest against it It was extraordinary to see of what a burst of earnestness such a decrepit man was capable His eyes became bright his grey hair rose on his head markings of purpose on his brow and face which had faded from them for five and twenty years started out again and there was an energy in his hand that made its action nervous once more My dear Frederick exclaimed mister Dorrit faintly What is wrong What is the matter How dare you said the old man turning round on Fanny how dare you do it Have you no memory Have you no heart Uncle cried Fanny affrighted and bursting into tears why do you attack me in this cruel manner What have I done Done returned the old man pointing to her sister s place where s your affectionate invaluable friend Where s your devoted guardian Where s your more than mother How dare you set up superiorities against all these characters combined in your sister For shame you false girl for shame I love Amy cried Miss Fanny sobbing and weeping as well as I love my life better than I love my life I don t deserve to be so treated I am as grateful to Amy and as fond of Amy as it s possible for any human being to be I wish I was dead I never was so wickedly wronged And only because I am anxious for the family credit To the winds with the family credit cried the old man with great scorn and indignation Brother I protest against pride I protest against ingratitude I protest against any one of us here who have known what we have known and have seen what we have seen setting up any pretension that puts Amy at a moment s disadvantage or to the cost of a moment s pain We may know that it s a base pretension by its having that effect It ought to bring a judgment on us Brother I protest against it in the sight of God As his hand went up above his head and came down on the table it might have been a blacksmith s After a few moments silence it had relaxed into its usual weak condition He went round to his brother with his ordinary shuffling step put the hand on his shoulder and said in a softened voice William my dear I felt obliged to say it forgive me for I felt obliged to say it and then went in his bowed way out of the palace hall just as he might have gone out of the Marshalsea room All this time Fanny had been sobbing and crying and still continued to do so Edward beyond opening his mouth in amazement had not opened his lips and had done nothing but stare mister Dorrit also had been utterly discomfited and quite unable to assert himself in any way Fanny was now the first to speak I never never never was so used she sobbed There never was anything so harsh and unjustifiable so disgracefully violent and cruel Dear kind quiet little Amy too what would she feel if she could know that she had been innocently the means of exposing me to such treatment But I ll never tell her No good darling I ll never tell her This helped mister Dorrit to break his silence My dear said he I ha approve of your resolution It will be ha hum much better not to speak of this to Amy It might hum it might distress her Ha No doubt it would distress her greatly It is considerate and right to avoid doing so We will ha keep this to ourselves But the cruelty of Uncle cried Miss Fanny O I never can forgive the wanton cruelty of Uncle My dear said mister Dorrit recovering his tone though he remained unusually pale I must request you not to say so You must remember that your uncle is ha not what he formerly was You must remember that your uncle s state requires hum great forbearance from us great forbearance I am sure cried Fanny piteously it is only charitable to suppose that there Must be something wrong in him somewhere or he never could have so attacked Me of all the people in the world Fanny returned mister Dorrit in a deeply fraternal tone you know with his innumerable good points what a hum wreck your uncle is and I entreat you by the fondness that I have for him and by the fidelity that you know I have always shown him to ha to draw your own conclusions and to spare my brotherly feelings This ended the scene Edward Dorrit Esquire saying nothing throughout but looking to the last perplexed and doubtful Miss Fanny awakened much affectionate uneasiness in her sister s mind that day by passing the greater part of it in violent fits of embracing her and in alternately giving her brooches and wishing herself dead CHAPTER six Something Right Somewhere To be in the halting state of mister Henry Gowan to have left one of two powers in disgust to want the necessary qualifications for finding promotion with another and to be loitering moodily about on neutral ground cursing both is to be in a situation unwholesome for the mind which time is not likely to improve The worst class of sum worked in the every day world is cyphered by the diseased arithmeticians who are always in the rule of Subtraction as to the merits and successes of others and never in Addition as to their own The habit too of seeking some sort of recompense in the discontented boast of being disappointed is a habit fraught with degeneracy A certain idle carelessness and recklessness of consistency soon comes of it To bring deserving things down by setting undeserving things up is one of its perverted delights and there is no playing fast and loose with the truth in any game without growing the worse for it In his expressed opinions of all performances in the Art of painting that were completely destitute of merit Gowan was the most liberal fellow on earth He would declare such a man to have more power in his little finger provided he had none than such another had provided he had much in his whole mind and body If the objection were taken that the thing commended was trash he would reply on behalf of his art My good fellow what do we all turn out but trash I turn out nothing else and I make you a present of the confession To make a vaunt of being poor was another of the incidents of his splenetic state though this may have had the design in it of showing that he ought to be rich just as he would publicly laud and decry the Barnacles lest it should be forgotten that he belonged to the family Howbeit these two subjects were very often on his lips and he managed them so well that he might have praised himself by the month together and not have made himself out half so important a man as he did by his light disparagement of his claims on anybody s consideration Out of this same airy talk of his it always soon came to be understood wherever he and his wife went that he had married against the wishes of his exalted relations and had had much ado to prevail on them to countenance her He never made the representation on the contrary seemed to laugh the idea to scorn but it did happen that with all his pains to depreciate himself he was always in the superior position From the days of their honeymoon Minnie Gowan felt sensible of being usually regarded as the wife of a man who had made a descent in marrying her but whose chivalrous love for her had cancelled that inequality To Venice they had been accompanied by Monsieur Blandois of Paris and at Venice Monsieur Blandois of Paris was very much in the society of Gowan When they had first met this gallant gentleman at Geneva Gowan had been undecided whether to kick him or encourage him and had remained for about four and twenty hours so troubled to settle the point to his satisfaction that he had thought of tossing up a five franc piece on the terms Tails kick heads encourage and abiding by the voice of the oracle It chanced however that his wife expressed a dislike to the engaging Blandois and that the balance of feeling in the hotel was against him Upon it Gowan resolved to encourage him Why this perversity if it were not in a generous fit which it was not Why should Gowan very much the superior of Blandois of Paris and very well able to pull that prepossessing gentleman to pieces and find out the stuff he was made of take up with such a man In the first place he opposed the first separate wish he observed in his wife because her father had paid his debts and it was desirable to take an early opportunity of asserting his independence In the second place he opposed the prevalent feeling because with many capacities of being otherwise he was an ill conditioned man He found a pleasure in declaring that a courtier with the refined manners of Blandois ought to rise to the greatest distinction in any polished country He found a pleasure in setting up Blandois as the type of elegance and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces He seriously protested that the bow of Blandois was perfect that the address of Blandois was irresistible and that the picturesque ease of Blandois would be cheaply purchased if it were not a gift and unpurchasable for a hundred thousand francs That exaggeration in the manner of the man which has been noticed as appertaining to him and to every such man whatever his original breeding as certainly as the sun belongs to this system was acceptable to Gowan as a caricature which he found it a humorous resource to have at hand for the ridiculing of numbers of people who necessarily did more or less of what Blandois overdid Thus he had taken up with him and thus negligently strengthening these inclinations with habit and idly deriving some amusement from his talk he had glided into a way of having him for a companion This though he supposed him to live by his wits at play tables and the like though he suspected him to be a coward while he himself was daring and courageous though he thoroughly knew him to be disliked by Minnie and though he cared so little for him after all that if he had given her any tangible personal cause to regard him with aversion he would have had no compunction whatever in flinging him out of the highest window in Venice into the deepest water of the city Little Dorrit would have been glad to make her visit to missus Gowan alone but as Fanny who had not yet recovered from her Uncle s protest though it was four and twenty hours of age pressingly offered her company the two sisters stepped together into one of the gondolas under mister Dorrit s window and with the courier in attendance were taken in high state to missus Gowan s lodging In truth their state was rather too high for the lodging which was as Fanny complained fearfully out of the way and which took them through a complexity of narrow streets of water which the same lady disparaged as mere ditches The house on a little desert island looked as if it had broken away from somewhere else and had floated by chance into its present anchorage in company with a vine almost as much in want of training as the poor wretches who were lying under its leaves The features of the surrounding picture were a church with hoarding and scaffolding about it which had been under suppositious repair so long that the means of repair looked a hundred years old and had themselves fallen into decay a quantity of washed linen spread to dry in the sun a number of houses at odds with one another and grotesquely out of the perpendicular like rotten pre Adamite cheeses cut into fantastic shapes and full of mites and a feverish bewilderment of windows with their lattice blinds all hanging askew and something draggled and dirty dangling out of most of them On the first floor of the house was a Bank a surprising experience for any gentleman of commercial pursuits bringing laws for all mankind from a British city where two spare clerks like dried dragoons in green velvet caps adorned with golden tassels stood bearded behind a small counter in a small room containing no other visible objects than an empty iron safe with the door open a jug of water and a papering of garland of roses but who on lawful requisition by merely dipping their hands out of sight could produce exhaustless mounds of five franc pieces Below the Bank was a suite of three or four rooms with barred windows which had the appearance of a jail for criminal rats Above the Bank was missus Gowan s residence Notwithstanding that its walls were blotched as if missionary maps were bursting out of them to impart geographical knowledge notwithstanding that its weird furniture was forlornly faded and musty and that the prevailing Venetian odour of bilge water and an ebb tide on a weedy shore was very strong the place was better within than it promised The door was opened by a smiling man like a reformed assassin a temporary servant who ushered them into the room where missus Gowan sat with the announcement that two beautiful English ladies were come to see the mistress missus Gowan who was engaged in needlework put her work aside in a covered basket and rose a little hurriedly Miss Fanny was excessively courteous to her and said the usual nothings with the skill of a veteran Papa was extremely sorry proceeded Fanny to be engaged to day he is so much engaged here our acquaintance being so wretchedly large and particularly requested me to bring his card for mister Gowan That I may be sure to acquit myself of a commission which he impressed upon me at least a dozen times allow me to relieve my conscience by placing it on the table at once Which she did with veteran ease We have been said Fanny charmed to understand that you know the Merdles We hope it may be another means of bringing us together They are friends said missus Gowan of mister Gowan s family I have not yet had the pleasure of a personal introduction to missus Merdle but I suppose I shall be presented to her at Rome Indeed returned Fanny with an appearance of amiably quenching her own superiority I think you ll like her You know her very well Why you see said Fanny with a frank action of her pretty shoulders in London one knows every one We met her on our way here and to say the truth papa was at first rather cross with her for taking one of the rooms that our people had ordered for us However of course that soon blew over and we were all good friends again Although the visit had as yet given Little Dorrit no opportunity of conversing with missus Gowan there was a silent understanding between them which did as well She looked at missus Gowan with keen and unabated interest the sound of her voice was thrilling to her nothing that was near her or about her or at all concerned her escaped Little Dorrit She was quicker to perceive the slightest matter here than in any other case but one You have been quite well she now said since that night Quite my dear And you Oh I am always well said Little Dorrit timidly I yes thank you There was no reason for her faltering and breaking off other than that missus Gowan had touched her hand in speaking to her and their looks had met Something thoughtfully apprehensive in the large soft eyes had checked Little Dorrit in an instant You don t know that you are a favourite of my husband s and that I am almost bound to be jealous of you said missus Gowan Little Dorrit blushing shook her head He will tell you if he tells you what he tells me that you are quieter and quicker of resource than any one he ever saw He speaks far too well of me said Little Dorrit I doubt that but I don t at all doubt that I must tell him you are here I should never be forgiven if I were to let you and Miss Dorrit go without doing so May I You can excuse the disorder and discomfort of a painter s studio The inquiries were addressed to Miss Fanny who graciously replied that she would be beyond anything interested and enchanted missus Gowan went to a door looked in beyond it and came back Do Henry the favour to come in said she I knew he would be pleased The first object that confronted Little Dorrit entering first was Blandois of Paris in a great cloak and a furtive slouched hat standing on a throne platform in a corner as he had stood on the Great Saint Bernard when the warning arms seemed to be all pointing up at him She recoiled from this figure as it smiled at her Don t be alarmed said Gowan coming from his easel behind the door It s only Blandois He is doing duty as a model to day I am making a study of him It saves me money to turn him to some use We poor painters have none to spare Blandois of Paris pulled off his slouched hat and saluted the ladies without coming out of his corner A thousand pardons said he But the Professore here is so inexorable with me that I am afraid to stir Don t stir then said Gowan coolly as the sisters approached the easel Let the ladies at least see the original of the daub that they may know what it s meant for There he stands you see A bravo waiting for his prey a distinguished noble waiting to save his country the common enemy waiting to do somebody a bad turn an angelic messenger waiting to do somebody a good turn whatever you think he looks most like Say Professore Mio a poor gentleman waiting to do homage to elegance and beauty remarked Blandois Or say Cattivo Soggetto Mio returned Gowan touching the painted face with his brush in the part where the real face had moved a murderer after the fact Show that white hand of yours Blandois Put it outside the cloak Keep it still Blandois hand was unsteady but he laughed and that would naturally shake it He was formerly in some scuffle with another murderer or with a victim you observe said Gowan putting in the markings of the hand with a quick impatient unskilful touch and these are the tokens of it Outside the cloak man Corpo di San Marco what are you thinking of Blandois of Paris shook with a laugh again so that his hand shook more now he raised it to twist his moustache which had a damp appearance and now he stood in the required position with a little new swagger His face was so directed in reference to the spot where Little Dorrit stood by the easel that throughout he looked at her Once attracted by his peculiar eyes she could not remove her own and they had looked at each other all the time She trembled now Gowan feeling it and supposing her to be alarmed by the large dog beside him whose head she caressed in her hand and who had just uttered a low growl glanced at her to say He won t hurt you Miss Dorrit I am not afraid of him she returned in the same breath but will you look at him In a moment Gowan had thrown down his brush and seized the dog with both hands by the collar Blandois How can you be such a fool as to provoke him By Heaven and the other place too he ll tear you to bits Lie down Lion Do you hear my voice you rebel The great dog regardless of being half choked by his collar was obdurately pulling with his dead weight against his master resolved to get across the room He had been crouching for a spring at the moment when his master caught him Lion Lion He was up on his hind legs and it was a wrestle between master and dog Get back Down Lion Get out of his sight Blandois What devil have you conjured into the dog I have done nothing to him Get out of his sight or I can t hold the wild beast Get out of the room By my soul he ll kill you The dog with a ferocious bark made one other struggle as Blandois vanished then in the moment of the dog s submission the master little less angry than the dog felled him with a blow on the head and standing over him struck him many times severely with the heel of his boot so that his mouth was presently bloody Now get you into that corner and lie down said Gowan or I ll take you out and shoot you Lion did as he was ordered and lay down licking his mouth and chest Lion s master stopped for a moment to take breath and then recovering his usual coolness of manner turned to speak to his frightened wife and her visitors Probably the whole occurrence had not occupied two minutes Come come Minnie You know he is always good humoured and tractable Blandois must have irritated him made faces at him The dog has his likings and dislikings and Blandois is no great favourite of his but I am sure you will give him a character Minnie for never having been like this before Minnie was too much disturbed to say anything connected in reply Little Dorrit was already occupied in soothing her Fanny who had cried out twice or thrice held Gowan s arm for protection Lion deeply ashamed of having caused them this alarm came trailing himself along the ground to the feet of his mistress You furious brute said Gowan striking him with his foot again You shall do penance for this And he struck him again and yet again O pray don t punish him any more cried Little Dorrit Don t hurt him See how gentle he is At her entreaty Gowan spared him and he deserved her intercession for truly he was as submissive and as sorry and as wretched as a dog could be It was not easy to recover this shock and make the visit unrestrained even though Fanny had not been under the best of circumstances the least trifle in the way In such further communication as passed among them before the sisters took their departure Little Dorrit fancied it was revealed to her that mister Gowan treated his wife even in his very fondness too much like a beautiful child He seemed so unsuspicious of the depths of feeling which she knew must lie below that surface that she doubted if there could be any such depths in himself She wondered whether his want of earnestness might be the natural result of his want of such qualities and whether it was with people as with ships that in too shallow and rocky waters their anchors had no hold and they drifted anywhere He attended them down the staircase jocosely apologising for the poor quarters to which such poor fellows as himself were limited and remarking that when the high and mighty Barnacles his relatives who would be dreadfully ashamed of them presented him with better he would live in better to oblige them At the water s edge they were saluted by Blandois who looked white enough after his late adventure but who made very light of it notwithstanding laughing at the mention of Lion Leaving the two together under the scrap of vine upon the causeway Gowan idly scattering the leaves from it into the water and Blandois lighting a cigarette the sisters were paddled away in state as they had come They had not glided on for many minutes when Little Dorrit became aware that Fanny was more showy in manner than the occasion appeared to require and looking about for the cause through the window and through the open door saw another gondola evidently in waiting on them As this gondola attended their progress in various artful ways sometimes shooting on a head and stopping to let them pass sometimes when the way was broad enough skimming along side by side with them and sometimes following close astern and as Fanny gradually made no disguise that she was playing off graces upon somebody within it of whom she at the same time feigned to be unconscious Little Dorrit at length asked who it was To which Fanny made the short answer That gaby Who said Little Dorrit My dear child returned Fanny in a tone suggesting that before her Uncle s protest she might have said You little fool instead how slow you are Young Sparkler She lowered the window on her side and leaning back and resting her elbow on it negligently fanned herself with a rich Spanish fan of black and gold The attendant gondola having skimmed forward again with some swift trace of an eye in the window Fanny laughed coquettishly and said Did you ever see such a fool my love Do you think he means to follow you all the way asked Little Dorrit My precious child returned Fanny I can t possibly answer for what an idiot in a state of desperation may do but I should think it highly probable It s not such an enormous distance All Venice would scarcely be that I imagine if he s dying for a glimpse of me And is he asked Little Dorrit in perfect simplicity Well my love that really is an awkward question for me to answer said her sister I believe he is You had better ask Edward He tells Edward he is I believe I understand he makes a perfect spectacle of himself at the Casino and that sort of places by going on about me But you had better ask Edward if you want to know I wonder he doesn t call said Little Dorrit after thinking a moment My dear Amy your wonder will soon cease if I am rightly informed I should not be at all surprised if he called to day The creature has only been waiting to get his courage up I suspect Will you see him Indeed my darling said Fanny that s just as it may happen Here he is again Look at him O you simpleton mister Sparkler had undeniably a weak appearance with his eye in the window like a knot in the glass and no reason on earth for stopping his bark suddenly except the real reason When you asked me if I will see him my dear said Fanny almost as well composed in the graceful indifference of her attitude as missus Merdle herself what do you mean I mean said Little Dorrit I think I rather mean what do you mean dear Fanny Fanny laughed again in a manner at once condescending arch and affable and said putting her arm round her sister in a playfully affectionate way Now tell me my little pet When we saw that woman at Martigny how did you think she carried it off Did you see what she decided on in a moment No Fanny Then I ll tell you Amy She settled with herself now I ll never refer to that meeting under such different circumstances and I ll never pretend to have any idea that these are the same girls That s her way out of a difficulty What did I tell you when we came away from Harley Street that time She is as insolent and false as any woman in the world But in the first capacity my love she may find people who can match her A significant turn of the Spanish fan towards Fanny s bosom indicated with great expression where one of these people was to be found Not only that pursued Fanny but she gives the same charge to Young Sparkler and doesn t let him come after me until she has got it thoroughly into his most ridiculous of all ridiculous noddles for one really can t call it a head that he is to pretend to have been first struck with me in that Inn Yard Why asked Little Dorrit Why Good gracious my love again very much in the tone of You stupid little creature how can you ask Don t you see that I may have become a rather desirable match for a noddle And don t you see that she puts the deception upon us and makes a pretence while she shifts it from her own shoulders very good shoulders they are too I must say observed Miss Fanny glancing complacently at herself of considering our feelings But we can always go back to the plain truth Yes but if you please we won t retorted Fanny No I am not going to have that done Amy The pretext is none of mine it s hers and she shall have enough of it In the triumphant exaltation of her feelings Miss Fanny using her Spanish fan with one hand squeezed her sister s waist with the other as if she were crushing missus Merdle No repeated Fanny She shall find me go her way She took it and I ll follow it And with the blessing of fate and fortune I ll go on improving that woman s acquaintance until I have given her maid before her eyes things from my dressmaker s ten times as handsome and expensive as she once gave me from hers Little Dorrit was silent sensible that she was not to be heard on any question affecting the family dignity and unwilling to lose to no purpose her sister s newly and unexpectedly restored favour She could not concur but she was silent Fanny well knew what she was thinking of so well that she soon asked her Her reply was Do you mean to encourage mister Sparkler Fanny Encourage him my dear said her sister smiling contemptuously that depends upon what you call encourage No I don t mean to encourage him But I ll make a slave of him Little Dorrit glanced seriously and doubtfully in her face but Fanny was not to be so brought to a check She furled her fan of black and gold and used it to tap her sister s nose with the air of a proud beauty and a great spirit who toyed with and playfully instructed a homely companion I shall make him fetch and carry my dear and I shall make him subject to me And if I don t make his mother subject to me too it shall not be my fault Do you think dear Fanny don t be offended we are so comfortable together now that you can quite see the end of that course I can t say I have so much as looked for it yet my dear answered Fanny with supreme indifference all in good time Such are my intentions And really they have taken me so long to develop that here we are at home And Young Sparkler at the door inquiring who is within By the merest accident of course In effect the swain was standing up in his gondola card case in hand affecting to put the question to a servant This conjunction of circumstances led to his immediately afterwards presenting himself before the young ladies in a posture which in ancient times would not have been considered one of favourable augury for his suit since the gondoliers of the young ladies having been put to some inconvenience by the chase so neatly brought their own boat in the gentlest collision with the bark of mister Sparkler as to tip that gentleman over like a larger species of ninepin and cause him to exhibit the soles of his shoes to the object of his dearest wishes while the nobler portions of his anatomy struggled at the bottom of his boat in the arms of one of his men However as Miss Fanny called out with much concern Was the gentleman hurt mister Sparkler rose more restored than might have been expected and stammered for himself with blushes Not at all so Miss Fanny had no recollection of having ever seen him before and was passing on with a distant inclination of her head when he announced himself by name Even then she was in a difficulty from being unable to call it to mind until he explained that he had had the honour of seeing her at Martigny Then she remembered him and hoped his lady mother was well Thank you stammered mister Sparkler she s uncommonly well at least poorly In Venice said Miss Fanny In Rome mister Sparkler answered I am here by myself myself I came to call upon mister Edward Dorrit myself Indeed upon mister Dorrit likewise In fact upon the family Turning graciously to the attendants Miss Fanny inquired whether her papa or brother was within The reply being that they were both within mister Sparkler humbly offered his arm Miss Fanny accepting it was squired up the great staircase by mister Sparkler who if he still believed which there is not any reason to doubt that she had no nonsense about her rather deceived himself Arrived in a mouldering reception room where the faded hangings of a sad sea green had worn and withered until they looked as if they might have claimed kindred with the waifs of seaweed drifting under the windows or clinging to the walls and weeping for their imprisoned relations Miss Fanny despatched emissaries for her father and brother Pending whose appearance she showed to great advantage on a sofa completing mister Sparkler s conquest with some remarks upon Dante known to that gentleman as an eccentric man in the nature of an Old File who used to put leaves round his head and sit upon a stool for some unaccountable purpose outside the cathedral at Florence mister Dorrit welcomed the visitor with the highest urbanity and most courtly manners He inquired particularly after missus Merdle He inquired particularly after mister Merdle mister Sparkler said or rather twitched out of himself in small pieces by the shirt collar that missus Merdle having completely used up her place in the country and also her house at Brighton and being of course unable don t you see to remain in London when there wasn t a soul there and not feeling herself this year quite up to visiting about at people s places had resolved to have a touch at Rome where a woman like herself with a proverbially fine appearance and with no nonsense about her couldn t fail to be a great acquisition As to mister Merdle he was so much wanted by the men in the City and the rest of those places and was such a doosed extraordinary phenomenon in Buying and Banking and that that mister Sparkler doubted if the monetary system of the country would be able to spare him though that his work was occasionally one too many for him and that he would be all the better for a temporary shy at an entirely new scene and climate mister Sparkler did not conceal As to himself mister Sparkler conveyed to the Dorrit family that he was going on rather particular business wherever they were going This immense conversational achievement required time but was effected Being effected mister Dorrit expressed his hope that mister Sparkler would shortly dine with them mister Sparkler received the idea so kindly that mister Dorrit asked what he was going to do that day for instance As he was going to do nothing that day his usual occupation and one for which he was particularly qualified he was secured without postponement being further bound over to accompany the ladies to the Opera in the evening At dinner time mister Sparkler rose out of the sea like Venus s son taking after his mother and made a splendid appearance ascending the great staircase If Fanny had been charming in the morning she was now thrice charming very becomingly dressed in her most suitable colours and with an air of negligence upon her that doubled mister Sparkler s fetters and riveted them I hear you are acquainted mister Sparkler said his host at dinner with ha mister Gowan mister Henry Gowan Perfectly sir returned mister Sparkler His mother and my mother are cronies in fact If I had thought of it Amy said mister Dorrit with a patronage as magnificent as that of Lord Decimus himself you should have despatched a note to them asking them to dine to day Some of our people could have ha fetched them and taken them home We could have spared a hum gondola for that purpose I am sorry to have forgotten this Pray remind me of them to morrow Little Dorrit was not without doubts how mister Henry Gowan might take their patronage but she promised not to fail in the reminder Pray does mister Henry Gowan paint ha Portraits inquired mister Dorrit mister Sparkler opined that he painted anything if he could get the job He has no particular walk said mister Dorrit mister Sparkler stimulated by Love to brilliancy replied that for a particular walk a man ought to have a particular pair of shoes as for example shooting shooting shoes cricket cricket shoes Whereas he believed that Henry Gowan had no particular pair of shoes No speciality said mister Dorrit This being a very long word for mister Sparkler and his mind being exhausted by his late effort he replied No thank you I seldom take it Well said mister Dorrit It would be very agreeable to me to present a gentleman so connected with some ha Testimonial of my desire to further his interests and develop the hum germs of his genius I think I must engage mister Gowan to paint my picture If the result should be ha mutually satisfactory I might afterwards engage him to try his hand upon my family The exquisitely bold and original thought presented itself to mister Sparkler that there was an opening here for saying there were some of the family emphasising some in a marked manner to whom no painter could render justice But for want of a form of words in which to express the idea it returned to the skies This was the more to be regretted as Miss Fanny greatly applauded the notion of the portrait and urged her papa to act upon it She surmised she said that mister Gowan had lost better and higher opportunities by marrying his pretty wife and Love in a cottage painting pictures for dinner was so delightfully interesting that she begged her papa to give him the commission whether he could paint a likeness or not though indeed both she and Amy knew he could from having seen a speaking likeness on his easel that day and having had the opportunity of comparing it with the original These remarks made mister Sparkler as perhaps they were intended to do nearly distracted for while on the one hand they expressed Miss Fanny s susceptibility of the tender passion she herself showed such an innocent unconsciousness of his admiration that his eyes goggled in his head with jealousy of an unknown rival Descending into the sea again after dinner and ascending out of it at the Opera staircase preceded by one of their gondoliers like an attendant Merman with a great linen lantern they entered their box and mister Sparkler entered on an evening of agony The theatre being dark and the box light several visitors lounged in during the representation in whom Fanny was so interested and in conversation with whom she fell into such charming attitudes as she had little confidences with them and little disputes concerning the identity of people in distant boxes that the wretched Sparkler hated all mankind But he had two consolations at the close of the performance She gave him her fan to hold while she adjusted her cloak and it was his blessed privilege to give her his arm down stairs again These crumbs of encouragement mister Sparkler thought would just keep him going and it is not impossible that Miss Dorrit thought so too The Merman with his light was ready at the box door and other Mermen with other lights were ready at many of the doors The Dorrit Merman held his lantern low to show the steps and mister Sparkler put on another heavy set of fetters over his former set as he watched her radiant feet twinkling down the stairs beside him Among the loiterers here was Blandois of Paris He spoke and moved forward beside Fanny Little Dorrit was in front with her brother and missus General mister Dorrit had remained at home but on the brink of the quay they all came together She started again to find Blandois close to her handing Fanny into the boat Gowan has had a loss he said since he was made happy to day by a visit from fair ladies A loss repeated Fanny relinquished by the bereaved Sparkler and taking her seat A loss said Blandois His dog Lion Little Dorrit s hand was in his as he spoke He is dead said Blandois Dead echoed Little Dorrit That noble dog Faith dear ladies said Blandois smiling and shrugging his shoulders somebody has poisoned that noble dog He is as dead as the Doges CHAPTER seven Mostly Prunes and Prism missus General always on her coach box keeping the proprieties well together took pains to form a surface on her very dear young friend and missus General s very dear young friend tried hard to receive it Hard as she had tried in her laborious life to attain many ends she had never tried harder than she did now to be varnished by missus General It made her anxious and ill at ease to be operated upon by that smoothing hand it is true but she submitted herself to the family want in its greatness as she had submitted herself to the family want in its littleness and yielded to her own inclinations in this thing no more than she had yielded to her hunger itself in the days when she had saved her dinner that her father might have his supper One comfort that she had under the Ordeal by General was more sustaining to her and made her more grateful than to a less devoted and affectionate spirit not habituated to her struggles and sacrifices might appear quite reasonable and indeed it may often be observed in life that spirits like Little Dorrit do not appear to reason half as carefully as the folks who get the better of them The continued kindness of her sister was this comfort to Little Dorrit It was nothing to her that the kindness took the form of tolerant patronage she was used to that It was nothing to her that it kept her in a tributary position and showed her in attendance on the flaming car in which Miss Fanny sat on an elevated seat exacting homage she sought no better place Always admiring Fanny s beauty and grace and readiness and not now asking herself how much of her disposition to be strongly attached to Fanny was due to her own heart and how much to Fanny s she gave her all the sisterly fondness her great heart contained The wholesale amount of Prunes and Prism which missus General infused into the family life combined with the perpetual plunges made by Fanny into society left but a very small residue of any natural deposit at the bottom of the mixture This rendered confidences with Fanny doubly precious to Little Dorrit and heightened the relief they afforded her Amy said Fanny to her one night when they were alone after a day so tiring that Little Dorrit was quite worn out though Fanny would have taken another dip into society with the greatest pleasure in life I am going to put something into your little head You won t guess what it is I suspect I don t think that s likely dear said Little Dorrit Come I ll give you a clue child said Fanny missus General Prunes and Prism in a thousand combinations having been wearily in the ascendant all day everything having been surface and varnish and show without substance Little Dorrit looked as if she had hoped that missus General was safely tucked up in bed for some hours Now can you guess Amy said Fanny No dear Unless I have done anything said Little Dorrit rather alarmed and meaning anything calculated to crack varnish and ruffle surface Fanny was so very much amused by the misgiving that she took up her favourite fan being then seated at her dressing table with her armoury of cruel instruments about her most of them reeking from the heart of Sparkler and tapped her sister frequently on the nose with it laughing all the time Oh our Amy our Amy said Fanny What a timid little goose our Amy is But this is nothing to laugh at On the contrary I am very cross my dear As it is not with me Fanny I don t mind returned her sister smiling Ah But I do mind said Fanny and so will you Pet when I enlighten you Amy has it never struck you that somebody is monstrously polite to missus General Everybody is polite to missus General said Little Dorrit Because Because she freezes them into it interrupted Fanny I don t mean that quite different from that Come Has it never struck you Amy that Pa is monstrously polite to missus General Amy murmuring No looked quite confounded No I dare say not But he is said Fanny He is Amy And remember my words missus General has designs on Pa Dear Fanny do you think it possible that missus General has designs on any one Do I think it possible retorted Fanny My love I know it I tell you she has designs on Pa And more than that I tell you Pa considers her such a wonder such a paragon of accomplishment and such an acquisition to our family that he is ready to get himself into a state of perfect infatuation with her at any moment And that opens a pretty picture of things I hope Think of me with missus General for a Mama Little Dorrit did not reply Think of me with missus General for a Mama but she looked anxious and seriously inquired what had led Fanny to these conclusions Lord my darling said Fanny tartly You might as well ask me how I know when a man is struck with myself But of course I do know It happens pretty often but I always know it I know this in much the same way I suppose At all events I know it You never heard Papa say anything Say anything repeated Fanny My dearest darling child what necessity has he had yet awhile to say anything And you have never heard missus General say anything My goodness me Amy returned Fanny is she the sort of woman to say anything Isn t it perfectly plain and clear that she has nothing to do at present but to hold herself upright keep her aggravating gloves on and go sweeping about Say anything If she had the ace of trumps in her hand at whist she wouldn t say anything child It would come out when she played it At least you may be mistaken Fanny Now may you not O yes I MAY be said Fanny but I am not However I am glad you can contemplate such an escape my dear and I am glad that you can take this for the present with sufficient coolness to think of such a chance It makes me hope that you may be able to bear the connection I should not be able to bear it and I should not try I d marry young Sparkler first O you would never marry him Fanny under any circumstances Upon my word my dear rejoined that young lady with exceeding indifference I wouldn t positively answer even for that There s no knowing what might happen Especially as I should have many opportunities afterwards of treating that woman his mother in her own style Which I most decidedly should not be slow to avail myself of Amy No more passed between the sisters then but what had passed gave the two subjects of missus General and mister Sparkler great prominence in Little Dorrit s mind and thenceforth she thought very much of both missus General having long ago formed her own surface to such perfection that it hid whatever was below it if anything no observation was to be made in that quarter mister Dorrit was undeniably very polite to her and had a high opinion of her but Fanny impetuous at most times might easily be wrong for all that Whereas the Sparkler question was on the different footing that any one could see what was going on there and Little Dorrit saw it and pondered on it with many doubts and wonderings The devotion of mister Sparkler was only to be equalled by the caprice and cruelty of his enslaver Sometimes she would prefer him to such distinction of notice that he would chuckle aloud with joy next day or next hour she would overlook him so completely and drop him into such an abyss of obscurity that he would groan under a weak pretence of coughing The constancy of his attendance never touched Fanny though he was so inseparable from Edward that when that gentleman wished for a change of society he was under the irksome necessity of gliding out like a conspirator in disguised boats and by secret doors and back ways though he was so solicitous to know how mister Dorrit was that he called every other day to inquire as if mister Dorrit were the prey of an intermittent fever though he was so constantly being paddled up and down before the principal windows that he might have been supposed to have made a wager for a large stake to be paddled a thousand miles in a thousand hours though whenever the gondola of his mistress left the gate the gondola of mister Sparkler shot out from some watery ambush and gave chase as if she were a fair smuggler and he a custom house officer It was probably owing to this fortification of the natural strength of his constitution with so much exposure to the air and the salt sea that mister Sparkler did not pine outwardly but whatever the cause he was so far from having any prospect of moving his mistress by a languishing state of health that he grew bluffer every day and that peculiarity in his appearance of seeming rather a swelled boy than a young man became developed to an extraordinary degree of ruddy puffiness Blandois calling to pay his respects mister Dorrit received him with affability as the friend of mister Gowan and mentioned to him his idea of commissioning mister Gowan to transmit him to posterity Blandois highly extolling it it occurred to mister Dorrit that it might be agreeable to Blandois to communicate to his friend the great opportunity reserved for him Blandois accepted the commission with his own free elegance of manner and swore he would discharge it before he was an hour older On his imparting the news to Gowan that Master gave mister Dorrit to the Devil with great liberality some round dozen of times for he resented patronage almost as much as he resented the want of it and was inclined to quarrel with his friend for bringing him the message It may be a defect in my mental vision Blandois said he but may I die if I see what you have to do with this Death of my life replied Blandois nor I neither except that I thought I was serving my friend By putting an upstart s hire in his pocket said Gowan frowning Do you mean that Tell your other friend to get his head painted for the sign of some public house and to get it done by a sign painter Who am I and who is he Professore returned the ambassador and who is Blandois Without appearing at all interested in the latter question Gowan angrily whistled mister Dorrit away But next day he resumed the subject by saying in his off hand manner and with a slighting laugh Well Blandois when shall we go to this Maecenas of yours We journeymen must take jobs when we can get them When shall we go and look after this job When you will said the injured Blandois as you please What have I to do with it What is it to me I can tell you what it is to me said Gowan Bread and cheese One must eat So come along my Blandois mister Dorrit received them in the presence of his daughters and of mister Sparkler who happened by some surprising accident to be calling there How are you Sparkler said Gowan carelessly When you have to live by your mother wit old boy I hope you may get on better than I do mister Dorrit then mentioned his proposal Sir said Gowan laughing after receiving it gracefully enough I am new to the trade and not expert at its mysteries I believe I ought to look at you in various lights tell you you are a capital subject and consider when I shall be sufficiently disengaged to devote myself with the necessary enthusiasm to the fine picture I mean to make of you I assure you and he laughed again I feel quite a traitor in the camp of those dear gifted good noble fellows my brother artists by not doing the hocus pocus better But I have not been brought up to it and it s too late to learn it Now the fact is I am a very bad painter but not much worse than the generality If you are going to throw away a hundred guineas or so I am as poor as a poor relation of great people usually is and I shall be very much obliged to you if you ll throw them away upon me I ll do the best I can for the money and if the best should be bad why even then you may probably have a bad picture with a small name to it instead of a bad picture with a large name to it This tone though not what he had expected on the whole suited mister Dorrit remarkably well It showed that the gentleman highly connected and not a mere workman would be under an obligation to him He expressed his satisfaction in placing himself in mister Gowan s hands and trusted that he would have the pleasure in their characters of private gentlemen of improving his acquaintance You are very good said Gowan I have not forsworn society since I joined the brotherhood of the brush the most delightful fellows on the face of the earth and am glad enough to smell the old fine gunpowder now and then though it did blow me into mid air and my present calling You ll not think mister Dorrit and here he laughed again in the easiest way that I am lapsing into the freemasonry of the craft for it s not so upon my life I can t help betraying it wherever I go though by Jupiter I love and honour the craft with all my might if I propose a stipulation as to time and place Ha mister Dorrit could erect no hum suspicion of that kind on mister Gowan s frankness Again you are very good said Gowan mister Dorrit I hear you are going to Rome I am going to Rome having friends there Let me begin to do you the injustice I have conspired to do you there not here We shall all be hurried during the rest of our stay here and though there s not a poorer man with whole elbows in Venice than myself I have not quite got all the Amateur out of me yet comprising the trade again you see and can t fall on to order in a hurry for the mere sake of the sixpences These remarks were not less favourably received by mister Dorrit than their predecessors They were the prelude to the first reception of mister and missus Gowan at dinner and they skilfully placed Gowan on his usual ground in the new family His wife too they placed on her usual ground Miss Fanny understood with particular distinctness that missus Gowan s good looks had cost her husband very dear that there had been a great disturbance about her in the Barnacle family and that the Dowager missus Gowan nearly heart broken had resolutely set her face against the marriage until overpowered by her maternal feelings missus General likewise clearly understood that the attachment had occasioned much family grief and dissension Of honest mister Meagles no mention was made except that it was natural enough that a person of that sort should wish to raise his daughter out of his own obscurity and that no one could blame him for trying his best to do so Little Dorrit s interest in the fair subject of this easily accepted belief was too earnest and watchful to fail in accurate observation She could see that it had its part in throwing upon missus Gowan the touch of a shadow under which she lived and she even had an instinctive knowledge that there was not the least truth in it But it had an influence in placing obstacles in the way of her association with missus Gowan by making the Prunes and Prism school excessively polite to her but not very intimate with her and Little Dorrit as an enforced sizar of that college was obliged to submit herself humbly to its ordinances Nevertheless there was a sympathetic understanding already established between the two which would have carried them over greater difficulties and made a friendship out of a more restricted intercourse As though accidents were determined to be favourable to it they had a new assurance of congeniality in the aversion which each perceived that the other felt towards Blandois of Paris an aversion amounting to the repugnance and horror of a natural antipathy towards an odious creature of the reptile kind And there was a passive congeniality between them besides this active one To both of them Blandois behaved in exactly the same manner and to both of them his manner had uniformly something in it which they both knew to be different from his bearing towards others The difference was too minute in its expression to be perceived by others but they knew it to be there A mere trick of his evil eyes a mere turn of his smooth white hand a mere hair s breadth of addition to the fall of his nose and the rise of the moustache in the most frequent movement of his face conveyed to both of them equally a swagger personal to themselves It was as if he had said I have a secret power in this quarter I know what I know This had never been felt by them both in so great a degree and never by each so perfectly to the knowledge of the other as on a day when he came to mister Dorrit s to take his leave before quitting Venice missus Gowan was herself there for the same purpose and he came upon the two together the rest of the family being out The two had not been together five minutes and the peculiar manner seemed to convey to them You were going to talk about me Ha Behold me here to prevent it Gowan is coming here said Blandois with a smile missus Gowan replied he was not coming Not coming said Blandois Permit your devoted servant when you leave here to escort you home Thank you I am not going home Not going home said Blandois Then I am forlorn That he might be but he was not so forlorn as to roam away and leave them together He sat entertaining them with his finest compliments and his choicest conversation but he conveyed to them all the time No no no dear ladies Behold me here expressly to prevent it He conveyed it to them with so much meaning and he had such a diabolical persistency in him that at length missus Gowan rose to depart On his offering his hand to missus Gowan to lead her down the staircase she retained Little Dorrit s hand in hers with a cautious pressure and said No thank you But if you will please to see if my boatman is there I shall be obliged to you It left him no choice but to go down before them As he did so hat in hand missus Gowan whispered He killed the dog Does mister Gowan know it Little Dorrit whispered No one knows it Don t look towards me look towards him He will turn his face in a moment No one knows it but I am sure he did You are I I think so Little Dorrit answered Henry likes him and he will not think ill of him he is so generous and open himself But you and I feel sure that we think of him as he deserves He argued with Henry that the dog had been already poisoned when he changed so and sprang at him Henry believes it but we do not I see he is listening but can t hear Good bye my love Good bye The last words were spoken aloud as the vigilant Blandois stopped turned his head and looked at them from the bottom of the staircase Assuredly he did look then though he looked his politest as if any real philanthropist could have desired no better employment than to lash a great stone to his neck and drop him into the water flowing beyond the dark arched gateway in which he stood No such benefactor to mankind being on the spot he handed missus Gowan to her boat and stood there until it had shot out of the narrow view when he handed himself into his own boat and followed Little Dorrit had sometimes thought and now thought again as she retraced her steps up the staircase that he had made his way too easily into her father s house But so many and such varieties of people did the same through mister Dorrit s participation in his elder daughter s society mania that it was hardly an exceptional case A perfect fury for making acquaintances on whom to impress their riches and importance had seized the House of Dorrit It appeared on the whole to Little Dorrit herself that this same society in which they lived greatly resembled a superior sort of Marshalsea Numbers of people seemed to come abroad pretty much as people had come into the prison through debt through idleness relationship curiosity and general unfitness for getting on at home They were brought into these foreign towns in the custody of couriers and local followers just as the debtors had been brought into the prison They prowled about the churches and picture galleries much in the old dreary prison yard manner They were usually going away again to morrow or next week and rarely knew their own minds and seldom did what they said they would do or went where they said they would go in all this again very like the prison debtors They paid high for poor accommodation and disparaged a place while they pretended to like it which was exactly the Marshalsea custom They were envied when they went away by people left behind feigning not to want to go and that again was the Marshalsea habit invariably A certain set of words and phrases as much belonging to tourists as the College and the Snuggery belonged to the jail was always in their mouths They had precisely the same incapacity for settling down to anything as the prisoners used to have they rather deteriorated one another as the prisoners used to do and they wore untidy dresses and fell into a slouching way of life still always like the people in the Marshalsea The period of the family s stay at Venice came in its course to an end and they moved with their retinue to Rome Through a repetition of the former Italian scenes growing more dirty and more haggard as they went on and bringing them at length to where the very air was diseased they passed to their destination A fine residence had been taken for them on the Corso and there they took up their abode in a city where everything seemed to be trying to stand still for ever on the ruins of something else except the water which following eternal laws tumbled and rolled from its glorious multitude of fountains Here it seemed to Little Dorrit that a change came over the Marshalsea spirit of their society and that Prunes and Prism got the upper hand Everybody was walking about saint Peter s and the Vatican on somebody else s cork legs and straining every visible object through somebody else s sieve Nobody said what anything was but everybody said what the missus Generals mister Eustace or somebody else said it was The whole body of travellers seemed to be a collection of voluntary human sacrifices bound hand and foot and delivered over to mister Eustace and his attendants to have the entrails of their intellects arranged according to the taste of that sacred priesthood Through the rugged remains of temples and tombs and palaces and senate halls and theatres and amphitheatres of ancient days hosts of tongue tied and blindfolded moderns were carefully feeling their way incessantly repeating Prunes and Prism in the endeavour to set their lips according to the received form missus General was in her pure element Nobody had an opinion There was a formation of surface going on around her on an amazing scale and it had not a flaw of courage or honest free speech in it Another modification of Prunes and Prism insinuated itself on Little Dorrit s notice very shortly after their arrival They received an early visit from missus Merdle who led that extensive department of life in the Eternal City that winter and the skilful manner in which she and Fanny fenced with one another on the occasion almost made her quiet sister wink like the glittering of small swords So delighted said missus Merdle to resume an acquaintance so inauspiciously begun at Martigny At Martigny of course said Fanny Charmed I am sure I understand said missus Merdle from my son Edmund Sparkler that he has already improved that chance occasion He has returned quite transported with Venice Indeed returned the careless Fanny Was he there long I might refer that question to mister Dorrit said missus Merdle turning the bosom towards that gentleman Edmund having been so much indebted to him for rendering his stay agreeable Oh pray don t speak of it returned Fanny I believe Papa had the pleasure of inviting mister Sparkler twice or thrice but it was nothing We had so many people about us and kept such open house that if he had that pleasure it was less than nothing Except my dear said mister Dorrit except ha as it afforded me unusual gratification to hum show by any means however slight and worthless the ha hum high estimation in which in ha common with the rest of the world I hold so distinguished and princely a character as mister Merdle s The bosom received this tribute in its most engaging manner mister Merdle observed Fanny as a means of dismissing mister Sparkler into the background is quite a theme of Papa s you must know missus Merdle I have been ha disappointed madam said mister Dorrit to understand from mister Sparkler that there is no great hum probability of mister Merdle s coming abroad Why indeed said missus Merdle he is so much engaged and in such request that I fear not He has not been able to get abroad for years You Miss Dorrit I believe have been almost continually abroad for a long time Oh dear yes drawled Fanny with the greatest hardihood An immense number of years So I should have inferred said missus Merdle Exactly said Fanny I trust however resumed mister Dorrit that if I have not the hum great advantage of becoming known to mister Merdle on this side of the Alps or Mediterranean I shall have that honour on returning to England It is an honour I particularly desire and shall particularly esteem mister Merdle said missus Merdle who had been looking admiringly at Fanny through her eye glass will esteem it I am sure no less Little Dorrit still habitually thoughtful and solitary though no longer alone at first supposed this to be mere Prunes and Prism But as her father when they had been to a brilliant reception at missus Merdle s harped at their own family breakfast table on his wish to know mister Merdle with the contingent view of benefiting by the advice of that wonderful man in the disposal of his fortune she began to think it had a real meaning and to entertain a curiosity on her own part to see the shining light of the time CHAPTER eight The Dowager missus Gowan is reminded that It Never Does While the waters of Venice and the ruins of Rome were sunning themselves for the pleasure of the Dorrit family and were daily being sketched out of all earthly proportion lineament and likeness by travelling pencils innumerable the firm of Doyce and Clennam hammered away in Bleeding Heart Yard and the vigorous clink of iron upon iron was heard there through the working hours The younger partner had by this time brought the business into sound trim and the elder left free to follow his own ingenious devices had done much to enhance the character of the factory As an ingenious man he had necessarily to encounter every discouragement that the ruling powers for a length of time had been able by any means to put in the way of this class of culprits but that was only reasonable self defence in the powers since How to do it must obviously be regarded as the natural and mortal enemy of How not to do it In this was to be found the basis of the wise system by tooth and nail upheld by the Circumlocution Office of warning every ingenious British subject to be ingenious at his peril of harassing him obstructing him inviting robbers by making his remedy uncertain and expensive to plunder him and at the best of confiscating his property after a short term of enjoyment as though invention were on a par with felony The system had uniformly found great favour with the Barnacles and that was only reasonable too for one who worthily invents must be in earnest and the Barnacles abhorred and dreaded nothing half so much That again was very reasonable since in a country suffering under the affliction of a great amount of earnestness there might in an exceeding short space of time be not a single Barnacle left sticking to a post Daniel Doyce faced his condition with its pains and penalties attached to it and soberly worked on for the work s sake Clennam cheering him with a hearty company operation was a moral support to him besides doing good service in his business relation The concern prospered and the partners were fast friends But Daniel could not forget the old design of so many years It was not in reason to be expected that he should if he could have lightly forgotten it he could never have conceived it or had the patience and perseverance to work it out So Clennam thought when he sometimes observed him of an evening looking over the models and drawings and consoling himself by muttering with a sigh as he put them away again that the thing was as true as it ever was To show no sympathy with so much endeavour and so much disappointment would have been to fail in what Clennam regarded as among the implied obligations of his partnership A revival of the passing interest in the subject which had been by chance awakened at the door of the Circumlocution Office originated in this feeling He asked his partner to explain the invention to him having a lenient consideration he stipulated for my being no workman Doyce No workman said Doyce You would have been a thorough workman if you had given yourself to it You have as good a head for understanding such things as I have met with A totally uneducated one I am sorry to add said Clennam I don t know that returned Doyce and I wouldn t have you say that No man of sense who has been generally improved and has improved himself can be called quite uneducated as to anything I don t particularly favour mysteries I would as soon on a fair and clear explanation be judged by one class of man as another provided he had the qualification I have named At all events said Clennam this sounds as if we were exchanging compliments but we know we are not I shall have the advantage of as plain an explanation as can be given Well said Daniel in his steady even way I ll try to make it so He had the power often to be found in union with such a character of explaining what he himself perceived and meant with the direct force and distinctness with which it struck his own mind His manner of demonstration was so orderly and neat and simple that it was not easy to mistake him There was something almost ludicrous in the complete irreconcilability of a vague conventional notion that he must be a visionary man with the precise sagacious travelling of his eye and thumb over the plans their patient stoppages at particular points their careful returns to other points whence little channels of explanation had to be traced up and his steady manner of making everything good and everything sound at each important stage before taking his hearer on a line s breadth further His dismissal of himself from his description was hardly less remarkable He never said I discovered this adaptation or invented that combination but showed the whole thing as if the Divine artificer had made it and he had happened to find it so modest he was about it such a pleasant touch of respect was mingled with his quiet admiration of it and so calmly convinced he was that it was established on irrefragable laws Not only that evening but for several succeeding evenings Clennam was quite charmed by this investigation The more he pursued it and the oftener he glanced at the grey head bending over it and the shrewd eye kindling with pleasure in it and love of it instrument for probing his heart though it had been made for twelve long years the less he could reconcile it to his younger energy to let it go without one effort more At length he said Doyce it came to this at last that the business was to be sunk with Heaven knows how many more wrecks or begun all over again Yes returned Doyce that s what the noblemen and gentlemen made of it after a dozen years And pretty fellows too said Clennam bitterly The usual thing observed Doyce I must not make a martyr of myself when I am one of so large a company Relinquish it or begin it all over again mused Clennam That was exactly the long and the short of it said Doyce Then my friend cried Clennam starting up and taking his work roughened hand it shall be begun all over again Doyce looked alarmed and replied in a hurry for him No no Better put it by Far better put it by It will be heard of one day I can put it by You forget my good Clennam I HAVE put it by It s all at an end Yes Doyce returned Clennam at an end as far as your efforts and rebuffs are concerned I admit but not as far as mine are I am younger than you I have only once set foot in that precious office and I am fresh game for them Come I ll try them You shall do exactly as you have been doing since we have been together I will add as I easily can to what I have been doing the attempt to get public justice done to you and unless I have some success to report you shall hear no more of it Daniel Doyce was still reluctant to consent and again and again urged that they had better put it by But it was natural that he should gradually allow himself to be over persuaded by Clennam and should yield Yield he did So Arthur resumed the long and hopeless labour of striving to make way with the Circumlocution Office The waiting rooms of that Department soon began to be familiar with his presence and he was generally ushered into them by its janitors much as a pickpocket might be shown into a police office the principal difference being that the object of the latter class of public business is to keep the pickpocket while the Circumlocution object was to get rid of Clennam However he was resolved to stick to the Great Department and so the work of form filling corresponding minuting memorandum making signing counter signing counter counter signing referring backwards and forwards and referring sideways crosswise and zig zag recommenced Here arises a feature of the Circumlocution Office not previously mentioned in the present record When that admirable Department got into trouble and was by some infuriated members of Parliament whom the smaller Barnacles almost suspected of labouring under diabolic possession attacked on the merits of no individual case but as an Institution wholly abominable and Bedlamite then the noble or right honourable Barnacle who represented it in the House would smite that member and cleave him asunder with a statement of the quantity of business for the prevention of business done by the Circumlocution Office Then would that noble or right honourable Barnacle hold in his hand a paper containing a few figures to which with the permission of the House he would entreat its attention Then would the inferior Barnacles exclaim obeying orders Hear Hear Hear and Read Then would the noble or right honourable Barnacle perceive sir from this little document which he thought might carry conviction even to the perversest mind Derisive laughter and cheering from the Barnacle fry that within the short compass of the last financial half year this much maligned Department Cheers had written and received fifteen thousand letters Loud cheers had written twenty four thousand minutes Louder cheers and thirty two thousand five hundred and seventeen memoranda Vehement cheering Nay an ingenious gentleman connected with the Department and himself a valuable public servant had done him the favour to make a curious calculation of the amount of stationery consumed in it during the same period It formed a part of this same short document and he derived from it the remarkable fact that the sheets of foolscap paper it had devoted to the public service would pave the footways on both sides of Oxford Street from end to end and leave nearly a quarter of a mile to spare for the park Immense cheering and laughter while of tape red tape it had used enough to stretch in graceful festoons from Hyde Park Corner to the General Post Office Then amidst a burst of official exultation would the noble or right honourable Barnacle sit down leaving the mutilated fragments of the Member on the field No one after that exemplary demolition of him would have the hardihood to hint that the more the Circumlocution Office did the less was done and that the greatest blessing it could confer on an unhappy public would be to do nothing With sufficient occupation on his hands now that he had this additional task such a task had many and many a serviceable man died of before his day Arthur Clennam led a life of slight variety Regular visits to his mother s dull sick room and visits scarcely less regular to mister Meagles at Twickenham were its only changes during many months He sadly and sorely missed Little Dorrit He had been prepared to miss her very much but not so much He knew to the full extent only through experience what a large place in his life was left blank when her familiar little figure went out of it He felt too that he must relinquish the hope of its return understanding the family character sufficiently well to be assured that he and she were divided by a broad ground of separation The old interest he had had in her and her old trusting reliance on him were tinged with melancholy in his mind so soon had change stolen over them and so soon had they glided into the past with other secret tendernesses When he received her letter he was greatly moved but did not the less sensibly feel that she was far divided from him by more than distance It helped him to a clearer and keener perception of the place assigned him by the family He saw that he was cherished in her grateful remembrance secretly and that they resented him with the jail and the rest of its belongings Through all these meditations which every day of his life crowded about her he thought of her otherwise in the old way She was his innocent friend his delicate child his dear Little Dorrit This very change of circumstances fitted curiously in with the habit begun on the night when the roses floated away of considering himself as a much older man than his years really made him He regarded her from a point of view which in its remoteness tender as it was he little thought would have been unspeakable agony to her He speculated about her future destiny and about the husband she might have with an affection for her which would have drained her heart of its dearest drop of hope and broken it Everything about him tended to confirm him in the custom of looking on himself as an elderly man from whom such aspirations as he had combated in the case of Minnie Gowan though that was not so long ago either reckoning by months and seasons were finally departed His relations with her father and mother were like those on which a widower son in law might have stood If the twin sister who was dead had lived to pass away in the bloom of womanhood and he had been her husband the nature of his intercourse with mister and missus Meagles would probably have been just what it was This imperceptibly helped to render habitual the impression within him that he had done with and dismissed that part of life He invariably heard of Minnie from them as telling them in her letters how happy she was and how she loved her husband but inseparable from that subject he invariably saw the old cloud on mister Meagles s face mister Meagles had never been quite so radiant since the marriage as before He had never quite recovered the separation from Pet He was the same good humoured open creature but as if his face from being much turned towards the pictures of his two children which could show him only one look unconsciously adopted a characteristic from them it always had now through all its changes of expression a look of loss in it One wintry Saturday when Clennam was at the cottage the Dowager missus Gowan drove up in the Hampton Court equipage which pretended to be the exclusive equipage of so many individual proprietors She descended in her shady ambuscade of green fan to favour mister and missus Meagles with a call And how do you both do Papa and Mama Meagles said she encouraging her humble connections And when did you last hear from or about my poor fellow My poor fellow was her son and this mode of speaking of him politely kept alive without any offence in the world the pretence that he had fallen a victim to the Meagles wiles And the dear pretty one said missus Gowan Have you later news of her than I have Which also delicately implied that her son had been captured by mere beauty and under its fascination had forgone all sorts of worldly advantages I am sure said missus Gowan without straining her attention on the answers she received it s an unspeakable comfort to know they continue happy My poor fellow is of such a restless disposition and has been so used to roving about and to being inconstant and popular among all manner of people that it s the greatest comfort in life I suppose they re as poor as mice Papa Meagles mister Meagles fidgety under the question replied I hope not ma am I hope they will manage their little income Oh my dearest Meagles returned the lady tapping him on the arm with the green fan and then adroitly interposing it between a yawn and the company how can you as a man of the world and one of the most business like of human beings for you know you are business like and a great deal too much for us who are not Which went to the former purpose by making mister Meagles out to be an artful schemer How can you talk about their managing their little means My poor dear fellow The idea of his managing hundreds And the sweet pretty creature too The notion of her managing Papa Meagles Don t Well ma am said mister Meagles gravely I am sorry to admit then that Henry certainly does anticipate his means My dear good man I use no ceremony with you because we are a kind of relations positively Mama Meagles exclaimed missus Gowan cheerfully as if the absurd coincidence then flashed upon her for the first time a kind of relations My dear good man in this world none of us can have everything our own way This again went to the former point and showed mister Meagles with all good breeding that so far he had been brilliantly successful in his deep designs missus Gowan thought the hit so good a one that she dwelt upon it repeating Not everything No no in this world we must not expect everything Papa Meagles And may I ask ma am retorted mister Meagles a little heightened in colour who does expect everything Oh nobody nobody said missus Gowan I was going to say but you put me out You interrupting Papa what was I going to say Drooping her large green fan she looked musingly at mister Meagles while she thought about it a performance not tending to the cooling of that gentleman s rather heated spirits Ah Yes to be sure said missus Gowan You must remember that my poor fellow has always been accustomed to expectations They may have been realised or they may not have been realised Let us say then may not have been realised observed mister Meagles The Dowager for a moment gave him an angry look but tossed it off with her head and her fan and pursued the tenor of her way in her former manner It makes no difference My poor fellow has been accustomed to that sort of thing and of course you knew it and were prepared for the consequences I myself always clearly foresaw the consequences and am not surprised And you must not be surprised In fact can t be surprised Must have been prepared for it mister Meagles looked at his wife and at Clennam bit his lip and coughed And now here s my poor fellow missus Gowan pursued receiving notice that he is to hold himself in expectation of a baby and all the expenses attendant on such an addition to his family Poor Henry But it can t be helped now it s too late to help it now Only don t talk of anticipating means Papa Meagles as a discovery because that would be too much Too much ma am said mister Meagles as seeking an explanation There there said missus Gowan putting him in his inferior place with an expressive action of her hand Too much for my poor fellow s mother to bear at this time of day They are fast married and can t be unmarried There there I know that You needn t tell me that Papa Meagles I know it very well What was it I said just now That it was a great comfort they continued happy It is to be hoped they will still continue happy It is to be hoped Pretty One will do everything she can to make my poor fellow happy and keep him contented Papa and Mama Meagles we had better say no more about it We never did look at this subject from the same side and we never shall There there Now I am good Truly having by this time said everything she could say in maintenance of her wonderfully mythical position and in admonition to mister Meagles that he must not expect to bear his honours of alliance too cheaply missus Gowan was disposed to forgo the rest If mister Meagles had submitted to a glance of entreaty from missus Meagles and an expressive gesture from Clennam he would have left her in the undisturbed enjoyment of this state of mind But Pet was the darling and pride of his heart and if he could ever have championed her more devotedly or loved her better than in the days when she was the sunlight of his house it would have been now when as its daily grace and delight she was lost to it missus Gowan ma am said mister Meagles I have been a plain man all my life If I was to try no matter whether on myself on somebody else or both any genteel mystifications I should probably not succeed in them Papa Meagles returned the Dowager with an affable smile but with the bloom on her cheeks standing out a little more vividly than usual as the neighbouring surface became paler probably not Therefore my good madam said mister Meagles at great pains to restrain himself I hope I may without offence ask to have no such mystification played off upon me Mama Meagles observed missus Gowan your good man is incomprehensible Her turning to that worthy lady was an artifice to bring her into the discussion quarrel with her and vanquish her mister Meagles interposed to prevent that consummation Mother said he you are inexpert my dear and it is not a fair match Let me beg of you to remain quiet Come missus Gowan come Let us try to be sensible let us try to be good natured let us try to be fair Don t you pity Henry and I won t pity Pet And don t be one sided my dear madam it s not considerate it s not kind Don t let us say that we hope Pet will make Henry happy or even that we hope Henry will make Pet happy mister Meagles himself did not look happy as he spoke the words but let us hope they will make each other happy Yes sure and there leave it father said missus Meagles the kind hearted and comfortable Why mother no returned mister Meagles not exactly there I can t quite leave it there I must say just half a dozen words more missus Gowan I hope I am not over sensitive I believe I don t look it Indeed you do not said missus Gowan shaking her head and the great green fan together for emphasis Thank you ma am that s well Notwithstanding which I feel a little I don t want to use a strong word now shall I say hurt asked mister Meagles at once with frankness and moderation and with a conciliatory appeal in his tone Say what you like answered missus Gowan It is perfectly indifferent to me No no don t say that urged mister Meagles because that s not responding amiably I feel a little hurt when I hear references made to consequences having been foreseen and to its being too late now and so forth Do you Papa Meagles said missus Gowan I am not surprised Well ma am reasoned mister Meagles I was in hopes you would have been at least surprised because to hurt me wilfully on so tender a subject is surely not generous I am not responsible said missus Gowan for your conscience you know Poor mister Meagles looked aghast with astonishment If I am unluckily obliged to carry a cap about with me which is yours and fits you pursued missus Gowan don t blame me for its pattern Papa Meagles I beg Why good Lord ma am mister Meagles broke out that s as much as to state Now Papa Meagles Papa Meagles said missus Gowan who became extremely deliberate and prepossessing in manner whenever that gentleman became at all warm perhaps to prevent confusion I had better speak for myself than trouble your kindness to speak for me It s as much as to state you begin If you please I will finish the sentence It is as much as to state not that I wish to press it or even recall it for it is of no use now and my only wish is to make the best of existing circumstances that from the first to the last I always objected to this match of yours and at a very late period yielded a most unwilling consent to it Mother cried mister Meagles Do you hear this Arthur Do you hear this The room being of a convenient size said missus Gowan looking about as she fanned herself and quite charmingly adapted in all respects to conversation I should imagine I am audible in any part of it Some moments passed in silence before mister Meagles could hold himself in his chair with sufficient security to prevent his breaking out of it at the next word he spoke At last he said Ma am I am very unwilling to revive them but I must remind you what my opinions and my course were all along on that unfortunate subject O my dear sir said missus Gowan smiling and shaking her head with accusatory intelligence they were well understood by me I assure you I never ma am said mister Meagles knew unhappiness before that time I never knew anxiety before that time It was a time of such distress to me that That mister Meagles could really say no more about it in short but passed his handkerchief before his Face I understood the whole affair said missus Gowan composedly looking over her fan As you have appealed to mister Clennam I may appeal to mister Clennam too He knows whether I did or not I am very unwilling said Clennam looked to by all parties to take any share in this discussion more especially because I wish to preserve the best understanding and the clearest relations with mister Henry Gowan I have very strong reasons indeed for entertaining that wish missus Gowan attributed certain views of furthering the marriage to my friend here in conversation with me before it took place and I endeavoured to undeceive her I represented that I knew him as I did and do to be strenuously opposed to it both in opinion and action You see said missus Gowan turning the palms of her hands towards mister Meagles as if she were Justice herself representing to him that he had better confess for he had not a leg to stand on You see Very good Now Papa and Mama Meagles both here she rose allow me to take the liberty of putting an end to this rather formidable controversy I will not say another word upon its merits I will only say that it is an additional proof of what one knows from all experience that this kind of thing never answers as my poor fellow himself would say that it never pays in one word that it never does mister Meagles asked What kind of thing It is in vain said missus Gowan for people to attempt to get on together who have such extremely different antecedents who are jumbled against each other in this accidental matrimonial sort of way and who cannot look at the untoward circumstance which has shaken them together in the same light It never does mister Meagles was beginning Permit me to say ma am No don t returned missus Gowan Why should you It is an ascertained fact It never does I will therefore if you please go my way leaving you to yours I shall at all times be happy to receive my poor fellow s pretty wife and I shall always make a point of being on the most affectionate terms with her But as to these terms semi family and semi stranger semi goring and semi boring they form a state of things quite amusing in its impracticability I assure you it never does The Dowager here made a smiling obeisance rather to the room than to any one in it and therewith took a final farewell of Papa and Mama Meagles Clennam stepped forward to hand her to the Pill Box which was at the service of all the Pills in Hampton Court Palace and she got into that vehicle with distinguished serenity and was driven away Thenceforth the Dowager with a light and careless humour often recounted to her particular acquaintance how after a hard trial she had found it impossible to know those people who belonged to Henry s wife and who had made that desperate set to catch him Whether she had come to the conclusion beforehand that to get rid of them would give her favourite pretence a better air might save her some occasional inconvenience and could risk no loss the pretty creature being fast married and her father devoted to her was best known to herself Though this history has its opinion on that point too and decidedly in the affirmative CHAPTER nine Appearance and Disappearance Arthur my dear boy said mister Meagles on the evening of the following day Mother and I have been talking this over and we don t feel comfortable in remaining as we are That elegant connection of ours that dear lady who was here yesterday I understand said Arthur Even that affable and condescending ornament of society pursued mister Meagles may misrepresent us we are afraid We could bear a great deal Arthur for her sake but we think we would rather not bear that if it was all the same to her Good said Arthur Go on You see proceeded mister Meagles it might put us wrong with our son in law it might even put us wrong with our daughter and it might lead to a great deal of domestic trouble You see don t you Yes indeed returned Arthur there is much reason in what you say He had glanced at missus Meagles who was always on the good and sensible side and a petition had shone out of her honest face that he would support mister Meagles in his present inclinings So we are very much disposed are Mother and I said mister Meagles to pack up bags and baggage and go among the Allongers and Marshongers once more I mean we are very much disposed to be off strike right through France into Italy and see our Pet And I don t think replied Arthur touched by the motherly anticipation in the bright face of missus Meagles she must have been very like her daughter once that you could do better And if you ask me for my advice it is that you set off to morrow Is it really though said mister Meagles Mother this is being backed in an idea Mother with a look which thanked Clennam in a manner very agreeable to him answered that it was indeed The fact is besides Arthur said mister Meagles the old cloud coming over his face that my son in law is already in debt again and that I suppose I must clear him again It may be as well even on this account that I should step over there and look him up in a friendly way Then again here s Mother foolishly anxious and yet naturally too about Pet s state of health and that she should not be left to feel lonesome at the present time It s undeniably a long way off Arthur and a strange place for the poor love under all the circumstances Let her be as well cared for as any lady in that land still it is a long way off just as Home is Home though it s never so Homely why you see said mister Meagles adding a new version to the proverb Rome is Rome though it s never so Romely All perfectly true observed Arthur and all sufficient reasons for going I am glad you think so it decides me Mother my dear you may get ready We have lost our pleasant interpreter she spoke three foreign languages beautifully Arthur you have heard her many a time and you must pull me through it Mother as well as you can I require a deal of pulling through Arthur said mister Meagles shaking his head a deal of pulling through I stick at everything beyond a noun substantive and I stick at him if he s at all a tight one Now I think of it returned Clennam there s Cavalletto He shall go with you if you like I could not afford to lose him but you will bring him safe back Well I am much obliged to you my boy said mister Meagles turning it over but I think not No I think I ll be pulled through by Mother Cavallooro I stick at his very name to start with and it sounds like the chorus to a comic song is so necessary to you that I don t like the thought of taking him away More than that there s no saying when we may come home again and it would never do to take him away for an indefinite time The cottage is not what it was It only holds two little people less than it ever did Pet and her poor unfortunate maid Tattycoram but it seems empty now Once out of it there s no knowing when we may come back to it No Arthur I ll be pulled through by Mother They would do best by themselves perhaps after all Clennam thought therefore did not press his proposal If you would come down and stay here for a change when it wouldn t trouble you mister Meagles resumed I should be glad to think and so would Mother too I know that you were brightening up the old place with a bit of life it was used to when it was full and that the Babies on the wall there had a kind eye upon them sometimes You so belong to the spot and to them Arthur and we should every one of us have been so happy if it had fallen out but let us see how s the weather for travelling now mister Meagles broke off cleared his throat and got up to look out of the window They agreed that the weather was of high promise and Clennam kept the talk in that safe direction until it had become easy again when he gently diverted it to Henry Gowan and his quick sense and agreeable qualities when he was delicately dealt With he likewise dwelt on the indisputable affection he entertained for his wife Clennam did not fail of his effect upon good mister Meagles whom these commendations greatly cheered and who took Mother to witness that the single and cordial desire of his heart in reference to their daughter s husband was harmoniously to exchange friendship for friendship and confidence for confidence Within a few hours the cottage furniture began to be wrapped up for preservation in the family absence or as mister Meagles expressed it the house began to put its hair in papers and within a few days Father and Mother were gone missus Tickit and doctor Buchan were posted as of yore behind the parlour blind and Arthur s solitary feet were rustling among the dry fallen leaves in the garden walks As he had a liking for the spot he seldom let a week pass without paying a visit Sometimes he went down alone from Saturday to Monday sometimes his partner accompanied him sometimes he merely strolled for an hour or two about the house and garden saw that all was right and returned to London again At all times and under all circumstances missus Tickit with her dark row of curls and doctor Buchan sat in the parlour window looking out for the family return On one of his visits missus Tickit received him with the words I have something to tell you mister Clennam that will surprise you So surprising was the something in question that it actually brought missus Tickit out of the parlour window and produced her in the garden walk when Clennam went in at the gate on its being opened for him What is it missus Tickit said he Sir returned that faithful housekeeper having taken him into the parlour and closed the door if ever I saw the led away and deluded child in my life I saw her identically in the dusk of yesterday evening You don t mean Tatty Coram yes I do quoth missus Tickit clearing the disclosure at a leap Where mister Clennam returned missus Tickit I was a little heavy in my eyes being that I was waiting longer than customary for my cup of tea which was then preparing by Mary Jane I was not sleeping nor what a person would term correctly dozing I was more what a person would strictly call watching with my eyes closed Without entering upon an inquiry into this curious abnormal condition Clennam said Exactly Well Well sir proceeded missus Tickit I was thinking of one thing and thinking of another just as you yourself might Just as anybody might Precisely so said Clennam Well And when I do think of one thing and do think of another pursued missus Tickit I hardly need to tell you mister Clennam that I think of the family Because dear me a person s thoughts missus Tickit said this with an argumentative and philosophic air however they may stray will go more or less on what is uppermost in their minds They will do it sir and a person can t prevent them Arthur subscribed to this discovery with a nod You find it so yourself sir I ll be bold to say said missus Tickit and we all find it so It an t our stations in life that changes us mister Clennam thoughts is free As I was saying I was thinking of one thing and thinking of another and thinking very much of the family Not of the family in the present times only but in the past times too For when a person does begin thinking of one thing and thinking of another in that manner as it s getting dark what I say is that all times seem to be present and a person must get out of that state and consider before they can say which is which He nodded again afraid to utter a word lest it should present any new opening to missus Tickit s conversational powers In consequence of which said missus Tickit when I quivered my eyes and saw her actual form and figure looking in at the gate I let them close again without so much as starting for that actual form and figure came so pat to the time when it belonged to the house as much as mine or your own that I never thought at the moment of its having gone away But sir when I quivered my eyes again and saw that it wasn t there then it all flooded upon me with a fright and I jumped up You ran out directly said Clennam I ran out assented missus Tickit as fast as ever my feet would carry me and if you ll credit it mister Clennam there wasn t in the whole shining Heavens no not so much as a finger of that young woman Passing over the absence from the firmament of this novel constellation Arthur inquired of missus Tickit if she herself went beyond the gate Went to and fro and high and low said missus Tickit and saw no sign of her He then asked missus Tickit how long a space of time she supposed there might have been between the two sets of ocular quiverings she had experienced missus Tickit though minutely circumstantial in her reply had no settled opinion between five seconds and ten minutes She was so plainly at sea on this part of the case and had so clearly been startled out of slumber that Clennam was much disposed to regard the appearance as a dream Without hurting missus Tickit s feelings with that infidel solution of her mystery he took it away from the cottage with him and probably would have retained it ever afterwards if a circumstance had not soon happened to change his opinion He was passing at nightfall along the Strand and the lamp lighter was going on before him under whose hand the street lamps blurred by the foggy air burst out one after another like so many blazing sunflowers coming into full blow all at once when a stoppage on the pavement caused by a train of coal waggons toiling up from the wharves at the river side brought him to a stand still He had been walking quickly and going with some current of thought and the sudden check given to both operations caused him to look freshly about him as people under such circumstances usually do Immediately he saw in advance a few people intervening but still so near to him that he could have touched them by stretching out his arm Tattycoram and a strange man of a remarkable appearance a swaggering man with a high nose and a black moustache as false in its colour as his eyes were false in their expression who wore his heavy cloak with the air of a foreigner His dress and general appearance were those of a man on travel and he seemed to have very recently joined the girl In bending down being much taller than she was listening to whatever she said to him he looked over his shoulder with the suspicious glance of one who was not unused to be mistrustful that his footsteps might be dogged It was then that Clennam saw his face as his eyes lowered on the people behind him in the aggregate without particularly resting upon Clennam s face or any other He had scarcely turned his head about again and it was still bent down listening to the girl when the stoppage ceased and the obstructed stream of people flowed on Still bending his head and listening to the girl he went on at her side and Clennam followed them resolved to play this unexpected play out and see where they went He had hardly made the determination though he was not long about it when he was again as suddenly brought up as he had been by the stoppage They turned short into the Adelphi the girl evidently leading and went straight on as if they were going to the Terrace which overhangs the river There is always to this day a sudden pause in that place to the roar of the great thoroughfare The many sounds become so deadened that the change is like putting cotton in the ears or having the head thickly muffled At that time the contrast was far greater there being no small steam boats on the river no landing places but slippery wooden stairs and foot causeways no railroad on the opposite bank no hanging bridge or fish market near at hand no traffic on the nearest bridge of stone nothing moving on the stream but watermen s wherries and coal lighters Long and broad black tiers of the latter moored fast in the mud as if they were never to move again made the shore funereal and silent after dark and kept what little water movement there was far out towards mid stream At any hour later than sunset and not least at that hour when most of the people who have anything to eat at home are going home to eat it and when most of those who have nothing have hardly yet slunk out to beg or steal it was a deserted place and looked on a deserted scene Such was the hour when Clennam stopped at the corner observing the girl and the strange man as they went down the street The man s footsteps were so noisy on the echoing stones that he was unwilling to add the sound of his own But when they had passed the turning and were in the darkness of the dark corner leading to the terrace he made after them with such indifferent appearance of being a casual passenger on his way as he could assume When he rounded the dark corner they were walking along the terrace towards a figure which was coming towards them If he had seen it by itself under such conditions of gas lamp mist and distance he might not have known it at first sight but with the figure of the girl to prompt him he at once recognised Miss Wade He stopped at the corner seeming to look back expectantly up the street as if he had made an appointment with some one to meet him there but he kept a careful eye on the three When they came together the man took off his hat and made Miss Wade a bow The girl appeared to say a few words as though she presented him or accounted for his being late or early or what not and then fell a pace or so behind by herself Miss Wade and the man then began to walk up and down the man having the appearance of being extremely courteous and complimentary in manner Miss Wade having the appearance of being extremely haughty When they came down to the corner and turned she was saying If I pinch myself for it sir that is my business Confine yourself to yours and ask me no question By Heaven ma am he replied making her another bow It was my profound respect for the strength of your character and my admiration of your beauty I want neither the one nor the other from any one said she and certainly not from you of all creatures Go on with your report Am I pardoned he asked with an air of half abashed gallantry You are paid she said and that is all you want Whether the girl hung behind because she was not to hear the business or as already knowing enough about it Clennam could not determine They turned and she turned She looked away at the river as she walked with her hands folded before her and that was all he could make of her without showing his face There happened by good fortune to be a lounger really waiting for some one and he sometimes looked over the railing at the water and sometimes came to the dark corner and looked up the street rendering Arthur less conspicuous When Miss Wade and the man came back again she was saying You must wait until to morrow A thousand pardons he returned My faith Then it s not convenient to night No I tell you I must get it before I can give it to you She stopped in the roadway as if to put an end to the conference He of course stopped too And the girl stopped It s a little inconvenient said the man A little But Holy Blue that s nothing in such a service I am without money to night by chance I have a good banker in this city but I would not wish to draw upon the house until the time when I shall draw for a round sum Harriet said Miss Wade arrange with him this gentleman here for sending him some money to morrow She said it with a slur of the word gentleman which was more contemptuous than any emphasis and walked slowly on The man bent his head again and the girl spoke to him as they both followed her Clennam ventured to look at the girl as they Moved away He could note that her rich black eyes were fastened upon the man with a scrutinising expression and that she kept at a little distance from him as they walked side by side to the further end of the terrace A loud and altered clank upon the pavement warned him before he could discern what was passing there that the man was coming back alone Clennam lounged into the road towards the railing and the man passed at a quick swing with the end of his cloak thrown over his shoulder singing a scrap of a French song The whole vista had no one in it now but himself The lounger had lounged out of view and Miss Wade and Tattycoram were gone More than ever bent on seeing what became of them and on having some information to give his good friend mister Meagles he went out at the further end of the terrace looking cautiously about him He rightly judged that at first at all events they would go in a contrary direction from their late companion He soon saw them in a neighbouring bye street which was not a thoroughfare evidently allowing time for the man to get well out of their way They walked leisurely arm in arm down one side of the street and returned on the opposite side When they came back to the street corner they changed their pace for the pace of people with an object and a distance before them and walked steadily away Clennam no less steadily kept them in sight They crossed the Strand and passed through Covent Garden under the windows of his old lodging where dear Little Dorrit had come that night and slanted away north east until they passed the great building whence Tattycoram derived her name and turned into the Gray s Inn Road Clennam was quite at home here in right of Flora not to mention the Patriarch and Pancks and kept them in view with ease He was beginning to wonder where they might be going next when that wonder was lost in the greater wonder with which he saw them turn into the Patriarchal street That wonder was in its turn swallowed up on the greater wonder with which he saw them stop at the Patriarchal door A low double knock at the bright brass knocker a gleam of light into the road from the opened door a brief pause for inquiry and answer and the door was shut and they were housed After looking at the surrounding objects for assurance that he was not in an odd dream and after pacing a little while before the house Arthur knocked at the door It was opened by the usual maid servant and she showed him up at once with her usual alacrity to Flora s sitting room There was no one with Flora but mister F s Aunt which respectable gentlewoman basking in a balmy atmosphere of tea and toast was ensconced in an easy chair by the fireside with a little table at her elbow and a clean white handkerchief spread over her lap on which two pieces of toast at that moment awaited consumption Bending over a steaming vessel of tea and looking through the steam and breathing forth the steam like a malignant Chinese enchantress engaged in the performance of unholy rites mister F s Aunt put down her great teacup and exclaimed Drat him if he an t come back again It would seem from the foregoing exclamation that this uncompromising relative of the lamented mister F measuring time by the acuteness of her sensations and not by the clock supposed Clennam to have lately gone away whereas at least a quarter of a year had elapsed since he had had the temerity to present himself before her My goodness Arthur cried Flora rising to give him a cordial reception Doyce and Clennam what a start and a surprise for though not far from the machinery and foundry business and surely might be taken sometimes if at no other time about mid day when a glass of sherry and a humble sandwich of whatever cold meat in the larder might not come amiss nor taste the worse for being friendly for you know you buy it somewhere and wherever bought a profit must be made or they would never keep the place it stands to reason without a motive still never seen and learnt now not to be expected for as mister F himself said if seeing is believing not seeing is believing too and when you don t see you may fully believe you re not remembered not that I expect you Arthur Doyce and Clennam to remember me why should I for the days are gone but bring another teacup here directly and tell her fresh toast and pray sit near the fire Arthur was in the greatest anxiety to explain the object of his visit but was put off for the moment in spite of himself by what he understood of the reproachful purport of these words and by the genuine pleasure she testified in seeing him And now pray tell me something all you know said Flora drawing her chair near to his about the good dear quiet little thing and all the changes of her fortunes carriage people now no doubt and horses without number most romantic a coat of arms of course and wild beasts on their hind legs showing it as if it was a copy they had done with mouths from ear to ear good gracious and has she her health which is the first consideration after all for what is wealth without it mister F himself so often saying when his twinges came that sixpence a day and find yourself and no gout so much preferable not that he could have lived on anything like it being the last man or that the previous little thing though far too familiar an expression now had any tendency of that sort much too slight and small but looked so fragile bless her mister F s Aunt who had eaten a piece of toast down to the crust here solemnly handed the crust to Flora who ate it for her as a matter of business mister F s Aunt then moistened her ten fingers in slow succession at her lips and wiped them in exactly the same order on the white handkerchief then took the other piece of toast and fell to work upon it While pursuing this routine she looked at Clennam with an expression of such intense severity that he felt obliged to look at her in return against his personal inclinations She is in Italy with all her family Flora he said when the dreaded lady was occupied again In Italy is she really said Flora with the grapes growing everywhere and lava necklaces and bracelets too that land of poetry with burning mountains picturesque beyond belief though if the organ boys come away from the neighbourhood not to be scorched nobody can wonder being so young and bringing their white mice with them most humane and is she really in that favoured land with nothing but blue about her and dying gladiators and Belvederes though mister F himself did not believe for his objection when in spirits was that the images could not be true there being no medium between expensive quantities of linen badly got up and all in creases and none whatever which certainly does not seem probable though perhaps in consequence of the extremes of rich and poor which may account for it Arthur tried to edge a word in but Flora hurried on again Venice Preserved too said she I think you have been there is it well or ill preserved for people differ so and Maccaroni if they really eat it like the conjurors why not cut it shorter you are acquainted Arthur dear Doyce and Clennam at least not dear and most assuredly not Doyce for I have not the pleasure but pray excuse me acquainted I believe with Mantua what has it got to do with Mantua making for I never have been able to conceive I believe there is no connection Flora between the two Arthur was beginning when she caught him up again Upon your word no isn t there I never did but that s like me I run away with an idea and having none to spare I keep it alas there was a time dear Arthur that is to say decidedly not dear nor Arthur neither but you understand me when one bright idea gilded the what s his name horizon of et cetera but it is darkly clouded now and all is over Arthur s increasing wish to speak of something very different was by this time so plainly written on his face that Flora stopped in a tender look and asked him what it was I have the greatest desire Flora to speak to some one who is now in this house with mister Casby no doubt Some one whom I saw come in and who in a misguided and deplorable way has deserted the house of a friend of mine Papa sees so many and such odd people said Flora rising that I shouldn t venture to go down for any one but you Arthur but for you I would willingly go down in a diving bell much more a dining room and will come back directly if you ll mind and at the same time not mind mister F s Aunt while I m gone With those words and a parting glance Flora bustled out leaving Clennam under dreadful apprehension of this terrible charge The first variation which manifested itself in mister F s Aunt s demeanour when she had finished her piece of toast was a loud and prolonged sniff Finding it impossible to avoid construing this demonstration into a defiance of himself its gloomy significance being unmistakable Clennam looked plaintively at the excellent though prejudiced lady from whom it emanated in the hope that she might be disarmed by a meek submission None of your eyes at me said mister F s Aunt shivering with hostility Take that That was the crust of the piece of toast Clennam accepted the boon with a look of gratitude and held it in his hand under the pressure of a little embarrassment which was not relieved when mister F s Aunt elevating her voice into a cry of considerable power exclaimed He has a proud stomach this chap He s too proud a chap to eat it and coming out of her chair shook her venerable fist so very close to his nose as to tickle the surface But for the timely return of Flora to find him in this difficult situation further consequences might have ensued Flora without the least discomposure or surprise but congratulating the old lady in an approving manner on being very lively to night handed her back to her chair He has a proud stomach this chap said mister F s relation on being reseated Give him a meal of chaff Oh I don t think he would like that aunt returned Flora Give him a meal of chaff I tell you said mister F s Aunt glaring round Flora on her enemy It s the only thing for a proud stomach Let him eat up every morsel Drat him give him a meal of chaff Under a general pretence of helping him to this refreshment Flora got him out on the staircase mister F s Aunt even then constantly reiterating with inexpressible bitterness that he was a chap and had a proud stomach and over and over again insisting on that equine provision being made for him which she had already so strongly prescribed Such an inconvenient staircase and so many corner stairs Arthur whispered Flora would you object to putting your arm round me under my pelerine With a sense of going down stairs in a highly ridiculous manner Clennam descended in the required attitude and only released his fair burden at the dining room door indeed even there she was rather difficult to be got rid of remaining in his embrace to murmur Arthur for mercy s sake don t breathe it to papa She accompanied Arthur into the room where the Patriarch sat alone with his list shoes on the fender twirling his thumbs as if he had never left off The youthful Patriarch aged ten looked out of his picture frame above him with no calmer air than he Both smooth heads were alike beaming blundering and bumpy mister Clennam I am glad to see you I hope you are well sir I hope you are well Please to sit down please to sit down I had hoped sir said Clennam doing so and looking round with a face of blank disappointment not to find you alone Ah indeed said the Patriarch sweetly Ah indeed I told you so you know papa cried Flora Ah to be sure returned the Patriarch Yes just so Ah to be sure Pray sir demanded Clennam anxiously is Miss Wade gone Miss Oh you call her Wade returned mister Casby Highly proper Arthur quickly returned What do you call her Wade said mister Casby Oh always Wade After looking at the philanthropic visage and the long silky white hair for a few seconds during which mister Casby twirled his thumbs and smiled at the fire as if he were benevolently wishing it to burn him that he might forgive it Arthur began I beg your pardon mister Casby Not so not so said the Patriarch not so But Miss Wade had an attendant with her a young woman brought up by friends of mine over whom her influence is not considered very salutary and to whom I should be glad to have the opportunity of giving the assurance that she has not yet forfeited the interest of those protectors Really really returned the Patriarch Will you therefore be so good as to give me the address of Miss Wade Dear dear dear said the Patriarch how very unfortunate If you had only sent in to me when they were here I observed the young woman mister Clennam A fine full coloured young woman mister Clennam with very dark hair and very dark eyes If I mistake not if I mistake not Arthur assented and said once more with new expression If you would be so good as to give me the address Dear dear dear exclaimed the Patriarch in sweet regret Tut tut tut what a pity what a pity I have no address sir Miss Wade mostly lives abroad mister Clennam She has done so for some years and she is if I may say so of a fellow creature and a lady fitful and uncertain to a fault mister Clennam I may not see her again for a long long time I may never see her again What a pity what a pity Clennam saw now that he had as much hope of getting assistance out of the Portrait as out of the Patriarch but he said nevertheless mister Casby could you for the satisfaction of the friends I have mentioned and under any obligation of secrecy that you may consider it your duty to impose give me any information at all touching Miss Wade I have seen her abroad and I have seen her at home but I know nothing of her Could you give me any account of her whatever None returned the Patriarch shaking his big head with his utmost benevolence None at all Dear dear dear What a real pity that she stayed so short a time and you delayed As confidential agency business agency business I have occasionally paid this lady money but what satisfaction is it to you sir to know that Truly none at all said Clennam Truly assented the Patriarch with a shining face as he philanthropically smiled at the fire none at all sir You hit the wise answer mister Clennam Truly none at all sir His turning of his smooth thumbs over one another as he sat there was so typical to Clennam of the way in which he would make the subject revolve if it were pursued never showing any new part of it nor allowing it to make the smallest advance that it did much to help to convince him of his labour having been in vain He might have taken any time to think about it for mister Casby well accustomed to get on anywhere by leaving everything to his bumps and his white hair knew his strength to lie in silence So there Casby sat twirling and twirling and making his polished head and forehead look largely benevolent in every knob With this spectacle before him Arthur had risen to go when from the inner Dock where the good ship Pancks was hove down when out in no cruising ground the noise was heard of that steamer labouring towards him It struck Arthur that the noise began demonstratively far off as though mister Pancks sought to impress on any one who might happen to think about it that he was working on from out of hearing mister Pancks and he shook hands and the former brought his employer a letter or two to sign mister Pancks in shaking hands merely scratched his eyebrow with his left forefinger and snorted once but Clennam who understood him better now than of old comprehended that he had almost done for the evening and wished to say a word to him outside Therefore when he had taken his leave of mister Casby and which was a more difficult process of Flora he sauntered in the neighbourhood on mister Pancks s line of road He had waited but a short time when mister Pancks appeared mister Pancks shaking hands again with another expressive snort and taking off his hat to put his hair up Arthur thought he received his cue to speak to him as one who knew pretty well what had just now passed Therefore he said without any preface I suppose they were really gone Pancks Yes replied Pancks They were really gone Does he know where to find that lady Can t say I should think so mister Pancks did not No mister Pancks did not Did mister Pancks know anything about her I expect rejoined that worthy I know as much about her as she knows about herself She is somebody s child anybody s nobody s Put her in a room in London here with any six people old enough to be her parents and her parents may be there for anything she knows They may be in any house she sees they may be in any churchyard she passes she may run against em in any street she may make chance acquaintance of em at any time and never know it She knows nothing about em She knows nothing about any relative whatever Never did Never will mister Casby could enlighten her perhaps May be said Pancks I expect so but don t know He has long had money not overmuch as I make out in trust to dole out to her when she can t do without it Sometimes she s proud and won t touch it for a length of time sometimes she s so poor that she must have it She writhes under her life A woman more angry passionate reckless and revengeful never lived She came for money to night Said she had peculiar occasion for it I think observed Clennam musing I by chance know what occasion I mean into whose pocket the money is to go Indeed said Pancks If it s a compact I recommend that party to be exact in it I wouldn t trust myself to that woman young and handsome as she is if I had wronged her no not for twice my proprietor s money Unless Pancks added as a saving clause I had a lingering illness on me and wanted to get it over Arthur hurriedly reviewing his own observation of her found it to tally pretty nearly with mister Pancks s view The wonder is to me pursued Pancks that she has never done for my proprietor as the only person connected with her story she can lay hold of Mentioning that I may tell you between ourselves that I am sometimes tempted to do for him myself Arthur started and said Dear me Pancks don t say that Understand me said Pancks extending five cropped coaly finger nails on Arthur s arm I don t mean cut his throat But by all that s precious if he goes too far I ll cut his hair Having exhibited himself in the new light of enunciating this tremendous threat mister Pancks with a countenance of grave import snorted several times and steamed away CHAPTER ten The Dreams of missus Flintwinch thicken The shady waiting rooms of the Circumlocution Office where he passed a good deal of time in company with various troublesome Convicts who were under sentence to be broken alive on that wheel had afforded Arthur Clennam ample leisure in three or four successive days to exhaust the subject of his late glimpse of Miss Wade and Tattycoram He had been able to make no more of it and no less of it and in this unsatisfactory condition he was fain to leave it During this space he had not been to his mother s dismal old house One of his customary evenings for repairing thither now coming round he left his dwelling and his partner at nearly nine o clock and slowly walked in the direction of that grim home of his youth It always affected his imagination as wrathful mysterious and sad and his imagination was sufficiently impressible to see the whole neighbourhood under some tinge of its dark shadow As he went along upon a dreary night the dim streets by which he went seemed all depositories of oppressive secrets The deserted counting houses with their secrets of books and papers locked up in chests and safes the banking houses with their secrets of strong rooms and wells the keys of which were in a very few secret pockets and a very few secret breasts the secrets of all the dispersed grinders in the vast mill among whom there were doubtless plunderers forgers and trust betrayers of many sorts whom the light of any day that dawned might reveal he could have fancied that these things in hiding imparted a heaviness to the air The shadow thickening and thickening as he approached its source he thought of the secrets of the lonely church vaults where the people who had hoarded and secreted in iron coffers were in their turn similarly hoarded not yet at rest from doing harm and then of the secrets of the river as it rolled its turbid tide between two frowning wildernesses of secrets extending thick and dense for many miles and warding off the free air and the free country swept by winds and wings of birds The shadow still darkening as he drew near the house the melancholy room which his father had once occupied haunted by the appealing face he had himself seen fade away with him when there was no other watcher by the bed arose before his mind Its close air was secret The gloom and must and dust of the whole tenement were secret At the heart of it his mother presided inflexible of face indomitable of will firmly holding all the secrets of her own and his father s life and austerely opposing herself front to front to the great final secret of all life He had turned into the narrow and steep street from which the court of enclosure wherein the house stood opened when another footstep turned into it behind him and so close upon his own that he was jostled to the wall As his mind was teeming with these thoughts the encounter took him altogether unprepared so that the other passenger had had time to say boisterously Pardon Not my fault and to pass on before the instant had elapsed which was requisite to his recovery of the realities about him When that moment had flashed away he saw that the man striding on before him was the man who had been so much in his mind during the last few days It was no casual resemblance helped out by the force of the impression the man made upon him It was the man the man he had followed in company with the girl and whom he had overheard talking to Miss Wade The street was a sharp descent and was crooked too and the man who although not drunk had the air of being flushed with some strong drink went down it so fast that Clennam lost him as he looked at him With no defined intention of following him but with an impulse to keep the figure in view a little longer Clennam quickened his pace to pass the twist in the street which hid him from his sight On turning it he saw the man no more Standing now close to the gateway of his mother s house he looked down the street but it was empty There was no projecting shadow large enough to obscure the man there was no turning near that he could have taken nor had there been any audible sound of the opening and closing of a door Nevertheless he concluded that the man must have had a key in his hand and must have opened one of the many house doors and gone in Ruminating on this strange chance and strange glimpse he turned into the court yard As he looked by mere habit towards the feebly lighted windows of his mother s room his eyes encountered the figure he had just lost standing against the iron railings of the little waste enclosure looking up at those windows and laughing to himself Some of the many vagrant cats who were always prowling about there by night and who had taken fright at him appeared to have stopped when he had stopped and were looking at him with eyes by no means unlike his own from tops of walls and porches and other safe points of pause He had only halted for a moment to entertain himself thus he immediately went forward throwing the end of his cloak off his shoulder as he went ascended the unevenly sunken steps and knocked a sounding knock at the door Clennam s surprise was not so absorbing but that he took his resolution without any incertitude He went up to the door too and ascended the steps too His friend looked at him with a braggart air and sang to himself Who passes by this road so late Compagnon de la Majolaine Who passes by this road so late Always gay After which he knocked again You are impatient sir said Arthur I am sir Death of my life sir returned the stranger it s my character to be impatient The sound of Mistress Affery cautiously chaining the door before she opened it caused them both to look that way Affery opened it a very little with a flaring candle in her hands and asked who was that at that time of night with that knock Why Arthur she added with astonishment seeing him first Not you sure Ah Lord save us No she cried out seeing the other Him again It s true Him again dear missus Flintwinch cried the stranger Open the door and let me take my dear friend Jeremiah to my arms Open the door and let me hasten myself to embrace my Flintwinch He s not at home cried Affery Fetch him cried the stranger Fetch my Flintwinch Tell him that it is his old Blandois who comes from arriving in England tell him that it is his little boy who is here his cabbage his well beloved Open the door beautiful missus Flintwinch and in the meantime let me to pass upstairs to present my compliments homage of Blandois to my lady My lady lives always It is well Open then To Arthur s increased surprise Mistress Affery stretching her eyes wide at himself as if in warning that this was not a gentleman for him to interfere with drew back the chain and opened the door The stranger without ceremony walked into the hall leaving Arthur to follow him Despatch then Achieve then Bring my Flintwinch Announce me to my lady cried the stranger clanking about the stone floor Pray tell me Affery said Arthur aloud and sternly as he surveyed him from head to foot with indignation who is this gentleman Pray tell me Affery the stranger repeated in his turn who ha ha ha who is this gentleman The voice of missus Clennam opportunely called from her chamber above Affery let them both come up Arthur come straight to me Arthur exclaimed Blandois taking off his hat at arm s length and bringing his heels together from a great stride in making him a flourishing bow The son of my lady I am the all devoted of the son of my lady Arthur looked at him again in no more flattering manner than before and turning on his heel without acknowledgment went up stairs The visitor followed him up stairs Mistress Affery took the key from behind the door and deftly slipped out to fetch her lord A bystander informed of the previous appearance of Monsieur Blandois in that room would have observed a difference in missus Clennam s present reception of him Her face was not one to betray it and her suppressed manner and her set voice were equally under her control It wholly consisted in her never taking her eyes off his face from the moment of his entrance and in her twice or thrice when he was becoming noisy swaying herself a very little forward in the chair in which she sat upright with her hands immovable upon its elbows as if she gave him the assurance that he should be presently heard at any length he would Arthur did not fail to observe this though the difference between the present occasion and the former was not within his power of observation Madame said Blandois do me the honour to present me to Monsieur your son It appears to me madame that Monsieur your son is disposed to complain of me He is not polite Sir said Arthur striking in expeditiously whoever you are and however you come to be here if I were the master of this house I would lose no time in placing you on the outside of it But you are not said his mother without looking at him Unfortunately for the gratification of your unreasonable temper you are not the master Arthur I make no claim to be mother If I object to this person s manner of conducting himself here and object to it so much that if I had any authority here I certainly would not suffer him to remain a minute I object on your account In the case of objection being necessary she returned I could object for myself And of course I should The subject of their dispute who had seated himself laughed aloud and rapped his legs with his hand You have no right said missus Clennam always intent on Blandois however directly she addressed her son to speak to the prejudice of any gentleman least of all a gentleman from another country because he does not conform to your standard or square his behaviour by your rules It is possible that the gentleman may on similar grounds object to you I hope so returned Arthur The gentleman pursued missus Clennam on a former occasion brought a letter of recommendation to us from highly esteemed and responsible correspondents I am perfectly unacquainted with the gentleman s object in coming here at present I am entirely ignorant of it and cannot be supposed likely to be able to form the remotest guess at its nature her habitual frown became stronger as she very slowly and weightily emphasised those words but when the gentleman proceeds to explain his object as I shall beg him to have the goodness to do to myself and Flintwinch when Flintwinch returns it will prove no doubt to be one more or less in the usual way of our business which it will be both our business and our pleasure to advance It can be nothing else We shall see madame said the man of business We shall see she assented The gentleman is acquainted with Flintwinch and when the gentleman was in London last I remember to have heard that he and Flintwinch had some entertainment or good fellowship together I am not in the way of knowing much that passes outside this room and the jingle of little worldly things beyond it does not much interest me but I remember to have heard that Right madame It is true He laughed again and whistled the burden of the tune he had sung at the door Therefore Arthur said his mother the gentleman comes here as an acquaintance and no stranger and it is much to be regretted that your unreasonable temper should have found offence in him I regret it I say so to the gentleman You will not say so I know therefore I say it for myself and Flintwinch since with us two the gentleman s business lies The key of the door below was now heard in the lock and the door was heard to open and close In due sequence mister Flintwinch appeared on whose entrance the visitor rose from his chair laughing loud and folded him in a close embrace How goes it my cherished friend said he How goes the world my Flintwinch Rose coloured So much the better so much the better Ah but you look charming Ah but you look young and fresh as the flowers of Spring Ah good little boy Brave child brave child While heaping these compliments on mister Flintwinch he rolled him about with a hand on each of his shoulders until the staggerings of that gentleman who under the circumstances was dryer and more twisted than ever were like those of a teetotum nearly spent I had a presentiment last time that we should be better and more intimately acquainted Is it coming on you Flintwinch Is it yet coming on Why no sir retorted mister Flintwinch Not unusually Hadn t you better be seated You have been calling for some more of that port sir I guess Ah Little joker Little pig cried the visitor Ha ha ha ha And throwing mister Flintwinch away as a closing piece of raillery he sat down again The amazement suspicion resentment and shame with which Arthur looked on at all this struck him dumb mister Flintwinch who had spun backward some two or three yards under the impetus last given to him brought himself up with a face completely unchanged in its stolidity except as it was affected by shortness of breath and looked hard at Arthur Not a whit less reticent and wooden was mister Flintwinch outwardly than in the usual course of things the only perceptible difference in him being that the knot of cravat which was generally under his ear had worked round to the back of his head where it formed an ornamental appendage not unlike a bagwig and gave him something of a courtly appearance As missus Clennam never removed her eyes from Blandois on whom they had some effect as a steady look has on a lower sort of dog so Jeremiah never removed his from Arthur It was as if they had tacitly agreed to take their different provinces Thus in the ensuing silence Jeremiah stood scraping his chin and looking at Arthur as though he were trying to screw his thoughts out of him with an instrument After a little the visitor as if he felt the silence irksome rose and impatiently put himself with his back to the sacred fire which had burned through so many years Thereupon missus Clennam said moving one of her hands for the first time and moving it very slightly with an action of dismissal Please to leave us to our business Arthur Mother I do so with reluctance Never mind with what she returned or with what not Please to leave us Come back at any other time when you may consider it a duty to bury half an hour wearily here Good night She held up her muffled fingers that he might touch them with his according to their usual custom and he stood over her wheeled chair to touch her face with his lips He thought then that her cheek was more strained than usual and that it was colder As he followed the direction of her eyes in rising again towards mister Flintwinch s good friend mister Blandois mister Blandois snapped his finger and thumb with one loud contemptuous snap I leave your your business acquaintance in my mother s room mister Flintwinch said Clennam with a great deal of surprise and a great deal of unwillingness The person referred to snapped his finger and thumb again Good night mother Good night I had a friend once my good comrade Flintwinch said Blandois standing astride before the fire and so evidently saying it to arrest Clennam s retreating steps that he lingered near the door I had a friend once who had heard so much of the dark side of this city and its ways that he wouldn t have confided himself alone by night with two people who had an interest in getting him under the ground my faith not even in a respectable house like this unless he was bodily too strong for them Bah What a poltroon my Flintwinch Eh A cur sir Agreed A cur But he wouldn t have done it my Flintwinch unless he had known them to have the will to silence him without the power He wouldn t have drunk from a glass of water under such circumstances not even in a respectable house like this my Flintwinch unless he had seen one of them drink first and swallow too Disdaining to speak and indeed not very well able for he was half choking Clennam only glanced at the visitor as he passed out The visitor saluted him with another parting snap and his nose came down over his moustache and his moustache went up under his nose in an ominous and ugly smile For Heaven s sake Affery whispered Clennam as she opened the door for him in the dark hall and he groped his way to the sight of the night sky what is going on here Her own appearance was sufficiently ghastly standing in the dark with her apron thrown over her head and speaking behind it in a low deadened voice Don t ask me anything Arthur I ve been in a dream for ever so long Go away He went out and she shut the door upon him He looked up at the windows of his mother s room and the dim light deadened by the yellow blinds seemed to say a response after Affery and to mutter Don t ask me anything Go away CHAPTER eleven A Letter from Little Dorrit Dear mister Clennam As I said in my last that it was best for nobody to write to me and as my sending you another little letter can therefore give you no other trouble than the trouble of reading it perhaps you may not find leisure for even that though I hope you will some day I am now going to devote an hour to writing to you again This time I write from Rome We left Venice before mister and missus Gowan did but they were not so long upon the road as we were and did not travel by the same way and so when we arrived we found them in a lodging here in a place called the Via Gregoriana I dare say you know it Now I am going to tell you all I can about them because I know that is what you most want to hear Theirs is not a very comfortable lodging but perhaps I thought it less so when I first saw it than you would have done because you have been in many different countries and have seen many different customs Of course it is a far far better place millions of times than any I have ever been used to until lately and I fancy I don t look at it with my own eyes but with hers For it would be easy to see that she has always been brought up in a tender and happy home even if she had not told me so with great love for it Well it is a rather bare lodging up a rather dark common staircase and it is nearly all a large dull room where mister Gowan paints The windows are blocked up where any one could look out and the walls have been all drawn over with chalk and charcoal by others who have lived there before oh I should think for years There is a curtain more dust coloured than red which divides it and the part behind the curtain makes the private sitting room When I first saw her there she was alone and her work had fallen out of her hand and she was looking up at the sky shining through the tops of the windows Pray do not be uneasy when I tell you but it was not quite so airy nor so bright nor so cheerful nor so happy and youthful altogether as I should have liked it to be On account of mister Gowan s painting Papa s picture which I am not quite convinced I should have known from the likeness if I had not seen him doing it I have had more opportunities of being with her since then than I might have had without this fortunate chance She is very much alone Very much alone indeed Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her I went one day when it happened that I could run round by myself at four or five o clock in the afternoon She was then dining alone and her solitary dinner had been brought in from somewhere over a kind of brazier with a fire in it and she had no company or prospect of company that I could see but the old man who had brought it He was telling her a long story of robbers outside the walls being taken up by a stone statue of a Saint to entertain her as he said to me when I came out because he had a daughter of his own though she was not so pretty I ought now to mention mister Gowan before I say what little more I have to say about her He must admire her beauty and he must be proud of her for everybody praises it and he must be fond of her and I do not doubt that he is but in his way You know his way and if it appears as careless and discontented in your eyes as it does in mine I am not wrong in thinking that it might be better suited to her If it does not seem so to you I am quite sure I am wholly mistaken for your unchanged poor child confides in your knowledge and goodness more than she could ever tell you if she was to try But don t be frightened I am not going to try Owing as I think if you think so too to mister Gowan s unsettled and dissatisfied way he applies himself to his profession very little He does nothing steadily or patiently but equally takes things up and throws them down and does them or leaves them undone without caring about them When I have heard him talking to Papa during the sittings for the picture I have sat wondering whether it could be that he has no belief in anybody else because he has no belief in himself Is it so I wonder what you will say when you come to this I know how you will look and I can almost hear the voice in which you would tell me on the Iron Bridge mister Gowan goes out a good deal among what is considered the best company here though he does not look as if he enjoyed it or liked it when he is with it and she sometimes accompanies him but lately she has gone out very little I think I have noticed that they have an inconsistent way of speaking about her as if she had made some great self interested success in marrying mister Gowan though at the same time the very same people would not have dreamed of taking him for themselves or their daughters Then he goes into the country besides to think about making sketches and in all places where there are visitors he has a large acquaintance and is very well known Besides all this he has a friend who is much in his society both at home and away from home though he treats this friend very coolly and is very uncertain in his behaviour to him I am quite sure because she has told me so that she does not like this friend He is so revolting to me too that his being away from here at present is quite a relief to my mind How much more to hers But what I particularly want you to know and why I have resolved to tell you so much while I am afraid it may make you a little uncomfortable without occasion is this She is so true and so devoted and knows so completely that all her love and duty are his for ever that you may be certain she will love him admire him praise him and conceal all his faults until she dies I believe she conceals them and always will conceal them even from herself She has given him a heart that can never be taken back and however much he may try it he will never wear out its affection You know the truth of this as you know everything far far better than I but I cannot help telling you what a nature she shows and that you can never think too well of her I have not yet called her by her name in this letter but we are such friends now that I do so when we are quietly together and she speaks to me by my name I mean not my Christian name but the name you gave me When she began to call me Amy I told her my short story and that you had always called me Little Dorrit I told her that the name was much dearer to me than any other and so she calls me Little Dorrit too Perhaps you have not heard from her father or mother yet and may not know that she has a baby son He was born only two days ago and just a week after they came It has made them very happy However I must tell you as I am to tell you all that I fancy they are under a constraint with mister Gowan and that they feel as if his mocking way with them was sometimes a slight given to their love for her It was but yesterday when I was there that I saw mister Meagles change colour and get up and go out as if he was afraid that he might say so unless he prevented himself by that means Yet I am sure they are both so considerate good humoured and reasonable that he might spare them It is hard in him not to think of them a little more I stopped at the last full stop to read all this over It looked at first as if I was taking on myself to understand and explain so much that I was half inclined not to send it But when I thought it over a little I felt more hopeful for your knowing at once that I had only been watchful for you and had only noticed what I think I have noticed because I was quickened by your interest in it Indeed you may be sure that is the truth And now I have done with the subject in the present letter and have little left to say We are all quite well and Fanny improves every day You can hardly think how kind she is to me and what pains she takes with me She has a lover who has followed her first all the way from Switzerland and then all the way from Venice and who has just confided to me that he means to follow her everywhere I was much confused by his speaking to me about it but he would I did not know what to say but at last I told him that I thought he had better not For Fanny but I did not tell him this is much too spirited and clever to suit him Still he said he would all the same I have no lover of course If you should ever get so far as this in this long letter you will perhaps say Surely Little Dorrit will not leave off without telling me something about her travels and surely it is time she did I think it is indeed but I don t know what to tell you Since we left Venice we have been in a great many wonderful places Genoa and Florence among them and have seen so many wonderful sights that I am almost giddy when I think what a crowd they make But you can tell me so much more about them than I can tell you that why should I tire you with my accounts and descriptions Dear mister Clennam as I had the courage to tell you what the familiar difficulties in my travelling mind were before I will not be a coward now One of my frequent thoughts is this Old as these cities are their age itself is hardly so curious to my reflections as that they should have been in their places all through those days when I did not even know of the existence of more than two or three of them and when I scarcely knew of anything outside our old walls There is something melancholy in it and I don t know why When we went to see the famous leaning tower at Pisa it was a bright sunny day and it and the buildings near it looked so old and the earth and the sky looked so young and its shadow on the ground was so soft and retired I could not at first think how beautiful it was or how curious but I thought O how many times when the shadow of the wall was falling on our room and when that weary tread of feet was going up and down the yard O how many times this place was just as quiet and lovely as it is to day It quite overpowered me My heart was so full that tears burst out of my eyes though I did what I could to restrain them And I have the same feeling often often Do you know that since the change in our fortunes though I appear to myself to have dreamed more than before I have always dreamed of myself as very young indeed I am not very old you may say No but that is not what I mean I have always dreamed of myself as a child learning to do needlework I have often dreamed of myself as back there seeing faces in the yard little known and which I should have thought I had quite forgotten but as often as not I have been abroad here in Switzerland or France or Italy somewhere where we have been yet always as that little child I have dreamed of going down to missus General with the patches on my clothes in which I can first remember myself I have over and over again dreamed of taking my place at dinner at Venice when we have had a large company in the mourning for my poor mother which I wore when I was eight years old and wore long after it was threadbare and would mend no more It has been a great distress to me to think how irreconcilable the company would consider it with my father s wealth and how I should displease and disgrace him and Fanny and Edward by so plainly disclosing what they wished to keep secret But I have not grown out of the little child in thinking of it and at the self same moment I have dreamed that I have sat with the heart ache at table calculating the expenses of the dinner and quite distracting myself with thinking how they were ever to be made good I have never dreamed of the change in our fortunes itself I have never dreamed of your coming back with me that memorable morning to break it I have never even dreamed of you Dear mister Clennam it is possible that I have thought of you and others so much by day that I have no thoughts left to wander round you by night For I must now confess to you that I suffer from home sickness that I long so ardently and earnestly for home as sometimes when no one sees me to pine for it I cannot bear to turn my face further away from it My heart is a little lightened when we turn towards it even for a few miles and with the knowledge that we are soon to turn away again So dearly do I love the scene of my poverty and your kindness O so dearly O so dearly Heaven knows when your poor child will see England again We are all fond of the life here except me and there are no plans for our return My dear father talks of a visit to London late in this next spring on some affairs connected with the property but I have no hope that he will bring me with him I have tried to get on a little better under missus General s instruction and I hope I am not quite so dull as I used to be I have begun to speak and understand almost easily the hard languages I told you about I did not remember at the moment when I wrote last that you knew them both but I remembered it afterwards and it helped me on God bless you dear mister Clennam Do not forget your ever grateful and affectionate LITTLE DORRIT P S Particularly remember that Minnie Gowan deserves the best remembrance in which you can hold her You cannot think too generously or too highly of her I forgot mister Pancks last time Please if you should see him give him your Little Dorrit s kind regard He was very good to Little D CHAPTER twelve In which a Great Patriotic Conference is holden The famous name of Merdle became every day more famous in the land Nobody knew that the Merdle of such high renown had ever done any good to any one alive or dead or to any earthly thing nobody knew that he had any capacity or utterance of any sort in him which had ever thrown for any creature the feeblest farthing candle ray of light on any path of duty or diversion pain or pleasure toil or rest fact or fancy among the multiplicity of paths in the labyrinth trodden by the sons of Adam nobody had the smallest reason for supposing the clay of which this object of worship was made to be other than the commonest clay with as clogged a wick smouldering inside of it as ever kept an image of humanity from tumbling to pieces All people knew or thought they knew that he had made himself immensely rich and for that reason alone prostrated themselves before him more degradedly and less excusably than the darkest savage creeps out of his hole in the ground to propitiate in some log or reptile the Deity of his benighted soul Nay the high priests of this worship had the man before them as a protest against their meanness The multitude worshipped on trust though always distinctly knowing why but the officiators at the altar had the man habitually in their view They sat at his feasts and he sat at theirs There was a spectre always attendant on him saying to these high priests Are such the signs you trust and love to honour this head these eyes this mode of speech the tone and manner of this man You are the levers of the Circumlocution Office and the rulers of men When half a dozen of you fall out by the ears it seems that mother earth can give birth to no other rulers Does your qualification lie in the superior knowledge of men which accepts courts and puffs this man Or if you are competent to judge aright the signs I never fail to show you when he appears among you is your superior honesty your qualification Two rather ugly questions these always going about town with mister Merdle and there was a tacit agreement that they must be stifled In missus Merdle s absence abroad mister Merdle still kept the great house open for the passage through it of a stream Of visitors A few of these took affable possession of the establishment Three or four ladies of distinction and liveliness used to say to one another Let us dine at our dear Merdle s next Thursday Whom shall we have Our dear Merdle would then receive his instructions and would sit heavily among the company at table and wander lumpishly about his drawing rooms afterwards only remarkable for appearing to have nothing to do with the entertainment beyond being in its way The Chief Butler the Avenging Spirit of this great man s life relaxed nothing of his severity He looked on at these dinners when the bosom was not there as he looked on at other dinners when the bosom was there and his eye was a basilisk to mister Merdle He was a hard man and would never bate an ounce of plate or a bottle of wine He would not allow a dinner to be given unless it was up to his mark He set forth the table for his own dignity If the guests chose to partake of what was served he saw no objection but it was served for the maintenance of his rank As he stood by the sideboard he seemed to announce I have accepted office to look at this which is now before me and to look at nothing less than this If he missed the presiding bosom it was as a part of his own state of which he was from unavoidable circumstances temporarily deprived just as he might have missed a centre piece or a choice wine cooler which had been sent to the Banker s mister Merdle issued invitations for a Barnacle dinner Lord Decimus was to be there mister Tite Barnacle was to be there the pleasant young Barnacle was to be there and the Chorus of Parliamentary Barnacles who went about the provinces when the House was up warbling the praises of their Chief were to be represented there It was understood to be a great occasion mister Merdle was going to take up the Barnacles Some delicate little negotiations had occurred between him and the noble Decimus the young Barnacle of engaging manners acting as negotiator and mister Merdle had decided to cast the weight of his great probity and great riches into the Barnacle scale Jobbery was suspected by the malicious perhaps because it was indisputable that if the adherence of the immortal Enemy of Mankind could have been secured by a job the Barnacles would have jobbed him for the good of the country for the good of the country missus Merdle had written to this magnificent spouse of hers whom it was heresy to regard as anything less than all the British Merchants since the days of Whittington rolled into one and gilded three feet deep all over had written to this spouse of hers several letters from Rome in quick succession urging upon him with importunity that now or never was the time to provide for Edmund Sparkler missus Merdle had shown him that the case of Edmund was urgent and that infinite advantages might result from his having some good thing directly In the grammar of missus Merdle s verbs on this momentous subject there was only one mood the Imperative and that Mood had only one Tense the Present missus Merdle s verbs were so pressingly presented to mister Merdle to conjugate that his sluggish blood and his long coat cuffs became quite agitated In which state of agitation mister Merdle evasively rolling his eyes round the Chief Butler s shoes without raising them to the index of that stupendous creature s thoughts had signified to him his intention of giving a special dinner not a very large dinner but a very special dinner The Chief Butler had signified in return that he had no objection to look on at the most expensive thing in that way that could be done and the day of the dinner was now come mister Merdle stood in one of his drawing rooms with his back to the fire waiting for the arrival of his important guests He seldom or never took the liberty of standing with his back to the fire unless he was quite alone In the presence of the Chief Butler he could not have done such a deed He would have clasped himself by the wrists in that constabulary manner of his and have paced up and down the hearthrug or gone creeping about among the rich objects of furniture if his oppressive retainer had appeared in the room at that very moment The sly shadows which seemed to dart out of hiding when the fire rose and to dart back into it when the fire fell were sufficient witnesses of his making himself so easy They were even more than sufficient if his uncomfortable glances at them might be taken to mean anything mister Merdle s right hand was filled with the evening paper and the evening paper was full of mister Merdle His wonderful enterprise his wonderful wealth his wonderful Bank were the fattening food of the evening paper that night The wonderful Bank of which he was the chief projector establisher and manager was the latest of the many Merdle wonders So modest was mister Merdle withal in the midst of these splendid achievements that he looked far more like a man in possession of his house under a distraint than a commercial Colossus bestriding his own hearthrug while the little ships were sailing into dinner Behold the vessels coming into port The engaging young Barnacle was the first arrival but Bar overtook him on the staircase Bar strengthened as usual with his double eye glass and his little jury droop was overjoyed to see the engaging young Barnacle and opined that we were going to sit in Banco as we lawyers called it to take a special argument Indeed said the sprightly young Barnacle whose name was Ferdinand how so Nay smiled Bar If you don t know how can I know You are in the innermost sanctuary of the temple I am one of the admiring concourse on the plain without Bar could be light in hand or heavy in hand according to the customer he had to deal with With Ferdinand Barnacle he was gossamer Bar was likewise always modest and self depreciatory in his way Bar was a man of great variety but one leading thread ran through the woof of all his patterns Every man with whom he had to do was in his eyes a jury man and he must get that jury man over if he could Our illustrious host and friend said Bar our shining mercantile star going into politics Going He has been in Parliament some time you know returned the engaging young Barnacle True said Bar with his light comedy laugh for special jury men which was a very different thing from his low comedy laugh for comic tradesmen on common juries he has been in Parliament for some time Yet hitherto our star has been a vacillating and wavering star Humph An average witness would have been seduced by the Humph into an affirmative answer But Ferdinand Barnacle looked knowingly at Bar as he strolled up stairs and gave him no answer at all Just so just so said Bar nodding his head for he was not to be put off in that way and therefore I spoke of our sitting in Banco to take a special argument meaning this to be a high and solemn occasion when as Captain Macheath says the judges are met a terrible show We lawyers are sufficiently liberal you see to quote the Captain though the Captain is severe upon us Nevertheless I think I could put in evidence an admission of the Captain s said Bar with a little jocose roll of his head for in his legal current of speech he always assumed the air of rallying himself with the best grace in the world an admission of the Captain s that Law in the gross is at least intended to be impartial For what says the Captain if I quote him correctly and if not with a light comedy touch of his double eye glass on his companion s shoulder my learned friend will set me right Since laws were made for every degree To curb vice in others as well as in me I wonder we ha n t better company Upon Tyburn Tree These words brought them to the drawing room where mister Merdle stood before the fire So immensely astounded was mister Merdle by the entrance of Bar with such a reference in his mouth that Bar explained himself to have been quoting Gay Assuredly not one of our Westminster Hall authorities said he but still no despicable one to a man possessing the largely practical mister Merdle s knowledge of the world mister Merdle looked as if he thought he would say something but subsequently looked as if he thought he wouldn t The interval afforded time for Bishop to be announced Bishop came in with meekness and yet with a strong and rapid step as if he wanted to get his seven league dress shoes on and go round the world to see that everybody was in a satisfactory state Bishop had no idea that there was anything significant in the occasion That was the most remarkable trait in his demeanour He was crisp fresh cheerful affable bland but so surprisingly innocent Bar sidled up to prefer his politest inquiries in reference to the health of missus Bishop missus Bishop had been a little unfortunate in the article of taking cold at a Confirmation but otherwise was well Young mister Bishop was also well He was down with his young wife and little family at his Cure of Souls The representatives of the Barnacle Chorus dropped in next and mister Merdle s physician dropped in next Bar who had a bit of one eye and a bit of his double eye glass for every one who came in at the door no matter with whom he was conversing or what he was talking about got among them all by some skilful means without being seen to get at them and touched each individual gentleman of the jury on his own individual favourite spot With some of the Chorus he laughed about the sleepy member who had gone out into the lobby the other night and voted the wrong way with others he deplored that innovating spirit in the time which could not even be prevented from taking an unnatural interest in the public service and the public money with the physician he had a word to say about the general health he had also a little information to ask him for concerning a professional man of unquestioned erudition and polished manners but those credentials in their highest development he believed were the possession of other professors of the healing art jury droop whom he had happened to have in the witness box the day before yesterday and from whom he had elicited in cross examination that he claimed to be one of the exponents of this new mode of treatment which appeared to Bar to eh well Bar thought so Bar had thought and hoped Physician would tell him so Without presuming to decide where doctors disagreed it did appear to Bar viewing it as a question of common sense and not of so called legal penetration that this new system was might be in the presence of so great an authority say Humbug Ah Fortified by such encouragement he could venture to say Humbug and now Bar s mind was relieved mister Tite Barnacle who like doctor Johnson s celebrated acquaintance had only one idea in his head and that was a wrong one had appeared by this time This eminent gentleman and mister Merdle seated diverse ways and with ruminating aspects on a yellow ottoman in the light of the fire holding no verbal communication with each other bore a strong general resemblance to the two cows in the Cuyp picture over against them But now Lord Decimus arrived The Chief Butler who up to this time had limited himself to a branch of his usual function by looking at the company as they entered and that with more of defiance than favour put himself so far out of his way as to come up stairs with him and announce him Lord Decimus being an overpowering peer a bashful young member of the Lower House who was the last fish but one caught by the Barnacles and who had been invited on this occasion to commemorate his capture shut his eyes when his Lordship came in Lord Decimus nevertheless was glad to see the Member He was also glad to see mister Merdle glad to see Bishop glad to see Bar glad to see Physician glad to see Tite Barnacle glad to see Chorus glad to see Ferdinand his private secretary Lord Decimus though one of the greatest of the earth was not remarkable for ingratiatory manners and Ferdinand had coached him up to the point of noticing all the fellows he might find there and saying he was glad to see them When he had achieved this rush of vivacity and condescension his Lordship composed himself into the picture after Cuyp and made a third cow in the group Bar who felt that he had got all the rest of the jury and must now lay hold of the Foreman soon came sidling up double eye glass in hand Bar tendered the weather as a subject neatly aloof from official reserve for the Foreman s consideration Bar said that he was told as everybody always is told though who tells them and why will ever remain a mystery that there was to be no wall fruit this year Lord Decimus had not heard anything amiss of his peaches but rather believed if his people were correct he was to have no apples No apples Bar was lost in astonishment and concern It would have been all one to him in reality if there had not been a pippin on the surface of the earth but his show of interest in this apple question was positively painful Now to what Lord Decimus for we troublesome lawyers loved to gather information and could never tell how useful it might prove to us to what Lord Decimus was this to be attributed Lord Decimus could not undertake to propound any theory about it This might have stopped another man but Bar sticking to him fresh as ever said As to pears now Long after Bar got made Attorney General this was told of him as a master stroke Lord Decimus had a reminiscence about a pear tree formerly growing in a garden near the back of his dame s house at Eton upon which pear tree the only joke of his life perennially bloomed It was a joke of a compact and portable nature turning on the difference between Eton pears and Parliamentary pairs but it was a joke a refined relish of which would seem to have appeared to Lord Decimus impossible to be had without a thorough and intimate acquaintance with the tree Therefore the story at first had no idea of such a tree sir then gradually found it in winter carried it through the changing season saw it bud saw it blossom saw it bear fruit saw the fruit ripen in short cultivated the tree in that diligent and minute manner before it got out of the bed room window to steal the fruit that many thanks had been offered up by belated listeners for the trees having been planted and grafted prior to Lord Decimus s time Bar s interest in apples was so overtopped by the wrapt suspense in which he pursued the changes of these pears from the moment when Lord Decimus solemnly opened with Your mentioning pears recalls to my remembrance a pear tree down to the rich conclusion And so we pass through the various changes of life from Eton pears to Parliamentary pairs that he had to go down stairs with Lord Decimus and even then to be seated next to him at table in order that he might hear the anecdote out By that time Bar felt that he had secured the Foreman and might go to dinner with a good appetite It was a dinner to provoke an appetite though he had not had one The rarest dishes sumptuously cooked and sumptuously served the choicest fruits the most exquisite wines marvels of workmanship in gold and silver china and glass innumerable things delicious to the senses of taste smell and sight were insinuated into its composition O what a wonderful man this Merdle what a great man what a master man how blessedly and enviably endowed in one word what a rich man He took his usual poor eighteenpennyworth of food in his usual indigestive way and had as little to say for himself as ever a wonderful man had Fortunately Lord Decimus was one of those sublimities who have no occasion to be talked to for they can be at any time sufficiently occupied with the contemplation of their own greatness This enabled the bashful young Member to keep his eyes open long enough at a time to see his dinner But whenever Lord Decimus spoke he shut them again The agreeable young Barnacle and Bar were the talkers of the party Bishop would have been exceedingly agreeable also but that his innocence stood in his way He was so soon left behind When there was any little hint of anything being in the wind he got lost directly Worldly affairs were too much for him he couldn t make them out at all This was observable when Bar said incidentally that he was happy to have heard that we were soon to have the advantage of enlisting on the good side the sound and plain sagacity not demonstrative or ostentatious but thoroughly sound and practical of our friend mister Sparkler Ferdinand Barnacle laughed and said oh yes he believed so A vote was a vote and always acceptable Bar was sorry to miss our good friend mister Sparkler to day mister Merdle He is away with missus Merdle returned that gentleman slowly coming out of a long abstraction in the course of which he had been fitting a tablespoon up his sleeve It is not indispensable for him to be on the spot The magic name of Merdle said Bar with the jury droop no doubt will suffice for all Why yes I believe so assented mister Merdle putting the spoon aside and clumsily hiding each of his hands in the coat cuff of the other hand I believe the people in my interest down there will not make any difficulty Model people said Bar I am glad you approve of them said mister Merdle And the people of those other two places now pursued Bar with a bright twinkle in his keen eye as it slightly turned in the direction of his magnificent neighbour we lawyers are always curious always inquisitive always picking up odds and ends for our patchwork minds since there is no knowing when and where they may fit into some corner the people of those other two places now Do they yield so laudably to the vast and cumulative influence of such enterprise and such renown do those little rills become absorbed so quietly and easily and as it were by the influence of natural laws so beautifully in the swoop of the majestic stream as it flows upon its wondrous way enriching the surrounding lands that their course is perfectly to be calculated and distinctly to be predicated mister Merdle a little troubled by Bar s eloquence looked fitfully about the nearest salt cellar for some moments and then said hesitating They are perfectly aware sir of their duty to Society They will return anybody I send to them for that purpose Cheering to know said Bar Cheering to know The three places in question were three little rotten holes in this Island containing three little ignorant drunken guzzling dirty out of the way constituencies that had reeled into mister Merdle s pocket Ferdinand Barnacle laughed in his easy way and airily said they were a nice set of fellows Bishop mentally perambulating among paths of peace was altogether swallowed up in absence of mind Pray asked Lord Decimus casting his eyes around the table what is this story I have heard of a gentleman long confined in a debtors prison proving to be of a wealthy family and having come into the inheritance of a large sum of money I have met with a variety of allusions to it Do you know anything of it Ferdinand I only know this much said Ferdinand that he has given the Department with which I have the honour to be associated this sparkling young Barnacle threw off the phrase sportively as who should say We know all about these forms of speech but we must keep it up we must keep the game alive no end of trouble and has put us into innumerable fixes Fixes repeated Lord Decimus with a majestic pausing and pondering on the word that made the bashful Member shut his eyes quite tight Fixes A very perplexing business indeed observed mister Tite Barnacle with an air of grave resentment What said Lord Decimus was the character of his business what was the nature of these a Fixes Ferdinand Oh it s a good story as a story returned that gentleman as good a thing of its kind as need be This mister Dorrit his name is Dorrit had incurred a responsibility to us ages before the fairy came out of the Bank and gave him his fortune under a bond he had signed for the performance of a contract which was not at all performed He was a partner in a house in some large way spirits or buttons or wine or blacking or oatmeal or woollen or pork or hooks and eyes or iron or treacle or shoes or something or other that was wanted for troops or seamen or somebody and the house burst and we being among the creditors detainees were lodged on the part of the Crown in a scientific manner and all the rest Of it When the fairy had appeared and he wanted to pay us off Egad we had got into such an exemplary state of checking and counter checking signing and counter signing that it was six months before we knew how to take the money or how to give a receipt for it It was a triumph of public business said this handsome young Barnacle laughing heartily You never saw such a lot of forms in your life Why the attorney said to me one day if I wanted this office to give me two or three thousand pounds instead of take it I couldn t have more trouble about it You are right old fellow I told him and in future you ll know that we have something to do here The pleasant young Barnacle finished by once more laughing heartily He was a very easy pleasant fellow indeed and his manners were exceedingly winning mister Tite Barnacle s view of the business was of a less airy character He took it ill that mister Dorrit had troubled the Department by wanting to pay the money and considered it a grossly informal thing to do after so many years But mister Tite Barnacle was a buttoned up man and consequently a weighty one All buttoned up men are weighty All buttoned up men are believed in Whether or no the reserved and never exercised power of unbuttoning fascinates mankind whether or no wisdom is supposed to condense and augment when buttoned up and to evaporate when unbuttoned it is certain that the man to whom importance is accorded is the buttoned up man mister Tite Barnacle never would have passed for half his current value unless his coat had been always buttoned up to his white cravat May I ask said Lord Decimus if mister Darrit or Dorrit has any family Nobody else replying the host said He has two daughters my lord Oh you are acquainted with him asked Lord Decimus missus Merdle is mister Sparkler is too In fact said mister Merdle I rather believe that one of the young ladies has made an impression on Edmund Sparkler He is susceptible and I think the conquest Here mister Merdle stopped and looked at the table cloth as he usually did when he found himself observed or listened to Bar was uncommonly pleased to find that the Merdle family and this family had already been brought into contact He submitted in a low voice across the table to Bishop that it was a kind of analogical illustration of those physical laws in virtue of which Like flies to Like He regarded this power of attraction in wealth to draw wealth to it as something remarkably interesting and curious something indefinably allied to the loadstone and gravitation Bishop who had ambled back to earth again when the present theme was broached acquiesced He said it was indeed highly important to Society that one in the trying situation of unexpectedly finding himself invested with a power for good or for evil in Society should become as it were merged in the superior power of a more legitimate and more gigantic growth the influence of which as in the case of our friend at whose board we sat was habitually exercised in harmony with the best interests of Society Thus instead of two rival and contending flames a larger and a lesser each burning with a lurid and uncertain glare we had a blended and a softened light whose genial ray diffused an equable warmth throughout the land Bishop seemed to like his own way of putting the case very much and rather dwelt upon it Bar meanwhile not to throw away a jury man making a show of sitting at his feet and feeding on his precepts The dinner and dessert being three hours long the bashful Member cooled in the shadow of Lord Decimus faster than he warmed with food and drink and had but a chilly time of it Lord Decimus like a tall tower in a flat country seemed to project himself across the table cloth hide the light from the honourable Member cool the honourable Member s marrow and give him a woeful idea of distance When he asked this unfortunate traveller to take wine he encompassed his faltering steps with the gloomiest of shades and when he said Your health sir all around him was barrenness and desolation At length Lord Decimus with a coffee cup in his hand began to hover about among the pictures and to cause an interesting speculation to arise in all minds as to the probabilities of his ceasing to hover and enabling the smaller birds to flutter up stairs which could not be done until he had urged his noble pinions in that direction After some delay and several stretches of his wings which came to nothing he soared to the drawing rooms And here a difficulty arose which always does arise when two people are specially brought together at a dinner to confer with one another Everybody except Bishop who had no suspicion of it knew perfectly well that this dinner had been eaten and drunk specifically to the end that Lord Decimus and mister Merdle should have five minutes conversation together The opportunity so elaborately prepared was now arrived and it seemed from that moment that no mere human ingenuity could so much as get the two chieftains into the same room mister Merdle and his noble guest persisted in prowling about at opposite ends of the perspective It was in vain for the engaging Ferdinand to bring Lord Decimus to look at the bronze horses near mister Merdle Then mister Merdle evaded and wandered away It was in vain for him to bring mister Merdle to Lord Decimus to tell him the history of the unique Dresden vases Then Lord Decimus evaded and wandered away while he was getting his man up to the mark Did you ever see such a thing as this said Ferdinand to Bar when he had been baffled twenty times Often returned Bar Unless I butt one of them into an appointed corner and you butt the other said Ferdinand it will not come off after all Very good said Bar I ll butt Merdle if you like but not my lord Ferdinand laughed in the midst of his vexation Confound them both said he looking at his watch I want to get away Why the deuce can t they come together They both know what they want and mean to do Look at them They were still looming at opposite ends of the perspective each with an absurd pretence of not having the other on his mind which could not have been more transparently ridiculous though his real mind had been chalked on his back Bishop who had just now made a third with Bar and Ferdinand but whose innocence had again cut him out of the subject and washed him in sweet oil was seen to approach Lord Decimus and glide into conversation I must get Merdle s doctor to catch and secure him I suppose said Ferdinand and then I must lay hold of my illustrious kinsman and decoy him if I can drag him if I can t to the conference Since you do me the honour said Bar with his slyest smile to ask for my poor aid it shall be yours with the greatest pleasure I don t think this is to be done by one man But if you will undertake to pen my lord into that furthest drawing room where he is now so profoundly engaged I will undertake to bring our dear Merdle into the presence without the possibility of getting away Done said Ferdinand Done said Bar Bar was a sight wondrous to behold and full of matter when jauntily waving his double eye glass by its ribbon and jauntily drooping to an Universe of jurymen he in the most accidental manner ever seen found himself at mister Merdle s shoulder and embraced that opportunity of mentioning a little point to him on which he particularly wished to be guided by the light of his practical knowledge Here he took mister Merdle s arm and walked him gently away A banker whom we would call A B advanced a considerable sum of money which we would call fifteen thousand pounds to a client or customer of his whom he would call P q Here as they were getting towards Lord Decimus he held mister Merdle tight As a security for the repayment of this advance to P Q whom we would call a widow lady there were placed in A B s hands the title deeds of a freehold estate which we would call Blinkiter Doddles Now the point was this A limited right of felling and lopping in the woods of Blinkiter Doddles lay in the son of P Q then past his majority and whom we would call X Y but really this was too bad In the presence of Lord Decimus to detain the host with chopping our dry chaff of law was really too bad Another time Bar was truly repentant and would not say another syllable Would Bishop favour him with half a dozen words He had now set mister Merdle down on a couch side by side with Lord Decimus and to it they must go now or never And now the rest of the company highly excited and interested always excepting Bishop who had not the slightest idea that anything was going on formed in one group round the fire in the next drawing room and pretended to be chatting easily on the infinite variety of small topics while everybody s thoughts and eyes were secretly straying towards the secluded pair The Chorus were excessively nervous perhaps as labouring under the dreadful apprehension that some good thing was going to be diverted from them Bishop alone talked steadily and evenly He conversed with the great Physician on that relaxation of the throat with which young curates were too frequently afflicted and on the means of lessening the great prevalence of that disorder in the church Physician as a general rule was of opinion that the best way to avoid it was to know how to read before you made a profession of reading Bishop said dubiously did he really think so And Physician said decidedly yes he did Ferdinand meanwhile was the only one of the party who skirmished on the outside of the circle he kept about mid way between it and the two as if some sort of surgical operation were being performed by Lord Decimus on mister Merdle or by mister Merdle on Lord Decimus and his services might at any moment be required as Dresser In fact within a quarter of an hour Lord Decimus called to him Ferdinand and he went and took his place in the conference for some five minutes more Then a half suppressed gasp broke out among the Chorus for Lord Decimus rose to take his leave Again coached up by Ferdinand to the point of making himself popular he shook hands in the most brilliant manner with the whole company and even said to Bar I hope you were not bored by my pears To which Bar retorted Eton my lord or Parliamentary neatly showing that he had mastered the joke and delicately insinuating that he could never forget it while his life remained All the grave importance that was buttoned up in mister Tite Barnacle took itself away next and Ferdinand took himself away next to the opera Some of the rest lingered a little marrying golden liqueur glasses to Buhl tables with sticky rings on the desperate chance of mister Merdle s saying something But Merdle as usual oozed sluggishly and muddily about his drawing room saying never a word In a day or two it was announced to all the town that Edmund Sparkler Esquire son in law of the eminent mister Merdle of worldwide renown was made one of the Lords of the Circumlocution Office and proclamation was issued to all true believers that this admirable appointment was to be hailed as a graceful and gracious mark of homage rendered by the graceful and gracious Decimus to that commercial interest which must ever in a great commercial country and all the rest of it with blast of trumpet So bolstered by this mark of Government homage the wonderful Bank and all the other wonderful undertakings went on and went up and gapers came to Harley Street Cavendish Square only to look at the house where the golden wonder lived And when they saw the Chief Butler looking out at the hall door in his moments of condescension the gapers said how rich he looked and wondered how much money he had in the wonderful Bank But if they had known that respectable Nemesis better they would not have wondered about it and might have stated the amount with the utmost precision CHAPTER thirteen The Progress of an Epidemic That it is at least as difficult to stay a moral infection as a physical one that such a disease will spread with the malignity and rapidity of the Plague that the contagion when it has once made head will spare no pursuit or condition but will lay hold on people in the soundest health and become developed in the most unlikely constitutions is a fact as firmly established by experience as that we human creatures breathe an atmosphere A blessing beyond appreciation would be conferred upon mankind if the tainted in whose weakness or wickedness these virulent disorders are bred could be instantly seized and placed in close confinement not to say summarily smothered before the poison is communicable As a vast fire will fill the air to a great distance with its roar so the sacred flame which the mighty Barnacles had fanned caused the air to resound more and more with the name of Merdle It was deposited on every lip and carried into every ear There never was there never had been there never again should be such a man as mister Merdle Nobody as aforesaid knew what he had done but everybody knew him to be the greatest that had appeared Down in Bleeding Heart Yard where there was not one unappropriated halfpenny as lively an interest was taken in this paragon of men as on the Stock Exchange missus Plornish now established in the small grocery and general trade in a snug little shop at the crack end of the Yard at the top of the steps with her little old father and Maggy acting as assistants habitually held forth about him over the counter in conversation with her customers mister Plornish who had a small share in a small builder s business in the neighbourhood said trowel in hand on the tops of scaffolds and on the tiles of houses that people did tell him as mister Merdle was the one mind you to put us all to rights in respects of that which all on us looked to and to bring us all safe home as much as we needed mind you fur toe be brought mister Baptist sole lodger of mister and missus Plornish was reputed in whispers to lay by the savings which were the result of his simple and moderate life for investment in one of mister Merdle s certain enterprises The female Bleeding Hearts when they came for ounces of tea and hundredweights of talk gave missus Plornish to understand That how ma am they had heard from their cousin Mary Anne which worked in the line that his lady s dresses would fill three waggons That how she was as handsome a lady ma am as lived no matter wheres and a busk like marble itself That how according to what they was told ma am it was her son by a former husband as was took into the Government and a General he had been and armies he had marched again and victory crowned if all you heard was to be believed That how it was reported that mister Merdle s words had been that if they could have made it worth his while to take the whole Government he would have took it without a profit but that take it he could not and stand a loss That how it was not to be expected ma am that he should lose by it his ways being as you might say and utter no falsehood paved with gold but that how it was much to be regretted that something handsome hadn t been got up to make it worth his while for it was such and only such that knowed the heighth to which the bread and butchers meat had rose and it was such and only such that both could and would bring that heighth down So rife and potent was the fever in Bleeding Heart Yard that mister Pancks s rent days caused no interval in the patients The disease took the singular form on those occasions of causing the infected to find an unfathomable excuse and consolation in allusions to the magic name Now then mister Pancks would say to a defaulting lodger Pay up Come on I haven t got it mister Pancks Defaulter would reply I tell you the truth sir when I say I haven t got so much as a single sixpence of it to bless myself with This won t do you know mister Pancks would retort You don t expect it will do do you Defaulter would admit with a low spirited No sir having no such expectation My proprietor isn t going to stand this you know mister Pancks would proceed He don t send me here for this Pay up Come The Defaulter would make answer Ah mister Pancks If I was the rich gentleman whose name is in everybody s mouth if my name was Merdle sir I d soon pay up and be glad to do it Dialogues on the rent question usually took place at the house doors or in the entries and in the presence of several deeply interested Bleeding Hearts They always received a reference of this kind with a low murmur of response as if it were convincing and the Defaulter however black and discomfited before always cheered up a little in making it If I was mister Merdle sir you wouldn t have cause to complain of me then No believe me the Defaulter would proceed with a shake of the head I d pay up so quick then mister Pancks that you shouldn t have to ask me The response would be heard again here implying that it was impossible to say anything fairer and that this was the next thing to paying the money down mister Pancks would be now reduced to saying as he booked the case Well You ll have the broker in and be turned out that s what ll happen to you It s no use talking to me about mister Merdle You are not mister Merdle any more than I am No sir the Defaulter would reply I only wish you were him sir The response would take this up quickly replying with great feeling Only wish you were him sir You d be easier with us if you were mister Merdle sir the Defaulter would go on with rising spirits and it would be better for all parties Better for our sakes and better for yours too You wouldn t have to worry no one then sir You wouldn t have to worry us and you wouldn t have to worry yourself You d be easier in your own mind sir and you d leave others easier too you would if you were mister Merdle mister Pancks in whom these impersonal compliments produced an irresistible sheepishness never rallied after such a charge He could only bite his nails and puff away to the next Defaulter The responsive Bleeding Hearts would then gather round the Defaulter whom he had just abandoned and the most extravagant rumours would circulate among them to their great comfort touching the amount of mister Merdle s ready money From one of the many such defeats of one of many rent days mister Pancks having finished his day s collection repaired with his note book under his arm to missus Plornish s corner mister Pancks s object was not professional but social He had had a trying day and wanted a little brightening By this time he was on friendly terms with the Plornish family having often looked in upon them at similar seasons and borne his part in recollections of Miss Dorrit missus Plornish s shop parlour had been decorated under her own eye and presented on the side towards the shop a little fiction in which missus Plornish unspeakably rejoiced This poetical heightening of the parlour consisted in the wall being painted to represent the exterior of a thatched cottage the artist having introduced in as effective a manner as he found compatible with their highly disproportionate dimensions the real door and window The modest sunflower and hollyhock were depicted as flourishing with great luxuriance on this rustic dwelling while a quantity of dense smoke issuing from the chimney indicated good cheer within and also perhaps that it had not been lately swept A faithful dog was represented as flying at the legs of the friendly visitor from the threshold and a circular pigeon house enveloped in a cloud of pigeons arose from behind the garden paling On the door when it was shut appeared the semblance of a brass plate presenting the inscription Happy Cottage T and M Plornish the partnership expressing man and wife No Poetry and no Art ever charmed the imagination more than the union of the two in this counterfeit cottage charmed missus Plornish It was nothing to her that Plornish had a habit of leaning against it as he smoked his pipe after work when his hat blotted out the pigeon house and all the pigeons when his back swallowed up the dwelling when his hands in his pockets uprooted the blooming garden and laid waste the adjacent country To missus Plornish it was still a most beautiful cottage a most wonderful deception and it made no difference that mister Plornish s eye was some inches above the level of the gable bed room in the thatch To come out into the shop after it was shut and hear her father sing a song inside this cottage was a perfect Pastoral to missus Plornish the Golden Age revived And truly if that famous period had been revived or had ever been at all it may be doubted whether it would have produced many more heartily admiring daughters than the poor woman Warned of a visitor by the tinkling bell at the shop door missus Plornish came out of Happy Cottage to see who it might be I guessed it was you mister Pancks said she for it s quite your regular night ain t it Here s father you see come out to serve at the sound of the bell like a brisk young shopman Ain t he looking well Father s more pleased to see you than if you was a customer for he dearly loves a gossip and when it turns upon Miss Dorrit he loves it all the more You never heard father in such voice as he is at present said missus Plornish her own voice quavering she was so proud and pleased He gave us Strephon last night to that degree that Plornish gets up and makes him this speech across the table John Edward Nandy says Plornish to father I never heard you come the warbles as I have heard you come the warbles this night An t it gratifying mister Pancks though really mister Pancks who had snorted at the old man in his friendliest manner replied in the affirmative and casually asked whether that lively Altro chap had come in yet missus Plornish answered no not yet though he had gone to the West End with some work and had said he should be back by tea time mister Pancks was then hospitably pressed into Happy Cottage where he encountered the elder Master Plornish just come home from school Examining that young student lightly on the educational proceedings of the day he found that the more advanced pupils who were in the large text and the letter M had been set the copy Merdle Millions And how are you getting on missus Plornish said Pancks since we re mentioning millions Very steady indeed sir returned missus Plornish Father dear would you go into the shop and tidy the window a little bit before tea your taste being so beautiful John Edward Nandy trotted away much gratified to comply with his daughter s request missus Plornish who was always in mortal terror of mentioning pecuniary affairs before the old gentleman lest any disclosure she made might rouse his spirit and induce him to run away to the workhouse was thus left free to be confidential with mister Pancks It s quite true that the business is very steady indeed said missus Plornish lowering her voice and has a excellent connection The only thing that stands in its way sir is the Credit This drawback rather severely felt by most people who engaged in commercial transactions with the inhabitants of Bleeding Heart Yard was a large stumbling block in missus Plornish s trade When mister Dorrit had established her in the business the Bleeding Hearts had shown an amount of emotion and a determination to support her in it that did honour to human nature Recognising her claim upon their generous feelings as one who had long been a member of their community they pledged themselves with great feeling to deal with missus Plornish come what would and bestow their patronage on no other establishment Influenced by these noble sentiments they had even gone out of their way to purchase little luxuries in the grocery and butter line to which they were unaccustomed saying to one another that if they did stretch a point was it not for a neighbour and a friend and for whom ought a point to be stretched if not for such So stimulated the business was extremely brisk and the articles in stock went off with the greatest celerity In short if the Bleeding Hearts had but paid the undertaking would have been a complete success whereas by reason of their exclusively confining themselves to owing the profits actually realised had not yet begun to appear in the books mister Pancks was making a very porcupine of himself by sticking his hair up in the contemplation of this state of accounts when old mister Nandy re entering the cottage with an air of mystery entreated them to come and look at the strange behaviour of mister Baptist who seemed to have met with something that had scared him All three going into the shop and watching through the window then saw mister Baptist pale and agitated go through the following extraordinary performances First he was observed hiding at the top of the steps leading down into the Yard and peeping up and down the street with his head cautiously thrust out close to the side of the shop door After very anxious scrutiny he came out of his retreat and went briskly down the street as if he were going away altogether then suddenly turned about and went at the same pace and with the same feint up the street He had gone no further up the street than he had gone down when he crossed the road and disappeared The object of this last manoeuvre was only apparent when his entering the shop with a sudden twist from the steps again explained that he had made a wide and obscure circuit round to the other or Doyce and Clennam end of the Yard and had come through the Yard and bolted in He was out of breath by that time as he might well be and his heart seemed to jerk faster than the little shop bell as it quivered and jingled behind him with his hasty shutting of the door Hallo old chap said mister Pancks Altro old boy What s the matter mister Baptist or Signor Cavalletto understood English now almost as well as mister Pancks himself and could speak it very well too Nevertheless missus Plornish with a pardonable vanity in that accomplishment of hers which made her all but Italian stepped in as interpreter E ask know said missus Plornish What go wrong Come into the happy little cottage Padrona returned mister Baptist imparting great stealthiness to his flurried back handed shake of his right forefinger Come there missus Plornish was proud of the title Padrona which she regarded as signifying not so much Mistress of the house as Mistress of the Italian tongue She immediately complied with mister Baptist s request and they all went into the cottage E ope you no fright said missus Plornish then interpreting mister Pancks in a new way with her usual fertility of resource What appen Peaka Padrona I have seen some one returned Baptist I have rincontrato him Im Oo him asked missus Plornish A bad man A baddest man I have hoped that I should never see him again Ow you know him bad asked missus Plornish It does not matter Padrona I know it too well E see you asked missus Plornish No I hope not I believe not He says missus Plornish then interpreted addressing her father and Pancks with mild condescension that he has met a bad man but he hopes the bad man didn t see him Why inquired missus Plornish reverting to the Italian language why ope bad man no see Padrona dearest returned the little foreigner whom she so considerately protected do not ask I pray Once again I say it matters not I have fear of this man I do not wish to see him I do not wish to be known of him never again Enough most beautiful Leave it The topic was so disagreeable to him and so put his usual liveliness to the rout that missus Plornish forbore to press him further the rather as the tea had been drawing for some time on the hob But she was not the less surprised and curious for asking no more questions neither was mister Pancks whose expressive breathing had been labouring hard since the entrance of the little man like a locomotive engine with a great load getting up a steep incline Maggy now better dressed than of yore though still faithful to the monstrous character of her cap had been in the background from the first with open mouth and eyes which staring and gaping features were not diminished in breadth by the untimely suppression of the subject However no more was said about it though much appeared to be thought on all sides by no means excepting the two young Plornishes who partook of the evening meal as if their eating the bread and butter were rendered almost superfluous by the painful probability of the worst of men shortly presenting himself for the purpose of eating them mister Baptist by degrees began to chirp a little but never stirred from the seat he had taken behind the door and close to the window though it was not his usual place As often as the little bell rang he started and peeped out secretly with the end of the little curtain in his hand and the rest before his face evidently not at all satisfied but that the man he dreaded had tracked him through all his doublings and turnings with the certainty of a terrible bloodhound The entrance at various times of two or three customers and of mister Plornish gave mister Baptist just enough of this employment to keep the attention of the company fixed upon him Tea was over and the children were abed and missus Plornish was feeling her way to the dutiful proposal that her father should favour them with Chloe when the bell rang again and mister Clennam came in Clennam had been poring late over his books and letters for the waiting rooms of the Circumlocution Office ravaged his time sorely Over and above that he was depressed and made uneasy by the late occurrence at his mother s He looked worn and solitary He felt so too but nevertheless was returning home from his counting house by that end of the Yard to give them the intelligence that he had received another letter from Miss Dorrit The news made a sensation in the cottage which drew off the general attention from mister Baptist Maggy who pushed her way into the foreground immediately would have seemed to draw in the tidings of her Little Mother equally at her ears nose mouth and eyes but that the last were obstructed by tears She was particularly delighted when Clennam assured her that there were hospitals and very kindly conducted hospitals in Rome mister Pancks rose into new distinction in virtue of being specially remembered in the letter Everybody was pleased and interested and Clennam was well repaid for his trouble But you are tired sir Let me make you a cup of tea said missus Plornish if you d condescend to take such a thing in the cottage and many thanks to you too I am sure for bearing us in mind so kindly mister Plornish deeming it incumbent on him as host to add his personal acknowledgments tendered them in the form which always expressed his highest ideal of a combination of ceremony with sincerity John Edward Nandy said mister Plornish addressing the old gentleman Sir It s not too often that you see unpretending actions without a spark of pride and therefore when you see them give grateful honour unto the same being that if you don t and live to want em it follows serve you right To which mister Nandy replied I am heartily of your opinion Thomas and which your opinion is the same as mine and therefore no more words and not being backwards with that opinion which opinion giving it as yes Thomas yes is the opinion in which yourself and me must ever be unanimously jined by all and where there is not difference of opinion there can be none but one opinion which fully no Thomas Thomas no Arthur with less formality expressed himself gratified by their high appreciation of so very slight an attention on his part and explained as to the tea that he had not yet dined and was going straight home to refresh after a long day s labour or he would have readily accepted the hospitable offer As mister Pancks was somewhat noisily getting his steam up for departure he concluded by asking that gentleman if he would walk with him mister Pancks said he desired no better engagement and the two took leave of Happy Cottage If you will come home with me Pancks said Arthur when they got into the street and will share what dinner or supper there is it will be next door to an act of charity for I am weary and out of sorts to night Ask me to do a greater thing than that said Pancks when you want it done and I ll do it Between this eccentric personage and Clennam a tacit understanding and accord had been always improving since mister Pancks flew over mister Rugg s back in the Marshalsea Yard When the carriage drove away on the memorable day of the family s departure these two had looked after it together and had walked slowly away together When the first letter came from little Dorrit nobody was more interested in hearing of her than mister Pancks The second letter at that moment in Clennam s breast pocket particularly remembered him by name Though he had never before made any profession or protestation to Clennam and though what he had just said was little enough as to the words in which it was expressed Clennam had long had a growing belief that mister Pancks in his own odd way was becoming attached to him All these strings intertwining made Pancks a very cable of anchorage that night I am quite alone Arthur explained as they walked on My partner is away busily engaged at a distance on his branch of our business and you shall do just as you like Thank you You didn t take particular notice of little Altro just now did you said Pancks No Why He s a bright fellow and I like him said Pancks Something has gone amiss with him to day Have you any idea of any cause that can have overset him You surprise me None whatever mister Pancks gave his reasons for the inquiry Arthur was quite unprepared for them and quite unable to suggest an explanation of them Perhaps you ll ask him said Pancks as he s a stranger Ask him what returned Clennam What he has on his mind I ought first to see for myself that he has something on his mind I think said Clennam I have found him in every way so diligent so grateful for little enough and so trustworthy that it might look like suspecting him And that would be very unjust True said Pancks But I say You oughtn t to be anybody s proprietor mister Clennam You re much too delicate For the matter of that returned Clennam laughing I have not a large proprietary share in Cavalletto His carving is his livelihood He keeps the keys of the Factory watches it every alternate night and acts as a sort of housekeeper to it generally but we have little work in the way of his ingenuity though we give him what we have No I am rather his adviser than his proprietor To call me his standing counsel and his banker would be nearer the fact Speaking of being his banker is it not curious Pancks that the ventures which run just now in so many people s heads should run even in little Cavalletto s Ventures retorted Pancks with a snort What ventures These Merdle enterprises Oh Investments said Pancks Ay ay I didn t know you were speaking of investments His quick way of replying caused Clennam to look at him with a doubt whether he meant more than he said As it was accompanied however with a quickening of his pace and a corresponding increase in the labouring of his machinery Arthur did not pursue the matter and they soon arrived at his house A dinner of soup and a pigeon pie served on a little round table before the fire and flavoured with a bottle of good wine oiled mister Pancks s works in a highly effective manner so that when Clennam produced his Eastern pipe and handed mister Pancks another Eastern pipe the latter gentleman was perfectly comfortable They puffed for a while in silence mister Pancks like a steam vessel with wind tide calm water and all other sea going conditions in her favour He was the first to speak and he spoke thus Yes Investments is the word Clennam with his former look said Ah I am going back to it you see said Pancks Yes I see you are going back to it returned Clennam wondering why Wasn t it a curious thing that they should run in little Altro s head Eh said Pancks as he smoked Wasn t that how you put it That was what I said Ay But think of the whole Yard having got it Think of their all meeting me with it on my collecting days here and there and everywhere Whether they pay or whether they don t pay Merdle Merdle Merdle Always Merdle Very strange how these runs on an infatuation prevail said Arthur An t it returned Pancks After smoking for a minute or so more drily than comported with his recent oiling he added Because you see these people don t understand the subject Not a bit assented Clennam Not a bit cried Pancks Know nothing of figures Know nothing of money questions Never made a calculation Never worked it sir If they had Clennam was going on to say when mister Pancks without change of countenance produced a sound so far surpassing all his usual efforts nasal or bronchial that he stopped If they had repeated Pancks in an inquiring tone I thought you spoke said Arthur hesitating what name to give the interruption Not at all said Pancks Not yet I may in a minute If they had If they had observed Clennam who was a little at a loss how to take his friend why I suppose they would have known better How so mister Clennam Pancks asked quickly and with an odd effect of having been from the commencement of the conversation loaded with the heavy charge he now fired off They re right you know They don t mean to be but they re right Right in sharing Cavalletto s inclination to speculate with mister Merdle Per fectly sir said Pancks I ve gone into it I ve made the calculations I ve worked it They re safe and genuine Relieved by having got to this mister Pancks took as long a pull as his lungs would permit at his Eastern pipe and looked sagaciously and steadily at Clennam while inhaling and exhaling too In those moments mister Pancks began to give out the dangerous infection with which he was laden It is the manner of communicating these diseases it is the subtle way in which they go about Do you mean my good Pancks asked Clennam emphatically that you would put that thousand pounds of yours let us say for instance out at this kind of interest Certainly said Pancks Already done it sir mister Pancks took another long inhalation another long exhalation another long sagacious look at Clennam I tell you mister Clennam I ve gone into it said Pancks He s a man of immense resources enormous capital government influence They re the best schemes afloat They re safe They re certain Well returned Clennam looking first at him gravely and then at the fire gravely You surprise me Bah Pancks retorted Don t say that sir It s what you ought to do yourself Why don t you do as I do Of whom mister Pancks had taken the prevalent disease he could no more have told than if he had unconsciously taken a fever Bred at first as many physical diseases are in the wickedness of men and then disseminated in their ignorance these epidemics after a period get communicated to many sufferers who are neither ignorant nor wicked mister Pancks might or might not have caught the illness himself from a subject of this class but in this category he appeared before Clennam and the infection he threw off was all the more virulent And you have really invested Clennam had already passed to that word your thousand pounds Pancks To be sure sir replied Pancks boldly with a puff of smoke And only wish it ten Now Clennam had two subjects lying heavy on his lonely mind that night the one his partner s long deferred hope the other what he had seen and heard at his mother s In the relief of having this companion and of feeling that he could trust him he passed on to both and both brought him round again with an increase and acceleration of force to his point of departure It came about in the simplest manner Quitting the investment subject after an interval of silent looking at the fire through the smoke of his pipe he told Pancks how and why he was occupied with the great National Department A hard case it has been and a hard case it is on Doyce he finished by saying with all the honest feeling the topic roused in him Hard indeed Pancks acquiesced But you manage for him mister Clennam How do you mean Manage the money part of the business Yes As well as I can Manage it better sir said Pancks Recompense him for his toils and disappointments Give him the chances of the time He ll never benefit himself in that way patient and preoccupied workman He looks to you sir I do my best Pancks returned Clennam uneasily As to duly weighing and considering these new enterprises of which I have had no experience I doubt if I am fit for it I am growing old Growing old cried Pancks Ha ha There was something so indubitably genuine in the wonderful laugh and series of snorts and puffs engendered in mister Pancks s astonishment at and utter rejection of the idea that his being quite in earnest could not be questioned Growing old cried Pancks Hear hear hear Old Hear him hear him The positive refusal expressed in mister Pancks s continued snorts no less than in these exclamations to entertain the sentiment for a single instant drove Arthur away from it Indeed he was fearful of something happening to mister Pancks in the violent conflict that took place between the breath he jerked out of himself and the smoke he jerked into himself This abandonment of the second topic threw him on the third Young old or middle aged Pancks he said when there was a favourable pause I am in a very anxious and uncertain state a state that even leads me to doubt whether anything now seeming to belong to me may be really mine Shall I tell you how this is Shall I put a great trust in you You shall sir said Pancks if you believe me worthy of it I do You may mister Pancks s short and sharp rejoinder confirmed by the sudden outstretching of his coaly hand was most expressive and convincing Arthur shook the hand warmly He then softening the nature of his old apprehensions as much as was possible consistently with their being made intelligible and never alluding to his mother by name but speaking vaguely of a relation of his confided to mister Pancks a broad outline of the misgivings he entertained and of the interview he had witnessed mister Pancks listened with such interest that regardless of the charms of the Eastern pipe he put it in the grate among the fire irons and occupied his hands during the whole recital in so erecting the loops and hooks of hair all over his head that he looked when it came to a conclusion like a journeyman Hamlet in conversation with his father s spirit Brings me back sir was his exclamation then with a startling touch on Clennam s knee brings me back sir to the Investments I don t say anything of your making yourself poor to repair a wrong you never committed That s you A man must be himself But I say this fearing you may want money to save your own blood from exposure and disgrace make as much as you can Arthur shook his head but looked at him thoughtfully too Be as rich as you can sir Pancks adjured him with a powerful concentration of all his energies on the advice Be as rich as you honestly can It s your duty Not for your sake but for the sake of others Take time by the forelock Poor mister Doyce who really is growing old depends upon you Your relative depends upon you You don t know what depends upon you Well well well returned Arthur Enough for to night One word more mister Clennam retorted Pancks and then enough for to night Why should you leave all the gains to the gluttons knaves and impostors Why should you leave all the gains that are to be got to my proprietor and the like of him Yet you re always doing it When I say you I mean such men as you You know you are Why I see it every day of my life I see nothing else It s my business to see it Therefore I say urged Pancks Go in and win But what of Go in and lose said Arthur Can t be done sir returned Pancks I have looked into it Name up everywhere immense resources enormous capital great position high connection government influence Can t be done Gradually after this closing exposition mister Pancks subsided allowed his hair to droop as much as it ever would droop on the utmost persuasion reclaimed the pipe from the fire irons filled it anew and smoked it out They said little more but were company to one another in silently pursuing the same subjects and did not part until midnight On taking his leave mister Pancks when he had shaken hands with Clennam worked completely round him before he steamed out at the door This Arthur received as an assurance that he might implicitly rely on Pancks if he ever should come to need assistance either in any of the matters of which they had spoken that night or any other subject that could in any way affect himself At intervals all next day and even while his attention was fixed on other things he thought of mister Pancks s investment of his thousand pounds and of his having looked into it He thought of mister Pancks s being so sanguine in this matter and of his not being usually of a sanguine character He thought of the great National Department and of the delight it would be to him to see Doyce better off He thought of the darkly threatening place that went by the name of Home in his remembrance and of the gathering shadows which made it yet more darkly threatening than of old He observed anew that wherever he went he saw or heard or touched the celebrated name of Merdle he found it difficult even to remain at his desk a couple of hours without having it presented to one of his bodily senses through some agency or other He began to think it was curious too that it should be everywhere and that nobody but he should seem to have any mistrust of it Though indeed he began to remember when he got to this even he did not mistrust it he had only happened to keep aloof from it Such symptoms when a disease of the kind is rife are usually the signs of sickening CHAPTER fourteen Taking Advice When it became known to the Britons on the shore of the yellow Tiber that their intelligent compatriot mister Sparkler was made one of the Lords of their Circumlocution Office they took it as a piece of news with which they had no nearer concern than with any other piece of news any other Accident or Offence in the English papers Some laughed some said by way of complete excuse that the post was virtually a sinecure and any fool who could spell his name was good enough for it some and these the more solemn political oracles said that Decimus did wisely to strengthen himself and that the sole constitutional purpose of all places within the gift of Decimus was that Decimus should strengthen himself A few bilious Britons there were who would not subscribe to this article of faith but their objection was purely theoretical In a practical point of view they listlessly abandoned the matter as being the business of some other Britons unknown somewhere or nowhere In like manner at home great numbers of Britons maintained for as long as four and twenty consecutive hours that those invisible and anonymous Britons ought to take it up and that if they quietly acquiesced in it they deserved it But of what class the remiss Britons were composed and where the unlucky creatures hid themselves and why they hid themselves and how it constantly happened that they neglected their interests when so many other Britons were quite at a loss to account for their not looking after those interests was not either upon the shore of the yellow Tiber or the shore of the black Thames made apparent to men missus Merdle circulated the news as she received congratulations on it with a careless grace that displayed it to advantage as the setting displays the jewel Yes she said Edmund had taken the place mister Merdle wished him to take it and he had taken it She hoped Edmund might like it but really she didn t know It would keep him in town a good deal and he preferred the country Still it was not a disagreeable position and it was a position There was no denying that the thing was a compliment to mister Merdle and was not a bad thing for Edmund if he liked it It was just as well that he should have something to do and it was just as well that he should have something for doing it Whether it would be more agreeable to Edmund than the army remained to be seen Thus the Bosom accomplished in the art of seeming to make things of small account and really enhancing them in the process While Henry Gowan whom Decimus had thrown away went through the whole round of his acquaintance between the Gate of the People and the town of Albano vowing almost but not quite with tears in his eyes that Sparkler was the sweetest tempered simplest hearted altogether most lovable jackass that ever grazed on the public common and that only one circumstance could have delighted him Gowan more than his the beloved jackass s getting this post and that would have been his Gowan s getting it himself He said it was the very thing for Sparkler There was nothing to do and he would do it charmingly there was a handsome salary to draw and he would draw it charmingly it was a delightful appropriate capital appointment and he almost forgave the donor his slight of himself in his joy that the dear donkey for whom he had so great an affection was so admirably stabled Nor did his benevolence stop here He took pains on all social occasions to draw mister Sparkler out and make him conspicuous before the company and although the considerate action always resulted in that young gentleman s making a dreary and forlorn mental spectacle of himself the friendly intention was not to be doubted Unless indeed it chanced to be doubted by the object of mister Sparkler s affections Miss Fanny was now in the difficult situation of being universally known in that light and of not having dismissed mister Sparkler however capriciously she used him Hence she was sufficiently identified with the gentleman to feel compromised by his being more than usually ridiculous and hence being by no means deficient in quickness she sometimes came to his rescue against Gowan and did him very good service But while doing this she was ashamed of him undetermined whether to get rid of him or more decidedly encourage him distracted with apprehensions that she was every day becoming more and more immeshed in her uncertainties and tortured by misgivings that missus Merdle triumphed in her distress With this tumult in her mind it is no subject for surprise that Miss Fanny came home one night in a state of agitation from a concert and ball at missus Merdle s house and on her sister affectionately trying to soothe her pushed that sister away from the toilette table at which she sat angrily trying to cry and declared with a heaving bosom that she detested everybody and she wished she was dead Dear Fanny what is the matter Tell me Matter you little Mole said Fanny If you were not the blindest of the blind you would have no occasion to ask me The idea of daring to pretend to assert that you have eyes in your head and yet ask me what s the matter Is it mister Sparkler dear Mis ter Spark ler repeated Fanny with unbounded scorn as if he were the last subject in the Solar system that could possibly be near her mind No Miss Bat it is not Immediately afterwards she became remorseful for having called her sister names declaring with sobs that she knew she made herself hateful but that everybody drove her to it I don t think you are well to night dear Fanny Stuff and nonsense replied the young lady turning angry again I am as well as you are Perhaps I might say better and yet make no boast of it Poor Little Dorrit not seeing her way to the offering of any soothing words that would escape repudiation deemed it best to remain quiet At first Fanny took this ill too protesting to her looking glass that of all the trying sisters a girl could have she did think the most trying sister was a flat sister That she knew she was at times a wretched temper that she knew she made herself hateful that when she made herself hateful nothing would do her half the good as being told so but that being afflicted with a flat sister she never WAS told so and the consequence resulted that she was absolutely tempted and goaded into making herself disagreeable Besides she angrily told her looking glass she didn t want to be forgiven It was not a right example that she should be constantly stooping to be forgiven by a younger sister And this was the Art of it that she was always being placed in the position of being forgiven whether she liked it or not Finally she burst into violent weeping and when her sister came and sat close at her side to comfort her said Amy you re an Angel But I tell you what my Pet said Fanny when her sister s gentleness had calmed her it now comes to this that things cannot and shall not go on as they are at present going on and that there must be an end of this one way or another As the announcement was vague though very peremptory Little Dorrit returned Let us talk about it Quite so my dear assented Fanny as she dried her eyes Let us talk about it I am rational again now and you shall advise me Will you advise me my sweet child Even Amy smiled at this notion but she said I will Fanny as well as I can Thank you dearest Amy returned Fanny kissing her You are my anchor Having embraced her Anchor with great affection Fanny took a bottle of sweet toilette water from the table and called to her maid for a fine handkerchief She then dismissed that attendant for the night and went on to be advised dabbing her eyes and forehead from time to time to cool them My love Fanny began our characters and points of view are sufficiently different kiss me again my darling to make it very probable that I shall surprise you by what I am going to say What I am going to say my dear is that notwithstanding our property we labour socially speaking under disadvantages You don t quite understand what I mean Amy I have no doubt I shall said Amy mildly after a few words more Well my dear what I mean is that we are after all newcomers into fashionable life I am sure Fanny Little Dorrit interposed in her zealous admiration no one need find that out in you Well my dear child perhaps not said Fanny though it s most kind and most affectionate in you you precious girl to say so Here she dabbed her sister s forehead and blew upon it a little But you are resumed Fanny as is well known the dearest little thing that ever was To resume my child Pa is extremely gentlemanly and extremely well informed but he is in some trifling respects a little different from other gentlemen of his fortune partly on account of what he has gone through poor dear partly I fancy on account of its often running in his mind that other people are thinking about that while he is talking to them Uncle my love is altogether unpresentable Though a dear creature to whom I am tenderly attached he is socially speaking shocking Edward is frightfully expensive and dissipated I don t mean that there is anything ungenteel in that itself far from it but I do mean that he doesn t do it well and that he doesn t if I may so express myself get the money s worth in the sort of dissipated reputation that attaches to him Poor Edward sighed Little Dorrit with the whole family history in the sigh Yes And poor you and me too returned Fanny rather sharply Very true Then my dear we have no mother and we have a missus General And I tell you again darling that missus General if I may reverse a common proverb and adapt it to her is a cat in gloves who WILL catch mice That woman I am quite sure and confident will be our mother in law I can hardly think Fanny Fanny stopped her Now don t argue with me about it Amy said she because I know better Feeling that she had been sharp again she dabbed her sister s forehead again and blew upon it again To resume once more my dear It then becomes a question with me I am proud and spirited Amy as you very well know too much so I dare say whether I shall make up my mind to take it upon myself to carry the family through How asked her sister anxiously I will not said Fanny without answering the question submit to be mother in lawed by missus General and I will not submit to be in any respect whatever either patronised or tormented by missus Merdle Little Dorrit laid her hand upon the hand that held the bottle of sweet water with a still more anxious look Fanny quite punishing her own forehead with the vehement dabs she now began to give it fitfully went on That he has somehow or other and how is of no consequence attained a very good position no one can deny That it is a very good connection no one can deny And as to the question of clever or not clever I doubt very much whether a clever husband would be suitable to me I cannot submit I should not be able to defer to him enough O my dear Fanny expostulated Little Dorrit upon whom a kind of terror had been stealing as she perceived what her sister meant If you loved any one all this feeling would change If you loved any one you would no more be yourself but you would quite lose and forget yourself in your devotion to him If you loved him Fanny Fanny had stopped the dabbing hand and was looking at her fixedly O indeed cried Fanny Really Bless me how much some people know of some subjects They say every one has a subject and I certainly seem to have hit upon yours Amy There you little thing I was only in fun dabbing her sister s forehead but don t you be a silly puss and don t you think flightily and eloquently about degenerate impossibilities There Now I ll go back to myself Dear Fanny let me say first that I would far rather we worked for a scanty living again than I would see you rich and married to mister Sparkler Let you say my dear retorted Fanny Why of course I will let you say anything There is no constraint upon you I hope We are together to talk it over And as to marrying mister Sparkler I have not the slightest intention of doing so to night my dear or to morrow morning either But at some time At no time for anything I know at present answered Fanny with indifference Then suddenly changing her indifference into a burning restlessness she added You talk about the clever men you little thing It s all very fine and easy to talk about the clever men but where are they I don t see them anywhere near me My dear Fanny so short a time Short time or long time interrupted Fanny I am impatient of our situation I don t like our situation and very little would induce me to change it Other girls differently reared and differently circumstanced altogether might wonder at what I say or may do Let them They are driven by their lives and characters I am driven by mine Fanny my dear Fanny you know that you have qualities to make you the wife of one very superior to mister Sparkler Amy my dear Amy retorted Fanny parodying her words I know that I wish to have a more defined and distinct position in which I can assert myself with greater effect against that insolent woman Would you therefore forgive my asking Fanny therefore marry her son Why perhaps said Fanny with a triumphant smile There may be many less promising ways of arriving at an end than that MY dear That piece of insolence may think now that it would be a great success to get her son off upon me and shelve me But perhaps she little thinks how I would retort upon her if I married her son I would oppose her in everything and compete with her I would make it the business of my life Fanny set down the bottle when she came to this and walked about the room always stopping and standing still while she spoke One thing I could certainly do my child I could make her older And I would This was followed by another walk I would talk of her as an old woman I would pretend to know if I didn t but I should from her son all about her age And she should hear me say Amy affectionately quite dutifully and affectionately how well she looked considering her time of life I could make her seem older at once by being myself so much younger I may not be as handsome as she is I am not a fair judge of that question I suppose but I know I am handsome enough to be a thorn in her side And I would be My dear sister would you condemn yourself to an unhappy life for this It wouldn t be an unhappy life Amy It would be the life I am fitted for Whether by disposition or whether by circumstances is no matter I am better fitted for such a life than for almost any other There was something of a desolate tone in those words but with a short proud laugh she took another walk and after passing a great looking glass came to another stop Figure Figure Amy Well The woman has a good figure I will give her her due and not deny it But is it so far beyond all others that it is altogether unapproachable Upon my word I am not so sure of it Give some much younger woman the latitude as to dress that she has being married and we would see about that my dear Something in the thought that was agreeable and flattering brought her back to her seat in a gayer temper She took her sister s hands in hers and clapped all four hands above her head as she looked in her sister s face laughing And the dancer Amy that she has quite forgotten the dancer who bore no sort of resemblance to me and of whom I never remind her oh dear no should dance through her life and dance in her way to such a tune as would disturb her insolent placidity a little Just a little my dear Amy just a little Meeting an earnest and imploring look in Amy s face she brought the four hands down and laid only one on Amy s lips Now don t argue with me child she said in a sterner way because it is of no use I understand these subjects much better than you do I have not nearly made up my mind but it may be Now we have talked this over comfortably and may go to bed You best and dearest little mouse Good night With those words Fanny weighed her Anchor and having taken so much advice left off being advised for that occasion Thenceforward Amy observed mister Sparkler s treatment by his enslaver with new reasons for attaching importance to all that passed between them There were times when Fanny appeared quite unable to endure his mental feebleness and when she became so sharply impatient of it that she would all but dismiss him for good There were other times when she got on much better with him when he amused her and when her sense of superiority seemed to counterbalance that opposite side of the scale If mister Sparkler had been other than the faithfullest and most submissive of swains he was sufficiently hard pressed to have fled from the scene of his trials and have set at least the whole distance from Rome to London between himself and his enchantress But he had no greater will of his own than a boat has when it is towed by a steam ship and he followed his cruel mistress through rough and smooth on equally strong compulsion missus Merdle during these passages said little to Fanny but said more about her She was as it were forced to look at her through her eye glass and in general conversation to allow commendations of her beauty to be wrung from her by its irresistible demands The defiant character it assumed when Fanny heard these extollings as it generally happened that she did was not expressive of concessions to the impartial bosom but the utmost revenge the bosom took was to say audibly A spoilt beauty but with that face and shape who could wonder It might have been about a month or six weeks after the night of the new advice when Little Dorrit began to think she detected some new understanding between mister Sparkler and Fanny mister Sparkler as if in attendance to some compact scarcely ever spoke without first looking towards Fanny for leave That young lady was too discreet ever to look back again but if mister Sparkler had permission to speak she remained silent if he had not she herself spoke Moreover it became plain whenever Henry Gowan attempted to perform the friendly office of drawing him out that he was not to be drawn And not only that but Fanny would presently without any pointed application in the world chance to say something with such a sting in it that Gowan would draw back as if he had put his hand into a bee hive There was yet another circumstance which went a long way to confirm Little Dorrit in her fears though it was not a great circumstance in itself mister Sparkler s demeanour towards herself changed It became fraternal Sometimes when she was in the outer circle of assemblies at their own residence at missus Merdle s or elsewhere she would find herself stealthily supported round the waist by mister Sparkler s arm mister Sparkler never offered the slightest explanation of this attention but merely smiled with an air of blundering contented good natured proprietorship which in so heavy a gentleman was ominously expressive Little Dorrit was at home one day thinking about Fanny with a heavy heart They had a room at one end of their drawing room suite nearly all irregular bay window projecting over the street and commanding all the picturesque life and variety of the Corso both up and down At three or four o clock in the afternoon English time the view from this window was very bright and peculiar and Little Dorrit used to sit and muse here much as she had been used to while away the time in her balcony at Venice Seated thus one day she was softly touched on the shoulder and Fanny said Well Amy dear and took her seat at her side Their seat was a part of the window when there was anything in the way of a procession going on they used to have bright draperies hung out of the window and used to kneel or sit on this seat and look out at it leaning on the brilliant colour But there was no procession that day and Little Dorrit was rather surprised by Fanny s being at home at that hour as she was generally out on horseback then Well Amy said Fanny what are you thinking of little one I was thinking of you Fanny No What a coincidence I declare here s some one else You were not thinking of this some one else too were you Amy Amy HAD been thinking of this some one else too for it was mister Sparkler She did not say so however as she gave him her hand mister Sparkler came and sat down on the other side of her and she felt the fraternal railing come behind her and apparently stretch on to include Fanny Well my little sister said Fanny with a sigh I suppose you know what this means She s as beautiful as she s doated on stammered mister Sparkler and there s no nonsense about her it s arranged You needn t explain Edmund said Fanny No my love said mister Sparkler In short pet proceeded Fanny on the whole we are engaged We must tell papa about it either to night or to morrow according to the opportunities Then it s done and very little more need be said My dear Fanny said mister Sparkler with deference I should like to say a word to Amy Well well Say it for goodness sake returned the young lady I am convinced my dear Amy said mister Sparkler that if ever there was a girl next to your highly endowed and beautiful sister who had no nonsense about her We know all about that Edmund interposed Miss Fanny Never mind that Pray go on to something else besides our having no nonsense about us Yes my love said mister Sparkler And I assure you Amy that nothing can be a greater happiness to myself myself next to the happiness of being so highly honoured with the choice of a glorious girl who hasn t an atom of Pray Edmund pray interrupted Fanny with a slight pat of her pretty foot upon the floor My love you re quite right said mister Sparkler and I know I have a habit of it What I wished to declare was that nothing can be a greater happiness to myself myself next to the happiness of being united to pre eminently the most glorious of girls than to have the happiness of cultivating the affectionate acquaintance of Amy I may not myself said mister Sparkler manfully be up to the mark on some other subjects at a short notice and I am aware that if you were to poll Society the general opinion would be that I am not but on the subject of Amy I am up to the mark mister Sparkler kissed her in witness thereof A knife and fork and an apartment proceeded mister Sparkler growing in comparison with his oratorical antecedents quite diffuse will ever be at Amy s disposal My Governor I am sure will always be proud to entertain one whom I so much esteem And regarding my mother said mister Sparkler who is a remarkably fine woman with Edmund Edmund cried Miss Fanny as before With submission my soul pleaded mister Sparkler I know I have a habit of it and I thank you very much my adorable girl for taking the trouble to correct it but my mother is admitted on all sides to be a remarkably fine woman and she really hasn t any That may be or may not be returned Fanny but pray don t mention it any more I will not my love said mister Sparkler Then in fact you have nothing more to say Edmund have you inquired Fanny So far from it my adorable girl answered mister Sparkler I apologise for having said so much mister Sparkler perceived by a kind of inspiration that the question implied had he not better go He therefore withdrew the fraternal railing and neatly said that he thought he would with submission take his leave He did not go without being congratulated by Amy as well as she could discharge that office in the flutter and distress of her spirits When he was gone she said O Fanny Fanny and turned to her sister in the bright window and fell upon her bosom and cried there Fanny laughed at first but soon laid her face against her sister s and cried too a little It was the last time Fanny ever showed that there was any hidden suppressed or conquered feeling in her on the matter From that hour the way she had chosen lay before her and she trod it with her own imperious self willed step CHAPTER fifteen No just Cause or Impediment why these Two Persons should not be joined together mister Dorrit on being informed by his elder daughter that she had accepted matrimonial overtures from mister Sparkler to whom she had plighted her troth received the communication at once with great dignity and with a large display of parental pride his dignity dilating with the widened prospect of advantageous ground from which to make acquaintances and his parental pride being developed by Miss Fanny s ready sympathy with that great object of his existence He gave her to understand that her noble ambition found harmonious echoes in his heart and bestowed his blessing on her as a child brimful of duty and good principle self devoted to the aggrandisement of the family name To mister Sparkler when Miss Fanny permitted him to appear mister Dorrit said he would not disguise that the alliance mister Sparkler did him the honour to propose was highly congenial to his feelings both as being in unison with the spontaneous affections of his daughter Fanny and as opening a family connection of a gratifying nature with mister Merdle the master spirit of the age missus Merdle also as a leading lady rich in distinction elegance grace and beauty he mentioned in very laudatory terms He felt it his duty to remark he was sure a gentleman of mister Sparkler s fine sense would interpret him with all delicacy that he could not consider this proposal definitely determined on until he should have had the privilege of holding some correspondence with mister Merdle and of ascertaining it to be so far accordant with the views of that eminent gentleman as that his mister Dorrit s daughter would be received on that footing which her station in life and her dowry and expectations warranted him in requiring that she should maintain in what he trusted he might be allowed without the appearance of being mercenary to call the Eye of the Great World While saying this which his character as a gentleman of some little station and his character as a father equally demanded of him he would not be so diplomatic as to conceal that the proposal remained in hopeful abeyance and under conditional acceptance and that he thanked mister Sparkler for the compliment rendered to himself and to his family He concluded with some further and more general observations on the ha character of an independent gentleman and the hum character of a possibly too partial and admiring parent To sum the whole up shortly he received mister Sparkler s offer very much as he would have received three or four half crowns from him in the days that were gone mister Sparkler finding himself stunned by the words thus heaped upon his inoffensive head made a brief though pertinent rejoinder the same being neither more nor less than that he had long perceived Miss Fanny to have no nonsense about her and that he had no doubt of its being all right with his Governor At that point the object of his affections shut him up like a box with a spring lid and sent him away Proceeding shortly afterwards to pay his respects to the Bosom mister Dorrit was received by it with great consideration missus Merdle had heard of this affair from Edmund She had been surprised at first because she had not thought Edmund a marrying man Society had not thought Edmund a marrying man Still of course she had seen as a woman we women did instinctively see these things mister Dorrit that Edmund had been immensely captivated by Miss Dorrit and she had openly said that mister Dorrit had much to answer for in bringing so charming a girl abroad to turn the heads of his countrymen Have I the honour to conclude madam said mister Dorrit that the direction which mister Sparkler s affections have taken is ha approved of by you I assure you mister Dorrit returned the lady that personally I am charmed That was very gratifying to mister Dorrit Personally repeated missus Merdle charmed This casual repetition of the word personally moved mister Dorrit to express his hope that mister Merdle s approval too would not be wanting I cannot said missus Merdle take upon myself to answer positively for mister Merdle gentlemen especially gentlemen who are what Society calls capitalists having their own ideas of these matters But I should think merely giving an opinion mister Dorrit I should think mister Merdle would be upon the whole here she held a review of herself before adding at her leisure quite charmed At the mention of gentlemen whom Society called capitalists mister Dorrit had coughed as if some internal demur were breaking out of him missus Merdle had observed it and went on to take up the cue Though indeed mister Dorrit it is scarcely necessary for me to make that remark except in the mere openness of saying what is uppermost to one whom I so highly regard and with whom I hope I may have the pleasure of being brought into still more agreeable relations For one cannot but see the great probability of your considering such things from mister Merdle s own point of view except indeed that circumstances have made it mister Merdle s accidental fortune or misfortune to be engaged in business transactions and that they however vast may a little cramp his horizons I am a very child as to having any notion of business said missus Merdle but I am afraid mister Dorrit it may have that tendency This skilful see saw of mister Dorrit and missus Merdle so that each of them sent the other up and each of them sent the other down and neither had the advantage acted as a sedative on mister Dorrit s cough He remarked with his utmost politeness that he must beg to protest against its being supposed even by missus Merdle the accomplished and graceful to which compliment she bent herself that such enterprises as mister Merdle s apart as they were from the puny undertakings of the rest of men had any lower tendency than to enlarge and expand the genius in which they were conceived You are generosity itself said missus Merdle in return smiling her best smile let us hope so But I confess I am almost superstitious in my ideas about business mister Dorrit threw in another compliment here to the effect that business like the time which was precious in it was made for slaves and that it was not for missus Merdle who ruled all hearts at her supreme pleasure to have anything to do with it missus Merdle laughed and conveyed to mister Dorrit an idea that the Bosom flushed which was one of her best effects I say so much she then explained merely because mister Merdle has always taken the greatest interest in Edmund and has always expressed the strongest desire to advance his prospects Edmund s public position I think you know His private position rests solely with mister Merdle In my foolish incapacity for business I assure you I know no more mister Dorrit again expressed in his own way the sentiment that business was below the ken of enslavers and enchantresses He then mentioned his intention as a gentleman and a parent of writing to mister Merdle missus Merdle concurred with all her heart or with all her art which was exactly the same thing and herself despatched a preparatory letter by the next post to the eighth wonder of the world In his epistolary communication as in his dialogues and discourses on the great question to which it related mister Dorrit surrounded the subject with flourishes as writing masters embellish copy books and ciphering books where the titles of the elementary rules of arithmetic diverge into swans eagles griffins and other calligraphic recreations and where the capital letters go out of their minds and bodies into ecstasies of pen and ink Nevertheless he did render the purport of his letter sufficiently clear to enable mister Merdle to make a decent pretence of having learnt it from that source mister Merdle replied to it accordingly mister Dorrit replied to mister Merdle mister Merdle replied to mister Dorrit and it was soon announced that the corresponding powers had come to a satisfactory understanding Now and not before Miss Fanny burst upon the scene completely arrayed for her new part Now and not before she wholly absorbed mister Sparkler in her light and shone for both and twenty more No longer feeling that want of a defined place and character which had caused her so much trouble this fair ship began to steer steadily on a shaped course and to swim with a weight and balance that developed her sailing qualities The preliminaries being so satisfactorily arranged I think I will now my dear said mister Dorrit announce ha formally to missus General Papa returned Fanny taking him up short upon that name I don t see what missus General has got to do with it My dear said mister Dorrit it will be an act of courtesy to hum a lady well bred and refined Oh I am sick of missus General s good breeding and refinement papa said Fanny I am tired of missus General Tired repeated mister Dorrit in reproachful astonishment of ha missus General Quite disgusted with her papa said Fanny I really don t see what she has to do with my marriage Let her keep to her own matrimonial projects if she has any Fanny returned mister Dorrit with a grave and weighty slowness upon him contrasting strongly with his daughter s levity I beg the favour of your explaining ha what it is you mean I mean papa said Fanny that if missus General should happen to have any matrimonial projects of her own I dare say they are quite enough to occupy her spare time And that if she has not so much the better but still I don t wish to have the honour of making announcements to her Permit me to ask you Fanny said mister Dorrit why not Because she can find my engagement out for herself papa retorted Fanny She is watchful enough I dare say I think I have seen her so Let her find it out for herself If she should not find it out for herself she will know it when I am married And I hope you will not consider me wanting in affection for you papa if I say it strikes me that will be quite enough for missus General Fanny returned mister Dorrit I am amazed I am displeased by this hum this capricious and unintelligible display of animosity towards ha missus General Do not if you please papa urged Fanny call it animosity because I assure you I do not consider missus General worth my animosity At this mister Dorrit rose from his chair with a fixed look of severe reproof and remained standing in his dignity before his daughter His daughter turning the bracelet on her arm and now looking at him and now looking from him said Very well papa I am truly sorry if you don t like it but I can t help it I am not a child and I am not Amy and I must speak Fanny gasped mister Dorrit after a majestic silence if I request you to remain here while I formally announce to missus General as an exemplary lady who is hum a trusted member of this family the ha the change that is contemplated among us if I ha not only request it but hum insist upon it Oh papa Fanny broke in with pointed significance if you make so much of it as that I have in duty nothing to do but comply I hope I may have my thoughts upon the subject however for I really cannot help it under the circumstances So Fanny sat down with a meekness which in the junction of extremes became defiance and her father either not deigning to answer or not knowing what to answer summoned mister Tinkler into his presence missus General mister Tinkler unused to receive such short orders in connection with the fair varnisher paused mister Dorrit seeing the whole Marshalsea and all its testimonials in the pause instantly flew at him with How dare you sir What do you mean I beg your pardon sir pleaded mister Tinkler I was wishful to know You wished to know nothing sir cried mister Dorrit highly flushed Don t tell me you did Ha You didn t You are guilty of mockery sir I assure you sir mister Tinkler began Don t assure me said mister Dorrit I will not be assured by a domestic You are guilty of mockery You shall leave me hum the whole establishment shall leave me What are you waiting for Only for my orders sir It s false said mister Dorrit you have your orders Ha hum MY compliments to missus General and I beg the favour of her coming to me if quite convenient for a few minutes Those are your orders In his execution of this mission mister Tinkler perhaps expressed that mister Dorrit was in a raging fume However that was missus General s skirts were very speedily heard outside coming along one might almost have said bouncing along with unusual expedition Albeit they settled down at the door and swept into the room with their customary coolness missus General said mister Dorrit take a chair missus General with a graceful curve of acknowledgment descended into the chair which mister Dorrit offered Madam pursued that gentleman as you have had the kindness to undertake the hum formation of my daughters and as I am persuaded that nothing nearly affecting them can ha be indifferent to you Wholly impossible said missus General in the calmest of ways I therefore wish to announce to you madam that my daughter now present missus General made a slight inclination of her head to Fanny who made a very low inclination of her head to missus General and came loftily upright again That my daughter Fanny is ha contracted to be married to mister Sparkler with whom you are acquainted Hence madam you will be relieved of half your difficult charge ha difficult charge mister Dorrit repeated it with his angry eye on Fanny But not I hope to the hum diminution of any other portion direct or indirect of the footing you have at present the kindness to occupy in my family mister Dorrit returned missus General with her gloved hands resting on one another in exemplary repose is ever considerate and ever but too appreciative of my friendly services Miss Fanny coughed as much as to say You are right Miss Dorrit has no doubt exercised the soundest discretion of which the circumstances admitted and I trust will allow me to offer her my sincere congratulations When free from the trammels of passion missus General closed her eyes at the word as if she could not utter it and see anybody when occurring with the approbation of near relatives and when cementing the proud structure of a family edifice these are usually auspicious events I trust Miss Dorrit will allow me to offer her my best congratulations Here missus General stopped and added internally for the setting of her face Papa potatoes poultry Prunes and prism mister Dorrit she superadded aloud is ever most obliging and for the attention and I will add distinction of having this confidence imparted to me by himself and Miss Dorrit at this early time I beg to offer the tribute of my thanks My thanks and my congratulations are equally the meed of mister Dorrit and of Miss Dorrit To me observed Miss Fanny they are excessively gratifying inexpressibly so The relief of finding that you have no objection to make missus General quite takes a load off my mind I am sure I hardly know what I should have done said Fanny if you had interposed any objection missus General missus General changed her gloves as to the right glove being uppermost and the left undermost with a Prunes and Prism smile To preserve your approbation missus General said Fanny returning the smile with one in which there was no trace of those ingredients will of course be the highest object of my married life to lose it would of course be perfect wretchedness I am sure your great kindness will not object and I hope papa will not object to my correcting a small mistake you have made however The best of us are so liable to mistakes that even you missus General have fallen into a little error The attention and distinction you have so impressively mentioned missus General as attaching to this confidence are I have no doubt of the most complimentary and gratifying description but they don t at all proceed from me The merit of having consulted you on the subject would have been so great in me that I feel I must not lay claim to it when it really is not mine It is wholly papa s I am deeply obliged to you for your encouragement and patronage but it was papa who asked for it I have to thank you missus General for relieving my breast of a great weight by so handsomely giving your consent to my engagement but you have really nothing to thank me for I hope you will always approve of my proceedings after I have left home and that my sister also may long remain the favoured object of your condescension missus General With this address which was delivered in her politest manner Fanny left the room with an elegant and cheerful air to tear up stairs with a flushed face as soon as she was out of hearing pounce in upon her sister call her a little Dormouse shake her for the better opening of her eyes tell her what had passed below and ask her what she thought of Pa now Towards missus Merdle the young lady comported herself with great independence and self possession but not as yet with any more decided opening of hostilities Occasionally they had a slight skirmish as when Fanny considered herself patted on the back by that lady or as when missus Merdle looked particularly young and well but missus Merdle always soon terminated those passages of arms by sinking among her cushions with the gracefullest indifference and finding her attention otherwise engaged Society for that mysterious creature sat upon the Seven Hills too found Miss Fanny vastly improved by her engagement She was much more accessible much more free and engaging much less exacting insomuch that she now entertained a host of followers and admirers to the bitter indignation of ladies with daughters to marry who were to be regarded as Having revolted from Society on the Miss Dorrit grievance and erected a rebellious standard Enjoying the flutter she caused Miss Dorrit not only haughtily moved through it in her own proper person but haughtily even Ostentatiously led mister Sparkler through it too seeming to say to them all If I think proper to march among you in triumphal procession attended by this weak captive in bonds rather than a stronger one that is my business Enough that I choose to do it mister Sparkler for his part questioned nothing but went wherever he was taken did whatever he was told felt that for his bride elect to be distinguished was for him to be distinguished on the easiest terms and was truly grateful for being so openly acknowledged The winter passing on towards the spring while this condition of affairs prevailed it became necessary for mister Sparkler to repair to England and take his appointed part in the expression and direction of its genius learning commerce spirit and sense The land of Shakespeare Milton Bacon Newton Watt the land of a host of past and present abstract philosophers natural philosophers and subduers of Nature and Art in their myriad forms called to mister Sparkler to come and take care of it lest it should perish mister Sparkler unable to resist the agonised cry from the depths of his country s soul declared that he must go It followed that the question was rendered pressing when where and how mister Sparkler should be married to the foremost girl in all this world with no nonsense about her Its solution after some little mystery and secrecy Miss Fanny herself announced to her sister Now my child said she seeking her out one day I am going to tell you something It is only this moment broached and naturally I hurry to you the moment it IS broached Your marriage Fanny My precious child said Fanny don t anticipate me Let me impart my confidence to you you flurried little thing in my own way As to your guess if I answered it literally I should answer no For really it is not my marriage that is in question half as much as it is Edmund s Little Dorrit looked and perhaps not altogether without cause somewhat at a loss to understand this fine distinction I am in no difficulty exclaimed Fanny and in no hurry I am not wanted at any public office or to give any vote anywhere else But Edmund is And Edmund is deeply dejected at the idea of going away by himself and indeed I don t like that he should be trusted by himself For if it s possible and it generally is to do a foolish thing he is sure to do it As she concluded this impartial summary of the reliance that might be safely placed upon her future husband she took off with an air of business the bonnet she wore and dangled it by its strings upon the ground It is far more Edmund s question therefore than mine However we need say no more about that That is self evident on the face of it Well my dearest Amy The point arising is he to go by himself or is he not to go by himself this other point arises are we to be married here and shortly or are we to be married at home months hence I see I am going to lose you Fanny What a little thing you are cried Fanny half tolerant and half impatient for anticipating one Pray my darling hear me out That woman she spoke of missus Merdle of course remains here until after Easter so in the case of my being married here and going to London with Edmund I should have the start of her That is something Further Amy That woman being out of the way I don t know that I greatly object to mister Merdle s proposal to Pa that Edmund and I should take up our abode in that house you know where you once went with a dancer my dear until our own house can be chosen and fitted up Further still Amy Papa having always intended to go to town himself in the spring you see if Edmund and I were married here we might go off to Florence where papa might join us and we might all three travel home together mister Merdle has entreated Pa to stay with him in that same mansion I have mentioned and I suppose he will But he is master of his own actions and upon that point which is not at all material I can t speak positively The difference between papa s being master of his own actions and mister Sparkler s being nothing of the sort was forcibly expressed by Fanny in her manner of stating the case Not that her sister noticed it for she was divided between regret at the coming separation and a lingering wish that she had been included in the plans for visiting England And these are the arrangements Fanny dear Arrangements repeated Fanny Now really child you are a little trying You know I particularly guarded myself against laying my words open to any such construction What I said was that certain questions present themselves and these are the questions Little Dorrit s thoughtful eyes met hers tenderly and quietly Now my own sweet girl said Fanny weighing her bonnet by the strings with considerable impatience it s no use staring A little owl could stare I look to you for advice Amy What do you advise me to do Do you think asked Little Dorrit persuasively after a short hesitation do you think Fanny that if you were to put it off for a few months it might be considering all things best No little Tortoise retorted Fanny with exceeding sharpness I don t think anything of the kind Here she threw her bonnet from her altogether and flounced into a chair But becoming affectionate almost immediately she flounced out of it again and kneeled down on the floor to take her sister chair and all in her arms Don t suppose I am hasty or unkind darling because I really am not But you are such a little oddity You make one bite your head off when one wants to be soothing beyond everything Didn t I tell you you dearest baby that Edmund can t be trusted by himself And don t you know that he can t Yes yes Fanny You said so I know And you know it I know retorted Fanny Well my precious child If he is not to be trusted by himself it follows I suppose that I should go with him It seems so love said Little Dorrit Therefore having heard the arrangements that are feasible to carry out that object am I to understand dearest Amy that on the whole you advise me to make them It seems so love said Little Dorrit again Very well cried Fanny with an air of resignation then I suppose it must be done I came to you my sweet the moment I saw the doubt and the necessity of deciding I have now decided So let it be After yielding herself up in this pattern manner to sisterly advice and the force of circumstances Fanny became quite benignant as one who had laid her own inclinations at the feet of her dearest friend and felt a glow of conscience in having made the sacrifice After all my Amy she said to her sister you are the best of small creatures and full of good sense and I don t know what I shall ever do without you With which words she folded her in a closer embrace and a really fond one Not that I contemplate doing without You Amy by any means for I hope we shall ever be next to inseparable And now my pet I am going to give you a word of advice When you are left alone here with missus General I am to be left alone here with missus General said Little Dorrit quietly Why of course my precious till papa comes back Unless you call Edward company which he certainly is not even when he is here and still more certainly is not when he is away at Naples or in Sicily I was going to say but you are such a beloved little Marplot for putting one out when you are left alone here with missus General Amy don t you let her slide into any sort of artful understanding with you that she is looking after Pa or that Pa is looking after her She will if she can I know her sly manner of feeling her way with those gloves of hers But don t you comprehend her on any account And if Pa should tell you when he comes back that he has it in contemplation to make missus General your mama which is not the less likely because I am going away my advice to you is that you say at once Papa I beg to object most strongly Fanny cautioned me about this and she objected and I object I don t mean to say that any objection from you Amy is likely to be of the smallest effect or that I think you likely to make it with any degree of firmness But there is a principle involved a filial principle and I implore you not to submit to be mother in lawed by missus General without asserting it in making every one about you as uncomfortable as possible I don t expect you to stand by it indeed I know you won t Pa being concerned but I wish to rouse you to a sense of duty As to any help from me or as to any opposition that I can offer to such a match you shall not be left in the lurch my love Whatever weight I may derive from my position as a married girl not wholly devoid of attractions used as that position always shall be to oppose that woman I will bring to bear you May depend upon it on the head and false hair for I am confident it s not all real ugly as it is and unlikely as it appears that any One in their Senses would go to the expense of buying it of missus General Little Dorrit received this counsel without venturing to oppose it but without giving Fanny any reason to believe that she intended to act upon it Having now as it were formally wound up her single life and arranged her worldly affairs Fanny proceeded with characteristic ardour to prepare for the serious change in her condition The preparation consisted in the despatch of her maid to Paris under the protection of the Courier for the purchase of that outfit for a bride on which it would be extremely low in the present narrative to bestow an English name but to which on a vulgar principle it observes of adhering to the language in which it professes to be written it declines to give a French one The rich and beautiful wardrobe purchased by these agents in the course of a few weeks made its way through the intervening country bristling with custom houses garrisoned by an immense army of shabby mendicants in uniform who incessantly repeated the Beggar s Petition over it as if every individual warrior among them were the ancient Belisarius and of whom there were so many Legions that unless the Courier had expended just one bushel and a half of silver money relieving their distresses they would have worn the wardrobe out before it got to Rome by turning it over and over Through all such dangers however it was triumphantly brought inch by inch and arrived at its journey s end in fine condition There it was exhibited to select companies of female viewers in whose gentle bosoms it awakened implacable feelings Concurrently active preparations were made for the day on which some of its treasures were to be publicly displayed Cards of breakfast invitation were sent out to half the English in the city of Romulus the other half made arrangements to be under arms as criticising volunteers at various outer points of the solemnity The most high and illustrious English Signor Edgardo Dorrit came post through the deep mud and ruts from forming a surface under the improving Neapolitan nobility to grace the occasion The best hotel and all its culinary myrmidons were set to work to prepare the feast The drafts of mister Dorrit almost constituted a run on the Torlonia Bank The British Consul hadn t had such a marriage in the whole of his Consularity The day came and the She Wolf in the Capitol might have snarled with envy to see how the Island Savages contrived these things now a days The murderous headed statues of the wicked Emperors of the Soldiery whom sculptors had not been able to flatter out of their villainous hideousness might have come off their pedestals to run away with the Bride The choked old fountain where erst the gladiators washed might have leaped into life again to honour the ceremony The Temple of Vesta might have sprung up anew from its ruins expressly to lend its countenance to the occasion Might have done but did not Like sentient things even like the lords and ladies of creation sometimes might have done much but did nothing The celebration went off with admirable pomp monks in black robes white robes and russet robes stopped to look after the carriages wandering peasants in fleeces of sheep begged and piped under the house windows the English volunteers defiled the day wore on to the hour of vespers the festival wore away the thousand churches rang their bells without any reference to it and saint Peter denied that he had anything to do with it But by that time the Bride was near the end of the first day s journey towards Florence It was the peculiarity of the nuptials that they were all Bride Nobody noticed the Bridegroom Nobody noticed the first Bridesmaid Few could have seen Little Dorrit who held that post for the glare even supposing many to have sought her So the Bride had mounted into her handsome chariot incidentally accompanied by the Bridegroom and after rolling for a few minutes smoothly over a fair pavement had begun to jolt through a Slough of Despond and through a long long avenue of wrack and ruin Other nuptial carriages are said to have gone the same road before and since If Little Dorrit found herself left a little lonely and a little low that night nothing would have done so much against her feeling of depression as the being able to sit at work by her father as in the old time and help him to his supper and his rest But that was not to be thought of now when they sat in the state equipage with missus General on the coach box And as to supper If mister Dorrit had wanted supper there was an Italian cook and there was a Swiss confectioner who must have put on caps as high as the Pope s Mitre and have performed the mysteries of Alchemists in a copper saucepaned laboratory below before he could have got it He was sententious and didactic that night If he had been simply loving he would have done Little Dorrit more good but she accepted him as he was when had she not accepted him as he was and made the most and best of him missus General at length retired Her retirement for the night was always her frostiest ceremony as if she felt it necessary that the human imagination should be chilled into stone to prevent its following her When she had gone through her rigid preliminaries amounting to a sort of genteel platoon exercise she withdrew Little Dorrit then put her arm round her father s neck to bid him good night Amy my dear said mister Dorrit taking her by the hand this is the close of a day that has ha greatly impressed and gratified me A little tired you dear too No said mister Dorrit no I am not sensible of fatigue when it arises from an occasion so hum replete with gratification of the purest kind Little Dorrit was glad to find him in such heart and smiled from her own heart My dear he continued this is an occasion ha teeming with a good example With a good example my favourite and attached child hum to you Little Dorrit fluttered by his words did not know what to say though he stopped as if he expected her to say something Amy he resumed your dear sister our Fanny has contracted ha hum a marriage eminently calculated to extend the basis of our ha connection and to hum consolidate our social relations My love I trust that the time is not far distant when some ha eligible partner may be found for you Oh no Let me stay with you I beg and pray that I may stay with you I want nothing but to stay and take care of you She said it like one in sudden alarm Nay Amy Amy said mister Dorrit This is weak and foolish weak and foolish You have a ha responsibility imposed upon you by your position It is to develop that position and be hum worthy of that position As to taking care of me I can ha take care of myself Or he added after a moment if I should need to be taken care of I hum can with the ha blessing of Providence be taken care of I ha hum I cannot my dear child think of engrossing and ha as it were sacrificing you O what a time of day at which to begin that profession of self denial at which to make it with an air of taking credit for it at which to believe it if such a thing could be Don t speak Amy I positively say I cannot do it I ha must not do it My hum conscience would not allow it I therefore my love take the opportunity afforded by this gratifying and impressive occasion of ha solemnly remarking that it is now a cherished wish and purpose of mine to see you ha eligibly I repeat eligibly married Oh no dear Pray Amy said mister Dorrit I am well persuaded that if the topic were referred to any person of superior social knowledge of superior delicacy and sense let us say for instance to ha missus General that there would not be two opinions as to the hum affectionate character and propriety of my sentiments But as I know your loving and dutiful nature from hum from experience I am quite satisfied that it is necessary to say no more I have hum no husband to propose at present my dear I have not even one in view I merely wish that we should ha understand each other Hum Good night my dear and sole remaining daughter Good night God bless you If the thought ever entered Little Dorrit s head that night that he could give her up lightly now in his prosperity and when he had it in his mind to replace her with a second wife she drove it away Faithful to him still as in the worst times through which she had borne him single handed she drove the thought away and entertained no harder reflection in her tearful unrest than that he now saw everything through their wealth and through the care he always had upon him that they should continue rich and grow richer They sat in their equipage of state with missus General on the box for three weeks longer and then he started for Florence to join Fanny Little Dorrit would have been glad to bear him company so far only for the sake of her own love and then to have turned back alone thinking of dear England But though the Courier had gone on with the Bride the Valet was next in the line and the succession would not have come to her as long as any one could be got for money missus General took life easily as easily that is as she could take anything when the Roman establishment remained in their sole occupation and Little Dorrit would often ride out in a hired carriage that was left them and alight alone and wander among the ruins of old Rome The ruins of the vast old Amphitheatre of the old Temples of the old commemorative Arches of the old trodden highways of the old tombs besides being what they were to her were ruins of the old Marshalsea ruins of her own old life ruins of the faces and forms that of old peopled it ruins of its loves hopes cares and joys Two ruined spheres of action and suffering were before the solitary girl often sitting on some broken fragment and in the lonely places under the blue sky she saw them both together Up then would come missus General taking all the colour out of everything as Nature and Art had taken it out of herself writing Prunes and Prism in mister Eustace s text wherever she could lay a hand looking everywhere for mister Eustace and company and seeing nothing else scratching up the driest little bones of antiquity and bolting them whole without any human visitings like a Ghoule in gloves CHAPTER sixteen Getting on The newly married pair on their arrival in Harley Street Cavendish Square London were received by the Chief Butler That great man was not interested in them but on the whole endured them People must continue to be married and given in marriage or Chief Butlers would not be wanted As nations are made to be taxed so families are made to be butlered The Chief Butler no doubt reflected that the course of nature required the wealthy population to be kept up on his account He therefore condescended to look at the carriage from the Hall door without frowning at it and said in a very handsome way to one of his men Thomas help with the luggage He even escorted the Bride up stairs into mister Merdle s presence but this must be considered as an act of homage to the sex of which he was an admirer being notoriously captivated by the charms of a certain Duchess and not as a committal of himself with the family mister Merdle was slinking about the hearthrug waiting to welcome missus Sparkler His hand seemed to retreat up his sleeve as he advanced to do so and he gave her such a superfluity of coat cuff that it was like being received by the popular conception of Guy Fawkes When he put his lips to hers besides he took himself into custody by the wrists and backed himself among the ottomans and chairs and tables as if he were his own Police officer saying to himself Now none of that Come I ve got you you know and you go quietly along with me missus Sparkler installed in the rooms of state the innermost sanctuary of down silk chintz and fine linen felt that so far her triumph was good and her way made step by step On the day before her marriage she had bestowed on missus Merdle s maid with an air of gracious indifference in missus Merdle s presence a trifling little keepsake bracelet bonnet and two dresses all new about four times as valuable as the present formerly made by missus Merdle to her She was now established in missus Merdle s own rooms to which some extra touches had been given to render them more worthy of her occupation In her mind s eye as she lounged there surrounded by every luxurious accessory that wealth could obtain or invention devise she saw the fair bosom that beat in unison with the exultation of her thoughts competing with the bosom that had been famous so long outshining it and deposing it Happy Fanny must have been happy No more wishing one s self dead now The Courier had not approved of mister Dorrit s staying in the house of a friend and had preferred to take him to an hotel in Brook Street Grosvenor Square mister Merdle ordered his carriage to be ready early in the morning that he might wait upon mister Dorrit immediately after breakfast Bright the carriage looked sleek the horses looked gleaming the harness looked luscious and lasting the liveries looked A rich responsible turn out An equipage for a Merdle Early people looked after it as it rattled along the streets and said with awe in their breath There he goes There he went until Brook Street stopped him Then forth from its magnificent case came the jewel not lustrous in itself but quite the contrary Commotion in the office of the hotel Merdle The landlord though a gentleman of a haughty spirit who had just driven a pair of thorough bred horses into town turned out to show him up stairs The clerks and servants cut him off by back passages and were found accidentally hovering in doorways and angles that they might look upon him Merdle O ye sun moon and stars the great man The rich man who had in a manner revised the New Testament and already entered into the kingdom of Heaven The man who could have any one he chose to dine with him and who had made the money As he went up the stairs people were already posted on the lower stairs that his shadow might fall upon them when he came down So were the sick brought out and laid in the track of the Apostle who had NOT got into the good society and had NOT made the money mister Dorrit dressing gowned and newspapered was at his breakfast The Courier with agitation in his voice announced Miss Mairdale mister Dorrit s overwrought heart bounded as he leaped up mister Merdle this is ha indeed an honour Permit me to express the hum sense the high sense I entertain of this ha hum highly gratifying act of attention I am well aware sir of the many demands upon your time and its ha enormous value mister Dorrit could not say enormous roundly enough for his own satisfaction That you should ha at this early hour bestow any of your priceless time upon me is ha a compliment that I acknowledge with the greatest esteem mister Dorrit positively trembled in addressing the great man mister Merdle uttered in his subdued inward hesitating voice a few sounds that were to no purpose whatever and finally said I am glad to see you sir You are very kind said mister Dorrit Truly kind By this time the visitor was seated and was passing his great hand over his exhausted forehead You are well I hope mister Merdle I am as well as I yes I am as well as I usually am said mister Merdle Your occupations must be immense Tolerably so But Oh dear no there s not much the matter with me said mister Merdle looking round the room A little dyspeptic mister Dorrit hinted Very likely But I Oh I am well enough said mister Merdle There were black traces on his lips where they met as if a little train of gunpowder had been fired there and he looked like a man who if his natural temperament had been quicker would have been very feverish that morning This and his heavy way of passing his hand over his forehead had prompted mister Dorrit s solicitous inquiries missus Merdle mister Dorrit insinuatingly pursued I left as you will be prepared to hear the ha observed of all observers the hum admired of all admirers the leading fascination and charm of Society in Rome She was looking wonderfully well when I quitted it missus Merdle said mister Merdle is generally considered a very attractive woman And she is no doubt I am sensible of her being SO Who can be otherwise responded mister Dorrit mister Merdle turned his tongue in his closed mouth it seemed rather a stiff and unmanageable tongue moistened his lips passed his hand over his forehead again and looked all round the room again principally under the chairs But he said looking mister Dorrit in the face for the first time and immediately afterwards dropping his eyes to the buttons of mister Dorrit s waistcoat if we speak of attractions your daughter ought to be the subject of our conversation She is extremely beautiful Both in face and figure she is quite uncommon When the young people arrived last night I was really surprised to see such charms mister Dorrit s gratification was such that he said ha he could not refrain from telling mister Merdle verbally as he had already done by letter what honour and happiness he felt in this union of their families And he offered his hand mister Merdle looked at the hand for a little while took it on his for a moment as if his were a yellow salver or fish slice and then returned it to mister Dorrit I thought I would drive round the first thing said mister Merdle to offer my services in case I can do anything for you and to say that I hope you will at least do me the honour of dining with me to day and every day when you are not better engaged during your stay in town mister Dorrit was enraptured by these attentions Do you stay long sir I have not at present the intention said mister Dorrit of ha exceeding a fortnight That s a very short stay after so long a journey returned mister Merdle Hum Yes said mister Dorrit But the truth is ha my dear mister Merdle that I find a foreign life so well suited to my health and taste that I hum have but two objects in my present visit to London First the ha the distinguished happiness and ha privilege which I now enjoy and appreciate secondly the arrangement hum the laying out that is to say in the best way of ha hum my money Well sir said mister Merdle after turning his tongue again if I can be of any use to you in that respect you may command me mister Dorrit s speech had had more hesitation in it than usual as he approached the ticklish topic for he was not perfectly clear how so exalted a potentate might take it He had doubts whether reference to any individual capital or fortune might not seem a wretchedly retail affair to so wholesale a dealer Greatly relieved by mister Merdle s affable offer of assistance he caught at it directly and heaped acknowledgments upon him I scarcely ha dared said mister Dorrit I assure you to hope for so hum vast an advantage as your direct advice and assistance Though of course I should under any circumstances like the ha hum rest of the civilised world have followed in mister Merdle s train You know we may almost say we are related sir said mister Merdle curiously interested in the pattern of the carpet and therefore you may consider me at your service Ha Very handsome indeed cried mister Dorrit Ha Most handsome It would not said mister Merdle be at the present moment easy for what I may call a mere outsider to come into any of the good things of course I speak of my own good things Of course of course cried mister Dorrit in a tone implying that there were no other good things Unless at a high price At what we are accustomed to term a very long figure mister Dorrit laughed in the buoyancy of his spirit Ha ha ha Long figure Good Ha Very expressive to be sure However said mister Merdle I do generally retain in my own hands the power of exercising some preference people in general would be pleased to call it favour as a sort of compliment for my care and trouble And public spirit and genius mister Dorrit suggested mister Merdle with a dry swallowing action seemed to dispose of those qualities like a bolus then added As a sort of return for it I will see if you please how I can exert this limited power for people are jealous and it is limited to your advantage You are very good replied mister Dorrit You are very good Of course said mister Merdle there must be the strictest integrity and uprightness in these transactions there must be the purest faith between man and man there must be unimpeached and unimpeachable confidence or business could not be carried on mister Dorrit hailed these generous sentiments with fervour Therefore said mister Merdle I can only give you a preference to a certain extent I perceive To a defined extent observed mister Dorrit Defined extent And perfectly above board As to my advice however said mister Merdle that is another matter That such as it is Oh Such as it was mister Dorrit could not bear the faintest appearance of its being depreciated even by mister Merdle himself That there is nothing in the bonds of spotless honour between myself and my fellow man to prevent my parting with if I choose And that said mister Merdle now deeply intent upon a dust cart that was passing the windows shall be at your command whenever you think proper New acknowledgments from mister Dorrit New passages of mister Merdle s hand over his forehead Calm and silence Contemplation of mister Dorrit s waistcoat buttons by mister Merdle My time being rather precious said mister Merdle suddenly getting up as if he had been waiting in the interval for his legs and they had just come I must be moving towards the City Can I take you anywhere sir I shall be happy to set you down or send you on My carriage is at your disposal mister Dorrit bethought himself that he had business at his banker s His banker s was in the City That was fortunate mister Merdle would take him into the City But surely he might not detain mister Merdle while he assumed his coat Yes he might and must mister Merdle insisted on it So mister Dorrit retiring into the next room put himself under the hands of his valet and in five minutes came back glorious Then said mister Merdle Allow me sir Take my arm Then leaning on mister Merdle s arm did mister Dorrit descend the staircase seeing the worshippers on the steps and feeling that the light of mister Merdle shone by reflection in himself Then the carriage and the ride into the City and the people who looked at them and the hats that flew off grey heads and the general bowing and crouching before this wonderful mortal the like of which prostration of spirit was not to be seen no by high Heaven no It may be worth thinking of by Fawners of all denominations in Westminster Abbey and Saint Paul s Cathedral put together on any Sunday in the year It was a rapturous dream to mister Dorrit to find himself set aloft in this public car of triumph making a magnificent progress to that befitting destination the golden Street of the Lombards There mister Merdle insisted on alighting and going his way a foot and leaving his poor equipage at mister Dorrit s disposition So the dream increased in rapture when mister Dorrit came out of the bank alone and people looked at him in default of mister Merdle and when with the ears of his mind he heard the frequent exclamation as he rolled glibly along A wonderful man to be mister Merdle s friend At dinner that day although the occasion was not foreseen and provided for a brilliant company of such as are not made of the dust of the earth but of some superior article for the present unknown shed their lustrous benediction upon mister Dorrit s daughter s marriage And mister Dorrit s daughter that day began in earnest her competition with that woman not present and began it so well that mister Dorrit could all but have taken his affidavit if required that missus Sparkler had all her life been lying at full length in the lap of luxury and had never heard of such a rough word in the English tongue as Marshalsea Next day and the day after and every day all graced by more dinner company cards descended on mister Dorrit like theatrical snow As the friend and relative by marriage of the illustrious Merdle Bar Bishop Treasury Chorus Everybody wanted to make or improve mister Dorrit s acquaintance In mister Merdle s heap of offices in the City when mister Dorrit appeared at any of them on his business taking him Eastward which it frequently did for it throve amazingly the name of Dorrit was always a passport to the great presence of Merdle So the dream increased in rapture every hour as mister Dorrit felt increasingly sensible that this connection had brought him forward indeed Only one thing sat otherwise than auriferously and at the same time lightly on mister Dorrit s mind It was the Chief Butler That stupendous character looked at him in the course of his official looking at the dinners in a manner that mister Dorrit considered questionable He looked at him as he passed through the hall and up the staircase going to dinner with a glazed fixedness that mister Dorrit did not like Seated at table in the act of drinking mister Dorrit still saw him through his wine glass regarding him with a cold and ghostly eye It misgave him that the Chief Butler must have known a Collegian and must have seen him in the College perhaps had been presented to him He looked as closely at the Chief Butler as such a man could be looked at and yet he did not recall that he had ever seen him elsewhere Ultimately he was inclined to think that there was no reverence in the man no sentiment in the great creature But he was not relieved by that for let him think what he would the Chief Butler had him in his supercilious eye even when that eye was on the plate and other table garniture and he never let him out of it To hint to him that this confinement in his eye was disagreeable or to ask him what he meant was an act too daring to venture upon his severity with his employers and their visitors being terrific and he never permitting himself to be approached with the slightest liberty CHAPTER seventeen Missing The term of mister Dorrit s visit was within two days of being out and he was about to dress for another inspection by the Chief Butler whose victims were always dressed expressly for him when one of the servants of the hotel presented himself bearing a card mister Dorrit taking it read missus Finching The servant waited in speechless deference Man man said mister Dorrit turning upon him with grievous indignation explain your motive in bringing me this ridiculous name I am wholly unacquainted with it Finching sir said mister Dorrit perhaps avenging himself on the Chief Butler by Substitute Ha What do you mean by Finching The man man seemed to mean Flinching as much as anything else for he backed away from mister Dorrit s severe regard as he replied A lady sir I know no such lady sir said mister Dorrit Take this card away I know no Finching of either sex Ask your pardon sir The lady said she was aware she might be unknown by name But she begged me to say sir that she had formerly the honour of being acquainted with Miss Dorrit The lady said sir the youngest Miss Dorrit mister Dorrit knitted his brows and rejoined after a moment or two Inform missus Finching sir emphasising the name as if the innocent man were solely responsible for it that she can come up He had reflected in his momentary pause that unless she were admitted she might leave some message or might say something below having a disgraceful reference to that former state of existence Hence the concession and hence the appearance of Flora piloted in by the man man I have not the pleasure said mister Dorrit standing with the card in his hand and with an air which imported that it would scarcely have been a first class pleasure if he had had it of knowing either this name or yourself madam Place a chair sir The responsible man with a start obeyed and went out on tiptoe Flora putting aside her veil with a bashful tremor upon her proceeded to introduce herself At the same time a singular combination of perfumes was diffused through the room as if some brandy had been put by mistake in a lavender water bottle or as if some lavender water had been put by mistake in a brandy bottle I beg mister Dorrit to offer a thousand apologies and indeed they would be far too few for such an intrusion which I know must appear extremely bold in a lady and alone too but I thought it best upon the whole however difficult and even apparently improper though mister F s Aunt would have willingly accompanied me and as a character of great force and spirit would probably have struck one possessed of such a knowledge of life as no doubt with so many changes must have been acquired for mister F himself said frequently that although well educated in the neighbourhood of Blackheath at as high as eighty guineas which is a good deal for parents and the plate kept back too on going away but that is more a meanness than its value that he had learnt more in his first years as a commercial traveller with a large commission on the sale of an article that nobody would hear of much less buy which preceded the wine trade a long time than in the whole six years in that academy conducted by a college Bachelor though why a Bachelor more clever than a married man I do not see and never did but pray excuse me that is not the point mister Dorrit stood rooted to the carpet a statue of mystification I must openly admit that I have no pretensions said Flora but having known the dear little thing which under altered circumstances appears a liberty but is not so intended and Goodness knows there was no favour in half a crown a day to such a needle as herself but quite the other way and as to anything lowering in it far from it the labourer is worthy of his hire and I am sure I only wish he got it oftener and more animal food and less rheumatism in the back and legs poor soul Madam said mister Dorrit recovering his breath by a great effort as the relict of the late mister Finching stopped to take hers madam said mister Dorrit very red in the face if I understand you to refer to ha to anything in the antecedents of hum a daughter of mine involving ha hum daily compensation madam I beg to observe that the ha fact assuming it ha to be fact never was within my knowledge Hum I should not have permitted it Ha Never Never Unnecessary to pursue the subject returned Flora and would not have mentioned it on any account except as supposing it a favourable and only letter of introduction but as to being fact no doubt whatever and you may set your mind at rest for the very dress I have on now can prove it and sweetly made though there is no denying that it would tell better on a better figure for my own is much too fat though how to bring it down I know not pray excuse me I am roving off again mister Dorrit backed to his chair in a stony way and seated himself as Flora gave him a softening look and played with her parasol The dear little thing said Flora having gone off perfectly limp and white and cold in my own house or at least papa s for though not a freehold still a long lease at a peppercorn on the morning when Arthur foolish habit of our youthful days and mister Clennam far more adapted to existing circumstances particularly addressing a stranger and that stranger a gentleman in an elevated station communicated the glad tidings imparted by a person of name of Pancks emboldens me At the mention of these two names mister Dorrit frowned stared frowned again hesitated with his fingers at his lips as he had hesitated long ago and said Do me the favour to ha state your pleasure madam mister Dorrit said Flora you are very kind in giving me permission and highly natural it seems to me that you should be kind for though more stately I perceive a likeness filled out of course but a likeness still the object of my intruding is my own without the slightest consultation with any human being and most decidedly not with Arthur pray excuse me Doyce and Clennam I don t know what I am saying mister Clennam solus for to put that individual linked by a golden chain to a purple time when all was ethereal out of any anxiety would be worth to me the ransom of a monarch not that I have the least idea how much that would come to but using it as the total of all I have in the world and more mister Dorrit without greatly regarding the earnestness of these latter words repeated State your pleasure madam It s not likely I well know said Flora but it s possible and being possible when I had the gratification of reading in the papers that you had arrived from Italy and were going back I made up my mind to try it for you might come across him or hear something of him and if so what a blessing and relief to all Allow me to ask madam said mister Dorrit with his ideas in wild confusion to whom ha To whom he repeated it with a raised voice in mere desperation you at present allude To the foreigner from Italy who disappeared in the City as no doubt you have read in the papers equally with myself said Flora not referring to private sources by the name of Pancks from which one gathers what dreadfully ill natured things some people are wicked enough to whisper most likely judging others by themselves and what the uneasiness and indignation of Arthur quite unable to overcome it Doyce and Clennam cannot fail to be It happened fortunately for the elucidation of any intelligible result that mister Dorrit had heard or read nothing about the matter This caused missus Finching with many apologies for being in great practical difficulties as to finding the way to her pocket among the stripes of her dress at length to produce a police handbill setting forth that a foreign gentleman of the name of Blandois last from Venice had unaccountably disappeared on such a night in such a part of the city of London that he was known to have entered such a house at such an hour that he was stated by the inmates of that house to have left it about so many minutes before midnight and that he had never been beheld since This with exact particulars of time and locality and with a good detailed description of the foreign gentleman who had so mysteriously vanished mister Dorrit read at large Blandois said mister Dorrit Venice And this description I know this gentleman He has been in my house He is intimately acquainted with a gentleman of good family but in indifferent circumstances of whom I am a hum patron Then my humble and pressing entreaty is the more said Flora that in travelling back you will have the kindness to look for this foreign gentleman along all the roads and up and down all the turnings and to make inquiries for him at all the hotels and orange trees and vineyards and volcanoes and places for he must be somewhere and why doesn t he come forward and say he s there and clear all parties up Pray madam said mister Dorrit referring to the handbill again who is Clennam and company Ha I see the name mentioned here in connection with the occupation of the house which Monsieur Blandois was seen to enter who is Clennam and company Is it the individual of whom I had formerly hum some ha slight transitory knowledge and to whom I believe you have referred Is it ha that person It s a very different person indeed replied Flora with no limbs and wheels instead and the grimmest of women though his mother Clennam and company a hum a mother exclaimed mister Dorrit And an old man besides said Flora mister Dorrit looked as if he must immediately be driven out of his mind by this account Neither was it rendered more favourable to sanity by Flora s dashing into a rapid analysis of mister Flintwinch s cravat and describing him without the lightest boundary line of separation between his identity and missus Clennam s as a rusty screw in gaiters Which compound of man and woman no limbs wheels rusty screw grimness and gaiters so completely stupefied mister Dorrit that he was a spectacle to be pitied But I would not detain you one moment longer said Flora upon whom his condition wrought its effect though she was quite unconscious of having produced it if you would have the goodness to give your promise as a gentleman that both in going back to Italy and in Italy too you would look for this mister Blandois high and low and if you found or heard of him make him come forward for the clearing of all parties By that time mister Dorrit had so far recovered from his bewilderment as to be able to say in a tolerably connected manner that he should consider that his duty Flora was delighted with her success and rose to take her leave With a million thanks said she and my address upon my card in case of anything to be communicated personally I will not send my love to the dear little thing for it might not be acceptable and indeed there is no dear little thing left in the transformation so why do it but both myself and mister F s Aunt ever wish her well and lay no claim to any favour on our side you may be sure of that but quite the other way for what she undertook to do she did and that is more than a great many of us do not to say anything of her doing it as Well as it could be done and I myself am one of them for I have said ever since I began to recover the blow of mister F s death that I would learn the Organ of which I am extremely fond but of which I am ashamed to say I do not yet know a note good evening When mister Dorrit who attended her to the room door had had a little time to collect his senses he found that the interview had summoned back discarded reminiscences which jarred with the Merdle dinner table He wrote and sent off a brief note excusing himself for that day and ordered dinner presently in his own rooms at the hotel He had another reason for this His time in London was very nearly out and was anticipated by engagements his plans were made for returning and he thought it behoved his importance to pursue some direct inquiry into the Blandois disappearance and be in a condition to carry back to mister Henry Gowan the result of his own personal investigation He therefore resolved that he would take advantage of that evening s freedom to go down to Clennam and company s easily to be found by the direction set forth in the handbill and see the place and ask a question or two there himself Having dined as plainly as the establishment and the Courier would let him and having taken a short sleep by the fire for his better recovery from missus Finching he set out in a hackney cabriolet alone The deep bell of saint Paul s was striking nine as he passed under the shadow of Temple Bar headless and forlorn in these degenerate days As he approached his destination through the by streets and water side ways that part of London seemed to him an uglier spot at such an hour than he had ever supposed it to be Many long years had passed since he had seen it he had never known much of it and it wore a mysterious and dismal aspect in his eyes So powerfully was his imagination impressed by it that when his driver stopped after having asked the way more than once and said to the best of his belief this was the gateway they wanted mister Dorrit stood hesitating with the coach door in his hand half afraid of the dark look of the place Truly it looked as gloomy that night as even it had ever looked Two of the handbills were posted on the entrance wall one on either side and as the lamp flickered in the night air shadows passed over them not unlike the shadows of fingers following the lines A watch was evidently kept upon the place As mister Dorrit paused a man passed in from over the way and another man passed out from some dark corner within and both looked at him in passing and both remained standing about As there was only one house in the enclosure there was no room for uncertainty so he went up the steps of that house and knocked There was a dim light in two windows on the first floor The door gave back a dreary vacant sound as though the house were empty but it was not for a light was visible and a step was audible almost directly They both came to the door and a chain grated and a woman with her apron thrown over her face and head stood in the aperture Who is it said the woman mister Dorrit much amazed by this appearance replied that he was from Italy and that he wished to ask a question relative to the missing person whom he knew Hi cried the woman raising a cracked voice Jeremiah Upon this a dry old man appeared whom mister Dorrit thought he identified by his gaiters as the rusty screw The woman was Under apprehensions of the dry old man for she whisked her apron away as he approached and disclosed a pale affrighted face Open the door you fool said the old man and let the gentleman in mister Dorrit not without a glance over his shoulder towards his driver and the cabriolet walked into the dim hall Now sir said mister Flintwinch you can ask anything here you think proper there are no secrets here sir Before a reply could be made a strong stern voice though a woman s called from above Who is it Who is it returned Jeremiah More inquiries A gentleman from Italy Bring him up here mister Flintwinch muttered as if he deemed that unnecessary but turning to mister Dorrit said missus Clennam She will do as she likes I ll show you the way He then preceded mister Dorrit up the blackened staircase that gentleman not unnaturally looking behind him on the road saw the woman following with her apron thrown over her head again in her former ghastly manner missus Clennam had her books open on her little table Oh said she abruptly as she eyed her visitor with a steady look You are from Italy sir are you Well mister Dorrit was at a loss for any more distinct rejoinder at the moment than Ha well Where is this missing man Have you come to give us information where he is I hope you have So far from it I hum have come to seek information Unfortunately for us there is none to be got here Flintwinch show the gentleman the handbill Give him several to take away Hold the light for him to read it mister Flintwinch did as he was directed and mister Dorrit read it through as if he had not previously seen it glad enough of the opportunity of collecting his presence of mind which the air of the house and of the people in it had a little disturbed While his eyes were on the paper he felt that the eyes of mister Flintwinch and of missus Clennam were on him He found when he looked up that this sensation was not a fanciful one Now you know as much said missus Clennam as we know sir Is mister Blandois a friend of yours No a hum an acquaintance answered mister Dorrit You have no commission from him perhaps I Ha Certainly not The searching look turned gradually to the floor after taking mister Flintwinch s face in its way mister Dorrit discomfited by finding that he was the questioned instead of the questioner applied himself to the reversal of that unexpected order of things I am ha a gentleman of property at present residing in Italy with my family my servants and hum my rather large establishment Being in London for a short time on affairs connected with ha my estate and hearing of this strange disappearance I wished to make myself acquainted with the circumstances at first hand because there is ha hum an English gentleman in Italy whom I shall no doubt see on my return who has been in habits of close and daily intimacy with Monsieur Blandois mister Henry Gowan You may know the name Never heard of it missus Clennam said it and mister Flintwinch echoed it Wishing to ha make the narrative coherent and consecutive to him said mister Dorrit may I ask say three questions Thirty if you choose Have you known Monsieur Blandois long Not a twelvemonth mister Flintwinch here will refer to the books and tell you when and by whom at Paris he was introduced to us If that missus Clennam added should be any satisfaction to you It is poor satisfaction to us Have you seen him often No Twice Once before and That once suggested mister Flintwinch And that once Pray madam said mister Dorrit with a growing fancy upon him as he recovered his importance that he was in some superior way in the Commission of the Peace pray madam may I inquire for the greater satisfaction of the gentleman whom I have the honour to ha retain or protect or let me say to hum know to know Was Monsieur Blandois here on business on the night indicated in this present sheet On what he called business returned missus Clennam Is ha excuse me is its nature to be communicated No It was evidently impracticable to pass the barrier of that reply The question has been asked before said missus Clennam and the answer has been No We don t choose to publish our transactions however unimportant to all the town We say No I mean he took away no money with him for example said mister Dorrit He took away none of ours sir and got none here I suppose observed mister Dorrit glancing from missus Clennam to mister Flintwinch and from mister Flintwinch to missus Clennam you have no way of accounting to yourself for this mystery Why do you suppose so rejoined missus Clennam Disconcerted by the cold and hard inquiry mister Dorrit was unable to assign any reason for his supposing so I account for it sir she pursued after an awkward silence on mister Dorrit s part by having no doubt that he is travelling somewhere or hiding somewhere Do you know ha why he should hide anywhere No It was exactly the same No as before and put another barrier up You asked me if I accounted for the disappearance to myself missus Clennam sternly reminded him not if I accounted for it to you I do not pretend to account for it to you sir I understand it to be no more my business to do that than it is yours to require that mister Dorrit answered with an apologetic bend of his head As he stepped back preparatory to saying he had no more to ask he could not but observe how gloomily and fixedly she sat with her eyes fastened on the ground and a certain air upon her of resolute waiting also how exactly the self same expression was reflected in mister Flintwinch standing at a little distance from her chair with his eyes also on the ground and his right hand softly rubbing his chin At that moment Mistress Affery of course the woman with the apron dropped the candlestick she held and cried out There O good Lord there it is again Hark Jeremiah Now If there were any sound at all it was so slight that she must have fallen into a confirmed habit of listening for sounds but mister Dorrit believed he did hear a something like the falling of dry leaves The woman s terror for a very short space seemed to touch the three and they all listened mister Flintwinch was the first to stir Affery my woman said he sidling at her with his fists clenched and his elbows quivering with impatience to shake her you are at your old tricks You ll be walking in your sleep next my woman and playing the whole round of your distempered antics You must have some physic When I have shown this gentleman out I ll make you up such a comfortable dose my woman such a comfortable dose It did not appear altogether comfortable in expectation to Mistress Affery but Jeremiah without further reference to his healing medicine took another candle from missus Clennam s table and said Now sir shall I light you down mister Dorrit professed himself obliged and went down mister Flintwinch shut him out and chained him out without a moment s loss of time He was again passed by the two men one going out and the other coming in got into the vehicle he had left waiting and was driven away Before he had gone far the driver stopped to let him know that he had given his name number and address to the two men on their joint requisition and also the address at which he had taken mister Dorrit up the hour at which he had been called from his stand and the way by which he had come This did not make the night s adventure run any less hotly in mister Dorrit s mind either when he sat down by his fire again or when he went to bed All night he haunted the dismal house saw the two people resolutely waiting heard the woman with her apron over her face cry out about the noise and found the body of the missing Blandois now buried in the cellar and now bricked up in a wall CHAPTER eighteen A Castle in the Air Manifold are the cares of wealth and state mister Dorrit s satisfaction in remembering that it had not been necessary for him to announce himself to Clennam and company or to make an allusion to his having had any knowledge of the intrusive person of that name had been damped over night while it was still fresh by a debate that arose within him whether or no he should take the Marshalsea in his way back and look at the old gate He had decided not to do so and had astonished the coachman by being very fierce with him for proposing to go over London Bridge and recross the river by Waterloo Bridge a course which would have taken him almost within sight of his old quarters Still for all that the question had raised a conflict in his breast and for some odd reason or no reason he was vaguely dissatisfied Even at the Merdle dinner table next day he was so out of sorts about it that he continued at intervals to turn it over and over in a manner frightfully inconsistent with the good society surrounding him It made him hot to think what the Chief Butler s opinion of him would have been if that illustrious personage could have plumbed with that heavy eye of his the stream of his meditations The farewell banquet was of a gorgeous nature and wound up his visit in a most brilliant manner Fanny combined with the attractions of her youth and beauty a certain weight of self sustainment as if she had been married twenty years He felt that he could leave her with a quiet mind to tread the paths of distinction and wished but without abatement of patronage and without prejudice to the retiring virtues of his favourite child that he had such another daughter My dear he told her at parting our family looks to you to ha assert its dignity and hum maintain its importance I know you will never disappoint it No papa said Fanny you may rely upon that I think My best love to dearest Amy and I will write to her very soon Shall I convey any message to ha anybody else asked mister Dorrit in an insinuating manner Papa said Fanny before whom missus General instantly loomed no I thank you You are very kind Pa but I must beg to be excused There is no other message to send I thank you dear papa that it would be at all agreeable to you to take They parted in an outer drawing room where only mister Sparkler waited on his lady and dutifully bided his time for shaking hands When mister Sparkler was admitted to this closing audience mister Merdle came creeping in with not much more appearance of arms in his sleeves than if he had been the twin brother of Miss Biffin and insisted on escorting mister Dorrit down stairs All mister Dorrit s protestations being in vain he enjoyed the honour of being accompanied to the hall door by this distinguished man who as mister Dorrit told him in shaking hands on the step had really overwhelmed him with attentions and services during this memorable visit Thus they parted mister Dorrit entering his carriage with a swelling breast not at all sorry that his Courier who had come to take leave in the lower regions should have an opportunity of beholding the grandeur of his departure The aforesaid grandeur was yet full upon mister Dorrit when he alighted at his hotel Helped out by the Courier and some half dozen of the hotel servants he was passing through the hall with a serene magnificence when lo a sight presented itself that struck him dumb and motionless John Chivery in his best clothes with his tall hat under his arm his ivory handled cane genteelly embarrassing his deportment and a bundle of cigars in his hand Now young man said the porter This is the gentleman This young man has persisted in waiting sir saying you would be glad to see him mister Dorrit glared on the young man choked and said in the mildest of tones Ah Young John It is Young John I think is it not Yes sir returned Young John I ha thought it was Young John said mister Dorrit The young man may come up turning to the attendants as he passed on oh yes he may come up Let Young John follow I will speak to him above Young John followed smiling and much gratified mister Dorrit s rooms were reached Candles were lighted The attendants withdrew Now sir said mister Dorrit turning round upon him and seizing him by the collar when they were safely alone What do you mean by this The amazement and horror depicted in the unfortunate John s face for he had rather expected to be embraced next were of that powerfully expressive nature that mister Dorrit withdrew his hand and merely glared at him How dare you do this said mister Dorrit How do you presume to come here How dare you insult me I insult you sir cried Young John Oh Yes sir returned mister Dorrit Insult me Your coming here is an affront an impertinence an audacity You are not wanted here Who sent you here What ha the Devil do you do here I thought sir said Young John with as pale and shocked a face as ever had been turned to mister Dorrit s in his life even in his College life I thought sir you mightn t object to have the goodness to accept a bundle Damn your bundle sir cried mister Dorrit in irrepressible rage I hum don t smoke I humbly beg your pardon sir You used to Tell me that again cried mister Dorrit quite beside himself and I ll take the poker to you John Chivery backed to the door Stop sir cried mister Dorrit Stop Sit down Confound you sit down John Chivery dropped into the chair nearest the door and mister Dorrit walked up and down the room rapidly at first then more slowly Once he went to the window and stood there with his forehead against the glass All of a sudden he turned and said What else did you come for Sir Nothing else in the world sir Oh dear me Only to say Sir that I hoped you was well and only to ask if Miss Amy was Well What s that to you sir retorted mister Dorrit It s nothing to me sir by rights I never thought of lessening the distance betwixt us I am sure I know it s a liberty sir but I never thought you d have taken it ill Upon my word and honour sir said Young John with emotion in my poor way I am too proud to have come I assure you if I had thought so mister Dorrit was ashamed He went back to the window and leaned his forehead against the glass for some time When he turned he had his handkerchief in his hand and he had been wiping his eyes with it and he looked tired and ill Young John I am very sorry to have been hasty with you but ha some remembrances are not happy remembrances and hum you shouldn t have come I feel that now sir returned John Chivery but I didn t before and Heaven knows I meant no harm sir No No said mister Dorrit I am hum sure of that Ha Give me your hand Young John give me your hand Young John gave it but mister Dorrit had driven his heart out of it and nothing could change his face now from its white shocked look There said mister Dorrit slowly shaking hands with him Sit down again Young John Thank you sir but I d rather stand mister Dorrit sat down instead After painfully holding his head a little while he turned it to his visitor and said with an effort to be easy And how is your father Young John How ha how are they all Young John Thank you sir They re all pretty well sir They re not any ways complaining Hum You are in your ha old business I see John said mister Dorrit with a glance at the offending bundle he had anathematised Partly sir I am in my John hesitated a little father s business likewise Oh indeed said mister Dorrit Do you ha hum go upon the ha Lock sir Yes sir Much to do John Yes sir we re pretty heavy at present I don t know how it is but we generally ARE pretty heavy At this time of the year Young John Mostly at all times of the year sir I don t know the time that makes much difference to us I wish you good night sir Stay a moment John ha stay a moment Hum Leave me the cigars John I ha beg Certainly sir John put them with a trembling hand on the table Stay a moment Young John stay another moment It would be a ha a gratification to me to send a little hum Testimonial by such a trusty messenger to be divided among ha hum them them according to their wants Would you object to take it John Not in any ways sir There s many of them I m sure that would be the better for it Thank you John I ha I ll write it John His hand shook so that he was a long time writing it and wrote it in a tremulous scrawl at last It was a cheque for one hundred pounds He folded it up put it in Young John s hand and pressed the hand in his I hope you ll ha overlook hum what has passed John Don t speak of it sir on any accounts I don t in any ways bear malice I m sure But nothing while John was there could change John s face to its natural colour and expression or restore John s natural manner And John said mister Dorrit giving his hand a final pressure and releasing it I hope we ha agree that we have spoken together in confidence and that you will abstain in going out from saying anything to any one that might hum suggest that ha once I Oh I assure you sir returned John Chivery in my poor humble way sir I m too proud and honourable to do it sir mister Dorrit was not too proud and honourable to listen at the door that he might ascertain for himself whether John really went straight out or lingered to have any talk with any one There was no doubt that he went direct out at the door and away down the street with a quick step After remaining alone for an hour mister Dorrit rang for the Courier who found him with his chair on the hearth rug sitting with his back towards him and his face to the fire You can take that bundle of cigars to smoke on the journey if you like said mister Dorrit with a careless wave of his hand Ha brought by hum little offering from ha son of old tenant of mine Next morning s sun saw mister Dorrit s equipage upon the Dover road where every red jacketed postilion was the sign of a cruel house established for the unmerciful plundering of travellers The whole business of the human race between London and Dover being spoliation mister Dorrit was waylaid at Dartford pillaged at Gravesend rifled at Rochester fleeced at Sittingbourne and sacked at Canterbury However it being the Courier s business to get him out of the hands of the banditti the Courier brought him off at every stage and so the red jackets went gleaming merrily along the spring landscape rising and falling to a regular measure between mister Dorrit in his snug corner and the next chalky rise in the dusty highway Another day s sun saw him at Calais And having now got the Channel between himself and John Chivery he began to feel safe and to find that the foreign air was lighter to breathe than the air of England On again by the heavy French roads for Paris Having now quite recovered his equanimity mister Dorrit in his snug corner fell to castle building as he rode along It was evident that he had a very large castle in hand All day long he was running towers up taking towers down adding a wing here putting on a battlement there looking to the walls strengthening the defences giving ornamental touches to the interior making in all respects a superb castle of it His preoccupied face so clearly denoted the pursuit in which he was engaged that every cripple at the post houses not blind who shoved his little battered tin box in at the carriage window for Charity in the name of Heaven Charity in the name of our Lady Charity in the name of all the Saints knew as well what work he was at as their countryman Le Brun could have known it himself though he had made that English traveller the subject of a special physiognomical treatise Arrived at Paris and resting there three days mister Dorrit strolled much about the streets alone looking in at the shop windows and particularly the jewellers windows Ultimately he went into the most famous jeweller s and said he wanted to buy a little gift for a lady It was a charming little woman to whom he said it a sprightly little woman dressed in perfect taste who came out of a green velvet bower to attend upon him from posting up some dainty little books of account which one could hardly suppose to be ruled for the entry of any articles more commercial than kisses at a dainty little shining desk which looked in itself like a sweetmeat For example then said the little woman what species of gift did Monsieur desire A love gift mister Dorrit smiled and said Eh well Perhaps What did he know It was always possible the sex being so charming Would she show him some Most willingly said the little woman Flattered and enchanted to show him many But pardon To begin with he would have the great goodness to observe that there were love gifts and there were nuptial gifts For example these ravishing ear rings and this necklace so superb to correspond were what one called a love gift These brooches and these rings of a beauty so gracious and celestial were what one called with the permission of Monsieur nuptial gifts Perhaps it would be a good arrangement mister Dorrit hinted smiling to purchase both and to present the love gift first and to finish with the nuptial offering Ah Heaven said the little woman laying the tips of the fingers of her two little hands against each other that would be generous indeed that would be a special gallantry And without doubt the lady so crushed with gifts would find them irresistible mister Dorrit was not sure of that But for example the sprightly little woman was very sure of it she said So mister Dorrit bought a gift of each sort and paid handsomely for it As he strolled back to his hotel afterwards he carried his head high having plainly got up his castle now to a much loftier altitude than the two square towers of Notre Dame Building away with all his might but reserving the plans of his castle exclusively for his own eye mister Dorrit posted away for Marseilles Building on building on busily busily from morning to night Falling asleep and leaving great blocks of building materials dangling in the air waking again to resume work and get them into their places What time the Courier in the rumble smoking Young John s best cigars left a little thread of thin light smoke behind perhaps as he built a castle or two with stray pieces of mister Dorrit s money Not a fortified town that they passed in all their journey was as strong not a Cathedral summit was as high as mister Dorrit s castle Neither the Saone nor the Rhone sped with the swiftness of that peerless building nor was the Mediterranean deeper than its foundations nor were the distant landscapes on the Cornice road nor the hills and bay of Genoa the Superb more beautiful mister Dorrit and his matchless castle were disembarked among the dirty white houses and dirtier felons of Civita Vecchia and thence scrambled on to Rome as they could through the filth that festered on the way CHAPTER nineteen The Storming of the Castle in the Air The sun had gone down full four hours and it was later than most travellers would like it to be for finding themselves outside the walls of Rome when mister Dorrit s carriage still on its last wearisome stage rattled over the solitary Campagna The savage herdsmen and the fierce looking peasants who had chequered the way while the light lasted had all gone down with the sun and left the wilderness blank At some turns of the road a pale flare on the horizon like an exhalation from the ruin sown land showed that the city was yet far off but this poor relief was rare and short lived The carriage dipped down again into a hollow of the black dry sea and for a long time there was nothing visible save its petrified swell and the gloomy sky mister Dorrit though he had his castle building to engage his mind could not be quite easy in that desolate place He was far more curious in every swerve of the carriage and every cry of the postilions than he had been since he quitted London The valet on the box evidently quaked The Courier in the rumble was not altogether comfortable in his mind As often as mister Dorrit let down the glass and looked back at him which was very often he saw him smoking John Chivery out it is true but still generally standing up the while and looking about him like a man who had his suspicions and kept upon his guard Then would mister Dorrit pulling up the glass again reflect that those postilions were cut throat looking fellows and that he would have done better to have slept at Civita Vecchia and have started betimes in the morning But for all this he worked at his castle in the intervals And now fragments of ruinous enclosure yawning window gap and crazy wall deserted houses leaking wells broken water tanks spectral cypress trees patches of tangled vine and the changing of the track to a long irregular disordered lane where everything was crumbling away from the unsightly buildings to the jolting road now these objects showed that they were nearing Rome And now a sudden twist and stoppage of the carriage inspired mister Dorrit with the mistrust that the brigand moment was come for twisting him into a ditch and robbing him until letting down the glass again and looking out he perceived himself assailed by nothing worse than a funeral procession which came mechanically chaunting by with an indistinct show of dirty vestments lurid torches swinging censers and a great cross borne before a priest He was an ugly priest by torchlight of a lowering aspect with an overhanging brow and as his eyes met those of mister Dorrit looking bareheaded out of the carriage his lips moving as they chaunted seemed to threaten that important traveller likewise the action of his hand which was in fact his manner of returning the traveller s salutation seemed to come in aid of that menace So thought mister Dorrit made fanciful by the weariness of building and travelling as the priest drifted past him and the procession straggled away taking its dead along with it Upon their so different way went mister Dorrit s company too and soon with their coach load of luxuries from the two great capitals of Europe they were like the Goths reversed beating at the gates of Rome mister Dorrit was not expected by his own people that night He had been but they had given him up until to morrow not doubting that it was later than he would care in those parts to be out Thus when his equipage stopped at his own gate no one but the porter appeared to receive him Was Miss Dorrit from home he asked No She was within Good said mister Dorrit to the assembling servants let them keep where they were let them help to unload the carriage he would find Miss Dorrit for himself So he went up his grand staircase slowly and tired and looked into various chambers which were empty until he saw a light in a small ante room It was a curtained nook like a tent within two other rooms and it looked warm and bright in colour as he approached it through the dark avenue they made There was a draped doorway but no door and as he stopped here looking in unseen he felt a pang Surely not like jealousy For why like jealousy There was only his daughter and his brother there he with his chair drawn to the hearth enjoying the warmth of the evening wood fire she seated at a little table busied with some embroidery work Allowing for the great difference in the still life of the picture the figures were much the same as of old his brother being sufficiently like himself to represent himself for a moment in the composition So had he sat many a night over a coal fire far away so had she sat devoted to him Yet surely there was nothing to be jealous of in the old miserable poverty Whence then the pang in his heart Do you know uncle I think you are growing young again Her uncle shook his head and said Since when my dear since when I think returned Little Dorrit plying her needle that you have been growing younger for weeks past So cheerful uncle and so ready and so interested My dear child all you All me uncle Yes yes You have done me a world of good You have been so considerate of me and so tender with me and so delicate in trying to hide your attentions from me that I well well well It s treasured up my darling treasured up There is nothing in it but your own fresh fancy uncle said Little Dorrit cheerfully Well well well murmured the old man Thank God She paused for an instant in her work to look at him and her look revived that former pain in her father s breast in his poor weak breast so full of contradictions vacillations inconsistencies the little peevish perplexities of this ignorant life mists which the morning without a night only can clear away I have been freer with you you see my dove said the old man since we have been alone I say alone for I don t count missus General I don t care for her she has nothing to do with me But I know Fanny was impatient of me And I don t wonder at it or complain of it for I am sensible that I must be in the way though I try to keep out of it as well as I can I know I am not fit company for our company My brother William said the old man admiringly is fit company for monarchs but not so your uncle my dear Frederick Dorrit is no credit to William Dorrit and he knows it quite well Ah Why here s your father Amy My dear William welcome back My beloved brother I am rejoiced to see you Turning his head in speaking he had caught sight of him as he stood in the doorway Little Dorrit with a cry of pleasure put her arms about her father s neck and kissed him again and again Her father was a little impatient and a little querulous I am glad to find you at last Amy he said Ha Really I am glad to find hum any one to receive me at last I appear to have been ha so little expected that upon my word I began ha hum to think it might be right to offer an apology for ha taking the liberty of coming back at all It was so late my dear William said his brother that we had given you up for to night I am stronger than you dear Frederick returned his brother with an elaboration of fraternity in which there was severity and I hope I can travel without detriment at ha any hour I choose Surely surely returned the other with a misgiving that he had given offence Surely William Thank you Amy pursued mister Dorrit as she helped him to put off his wrappers I can do it without assistance I ha need not trouble you Amy Could I have a morsel of bread and a glass of wine or hum would it cause too much inconvenience Dear father you shall have supper in a very few minutes Thank you my love said mister Dorrit with a reproachful frost upon him I ha am afraid I am causing inconvenience Hum missus General pretty well missus General complained of a headache and of being fatigued and so when we gave you up she went to bed dear Perhaps mister Dorrit thought that missus General had done well in being overcome by the disappointment of his not arriving At any rate his face relaxed and he said with obvious satisfaction Extremely sorry to hear that missus General is not well During this short dialogue his daughter had been observant of him with something more than her usual interest It would seem as though he had a changed or worn appearance in her eyes and he perceived and resented it for he said with renewed peevishness when he had divested himself of his travelling cloak and had come to the fire Amy what are you looking at What do you see in me that causes you to ha concentrate your solicitude on me in that hum very particular manner I did not know it father I beg your pardon It gladdens my eyes to see you again that s all Don t say that s all because ha that s not all You hum you think said mister Dorrit with an accusatory emphasis that I am not looking well I thought you looked a little tired love Then you are mistaken said mister Dorrit Ha I am not tired Ha hum I am very much fresher than I was when I went away He was so inclined to be angry that she said nothing more in her justification but remained quietly beside him embracing his arm As he stood thus with his brother on the other side he fell into a heavy doze of not a minute s duration and awoke with a start Frederick he said turning to his brother I recommend you to go to bed immediately No William I ll wait and see you sup Frederick he retorted I beg you to go to bed I ha make it a personal request that you go to bed You ought to have been in bed long ago You are very feeble Hah said the old man who had no wish but to please him Well well well I dare say I am My dear Frederick returned mister Dorrit with an astonishing superiority to his brother s failing powers there can be no doubt of it It is painful to me to see you so weak Ha It distresses me Hum I don t find you looking at all well You are not fit for this sort of thing You should be more careful you should be very careful Shall I go to bed asked Frederick Dear Frederick said mister Dorrit do I adjure you Good night brother I hope you will be stronger to morrow I am not at all pleased with your looks Good night dear fellow After dismissing his brother in this gracious way he fell into a doze again before the old man was well out of the room and he would have stumbled forward upon the logs but for his daughter s restraining hold Your uncle wanders very much Amy he said when he was thus roused He is less ha coherent and his conversation is more hum broken than I have ha hum ever known Has he had any illness since I have been gone No father You ha see a great change in him Amy I have not observed it dear Greatly broken said mister Dorrit Greatly broken My poor affectionate failing Frederick Ha Even taking into account what he was before he is hum sadly broken His supper which was brought to him there and spread upon the little table where he had seen her working diverted his attention She sat at his side as in the days that were gone for the first time since those days ended They were alone and she helped him to his meat and poured out his drink for him as she had been used to do in the prison All this happened now for the first time since their accession to wealth She was afraid to look at him much after the offence he had taken but she noticed two occasions in the course of his meal when he all of a sudden looked at her and looked about him as if the association were so strong that he needed assurance from his sense of sight that they were not in the old prison room Both times he put his hand to his head as if he missed his old black cap though it had been ignominiously given away in the Marshalsea and had never got free to that hour but still hovered about the yards on the head of his successor He took very little supper but was a long time over it and often reverted to his brother s declining state Though he expressed the greatest pity for him he was almost bitter upon him He said that poor Frederick ha hum drivelled There was no other word to express it drivelled Poor fellow It was melancholy to reflect what Amy must have undergone from the excessive tediousness of his Society wandering and babbling on poor dear estimable creature wandering and babbling on if it had not been for the relief she had had in missus General Extremely sorry he then repeated with his former satisfaction that that ha superior woman was poorly Little Dorrit in her watchful love would have remembered the lightest thing he said or did that night though she had had no subsequent reason to recall that night She always remembered that when he looked about him under the strong influence of the old association he tried to keep it out of her mind and perhaps out of his own too by immediately expatiating on the great riches and great company that had encompassed him in his absence and on the lofty position he and his family had to sustain Nor did she fail to recall that there were two under currents side by side pervading all his discourse and all his manner one showing her how well he had got on without her and how independent he was of her the other in a fitful and unintelligible way almost complaining of her as if it had been possible that she had neglected him while he was away His telling her of the glorious state that mister Merdle kept and of the court that bowed before him naturally brought him to missus Merdle So naturally indeed that although there was an unusual want of sequence in the greater part of his remarks he passed to her at once and asked how she was She is very well She is going away next week Home asked mister Dorrit After a few weeks stay upon the road She will be a vast loss here said mister Dorrit A vast ha acquisition at home To Fanny and to hum the rest of the ha great world Little Dorrit thought of the competition that was to be entered upon and assented very softly missus Merdle is going to have a great farewell Assembly dear and a dinner before it She has been expressing her anxiety that you should return in time She has invited both you and me to her dinner She is ha very kind When is the day The day after to morrow Write round in the morning and say that I have returned and shall hum be delighted May I walk with you up the stairs to your room dear No he answered looking angrily round for he was moving away as if forgetful of leave taking You may not Amy I want no help I am your father not your infirm uncle He checked himself as abruptly as he had broken into this reply and said You have not kissed me Amy Good night my dear We must marry ha we must marry YOU now With that he went more slowly and more tired up the staircase to his rooms and almost as soon as he got there dismissed his valet His next care was to look about him for his Paris purchases and after opening their cases and carefully surveying them to put them away under lock and key After that what with dozing and what with castle building he lost himself for a long time so that there was a touch of morning on the eastward rim of the desolate Campagna when he crept to bed missus General sent up her compliments in good time next day and hoped he had rested well after this fatiguing journey He sent down his compliments and begged to inform missus General that he had rested very well indeed and was in high condition Nevertheless he did not come forth from his own rooms until late in the afternoon and although he then caused himself to be magnificently arrayed for a drive with missus General and his daughter his appearance was scarcely up to his description of himself As the family had no visitors that day its four members dined alone together He conducted missus General to the seat at his right hand with immense ceremony and Little Dorrit could not but notice as she followed with her uncle both that he was again elaborately dressed and that his manner towards missus General was very particular The perfect formation of that accomplished lady s surface rendered it difficult to displace an atom of its genteel glaze but Little Dorrit thought she descried a slight thaw of triumph in a corner of her frosty eye Notwithstanding what may be called in these pages the Pruney and Prismatic nature of the family banquet mister Dorrit several times fell asleep while it was in progress His fits of dozing were as sudden as they had been overnight and were as short and profound When the first of these slumberings seized him missus General looked almost amazed but on each recurrence of the symptoms she told her polite beads Papa Potatoes Poultry Prunes and Prism and by dint of going through that infallible performance very slowly appeared to finish her rosary at about the same time as mister Dorrit started from his sleep He was again painfully aware of a somnolent tendency in Frederick which had no existence out of his own imagination and after dinner when Frederick had withdrawn privately apologised to missus General for the poor man The most estimable and affectionate of brothers he said but ha hum broken up altogether Unhappily declining fast mister Frederick sir quoth missus General is habitually absent and drooping but let us hope it is not so bad as that mister Dorrit however was determined not to let him off Fast declining madam A wreck A ruin Mouldering away before our eyes Hum Good Frederick You left missus Sparkler quite well and happy I trust said missus General after heaving a cool sigh for Frederick Surrounded replied mister Dorrit by ha all that can charm the taste and hum elevate the mind Happy my dear madam in a hum husband missus General was a little fluttered seeming delicately to put the word away with her gloves as if there were no knowing what it might lead to Fanny mister Dorrit continued Fanny missus General has high qualities Ha Ambition hum purpose consciousness of ha position determination to support that position ha hum grace beauty and native nobility No doubt said missus General with a little extra stiffness Combined with these qualities madam said mister Dorrit Fanny has ha manifested one blemish which has made me hum made me uneasy and ha I must add angry but which I trust may now be considered at an end even as to herself and which is undoubtedly at an end as to ha others To what mister Dorrit returned missus General with her gloves again somewhat excited can you allude I am at a loss to Do not say that my dear madam interrupted mister Dorrit missus General s voice as it died away pronounced the words at a loss to imagine After which mister Dorrit was seized with a doze for about a minute out of which he sprang with spasmodic nimbleness I refer missus General to that ha strong spirit of opposition or hum I might say ha jealousy in Fanny which has occasionally risen against the ha sense I entertain of hum the claims of ha the lady with whom I have now the honour of communing mister Dorrit returned missus General is ever but too obliging ever but too appreciative If there have been moments when I have imagined that Miss Dorrit has indeed resented the favourable opinion mister Dorrit has formed of my services I have found in that only too high opinion my consolation and recompense Opinion of your services madam said mister Dorrit Of missus General repeated in an elegantly impressive manner my services Of your services alone dear madam said mister Dorrit I presume retorted missus General in her former impressive manner of my services alone For to what else said missus General with a slightly interrogative action of her gloves could I impute To ha yourself missus General Ha hum To yourself and your merits was mister Dorrit s rejoinder mister Dorrit will pardon me said missus General if I remark that this is not a time or place for the pursuit of the present conversation mister Dorrit will excuse me if I remind him that Miss Dorrit is in the adjoining room and is visible to myself while I utter her name mister Dorrit will forgive me if I observe that I am agitated and that I find there are moments when weaknesses I supposed myself to have subdued return with redoubled power mister Dorrit will allow me to withdraw Hum Perhaps we may resume this ha interesting conversation said mister Dorrit at another time unless it should be what I hope it is not hum in any way disagreeable to ah missus General mister Dorrit said missus General casting down her eyes as she rose with a bend must ever claim my homage and obedience missus General then took herself off in a stately way and not with that amount of trepidation upon her which might have been expected in a less remarkable woman mister Dorrit who had conducted his part of the dialogue with a certain majestic and admiring condescension much as some people may be seen to conduct themselves in Church and to perform their part in the service appeared on the whole very well satisfied with himself and with missus General too On the return of that lady to tea she had touched herself up with a little powder and pomatum and was not without moral enchantment likewise the latter showing itself in much sweet patronage of manner towards Miss Dorrit and in an air of as tender interest in mister Dorrit as was consistent with rigid propriety At the close of the evening when she rose to retire mister Dorrit took her by the hand as if he were going to lead her out into the Piazza of the people to walk a minuet by moonlight and with great solemnity conducted her to the room door where he raised her knuckles to his lips Having parted from her with what may be conjectured to have been a rather bony kiss of a cosmetic flavour he gave his daughter his blessing graciously And having thus hinted that there was something remarkable in the wind he again went to bed He remained in the seclusion of his own chamber next morning but early in the afternoon sent down his best compliments to missus General by mister Tinkler and begged she would accompany Miss Dorrit on an airing without him His daughter was dressed for missus Merdle s dinner before he appeared He then presented himself in a refulgent condition as to his attire but looking indefinably shrunken and old However as he was plainly determined to be angry with her if she so much as asked him how he was she only ventured to kiss his cheek before accompanying him to missus Merdle s with an anxious heart The distance that they had to go was very short but he was at his building work again before the carriage had half traversed it missus Merdle received him with great distinction the bosom was in admirable preservation and on the best terms with itself the dinner was very choice and the company was very select It was principally English saving that it comprised the usual French Count and the usual Italian Marchese decorative social milestones always to be found in certain places and varying very little in appearance The table was long and the dinner was long and Little Dorrit overshadowed by a large pair of black whiskers and a large white cravat lost sight of her father altogether until a servant put a scrap of paper in her hand with a whispered request from missus Merdle that she would read it directly missus Merdle had written on it in pencil Pray come and speak to mister Dorrit I doubt if he is well She was hurrying to him unobserved when he got up out of his chair and leaning over the table called to her supposing her to be still in her place Amy Amy my child The action was so unusual to say nothing of his strange eager appearance and strange eager voice that it instantaneously caused a profound silence Amy my dear he repeated Will you go and see if Bob is on the lock She was at his side and touching him but he still perversely supposed her to be in her seat and called out still leaning over the table Amy Amy I don t feel quite myself Ha I don t know what s the matter with me I particularly wish to see Bob Ha Of all the turnkeys he s as much my friend as yours See if Bob is in the lodge and beg him to come to me All the guests were now in consternation and everybody rose Dear father I am not there I am here by you Oh You are here Amy Good Hum Good Ha Call Bob If he has been relieved and is not on the lock tell missus Bangham to go and fetch him She was gently trying to get him away but he resisted and would not go I tell you child he said petulantly I can t be got up the narrow stairs without Bob Ha Send for Bob Hum Send for Bob best of all the turnkeys send for Bob He looked confusedly about him and becoming conscious of the number of faces by which he was surrounded addressed them Ladies and gentlemen the duty ha devolves upon me of hum welcoming you to the Marshalsea Welcome to the Marshalsea The space is ha limited limited the parade might be wider but you will find it apparently grow larger after a time a time ladies and gentlemen and the air is all things considered very good It blows over the ha Surrey hills Blows over the Surrey hills This is the Snuggery Hum Supported by a small subscription of the ha Collegiate body In return for which hot water general kitchen and little domestic advantages Those who

but she had no other care than to soothe him and get him away for his own dear sake She was between him and the wondering faces turned round upon his breast with her own face raised to his He held her clasped in his left arm and between whiles her low voice was heard tenderly imploring him to go away with her Born here he repeated shedding tears Bred here Ladies and gentlemen my daughter Child of

mortification undergone by the Bosom had occasioned the withdrawal of the greater part of the company into other rooms The few who had lingered thus long followed the rest and Little Dorrit and her father were left to the servants and themselves Dearest and most precious to her he would come with her now would he not He replied to her fervid entreaties that he would never be able to get up the narrow stairs without Bob where was Bob would nobody fetch Bob Under pretence of looking for Bob she got him out against the stream of gay company now pouring in for the evening assembly and got him into a coach that had just set down its load and got him home The broad stairs of his Roman palace were contracted in his failing sight to the narrow stairs of his London prison and he would suffer no one but her to touch him his brother excepted They got him up to his room without help and laid him down on his bed And from that hour his poor maimed spirit only remembering the place where it had broken its wings cancelled the dream through which it had since groped and knew of nothing beyond the Marshalsea When he heard footsteps in the street he took them for the old weary tread in the yards When the hour came for locking up he supposed all strangers to be excluded for the night When the time for opening came again he was so anxious to see Bob that they were fain to patch up a narrative how that Bob many a year dead then gentle turnkey had taken cold but hoped to be out to morrow or the next day or the next at furthest He fell away into a weakness so extreme that he could not raise his hand But he still protected his brother according to his long usage and would say with some complacency fifty times a day when he saw him standing by his bed My good Frederick sit down You are very feeble indeed They tried him with missus General but he had not the faintest knowledge of her Some injurious suspicion lodged itself in his brain that she wanted to supplant missus Bangham and that she was given to drinking He charged her with it in no measured terms and was so urgent with his daughter to go round to the Marshal and entreat him to turn her out that she was never reproduced after the first failure Saving that he once asked if Tip had gone outside the remembrance of his two children not present seemed to have departed from him But the child who had done so much for him and had been so poorly repaid was never out of his mind Not that he spared her or was fearful of her being spent by watching and fatigue he was not more troubled on that score than he had usually been No he loved her in his old way They were in the jail again and she tended him and he had constant need of her and could not turn without her and he even told her sometimes that he was content to have undergone a great deal for her sake As to her she bent over his bed with her quiet face against his and would have laid down her own life to restore him When he had been sinking in this painless way for two or three days she observed him to be troubled by the ticking of his watch a pompous gold watch that made as great a to do about its going as if nothing else went but itself and Time She suffered it to run down but he was still uneasy and showed that was not what he wanted At length he roused himself to explain that he wanted money to be raised on this watch He was quite pleased when she pretended to take it away for the purpose and afterwards had a relish for his little tastes of wine and jelly that he had not had before He soon made it plain that this was so for in another day or two he sent off his sleeve buttons and finger rings He had an amazing satisfaction in entrusting her with these errands and appeared to consider it equivalent to making the most methodical and provident arrangements After his trinkets or such of them as he had been able to see about him were gone his clothes engaged his attention and it is as likely as not that he was kept alive for some days by the satisfaction of sending them piece by piece to an imaginary pawnbroker s Thus for ten days Little Dorrit bent over his pillow laying her cheek against his Sometimes she was so worn out that for a few minutes they would slumber together Then she would awake to recollect with fast flowing silent tears what it was that touched her face and to see stealing over the cherished face upon the pillow a deeper shadow than the shadow of the Marshalsea Wall Quietly quietly all the lines of the plan of the great Castle melted one after another Quietly quietly the ruled and cross ruled countenance on which they were traced became fair and blank Quietly quietly the reflected marks of the prison bars and of the zig zag iron on the wall top faded away Quietly quietly the face subsided into a far younger likeness of her own than she had ever seen under the grey hair and sank to rest At first her uncle was stark distracted O my brother O William William You to go before me you to go alone you to go and I to remain You so far superior so distinguished so noble I a poor useless creature fit for nothing and whom no one would have missed It did her for the time the good of having him to think of and to succour Uncle dear uncle spare yourself spare me The old man was not deaf to the last words When he did begin to restrain himself it was that he might spare her He had no care for himself but with all the remaining power of the honest heart stunned so long and now awaking to be broken he honoured and blessed her O God he cried before they left the room with his wrinkled hands clasped over her Thou seest this daughter of my dear dead brother All that I have looked upon with my half blind and sinful eyes Thou hast discerned clearly brightly Not a hair of her head shall be harmed before Thee Thou wilt uphold her here to her last hour And I know Thou wilt reward her hereafter They remained in a dim room near until it was almost midnight quiet and sad together At times his grief would seek relief in a burst like that in which it had found its earliest expression but besides that his little strength would soon have been unequal to such strains he never failed to recall her words and to reproach himself and calm himself The only utterance with which he indulged his sorrow was the frequent exclamation that his brother was gone alone that they had been together in the outset of their lives that they had fallen into misfortune together that they had kept together through their many years of poverty that they had remained together to that day and that his brother was gone alone alone They parted heavy and sorrowful She would not consent to leave him anywhere but in his own room and she saw him lie down in his clothes upon his bed and covered him with her own hands Then she sank upon her own bed and fell into a deep sleep the sleep of exhaustion and rest though not of complete release from a pervading consciousness of affliction Sleep good Little Dorrit Sleep through the night It was a moonlight night but the moon rose late being long past the full When it was high in the peaceful firmament it shone through half closed lattice blinds into the solemn room where the stumblings and wanderings of a life had so lately ended Two quiet figures were within the room two figures equally still and impassive equally removed by an untraversable distance from the teeming earth and all that it contains though soon to lie in it One figure reposed upon the bed The other kneeling on the floor drooped over it the arms easily and peacefully resting on the coverlet the face bowed down so that the lips touched the hand over which with its last breath it had bent The two brothers were before their Father far beyond the twilight judgment of this world high above its mists and obscurities CHAPTER twenty Introduces the next The passengers were landing from the packet on the pier at Calais A low lying place and a low spirited place Calais was with the tide ebbing out towards low water mark There had been no more water on the bar than had sufficed to float the packet in and now the bar itself with a shallow break of sea over it looked like a lazy marine monster just risen to the surface whose form was indistinctly shown as it lay asleep The meagre lighthouse all in white haunting the seaboard as if it were the ghost of an edifice that had once had colour and rotundity dropped melancholy tears after its late buffeting by the waves The long rows of gaunt black piles slimy and wet and weather worn with funeral garlands of seaweed twisted about them by the late tide might have represented an unsightly marine cemetery Every wave dashed storm beaten object was so low and so little under the broad grey sky in the noise of the wind and sea and before the curling lines of surf making at it ferociously that the wonder was there was any Calais left and that its low gates and low wall and low roofs and low ditches and low sand hills and low ramparts and flat streets had not yielded long ago to the undermining and besieging sea like the fortifications children make on the sea shore After slipping among oozy piles and planks stumbling up wet steps and encountering many salt difficulties the passengers entered on their comfortless peregrination along the pier where all the French vagabonds and English outlaws in the town half the population attended to prevent their recovery from bewilderment After being minutely inspected by all the English and claimed and reclaimed and counter claimed as prizes by all the French in a hand to hand scuffle three quarters of a mile long they were at last free to enter the streets and to make off in their various directions hotly pursued Clennam harassed by more anxieties than one was among this devoted band Having rescued the most defenceless of his compatriots from situations of great extremity he now went his way alone or as nearly alone as he could be with a native gentleman in a suit of grease and a cap of the same material giving chase at a distance of some fifty yards and continually calling after him Hi Ice say You Seer Ice say Nice Oatel Even this hospitable person however was left behind at last and Clennam pursued his way unmolested There was a tranquil air in the town after the turbulence of the Channel and the beach and its dulness in that comparison was agreeable He met new groups of his countrymen who had all a straggling air of having at one time overblown themselves like certain uncomfortable kinds of flowers and of being now mere weeds They had all an air too of lounging out a limited round day after day which strongly reminded him of the Marshalsea But taking no further note of them than was sufficient to give birth to the reflection he sought out a certain street and number which he kept in his mind So Pancks said he murmured to himself as he stopped before a dull house answering to the address I suppose his information to be correct and his discovery among mister Casby s loose papers indisputable but without it I should hardly have supposed this to be a likely place A dead sort of house with a dead wall over the way and a dead gateway at the side where a pendant bell handle produced two dead tinkles and a knocker produced a dead flat surface tapping that seemed not to have depth enough in it to penetrate even the cracked door However the door jarred open on a dead sort of spring and he closed it behind him as he entered a dull yard soon brought to a close by another dead wall where an attempt had been made to train some creeping shrubs which were dead and to make a little fountain in a grotto which was dry and to decorate that with a little statue which was gone The entry to the house was on the left and it was garnished as the outer gateway was with two printed bills in French and English announcing Furnished Apartments to let with immediate possession A strong cheerful peasant woman all stocking petticoat white cap and ear ring stood here in a dark doorway and said with a pleasant show of teeth Ice say Seer Who Clennam replying in French said the English lady he wished to see the English lady Enter then and ascend if you please returned the peasant woman in French likewise He did both and followed her up a dark bare staircase to a back room on the first floor Hence there was a gloomy view of the yard that was dull and of the shrubs that were dead and of the fountain that was dry and of the pedestal of the statue that was gone Monsieur Blandois said Clennam With pleasure Monsieur Thereupon the woman withdrew and left him to look at the room It was the pattern of room always to be found in such a house Cool dull and dark Waxed floor very slippery A room not large enough to skate in nor adapted to the easy pursuit of any other occupation Red and white curtained windows little straw mat little round table with a tumultuous assemblage of legs underneath clumsy rush bottomed chairs two great red velvet arm chairs affording plenty of space to be uncomfortable in bureau chimney glass in several pieces pretending to be in one piece pair of gaudy vases of very artificial flowers between them a Greek warrior with his helmet off sacrificing a clock to the Genius of France After some pause a door of communication with another room was opened and a lady entered She manifested great surprise on seeing Clennam and her glance went round the room in search of some one else Pardon me Miss Wade I am alone It was not your name that was brought to me No I know that Excuse me I have already had experience that my name does not predispose you to an interview and I ventured to mention the name of one I am in search of Pray she returned motioning him to a chair so coldly that he remained standing what name was it that you gave I mentioned the name of Blandois Blandois A name you are acquainted with It is strange she said frowning that you should still press an undesired interest in me and my acquaintances in me and my affairs mister Clennam I don t know what you mean Pardon me You know the name What can you have to do with the name What can I have to do with the name What can you have to do with my knowing or not knowing any name I know many names and I have forgotten many more This may be in the one class or it may be in the other or I may never have heard it I am acquainted with no reason for examining myself or for being examined about it If you will allow me said Clennam I will tell you my reason for pressing the subject I admit that I do press it and I must beg you to forgive me if I do so very earnestly The reason is all mine I do not insinuate that it is in any way yours Well sir she returned repeating a little less haughtily than before her former invitation to him to be seated to which he now deferred as she seated herself I am at least glad to know that this is not another bondswoman of some friend of yours who is bereft of free choice and whom I have spirited away I will hear your reason if you please First to identify the person of whom we speak said Clennam let me observe that it is the person you met in London some time back You will remember meeting him near the river in the Adelphi You mix yourself most unaccountably with my business she replied looking full at him with stern displeasure How do you know that I entreat you not to take it ill By mere accident What accident Solely the accident of coming upon you in the street and seeing the meeting Do you speak of yourself or of some one else Of myself I saw it To be sure it was in the open street she observed after a few moments of less and less angry reflection Fifty people might have seen it It would have signified nothing if they had Nor do I make my having seen it of any moment nor otherwise than as an explanation of my coming here do I connect my visit with it or the favour that I have to ask Oh You have to ask a favour It occurred to me and the handsome face looked bitterly at him that your manner was softened mister Clennam He was content to protest against this by a slight action without contesting it in words He then referred to Blandois disappearance of which it was probable she had heard However probable it was to him she had heard of no such thing Let him look round him she said and judge for himself what general intelligence was likely to reach the ears of a woman who had been shut up there while it was rife devouring her own heart When she had uttered this denial which he believed to be true she asked him what he meant by disappearance That led to his narrating the circumstances in detail and expressing something of his anxiety to discover what had really become of the man and to repel the dark suspicions that clouded about his mother s house She heard him with evident surprise and with more marks of suppressed interest than he had seen in her still they did not overcome her distant proud and self secluded manner When he had finished she said nothing but these words You have not yet told me sir what I have to do with it or what the favour is Will you be so good as come to that I assume said Arthur persevering in his endeavour to soften her scornful demeanour that being in communication may I say confidential communication with this person You may say of course whatever you like she remarked but I do not subscribe to your assumptions mister Clennam or to any one s that being at least in personal communication with him said Clennam changing the form of his position in the hope of making it unobjectionable you can tell me something of his antecedents pursuits habits usual place of residence Can give me some little clue by which to seek him out in the likeliest manner and either produce him or establish what has become of him This is the favour I ask and I ask it in a distress of mind for which I hope you will feel some consideration If you should have any reason for imposing conditions upon me I will respect it without asking what it is You chanced to see me in the street with the man she observed after being to his mortification evidently more occupied with her own reflections on the matter than with his appeal Then you knew the man before Not before afterwards I never saw him before but I saw him again on this very night of his disappearance In my mother s room in fact I left him there You will read in this paper all that is known of him He handed her one of the printed bills which she read with a steady and attentive face This is more than I knew of him she said giving it back Clennam s looks expressed his heavy disappointment perhaps his incredulity for she added in the same unsympathetic tone You don t believe it Still it is so As to personal communication it seems that there was personal communication between him and your mother And yet you say you believe her declaration that she knows no more of him A sufficiently expressive hint of suspicion was conveyed in these words and in the smile by which they were accompanied to bring the blood into Clennam s cheeks Come sir she said with a cruel pleasure in repeating the stab I will be as open with you as you can desire I will confess that if I cared for my credit which I do not or had a good name to preserve which I have not for I am utterly indifferent to its being considered good or bad I should regard myself as heavily compromised by having had anything to do with this fellow Yet he never passed in at MY door never sat in colloquy with ME until midnight She took her revenge for her old grudge in thus turning his subject against him Hers was not the nature to spare him and she had no compunction That he is a low mercenary wretch that I first saw him prowling about Italy where I was not long ago and that I hired him there as the suitable instrument of a purpose I happened to have I have no objection to tell you In short it was worth my while for my own pleasure the gratification of a strong feeling to pay a spy who would fetch and carry for money I paid this creature And I dare say that if I had wanted to make such a bargain and if I could have paid him enough and if he could have done it in the dark free from all risk he would have taken any life with as little scruple as he took my money That at least is my opinion of him and I see it is not very far removed from yours Your mother s opinion of him I am to assume following your example of assuming this and that was vastly different My mother let me remind you said Clennam was first brought into communication with him in the unlucky course of business It appears to have been an unlucky course of business that last brought her into communication with him returned Miss Wade and business hours on that occasion were late You imply said Arthur smarting under these cool handed thrusts of which he had deeply felt the force already that there was something mister Clennam she composedly interrupted recollect that I do not speak by implication about the man He is I say again without disguise a low mercenary wretch I suppose such a creature goes where there is occasion for him If I had not had occasion for him you would not have seen him and me together Wrung by her persistence in keeping that dark side of the case before him of which there was a half hidden shadow in his own breast Clennam was silent I have spoken of him as still living she added but he may have been put out of the way for anything I know For anything I care also I have no further occasion for him With a heavy sigh and a despondent air Arthur Clennam slowly rose She did not rise also but said having looked at him in the meanwhile with a fixed look of suspicion and lips angrily compressed He was the chosen associate of your dear friend mister Gowan was he not Why don t you ask your dear friend to help you The denial that he was a dear friend rose to Arthur s lips but he repressed it remembering his old struggles and resolutions and said Further than that he has never seen Blandois since Blandois set out for England mister Gowan knows nothing additional about him He was a chance acquaintance made abroad A chance acquaintance made abroad she repeated Yes Your dear friend has need to divert himself with all the acquaintances he can make seeing what a wife he has I hate his wife sir The anger with which she said it the more remarkable for being so much under her restraint fixed Clennam s attention and kept him on the spot It flashed out of her dark eyes as they regarded him quivered in her nostrils and fired the very breath she exhaled but her face was otherwise composed into a disdainful serenity and her attitude was as calmly and haughtily graceful as if she had been in a mood of complete indifference All I will say is Miss Wade he remarked that you can have received no provocation to a feeling in which I believe you have no sharer You may ask your dear friend if you choose she returned for his opinion upon that subject I am scarcely on those intimate terms with my dear friend said Arthur in spite of his resolutions that would render my approaching the subject very probable Miss Wade I hate him she returned Worse than his wife because I was once dupe enough and false enough to myself almost to love him You have seen me sir only on common place occasions when I dare say you have thought me a common place woman a little more self willed than the generality You don t know what I mean by hating if you know me no better than that you can t know without knowing with what care I have studied myself and people about me For this reason I have for some time inclined to tell you what my life has been not to propitiate your opinion for I set no value on it but that you may comprehend when you think of your dear friend and his dear wife what I mean by hating Shall I give you something I have written and put by for your perusal or shall I hold my hand Arthur begged her to give it to him She went to the bureau unlocked it and took from an inner drawer a few folded sheets of paper Without any conciliation of him scarcely addressing him rather speaking as if she were speaking to her own looking glass for the justification of her own stubbornness she said as she gave them to him Now you may know what I mean by hating No more of that Sir whether you find me temporarily and cheaply lodging in an empty London house or in a Calais apartment you find Harriet with me You may like to see her before you leave Harriet come in She called Harriet again The second call produced Harriet once Tattycoram Here is mister Clennam said Miss Wade not come for you he has given you up I suppose you have by this time Having no authority or influence yes assented Clennam Not come in search of you you see but still seeking some one He wants that Blandois man With whom I saw you in the Strand in London hinted Arthur If you know anything of him Harriet except that he came from Venice which we all know tell it to mister Clennam freely I know nothing more about him said the girl Are you satisfied Miss Wade inquired of Arthur He had no reason to disbelieve them the girl s manner being so natural as to be almost convincing if he had had any previous doubts He replied I must seek for intelligence elsewhere He was not going in the same breath but he had risen before the girl entered and she evidently thought he was She looked quickly at him and said Are they well sir Who She stopped herself in saying what would have been all of them glanced at Miss Wade and said mister and missus Meagles They were when I last heard of them They are not at home By the way let me ask you Is it true that you were seen there Where Where does any one say I was seen returned the girl sullenly casting down her eyes Looking in at the garden gate of the cottage No said Miss Wade She has never been near it You are wrong then said the girl I went down there the last time we were in London I went one afternoon when you left me alone And I did look in You poor spirited girl returned Miss Wade with infinite contempt does all our companionship do all our conversations do all your old complainings tell for so little as that There was no harm in looking in at the gate for an instant said the girl I saw by the windows that the family were not there Why should you go near the place Because I wanted to see it Because I felt that I should like to look at it again As each of the two handsome faces looked at the other Clennam felt how each of the two natures must be constantly tearing the other to pieces Oh said Miss Wade coldly subduing and removing her glance if you had any desire to see the place where you led the life from which I rescued you because you had found out what it was that is another thing But is that your truth to me Is that your fidelity to me Is that the common cause I make with you You are not worth the confidence I have placed in you You are not worth the favour I have shown you You are no higher than a spaniel and had better go back to the people who did worse than whip you If you speak so of them with any one else by to hear you ll provoke me to take their part said the girl Go back to them Miss Wade retorted Go back to them You know very well retorted Harriet in her turn that I won t go back to them You know very well that I have thrown them off and never can never shall never will go back to them Let them alone then Miss Wade You prefer their plenty to your less fat living here she rejoined You exalt them and slight me What else should I have expected I ought to have known it It s not so said the girl flushing high and you don t say what you mean I know what you mean You are reproaching me underhanded with having nobody but you to look to And because I have nobody but you to look to you think you are to make me do or not do everything you please and are to put any affront upon me You are as bad as they were every bit But I will not be quite tamed and made submissive I will say again that I went to look at the house because I had often thought that I should like to see it once more I will ask again how they are because I once liked them and at times thought they were kind to me Hereupon Clennam said that he was sure they would still receive her kindly if she should ever desire to return Never said the girl passionately I shall never do that Nobody knows that better than Miss Wade though she taunts me because she has made me her dependent And I know I am so and I know she is overjoyed when she can bring it to my mind A good pretence said Miss Wade with no less anger haughtiness and bitterness but too threadbare to cover what I plainly see in this My poverty will not bear competition with their money Better go back at once better go back at once and have done with it Arthur Clennam looked at them standing a little distance asunder in the dull confined room each proudly cherishing her own anger each with a fixed determination torturing her own breast and torturing the other s He said a word or two of leave taking but Miss Wade barely inclined her head and Harriet with the assumed humiliation of an abject dependent and serf but not without defiance for all that made as if she were too low to notice or to be noticed He came down the dark winding stairs into the yard with an increased sense upon him of the gloom of the wall that was dead and of the shrubs that were dead and of the fountain that was dry and of the statue that was gone Pondering much on what he had seen and heard in that house as well as on the failure of all his efforts to trace the suspicious character who was lost he returned to London and to England by the packet that had taken him over On the way he unfolded the sheets of paper and read in them what is reproduced in the next chapter CHAPTER twenty one The History of a Self Tormentor I have the misfortune of not being a fool From a very early age I have detected what those about me thought they hid from me If I could have been habitually imposed upon instead of habitually discerning the truth I might have lived as smoothly as most fools do My childhood was passed with a grandmother that is to say with a lady who represented that relative to me and who took that title on herself She had no claim to it but I being to that extent a little fool had no suspicion of her She had some children of her own family in her house and some children of other people All girls ten in number including me We all lived together and were educated together I must have been about twelve years old when I began to see how determinedly those girls patronised me I was told I was an orphan There was no other orphan among us and I perceived here was the first disadvantage of not being a fool that they conciliated me in an insolent pity and in a sense of superiority I did not set this down as a discovery rashly I tried them often I could hardly make them quarrel with me When I succeeded with any of them they were sure to come after an hour or two and begin a reconciliation I tried them over and over again and I never knew them wait for me to begin They were always forgiving me in their vanity and condescension Little images of grown people One of them was my chosen friend I loved that stupid mite in a passionate way that she could no more deserve than I can remember without feeling ashamed of though I was but a child She had what they called an amiable temper an affectionate temper She could distribute and did distribute pretty looks and smiles to every one among them I believe there was not a soul in the place except myself who knew that she did it purposely to wound and gall me Nevertheless I so loved that unworthy girl that my life was made stormy by my fondness for her I was constantly lectured and disgraced for what was called trying her in other words charging her with her little perfidy and throwing her into tears by showing her that I read her heart However I loved her faithfully and one time I went home with her for the holidays She was worse at home than she had been at school She had a crowd of cousins and acquaintances and we had dances at her house and went out to dances at other houses and both at home and out she tormented my love beyond endurance Her plan was to make them all fond of her and so drive me wild with jealousy To be familiar and endearing with them all and so make me mad with envying them When we were left alone in our bedroom at night I would reproach her with my perfect knowledge of her baseness and then she would cry and cry and say I was cruel and then I would hold her in my arms till morning loving her as much as ever and often feeling as if rather than suffer so I could so hold her in my arms and plunge to the bottom of a river where I would still hold her after we were both dead It came to an end and I was relieved In the family there was an aunt who was not fond of me I doubt if any of the family liked me much but I never wanted them to like me being altogether bound up in the one girl The aunt was a young woman and she had a serious way with her eyes of watching me She was an audacious woman and openly looked compassionately at me After one of the nights that I have spoken of I came down into a greenhouse before breakfast Charlotte the name of my false young friend had gone down before me and I heard this aunt speaking to her about me as I entered I stopped where I was among the leaves and listened The aunt said Charlotte Miss Wade is wearing you to death and this must not continue I repeat the very words I heard Now what did she answer Did she say It is I who am wearing her to death I who am keeping her on a rack and am the executioner yet she tells me every night that she loves me devotedly though she knows what I make her undergo No my first memorable experience was true to what I knew her to be and to all my experience She began sobbing and weeping to secure the aunt s sympathy to herself and said Dear aunt she has an unhappy temper other girls at school besides I try hard to make it better we all try hard Upon that the aunt fondled her as if she had said something noble instead of despicable and false and kept up the infamous pretence by replying But there are reasonable limits my dear love to everything and I see that this poor miserable girl causes you more constant and useless distress than even so good an effort justifies The poor miserable girl came out of her concealment as you may be prepared to hear and said Send me home I never said another word to either of them or to any of them but Send me home or I will walk home alone night and day When I got home I told my supposed grandmother that unless I was sent away to finish my education somewhere else before that girl came back or before any one of them came back I would burn my sight away by throwing myself into the fire rather than I would endure to look at their plotting faces I went among young women next and I found them no better Fair words and fair pretences but I penetrated below those assertions of themselves and depreciations of me and they were no better Before I left them I learned that I had no grandmother and no recognised relation I carried the light of that information both into my past and into my future It showed me many new occasions on which people triumphed over me when they made a pretence of treating me with consideration or doing me a service A man of business had a small property in trust for me I was to be a governess I became a governess and went into the family of a poor nobleman where there were two daughters little children but the parents wished them to grow up if possible under one instructress The mother was young and pretty From the first she made a show of behaving to me with great delicacy I kept my resentment to myself but I knew very well that it was her way of petting the knowledge that she was my Mistress and might have behaved differently to her servant if it had been her fancy I say I did not resent it nor did I but I showed her by not gratifying her that I understood her When she pressed me to take wine I took water If there happened to be anything choice at table she always sent it to me but I always declined it and ate of the rejected dishes These disappointments of her patronage were a sharp retort and made me feel independent I liked the children They were timid but on the whole disposed to attach themselves to me There was a nurse however in the house a rosy faced woman always making an obtrusive pretence of being gay and good humoured who had nursed them both and who had secured their affections before I saw them I could almost have settled down to my fate but for this woman Her artful devices for keeping herself before the children in constant competition with me might have blinded many in my place but I saw through them from the first On the pretext of arranging my rooms and waiting on me and taking care of my wardrobe all of which she did busily she was never absent The most crafty of her many subtleties was her feint of seeking to make the children fonder of me She would lead them to me and coax them to me Come to good Miss Wade come to dear Miss Wade come to pretty Miss Wade She loves you very much Miss Wade is a clever lady who has read heaps of books and can tell you far better and more interesting stories than I know Come and hear Miss Wade How could I engage their attentions when my heart was burning against these ignorant designs How could I wonder when I saw their innocent faces shrinking away and their arms twining round her neck instead of mine Then she would look up at me shaking their curls from her face and say They ll come round soon Miss Wade they re very simple and loving ma am don t be at all cast down about it ma am exulting over me There was another thing the woman did At times when she saw that she had safely plunged me into a black despondent brooding by these means she would call the attention of the children to it and would show them the difference between herself and me Hush Poor Miss Wade is not well Don t make a noise my dears her head aches Come and comfort her Come and ask her if she is better come and ask her to lie down I hope you have nothing on your mind ma am Don t take on ma am and be sorry It became intolerable Her ladyship my Mistress coming in one day when I was alone and at the height of feeling that I could support it no longer I told her I must go I could not bear the presence of that woman Dawes Miss Wade Poor Dawes is devoted to you would do anything for you I knew beforehand she would say so I was quite prepared for it I only answered it was not for me to contradict my Mistress I must go I hope Miss Wade she returned instantly assuming the tone of superiority she had always so thinly concealed that nothing I have ever said or done since we have been together has justified your use of that disagreeable word Mistress It must have been wholly inadvertent on my part Pray tell me what it is I replied that I had no complaint to make either of my Mistress or to my Mistress but I must go She hesitated a moment and then sat down beside me and laid her hand on mine As if that honour would obliterate any remembrance Miss Wade I fear you are unhappy through causes over which I have no influence I smiled thinking of the experience the word awakened and said I have an unhappy temper I suppose I did not say that It is an easy way of accounting for anything said I It may be but I did not say so What I wish to approach is something very different My husband and I have exchanged some remarks upon the subject when we have observed with pain that you have not been easy with us Easy Oh You are such great people my lady said I I am unfortunate in using a word which may convey a meaning and evidently does quite opposite to my intention She had not expected my reply and it shamed her I only mean not happy with us It is a difficult topic to enter on but from one young woman to another perhaps in short we have been apprehensive that you may allow some family circumstances of which no one can be more innocent than yourself to prey upon your spirits If so let us entreat you not to make them a cause of grief My husband himself as is well known formerly had a very dear sister who was not in law his sister but who was universally beloved and respected I saw directly that they had taken me in for the sake of the dead woman whoever she was and to have that boast of me and advantage of me I saw in the nurse s knowledge of it an encouragement to goad me as she had done and I saw in the children s shrinking away a vague impression that I was not like other people I left that house that night After one or two short and very similar experiences which are not to the present purpose I entered another family where I had but one pupil a girl of fifteen who was the only daughter The parents here were elderly people people of station and rich A nephew whom they had brought up was a frequent visitor at the house among many other visitors and he began to pay me attention I was resolute in repulsing him for I had determined when I went there that no one should pity me or condescend to me But he wrote me a letter It led to our being engaged to be married He was a year younger than I and young looking even when that allowance was made He was on absence from India where he had a post that was soon to grow into a very good one In six months we were to be married and were to go to India I was to stay in the house and was to be married from the house Nobody objected to any part of the plan I cannot avoid saying he admired me but if I could I would Vanity has nothing to do with the declaration for his admiration worried me He took no pains to hide it and caused me to feel among the rich people as if he had bought me for my looks and made a show of his purchase to justify himself They appraised me in their own minds I saw and were curious to ascertain what my full value was I resolved that they should not know I was immovable and silent before them and would have suffered any one of them to kill me sooner than I would have laid myself out to bespeak their approval He told me I did not do myself justice I told him I did and it was because I did and meant to do so to the last that I would not stoop to propitiate any of them He was concerned and even shocked when I added that I wished he would not parade his attachment before them but he said he would sacrifice even the honest impulses of his affection to my peace Under that pretence he began to retort upon me By the hour together he would keep at a distance from me talking to any one rather than to me I have sat alone and unnoticed half an evening while he conversed with his young cousin my pupil I have seen all the while in people s eyes that they thought the two looked nearer on an equality than he and I I have sat divining their thoughts until I have felt that his young appearance made me ridiculous and have raged against myself for ever loving him For I did love him once Undeserving as he was and little as he thought of all these agonies that it cost me agonies which should have made him wholly and gratefully mine to his life s end I loved him I bore with his cousin s praising him to my face and with her pretending to think that it pleased me but full well knowing that it rankled in my breast for his sake While I have sat in his presence recalling all my slights and wrongs and deliberating whether I should not fly from the house at once and never see him again I have loved him His aunt my Mistress you will please to remember deliberately wilfully added to my trials and vexations It was her delight to expatiate on the style in which we were to live in India and on the establishment we should keep and the company we should entertain when he got his advancement My pride rose against this barefaced way of pointing out the contrast my married life was to present to my then dependent and inferior position I suppressed my indignation but I showed her that her intention was not lost upon me and I repaid her annoyance by affecting humility What she described would surely be a great deal too much honour for me I would tell her I was afraid I might not be able to support so great a change Think of a mere governess her daughter s governess coming to that high distinction It made her uneasy and made them all uneasy when I answered in this way They knew that I fully understood her It was at the time when my troubles were at their highest and when I was most incensed against my lover for his ingratitude in caring as little as he did for the innumerable distresses and mortifications I underwent on his account that your dear friend mister Gowan appeared at the house He had been intimate there for a long time but had been abroad He understood the state of things at a glance and he understood me He was the first person I had ever seen in my life who had understood me He was not in the house three times before I knew that he accompanied every movement of my mind In his coldly easy way with all of them and with me and with the whole subject I saw it clearly In his light protestations of admiration of my future husband in his enthusiasm regarding our engagement and our prospects in his hopeful congratulations on our future wealth and his despondent references to his own poverty all equally hollow and jesting and full of mockery I saw it clearly He made me feel more and more resentful and more and more contemptible by always presenting to me everything that surrounded me with some new hateful light upon it while he pretended to exhibit it in its best aspect for my admiration and his own He was like the dressed up Death in the Dutch series whatever figure he took upon his arm whether it was youth or age beauty or ugliness whether he danced with it sang with it played with it or prayed with it he made it ghastly You will understand then that when your dear friend complimented me he really condoled with me that when he soothed me under my vexations he laid bare every smarting wound I had that when he declared my faithful swain to be the most loving young fellow in the world with the tenderest heart that ever beat he touched my old misgiving that I was made ridiculous These were not great services you may say They were acceptable to me because they echoed my own mind and confirmed my own knowledge I soon began to like the society of your dear friend better than any other When I perceived which I did almost as soon that jealousy was growing out of this I liked this society still better Had I not been subject to jealousy and were the endurances to be all mine No Let him know what it was I was delighted that he should know it I was delighted that he should feel keenly and I hoped he did More than that He was tame in comparison with mister Gowan who knew how to address me on equal terms and how to anatomise the wretched people around us This went on until the aunt my Mistress took it upon herself to speak to me It was scarcely worth alluding to she knew I meant nothing but she suggested from herself knowing it was only necessary to suggest that it might be better if I were a little less companionable with mister Gowan I asked her how she could answer for what I meant She could always answer she replied for my meaning nothing wrong I thanked her but said I would prefer to answer for myself and to myself Her other servants would probably be grateful for good characters but I wanted none Other conversation followed and induced me to ask her how she knew that it was only necessary for her to make a suggestion to me to have it obeyed Did she presume on my birth or on my hire I was not bought body and soul She seemed to think that her distinguished nephew had gone into a slave market and purchased a wife It would probably have come sooner or later to the end to which it did come but she brought it to its issue at once She told me with assumed commiseration that I had an unhappy temper On this repetition of the old wicked injury I withheld no longer but exposed to her all I had known of her and seen in her and all I had undergone within myself since I had occupied the despicable position of being engaged to her nephew I told her that mister Gowan was the only relief I had had in my degradation that I had borne it too long and that I shook it off too late but that I would see none of them more And I never did Your dear friend followed me to my retreat and was very droll on the severance of the connection though he was sorry too for the excellent people in their way the best he had ever met and deplored the necessity of breaking mere house flies on the wheel He protested before long and far more truly than I then supposed that he was not worth acceptance by a woman of such endowments and such power of character but well well Your dear friend amused me and amused himself as long as it suited his inclinations and then reminded me that we were both people of the world that we both understood mankind that we both knew there was no such thing as romance that we were both prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense and that we both foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth So he said and I did not contradict him It was not very long before I found that he was courting his present wife and that she had been taken away to be out of his reach I hated her then quite as much as I hate her now and naturally therefore could desire nothing better than that she should marry him But I was restlessly curious to look at her so curious that I felt it to be one of the few sources of entertainment left to me I travelled a little travelled until I found myself in her society and in yours Your dear friend I think was not known to you then and had not given you any of those signal marks of his friendship which he has bestowed upon you In that company I found a girl in various circumstances of whose position there was a singular likeness to my own and in whose character I was interested and pleased to see much of the rising against swollen patronage and selfishness calling themselves kindness protection benevolence and other fine names which I have described as inherent in my nature I often heard it said too that she had an unhappy temper Well understanding what was meant by the convenient phrase and wanting a companion with a knowledge of what I knew I thought I would try to release the girl from her bondage and sense of injustice I have no occasion to relate that I succeeded We have been together ever since sharing my small means CHAPTER twenty two Who passes by this Road so late Arthur Clennam had made his unavailing expedition to Calais in the midst of a great pressure of business A certain barbaric Power with valuable possessions on the map of the world had occasion for the services of one or two engineers quick in invention and determined in execution practical men who could make the men and means their ingenuity perceived to be wanted out of the best materials they could find at hand and who were as bold and fertile in the adaptation of such materials to their purpose as in the conception of their purpose itself This Power being a barbaric one had no idea of stowing away a great national object in a Circumlocution Office as strong wine is hidden from the light in a cellar until its fire and youth are gone and the labourers who worked in the vineyard and pressed the grapes are dust With characteristic ignorance it acted on the most decided and energetic notions of How to do it and never showed the least respect for or gave any quarter to the great political science How not to do it Indeed it had a barbarous way of striking the latter art and mystery dead in the person of any enlightened subject who practised it Accordingly the men who were wanted were sought out and found which was in itself a most uncivilised and irregular way of proceeding Being found they were treated with great confidence and honour which again showed dense political ignorance and were invited to come at once and do what they had to do In short they were regarded as men who meant to do it engaging with other men who meant it to be done Daniel Doyce was one of the chosen There was no foreseeing at that time whether he would be absent months or years The preparations for his departure and the conscientious arrangement for him of all the details and results of their joint business had necessitated labour within a short compass of time which had occupied Clennam day and night He had slipped across the water in his first leisure and had slipped as quickly back again for his farewell interview with Doyce Him Arthur now showed with pains and care the state of their gains and losses responsibilities and prospects Daniel went through it all in his patient manner and admired it all exceedingly He audited the accounts as if they were a far more ingenious piece of mechanism than he had ever constructed and afterwards stood looking at them weighing his hat over his head by the brims as if he were absorbed in the contemplation of some wonderful engine It s all beautiful Clennam in its regularity and order Nothing can be plainer Nothing can be better I am glad you approve Doyce Now as to the management of your capital while you are away and as to the conversion of so much of it as the business may need from time to time His partner stopped him As to that and as to everything else of that kind all rests with you You will continue in all such matters to act for both of us as you have done hitherto and to lighten my mind of a load it is much relieved from Though as I often tell you returned Clennam you unreasonably depreciate your business qualities Perhaps so said Doyce smiling And perhaps not Anyhow I have a calling that I have studied more than such matters and that I am better fitted for I have perfect confidence in my partner and I am satisfied that he will do what is best If I have a prejudice connected with money and money figures continued Doyce laying that plastic workman s thumb of his on the lapel of his partner s coat it is against speculating I don t think I have any other I dare say I entertain that prejudice only because I have never given my mind fully to the subject But you shouldn t call it a prejudice said Clennam My dear Doyce it is the soundest sense I am glad you think so returned Doyce with his grey eye looking kind and bright It so happens said Clennam that just now not half an hour before you came down I was saying the same thing to Pancks who looked in here We both agreed that to travel out of safe investments is one of the most dangerous as it is one of the most common of those follies which often deserve the name of vices Pancks said Doyce tilting up his hat at the back and nodding with an air of confidence Aye aye aye That s a cautious fellow He is a very cautious fellow indeed returned Arthur Quite a specimen of caution They both appeared to derive a larger amount of satisfaction from the cautious character of mister Pancks than was quite intelligible judged by the surface of their conversation And now said Daniel looking at his watch as time and tide wait for no man my trusty partner and as I am ready for starting bag and baggage at the gate below let me say a last word I want you to grant a request of mine Any request you can make Except Clennam was quick with his exception for his partner s face was quick in suggesting it except that I will abandon your invention That s the request and you know it is said Doyce I say No then I say positively No Now that I have begun I will have some definite reason some responsible statement something in the nature of a real answer from those people You will not returned Doyce shaking his head Take my word for it you never will At least I ll try said Clennam It will do me no harm to try I am not certain of that rejoined Doyce laying his hand persuasively on his shoulder It has done me harm my friend It has aged me tired me vexed me disappointed me It does no man any good to have his patience worn out and to think himself ill used I fancy even already that unavailing attendance on delays and evasions has made you something less elastic than you used to be Private anxieties may have done that for the moment said Clennam but not official harrying Not yet I am not hurt yet Then you won t grant my request Decidedly No said Clennam I should be ashamed if I submitted to be so soon driven out of the field where a much older and a much more sensitively interested man contended with fortitude so long As there was no moving him Daniel Doyce returned the grasp of his hand and casting a farewell look round the counting house went down stairs with him Doyce was to go to Southampton to join the small staff of his fellow travellers and a coach was at the gate well furnished and packed and ready to take him there The workmen were at the gate to see him off and were mightily proud of him Good luck to you mister Doyce said one of the number Wherever you go they ll find as they ve got a man among em a man as knows his tools and as his tools knows a man as is willing and a man as is able and if that s not a man where is a man This oration from a gruff volunteer in the back ground not previously suspected of any powers in that way was received with three loud cheers and the speaker became a distinguished character for ever afterwards In the midst of the three loud cheers Daniel gave them all a hearty Good Bye Men and the coach disappeared from sight as if the concussion of the air had blown it out of Bleeding Heart Yard mister Baptist as a grateful little fellow in a position of trust was among the workmen and had done as much towards the cheering as a mere foreigner could In truth no men on earth can cheer like Englishmen who do so rally one another s blood and spirit when they cheer in earnest that the stir is like the rush of their whole history with all its standards waving at once from Saxon Alfred s downwards mister Baptist had been in a manner whirled away before the onset and was taking his breath in quite a scared condition when Clennam beckoned him to follow up stairs and return the books and papers to their places In the lull consequent on the departure in that first vacuity which ensues on every separation foreshadowing the great separation that is always overhanging all mankind Arthur stood at his desk looking dreamily out at a gleam of sun But his liberated attention soon reverted to the theme that was foremost in his thoughts and began for the hundredth time to dwell upon every circumstance that had impressed itself upon his mind on the mysterious night when he had seen the man at his mother s Again the man jostled him in the crooked street again he followed the man and lost him again he came upon the man in the court yard looking at the house again he followed the man and stood beside him on the door steps Who passes by this road so late Compagnon de la Majolaine Who passes by this road so late Always gay It was not the first time by many that he had recalled the song of the child s game of which the fellow had hummed a verse while they stood side by side but he was so unconscious of having repeated it audibly that he started to hear the next verse Of all the king s knights tis the flower Compagnon de la Majolaine Of all the king s knights tis the flower Always gay Cavalletto had deferentially suggested the words and tune supposing him to have stopped short for want of more Ah You know the song Cavalletto By Bacchus yes sir They all know it in France I have heard it many times sung by the little children The last time when it I have heard said mister Baptist formerly Cavalletto who usually went back to his native construction of sentences when his memory went near home is from a sweet little voice A little voice very pretty very innocent Altro The last time I heard it returned Arthur was in a voice quite the reverse of pretty and quite the reverse of innocent He said it more to himself than to his companion and added to himself repeating the man s next words Death of my life sir it s my character to be impatient EH cried Cavalletto astounded and with all his colour gone in a moment What is the matter Sir You know where I have heard that song the last time With his rapid native action his hands made the outline of a high hook nose pushed his eyes near together dishevelled his hair puffed out his upper lip to represent a thick moustache and threw the heavy end of an ideal cloak over his shoulder While doing this with a swiftness incredible to one who has not watched an Italian peasant he indicated a very remarkable and sinister smile The whole change passed over him like a flash of light and he stood in the same instant pale and astonished before his patron In the name of Fate and wonder said Clennam what do you mean Do you know a man of the name of Blandois No said mister Baptist shaking his head You have just now described a man who was by when you heard that song have you not Yes said mister Baptist nodding fifty times And was he not called Blandois No said mister Baptist Altro Altro Altro Altro He could not reject the name sufficiently with his head and his right forefinger going at once Stay cried Clennam spreading out the handbill on his desk Was this the man You can understand what I read aloud Altogether Perfectly But look at it too Come here and look over me while I read mister Baptist approached followed every word with his quick eyes saw and heard it all out with the greatest impatience then clapped his two hands flat upon the bill as if he had fiercely caught some noxious creature and cried looking eagerly at Clennam It is the man Behold him This is of far greater moment to me said Clennam in great agitation than you can imagine Tell me where you knew the man mister Baptist releasing the paper very slowly and with much discomfiture and drawing himself back two or three paces and making as though he dusted his hands returned very much against his will At Marsiglia Marseilles What was he A prisoner and Altro I believe yes an mister Baptist crept closer again to whisper it Assassin Clennam fell back as if the word had struck him a blow so terrible did it make his mother s communication with the man appear Cavalletto dropped on one knee and implored him with a redundancy of gesticulation to hear what had brought himself into such foul company He told with perfect truth how it had come of a little contraband trading and how he had in time been released from prison and how he had gone away from those antecedents How at the house of entertainment called the Break of Day at Chalons on the Saone he had been awakened in his bed at night by the same assassin then assuming the name of Lagnier though his name had formerly been Rigaud how the assassin had proposed that they should join their fortunes together how he held the assassin in such dread and aversion that he had fled from him at daylight and how he had ever since been haunted by the fear of seeing the assassin again and being claimed by him as an acquaintance When he had related this with an emphasis and poise on the word assassin peculiarly belonging to his own language and which did not serve to render it less terrible to Clennam he suddenly sprang to his feet pounced upon the bill again and with a vehemence that would have been absolute madness in any man of Northern origin cried Behold the same assassin Here he is In his passionate raptures he at first forgot the fact that he had lately seen the assassin in London On his remembering it it suggested hope to Clennam that the recognition might be of later date than the night of the visit at his mother s but Cavalletto was too exact and clear about time and place to leave any opening for doubt that it had preceded that occasion Listen said Arthur very seriously This man as we have read here has wholly disappeared Of it I am well content said Cavalletto raising his eyes piously A thousand thanks to Heaven Accursed assassin Not so returned Clennam for until something more is heard of him I can never know an hour s peace Enough Benefactor that is quite another thing A million of excuses Now Cavalletto said Clennam gently turning him by the arm so that they looked into each other s eyes I am certain that for the little I have been able to do for you you are the most sincerely grateful of men I swear it cried the other I know it If you could find this man or discover what has become of him or gain any later intelligence whatever of him you would render me a service above any other service I could receive in the world and would make me with far greater reason as grateful to you as you are to me I know not where to look cried the little man kissing Arthur s hand in a transport I know not where to begin I know not where to go But courage Enough It matters not I go in this instant of time Not a word to any one but me Cavalletto Al tro cried Cavalletto And was gone with great speed CHAPTER twenty three Mistress Affery makes a Conditional Promise respecting her Dreams Left alone with the expressive looks and gestures of mister Baptist otherwise Giovanni Baptista Cavalletto vividly before him Clennam entered on a weary day It was in vain that he tried to control his attention by directing it to any business occupation or train of thought it rode at anchor by the haunting topic and would hold to no other idea As though a criminal should be chained in a stationary boat on a deep clear river condemned whatever countless leagues of water flowed past him always to see the body of the fellow creature he had drowned lying at the bottom immovable and unchangeable except as the eddies made it broad or long now expanding now contracting its terrible lineaments so Arthur below the shifting current of transparent thoughts and fancies which were gone and succeeded by others as soon as come saw steady and dark and not to be stirred from its place the one subject that he endeavoured with all his might to rid himself of and that he could not fly from The assurance he now had that Blandois whatever his right name was one of the worst of characters greatly augmented the burden of his anxieties Though the disappearance should be accounted for to morrow the fact that his mother had been in communication with such a man would remain unalterable That the communication had been of a secret kind and that she had been submissive to him and afraid of him he hoped might be known to no one beyond himself yet knowing it how could he separate it from his old vague fears and how believe that there was nothing evil in such relations Her resolution not to enter on the question with him and his knowledge of her indomitable character enhanced his sense of helplessness It was like the oppression of a dream to believe that shame and exposure were impending over her and his father s memory and to be shut out as by a brazen wall from the possibility of coming to their aid The purpose he had brought home to his native country and had ever since kept in view was with her greatest determination defeated by his mother herself at the time of all others when he feared that it pressed most His advice energy activity money credit all his resources whatsoever were all made useless If she had been possessed of the old fabled influence and had turned those who looked upon her into stone she could not have rendered him more completely powerless so it seemed to him in his distress of mind than she did when she turned her unyielding face to his in her gloomy room But the light of that day s discovery shining on these considerations roused him to take a more decided course of action Confident in the rectitude of his purpose and impelled by a sense of overhanging danger closing in around he resolved if his mother would still admit of no approach to make a desperate appeal to Affery If she could be brought to become communicative and to do what lay in her to break the spell of secrecy that enshrouded the house he might shake off the paralysis of which every hour that passed over his head made him more acutely sensible This was the result of his day s anxiety and this was the decision he put in practice when the day closed in His first disappointment on arriving at the house was to find the door open and mister Flintwinch smoking a pipe on the steps If circumstances had been commonly favourable Mistress Affery would have opened the door to his knock Circumstances being uncommonly unfavourable the door stood open and mister Flintwinch was smoking his pipe on the steps Good evening said Arthur Good evening said mister Flintwinch The smoke came crookedly out of mister Flintwinch s mouth as if it circulated through the whole of his wry figure and came back by his wry throat before coming forth to mingle with the smoke from the crooked chimneys and the mists from the crooked river Have you any news said Arthur We have no news said Jeremiah I mean of the foreign man Arthur explained I mean of the foreign man said Jeremiah He looked so grim as he stood askew with the knot of his cravat under his ear that the thought passed into Clennam s mind and not for the first time by many could Flintwinch for a purpose of his own have got rid of Blandois Could it have been his secret and his safety that were at issue He was small and bent and perhaps not actively strong yet he was as tough as an old yew tree and as crusty as an old jackdaw Such a man coming behind a much younger and more vigorous man and having the will to put an end to him and no relenting might do it pretty surely in that solitary place at a late hour While in the morbid condition of his thoughts these thoughts drifted over the main one that was always in Clennam s mind mister Flintwinch regarding the opposite house over the gateway with his neck twisted and one eye shut up stood smoking with a vicious expression upon him more as if he were trying to bite off the stem of his pipe than as if he were enjoying it Yet he was enjoying it in his own way You ll be able to take my likeness the next time you call Arthur I should think said mister Flintwinch drily as he stooped to knock the ashes out Rather conscious and confused Arthur asked his pardon if he had stared at him unpolitely But my mind runs so much upon this matter he said that I lose myself Hah Yet I don t see returned mister Flintwinch quite at his leisure why it should trouble YOU Arthur No No said mister Flintwinch very shortly and decidedly much as if he were of the canine race and snapped at Arthur s hand Is it nothing to see those placards about Is it nothing to me to see my mother s name and residence hawked up and down in such an association I don t see returned mister Flintwinch scraping his horny cheek that it need signify much to you But I ll tell you what I do see Arthur glancing up at the windows I see the light of fire and candle in your mother s room And what has that to do with it Why sir I read by it said mister Flintwinch screwing himself at him that if it s advisable as the proverb says it is to let sleeping dogs lie it s just as advisable perhaps to let missing dogs lie Let em be They generally turn up soon enough mister Flintwinch turned short round when he had made this remark and went into the dark hall Clennam stood there following him with his eyes as he dipped for a light in the phosphorus box in the little room at the side got one after three or four dips and lighted the dim lamp against the wall All the while Clennam was pursuing the probabilities rather as if they were being shown to him by an invisible hand than as if he himself were conjuring them up of mister Flintwinch s ways and means of doing that darker deed and removing its traces by any of the black avenues of shadow that lay around them Now sir said the testy Jeremiah will it be agreeable to walk up stairs My mother is alone I suppose Not alone said mister Flintwinch mister Casby and his daughter are with her They came in while I was smoking and I stayed behind to have my smoke out This was the second disappointment Arthur made no remark upon it and repaired to his mother s room where mister Casby and Flora had been taking tea anchovy paste and hot buttered toast The relics of those delicacies were not yet removed either from the table or from the scorched countenance of Affery who with the kitchen toasting fork still in her hand looked like a sort of allegorical personage except that she had a considerable advantage over the general run of such personages in point of significant emblematical purpose Flora had spread her bonnet and shawl upon the bed with a care indicative of an intention to stay some time mister Casby too was beaming near the hob with his benevolent knobs shining as if the warm butter of the toast were exuding through the patriarchal skull and with his face as ruddy as if the colouring matter of the anchovy paste were mantling in the patriarchal visage Seeing this as he exchanged the usual salutations Clennam decided to speak to his mother without postponement It had long been customary as she never changed her room for those who had anything to say to her apart to wheel her to her desk where she sat usually with the back of her chair turned towards the rest of the room and the person who talked with her seated in a corner on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose Except that it was long since the mother and son had spoken together without the intervention of a third person it was an ordinary matter of course within the experience of visitors for missus Clennam to be asked with a word of apology for the interruption if she could be spoken with on a matter of business and on her replying in the affirmative to be wheeled into the position described Therefore when Arthur now made such an apology and such a request and moved her to her desk and seated himself on the stool missus Finching merely began to talk louder and faster as a delicate hint that she could overhear nothing and mister Casby stroked his long white locks with sleepy calmness Mother I have heard something to day which I feel persuaded you don t know and which I think you should know of the antecedents of that man I saw here I know nothing of the antecedents of the man you saw here Arthur She spoke aloud He had lowered his own voice but she rejected that advance towards confidence as she rejected every other and spoke in her usual key and in her usual stern voice I have received it on no circuitous information it has come to me direct She asked him exactly as before if he were there to tell her what it was I thought it right that you should know it And what is it He has been a prisoner in a French gaol She answered with composure I should think that very likely But in a gaol for criminals mother On an accusation of murder She started at the word and her looks expressed her natural horror Yet she still spoke aloud when she demanded Who told you so A man who was his fellow prisoner That man s antecedents I suppose were not known to you before he told you No Though the man himself was Yes My case and Flintwinch s in respect of this other man I dare say the resemblance is not so exact though as that your informant became known to you through a letter from a correspondent with whom he had deposited money How does that part of the parallel stand Arthur had no choice but to say that his informant had not become known to him through the agency of any such credentials or indeed of any credentials at all missus Clennam s attentive frown expanded by degrees into a severe look of triumph and she retorted with emphasis Take care how you judge others then I say to you Arthur for your good take care how you judge Her emphasis had been derived from her eyes quite as much as from the stress she laid upon her words She continued to look at him and if when he entered the house he had had any latent hope of prevailing in the least with her she now looked it out of his heart Mother shall I do nothing to assist you Nothing Will you entrust me with no confidence no charge no explanation Will you take no counsel with me Will you not let me come near you How can you ask me You separated yourself from my affairs It was not my act it was yours How can you consistently ask me such a question You know that you left me to Flintwinch and that he occupies your place Glancing at Jeremiah Clennam saw in his very gaiters that his attention was closely directed to them though he stood leaning against the wall scraping his jaw and pretended to listen to Flora as she held forth in a most distracting manner on a chaos of subjects in which mackerel and mister F s Aunt in a swing had become entangled with cockchafers and the wine trade A prisoner in a French gaol on an accusation of murder repeated missus Clennam steadily going over what her son had said That is all you know of him from the fellow prisoner In substance all And was the fellow prisoner his accomplice and a murderer too But of course he gives a better account of himself than of his friend it is needless to ask This will supply the rest of them here with something new to talk about Casby Arthur tells me Stay mother Stay stay He interrupted her hastily for it had not entered his imagination that she would openly proclaim what he had told her What now she said with displeasure What more I beg you to excuse me mister Casby and you too missus Finching for one other moment with my mother He had laid his hand upon her chair or she would otherwise have wheeled it round with the touch of her foot upon the ground They were still face to face She looked at him as he ran over the possibilities of some result he had not intended and could not foresee being influenced by Cavalletto s disclosure becoming a matter of notoriety and hurriedly arrived at the conclusion that it had best not be talked about though perhaps he was guided by no more distinct reason than that he had taken it for granted that his mother would reserve it to herself and her partner What now she said again impatiently What is it I did not mean mother that you should repeat what I have communicated I think you had better not repeat it Do you make that a condition with me Well Yes Observe then It is you who make this a secret said she holding up her hand and not I It is you Arthur who bring here doubts and suspicions and entreaties for explanations and it is you Arthur who bring secrets here What is it to me do you think where the man has been or what he has been What can it be to me The whole world may know it if they care to know it it is nothing to me Now let me go He yielded to her imperious but elated look and turned her chair back to the place from which he had wheeled it In doing so he saw elation in the face of mister Flintwinch which most assuredly was not inspired by Flora This turning of his intelligence and of his whole attempt and design against himself did even more than his mother s fixedness and firmness to convince him that his efforts with her were idle Nothing remained but the appeal to his old friend Affery But even to get the very doubtful and preliminary stage of making the appeal seemed one of the least promising of human undertakings She was so completely under the thrall of the two clever ones was so systematically kept in sight by one or other of them and was so afraid to go about the house besides that every opportunity of speaking to her alone appeared to be forestalled Over and above that Mistress Affery by some means it was not very difficult to guess through the sharp arguments of her liege lord had acquired such a lively conviction of the hazard of saying anything under any circumstances that she had remained all this time in a corner guarding herself from approach with that symbolical instrument of hers so that when a word or two had been addressed to her by Flora or even by the bottle green patriarch himself she had warded off conversation with the toasting fork like a dumb woman After several abortive attempts to get Affery to look at him while she cleared the table and washed the tea service Arthur thought of an expedient which Flora might originate To whom he therefore whispered Could you say you would like to go through the house Now poor Flora being always in fluctuating expectation of the time when Clennam would renew his boyhood and be madly in love with her again received the whisper with the utmost delight not only as rendered precious by its mysterious character but as preparing the way for a tender interview in which he would declare the state of his affections She immediately began to work out the hint Ah dear me the poor old room said Flora glancing round looks just as ever missus Clennam I am touched to see except for being smokier which was to be expected with time and which we must all expect and reconcile ourselves to being whether we like it or not as I am sure I have had to do myself if not exactly smokier dreadfully stouter which is the same or worse to think of the days when papa used to bring me here the least of girls a perfect mass of chilblains to be stuck upon a chair with my feet on the rails and stare at Arthur pray excuse me mister Clennam the least of boys in the frightfullest of frills and jackets ere yet mister F appeared a misty shadow on the horizon paying attentions like the well known spectre of some place in Germany beginning with a B is a moral lesson inculcating that all the paths in life are similar to the paths down in the North of England where they get the coals and make the iron and things gravelled with ashes Having paid the tribute of a sigh to the instability of human existence Flora hurried on with her purpose Not that at any time she proceeded its worst enemy could have said it was a cheerful house for that it was never made to be but always highly impressive fond memory recalls an occasion in youth ere yet the judgment was mature when Arthur confirmed habit mister Clennam took me down into an unused kitchen eminent for mouldiness and proposed to secrete me there for life and feed me on what he could hide from his meals when he was not at home for the holidays and on dry bread in disgrace which at that halcyon period too frequently occurred would it be inconvenient or asking too much to beg to be permitted to revive those scenes and walk through the house missus Clennam who responded with a constrained grace to missus Finching s good nature in being there at all though her visit before Arthur s unexpected arrival was undoubtedly an act of pure good nature and no self gratification intimated that all the house was open to her Flora rose and looked to Arthur for his escort Certainly said he aloud and Affery will light us I dare say Affery was excusing herself with Don t ask nothing of me Arthur when mister Flintwinch stopped her with Why not Affery what s the matter with you woman Why not jade Thus expostulated with she came unwillingly out of her corner resigned the toasting fork into one of her husband s hands and took the candlestick he offered from the other Go before you fool said Jeremiah Are you going up or down missus Finching Flora answered Down Then go before and down you Affery said Jeremiah And do it properly or I ll come rolling down the banisters and tumbling over you Affery headed the exploring party Jeremiah closed it He had no intention of leaving them Clennam looking back and seeing him following three stairs behind in the coolest and most methodical manner exclaimed in a low voice Is there no getting rid of him Flora reassured his mind by replying promptly Why though not exactly proper Arthur and a thing I couldn t think of before a younger man or a stranger still I don t mind him if you so particularly wish it and provided you ll have the goodness not to take me too tight Wanting the heart to explain that this was not at all what he meant Arthur extended his supporting arm round Flora s figure Oh my goodness me said she You are very obedient indeed really and it s extremely honourable and gentlemanly in you I am sure but still at the same time if you would like to be a little tighter than that I shouldn t consider it intruding In this preposterous attitude unspeakably at variance with his anxious mind Clennam descended to the basement of the house finding that wherever it became darker than elsewhere Flora became heavier and that when the house was lightest she was too Returning from the dismal kitchen regions which were as dreary as they could be Mistress Affery passed with the light into his father s old room and then into the old dining room always passing on before like a phantom that was not to be overtaken and neither turning nor answering when he whispered Affery I want to speak to you In the dining room a sentimental desire came over Flora to look into the dragon closet which had so often swallowed Arthur in the days of his boyhood not improbably because as a very dark closet it was a likely place to be heavy in Arthur fast subsiding into despair had opened it when a knock was heard at the outer door Mistress Affery with a suppressed cry threw her apron over her head What You want another dose said mister Flintwinch You shall have it my woman you shall have a good one Oh You shall have a sneezer you shall have a teaser In the meantime is anybody going to the door said Arthur In the meantime I am going to the door sir returned the old man so savagely as to render it clear that in a choice of difficulties he felt he must go though he would have preferred not to go Stay here the while all Affery my woman move an inch or speak a word in your foolishness and I ll treble your dose The moment he was gone Arthur released missus Finching with some difficulty by reason of that lady misunderstanding his intentions and making arrangements with a view to tightening instead of slackening Affery speak to me now Don t touch me Arthur she cried shrinking from him Don t come near me He ll see you Jeremiah will Don t He can t see me returned Arthur suiting the action to the word if I blow the candle out He ll hear you cried Affery He can t hear me returned Arthur suiting the action to the words again if I draw you into this black closet and speak here Why do you hide your face Because I am afraid of seeing something You can t be afraid of seeing anything in this darkness Affery Yes I am Much more than if it was light Why are you afraid Because the house is full of mysteries and secrets because it s full of whisperings and counsellings because it s full of noises There never was such a house for noises I shall die of em if Jeremiah don t strangle me first As I expect he will I have never heard any noises here worth speaking of Ah But you would though if you lived in the house and was obliged to go about it as I am said Affery and you d feel that they was so well worth speaking of that you d feel you was nigh bursting through not being allowed to speak of em Here s Jeremiah You ll get me killed My good Affery I solemnly declare to you that I can see the light of the open door on the pavement of the hall and so could you if you would uncover your face and look I durstn t do it said Affery I durstn t never Arthur I m always blind folded when Jeremiah an t a looking and sometimes even when he is He cannot shut the door without my seeing him said Arthur You are as safe with me as if he was fifty miles away I wish he was cried Affery Affery I want to know what is amiss here I want some light thrown on the secrets of this house I tell you Arthur she interrupted noises is the secrets rustlings and stealings about tremblings treads overhead and treads underneath But those are not all the secrets I don t know said Affery Don t ask me no more Your old sweetheart an t far off and she s a blabber His old sweetheart being in fact so near at hand that she was then reclining against him in a flutter a very substantial angle of forty five degrees here interposed to assure Mistress Affery with greater earnestness than directness of asseveration that what she heard should go no further but should be kept inviolate if on no other account on Arthur s sensible of intruding in being too familiar Doyce and Clennam s I make an imploring appeal to you Affery to you one of the few agreeable early remembrances I have for my mother s sake for your husband s sake for my own for all our sakes I am sure you can tell me something connected with the coming here of this man if you will Why then I ll tell you Arthur returned Affery Jeremiah s coming No indeed he is not The door is open and he is standing outside talking I ll tell you then said Affery after listening that the first time he ever come he heard the noises his own self What s that he said to me I don t know what it is I says to him catching hold of him but I have heard it over and over again While I says it he stands a looking at me all of a shake he do Has he been here often Only that night and the last night What did you see of him on the last night after I was gone Them two clever ones had him all alone to themselves Jeremiah come a dancing at me sideways after I had let you out he always comes a dancing at me sideways when he s going to hurt me and he said to me Now Affery he said I am a coming behind you my woman and a going to run you up So he took and squeezed the back of my neck in his hand till it made me open MY mouth and then he pushed me before him to bed squeezing all the way That s what he calls running me up he do Oh he s a wicked one And did you hear or see no more Affery Don t I tell you I was sent to bed Arthur Here he is I assure you he is still at the door Those whisperings and counsellings Affery that you have spoken of What are they How should I know Don t ask me nothing about em Arthur Get away But my dear Affery unless I can gain some insight into these hidden things in spite of your husband and in spite of my mother ruin will come of it Don t ask me nothing repeated Affery I have been in a dream for ever so long Go away go away You said that before returned Arthur You used the same expression that night at the door when I asked you what was going on here What do you mean by being in a dream I an t a going to tell you Get away I shouldn t tell you if you was by yourself much less with your old sweetheart here It was equally vain for Arthur to entreat and for Flora to protest Affery who had been trembling and struggling the whole time turned a deaf ear to all adjuration and was bent on forcing herself out of the closet I d sooner scream to Jeremiah than say another word I ll call out to him Arthur if you don t give over speaking to me Now here s the very last word I ll say afore I call to him If ever you begin to get the better of them two clever ones your own self you ought to it as I told you when you first come home for you haven t been a living here long years to be made afeared of your life as I have then do you get the better of em afore my face and then do you say to me Affery tell your dreams Maybe then I ll tell em The shutting of the door stopped Arthur from replying They glided into the places where Jeremiah had left them and Clennam stepping forward as that old gentleman returned informed him that he had accidentally extinguished the candle mister Flintwinch looked on as he re lighted it at the lamp in the hall and preserved a profound taciturnity respecting the person who had been holding him in conversation Perhaps his irascibility demanded compensation for some tediousness that the visitor had expended on him however that was he took such umbrage at seeing his wife with her apron over her head that he charged at her and taking her veiled nose between his thumb and finger appeared to throw the whole screw power of his person into the wring he gave it Flora now permanently heavy did not release Arthur from the survey of the house until it had extended even to his old garret bedchamber His thoughts were otherwise occupied than with the tour of inspection yet he took particular notice at the time as he afterwards had occasion to remember of the airlessness and closeness of the house that they left the track of their footsteps in the dust on the upper floors and that there was a resistance to the opening of one room door which occasioned Affery to cry out that somebody was hiding inside and to continue to believe so though somebody was sought and not discovered When they at last returned to his mother s room they found her shading her face with her muffled hand and talking in a low voice to the Patriarch as he stood before the fire whose blue eyes polished head and silken locks turning towards them as they came in imparted an inestimable value and inexhaustible love of his species to his remark So you have been seeing the premises seeing the premises premises seeing the premises it was not in itself a jewel of benevolence or wisdom yet he made it an exemplar of both that one would have liked to have a copy of CHAPTER twenty four The Evening of a Long Day That illustrious man and great national ornament mister Merdle continued his shining course It began to be widely understood that one who had done society the admirable service of making so much money out of it could not be suffered to remain a commoner A baronetcy was spoken of with confidence a peerage was frequently mentioned Rumour had it that mister Merdle had set his golden face against a baronetcy that he had plainly intimated to Lord Decimus that a baronetcy was not enough for him that he had said No a Peerage or plain Merdle This was reported to have plunged Lord Decimus as nigh to his noble chin in a slough of doubts as so lofty a person could be sunk For the Barnacles as a group of themselves in creation had an idea that such distinctions belonged to them and that when a soldier sailor or lawyer became ennobled they let him in as it were by an act of condescension at the family door and immediately shut it again Not only said Rumour had the troubled Decimus his own hereditary part in this impression but he also knew of several Barnacle claims already on the file which came into collision with that of the master spirit Right or wrong Rumour was very busy and Lord Decimus while he was or was supposed to be in stately excogitation of the difficulty lent her some countenance by taking on several public occasions one of those elephantine trots of his through a jungle of overgrown sentences waving mister Merdle about on his trunk as Gigantic Enterprise The Wealth of England Elasticity Credit Capital Prosperity and all manner of blessings So quietly did the mowing of the old scythe go on that fully three months had passed unnoticed since the two English brothers had been laid in one tomb in the strangers cemetery at Rome mister and missus Sparkler were established in their own house a little mansion rather of the Tite Barnacle class quite a triumph of inconvenience with a perpetual smell in it of the day before yesterday s soup and coach horses but extremely dear as being exactly in the centre of the habitable globe In this enviable abode and envied it really was by many people missus Sparkler had intended to proceed at once to the demolition of the Bosom when active hostilities had been suspended by the arrival of the Courier with his tidings of death missus Sparkler who was not unfeeling had received them with a violent burst of grief which had lasted twelve hours after which she had arisen to see about her mourning and to take every precaution that could ensure its being as becoming as missus Merdle s A gloom was then cast over more than one distinguished family according to the politest sources of intelligence and the Courier went back again mister and missus Sparkler had been dining alone with their gloom cast over them and missus Sparkler reclined on a drawing room sofa It was a hot summer Sunday evening The residence in the centre of the habitable globe at all times stuffed and close as if it had an incurable cold in its head was that evening particularly stifling The bells of the churches had done their worst in the way of clanging among the unmelodious echoes of the streets and the lighted windows of the churches had ceased to be yellow in the grey dusk and had died out opaque black missus Sparkler lying on her sofa looking through an open window at the opposite side of a narrow street over boxes of mignonette and flowers was tired of the view missus Sparkler looking at another window where her husband stood in the balcony was tired of that view missus Sparkler looking at herself in her mourning was even tired of that view though naturally not so tired of that as of the other two It s like lying in a well said missus Sparkler changing her position fretfully Dear me Edmund if you have anything to say why don t you say it mister Sparkler might have replied with ingenuousness My life I have nothing to say But as the repartee did not occur to him he contented himself with coming in from the balcony and standing at the side of his wife s couch Good gracious Edmund said missus Sparkler more fretfully still you are absolutely putting mignonette up your nose Pray don t mister Sparkler in absence of mind perhaps in a more literal absence of mind than is usually understood by the phrase had smelt so hard at a sprig in his hand as to be on the verge of the offence in question He smiled said I ask your pardon my dear and threw it out of window You make my head ache by remaining in that position Edmund said missus Sparkler raising her eyes to him after another minute you look so aggravatingly large by this light Do sit down Certainly my dear said mister Sparkler and took a chair on the same spot If I didn t know that the longest day was past said Fanny yawning in a dreary manner I should have felt certain this was the longest day I never did experience such a day Is that your fan my love asked mister Sparkler picking up one and presenting it Edmund returned his wife more wearily yet don t ask weak questions I entreat you not Whose can it be but mine Yes I thought it was yours said mister Sparkler Then you shouldn t ask retorted Fanny After a little while she turned on her sofa and exclaimed Dear me dear me there never was such a long day as this After another little while she got up slowly walked about and came back again My dear said mister Sparkler flashing with an original conception I think you must have got the fidgets Oh Fidgets repeated missus Sparkler Don t My adorable girl urged mister Sparkler try your aromatic vinegar I have often seen my mother try it and it seemingly refreshed her And she is as I believe you are aware a remarkably fine woman with no non Good Gracious exclaimed Fanny starting up again It s beyond all patience This is the most wearisome day that ever did dawn upon the world I am certain mister Sparkler looked meekly after her as she lounged about the room and he appeared to be a little frightened When she had tossed a few trifles about and had looked down into the darkening street out of all the three windows she returned to her sofa and threw herself among its pillows Now Edmund come here Come a little nearer because I want to be able to touch you with my fan that I may impress you very much with what I am going to say That will do Quite close enough Oh you do look so big mister Sparkler apologised for the circumstance pleaded that he couldn t help it and said that our fellows without more particularly indicating whose fellows used to call him by the name of Quinbus Flestrin Junior or the Young Man Mountain You ought to have told me so before Fanny complained My dear returned mister Sparkler rather gratified I didn t know It would interest you or I would have made a point of telling you There For goodness sake don t talk said Fanny I want to talk myself Edmund we must not be alone any more I must take such precautions as will prevent my being ever again reduced to the state of dreadful depression in which I am this evening My dear answered mister Sparkler being as you are well known to be a remarkably fine woman with no Oh good GRACIOUS cried Fanny mister Sparkler was so discomposed by the energy of this exclamation accompanied with a flouncing up from the sofa and a flouncing down again that a minute or two elapsed before he felt himself equal to saying in explanation I mean my dear that everybody knows you are calculated to shine in society Calculated to shine in society retorted Fanny with great irritability yes indeed And then what happens I no sooner recover in a visiting point of view the shock of poor dear papa s death and my poor uncle s though I do not disguise from myself that the last was a happy release for if you are not presentable you had much better die You are not referring to me my love I hope mister Sparkler humbly interrupted Edmund Edmund you would wear out a Saint Am I not expressly speaking of my poor uncle You looked with so much expression at myself my dear girl said mister Sparkler that I felt a little uncomfortable Thank you my love Now you have put me out observed Fanny with a resigned toss of her fan and I had better go to bed Don t do that my love urged mister Sparkler Take time Fanny took a good deal of time lying back with her eyes shut and her eyebrows raised with a hopeless expression as if she had utterly given up all terrestrial affairs At length without the slightest notice she opened her eyes again and recommenced in a short sharp manner What happens then I ask What happens Why I find myself at the very period when I might shine most in society and should most like for very momentous reasons to shine in society I find myself in a situation which to a certain extent disqualifies me for going into society It s too bad really My dear said mister Sparkler I don t think it need keep you at home Edmund you ridiculous creature returned Fanny with great indignation do you suppose that a woman in the bloom of youth and not wholly devoid of personal attractions can put herself at such a time in competition as to figure with a woman in every other way her inferior If you do suppose such a thing your folly is boundless mister Sparkler submitted that he had thought it might be got over Got over repeated Fanny with immeasurable scorn For a time mister Sparkler submitted Honouring the last feeble suggestion with no notice missus Sparkler declared with bitterness that it really was too bad and that positively it was enough to make one wish one was dead However she said when she had in some measure recovered from her sense of personal ill usage provoking as it is and cruel as it seems I suppose it must be submitted to Especially as it was to be expected said mister Sparkler Edmund returned his wife if you have nothing more becoming to do than to attempt to insult the woman who has honoured you with her hand when she finds herself in adversity I think YOU had better go to bed mister Sparkler was much afflicted by the charge and offered a most tender and earnest apology His apology was accepted but missus Sparkler requested him to go round to the other side of the sofa and sit in the window curtain to tone himself down Now Edmund she said stretching out her fan and touching him with it at arm s length what I was going to say to you when you began as usual to prose and worry is that I shall guard against our being alone any more and that when circumstances prevent my going out to my own satisfaction I must arrange to have some people or other always here for I really cannot and will not have another such day as this has been mister Sparkler s sentiments as to the plan were in brief that it had no nonsense about it He added And besides you know it s likely that you ll soon have your sister Dearest Amy yes cried missus Sparkler with a sigh of affection Darling little thing Not however that Amy would do here alone mister Sparkler was going to say No interrogatively but he saw his danger and said it assentingly No Oh dear no she wouldn t do here alone No Edmund For not only are the virtues of the precious child of that still character that they require a contrast require life and movement around them to bring them out in their right colours and make one love them of all things but she will require to be roused on more accounts than one That s it said mister Sparkler Roused Pray don t Edmund Your habit of interrupting without having the least thing in the world to say distracts one You must be broken of it Speaking of Amy my poor little pet was devotedly attached to poor papa and no doubt will have lamented his loss exceedingly and grieved very much I have done so myself I have felt it dreadfully But Amy will no doubt have felt it even more from having been on the spot the whole time and having been with poor dear papa at the last which I unhappily was not Here Fanny stopped to weep and to say Dear dear beloved papa How truly gentlemanly he was What a contrast to poor uncle From the effects of that trying time she pursued my good little Mouse will have to be roused Also from the effects of this long attendance upon Edward in his illness an attendance which is not yet over which may even go on for some time longer and which in the meanwhile unsettles us all by keeping poor dear papa s affairs from being wound up Fortunately however the papers with his agents here being all sealed up and locked up as he left them when he providentially came to England the affairs are in that state of order that they can wait until my brother Edward recovers his health in Sicily sufficiently to come over and administer or execute or whatever it may be that will have to be done He couldn t have a better nurse to bring him round mister Sparkler made bold to opine For a wonder I can agree with you returned his wife languidly turning her eyelids a little in his direction she held forth in general as if to the drawing room furniture and can adopt your words He couldn t have a better nurse to bring him round There are times when my dear child is a little wearing to an active mind but as a nurse she is Perfection Best of Amys mister Sparkler growing rash on his late success observed that Edward had had biggodd a long bout of it my dear girl If Bout Edmund returned missus Sparkler is the slang term for indisposition he has If it is not I am unable to give an opinion on the barbarous language you address to Edward s sister That he contracted Malaria Fever somewhere either by travelling day and night to Rome where after all he arrived too late to see poor dear papa before his death or under some other unwholesome circumstances is indubitable if that is what you mean Likewise that his extremely careless life has made him a very bad subject for it indeed mister Sparkler considered it a parallel case to that of some of our fellows in the West Indies with Yellow Jack missus Sparkler closed her eyes again and refused to have any consciousness of our fellows of the West Indies or of Yellow Jack So Amy she pursued when she reopened her eyelids will require to be roused from the effects of many tedious and anxious weeks And lastly she will require to be roused from a low tendency which I know very well to be at the bottom of her heart Don t ask me what it is Edmund because I must decline to tell you I am not going to my dear said mister Sparkler I shall thus have much improvement to effect in my sweet child missus Sparkler continued and cannot have her near me too soon Amiable and dear little Twoshoes As to the settlement of poor papa s affairs my interest in that is not very selfish Papa behaved very generously to me when I was married and I have little or nothing to expect Provided he had made no will that can come into force leaving a legacy to missus General I am contented Dear papa dear papa She wept again but missus General was the best of restoratives The name soon stimulated her to dry her eyes and say It is a highly encouraging circumstance in Edward s illness I am thankful to think and gives one the greatest confidence in his sense not being impaired or his proper spirit weakened down to the time of poor dear papa s death at all events that he paid off missus General instantly and sent her out of the house I applaud him for it I could forgive him a great deal for doing with such promptitude so exactly what I would have done myself missus Sparkler was in the full glow of her gratification when a double knock was heard at the door A very odd knock Low as if to avoid making a noise and attracting attention Long as if the person knocking were preoccupied in mind and forgot to leave off Halloa said mister Sparkler Who s this Not Amy and Edward without notice and without a carriage said missus Sparkler Look out The room was dark but the street was lighter because of its lamps mister Sparkler s head peeping over the balcony looked so very bulky and heavy that it seemed on the point of overbalancing him and flattening the unknown below It s one fellow said mister Sparkler I can t see who stop though On this second thought he went out into the balcony again and had another look He came back as the door was opened and announced that he believed he had identified his governor s tile He was not mistaken for his governor with his tile in his hand was introduced immediately afterwards Candles said missus Sparkler with a word of excuse for the darkness It s light enough for me said mister Merdle When the candles were brought in mister Merdle was discovered standing behind the door picking his lips I thought I d give you a call he said I am rather particularly occupied just now and as I happened to be out for a stroll I thought I d give you a call As he was in dinner dress Fanny asked him where he had been dining Well said mister Merdle I haven t been dining anywhere particularly Of course you have dined said Fanny Why no I haven t exactly dined said mister Merdle He had passed his hand over his yellow forehead and considered as if he were not sure about it Something to eat was proposed No thank you said mister Merdle I don t feel inclined for it I was to have dined out along with missus Merdle But as I didn t feel inclined for dinner I let missus Merdle go by herself just as we were getting into the carriage and thought I d take a stroll instead Would he have tea or coffee No thank you said mister Merdle I looked in at the Club and got a bottle of wine At this period of his visit mister Merdle took the chair which Edmund Sparkler had offered him and which he had hitherto been pushing slowly about before him like a dull man with a pair of skates on for the first time who could not make up his mind to start He now put his hat upon another chair beside him and looking down into it as if it were some twenty feet deep said again You see I thought I d give you a call Flattering to us said Fanny for you are not a calling man No no returned mister Merdle who was by this time taking himself into custody under both coat sleeves No I am not a calling man You have too much to do for that said Fanny Having so much to do mister Merdle loss of appetite is a serious thing with you and you must have it seen to You must not be ill Oh I am very well replied mister Merdle after deliberating about it I am as well as I usually am I am well enough I am as well as I want to be The master mind of the age true to its characteristic of being at all times a mind that had as little as possible to say for itself and great difficulty in saying it became mute again missus Sparkler began to wonder how long the master mind meant to stay I was speaking of poor papa when you came in sir Aye Quite a coincidence said mister Merdle Fanny did not see that but felt it incumbent on her to continue talking I was saying she pursued that my brother s illness has occasioned a delay in examining and arranging papa s property Yes said mister Merdle yes There has been a delay Not that it is of consequence said Fanny Not assented mister Merdle after having examined the cornice of all that part of the room which was within his range not that it is of any consequence My only anxiety is said Fanny that missus General should not get anything She won t get anything said mister Merdle Fanny was delighted to hear him express the opinion mister Merdle after taking another gaze into the depths of his hat as if he thought he saw something at the bottom rubbed his hair and slowly appended to his last remark the confirmatory words Oh dear no No Not she Not likely As the topic seemed exhausted and mister Merdle too Fanny inquired if he were going to take up missus Merdle and the carriage in his way home No he answered I shall go by the shortest way and leave missus Merdle to here he looked all over the palms of both his hands as if he were telling his own fortune to take care of herself I dare say she ll manage to do it Probably said Fanny There was then a long silence during which missus Sparkler lying back on her sofa again shut her eyes and raised her eyebrows in her former retirement from mundane affairs But however said mister Merdle I am equally detaining you and myself I thought I d give you a call you know Charmed I am sure said Fanny So I am off added mister Merdle getting up Could you lend me a penknife It was an odd thing Fanny smilingly observed for her who could seldom prevail upon herself even to write a letter to lend to a man of such vast business as mister Merdle Isn t it mister Merdle acquiesced but I want one and I know you have got several little wedding keepsakes about with scissors and tweezers and such things in them You shall have it back to morrow Edmund said missus Sparkler open now very carefully I beg and beseech for you are so very awkward the mother of pearl box on my little table there and give mister Merdle the mother of pearl penknife Thank you said mister Merdle but if you have got one with a darker handle I think I should prefer one with a darker handle Tortoise shell Thank you said mister Merdle yes I think I should prefer tortoise shell Edmund accordingly received instructions to open the tortoise shell box and give mister Merdle the tortoise shell knife On his doing so his wife said to the master spirit graciously I will forgive you if you ink it I ll undertake not to ink it said mister Merdle The illustrious visitor then put out his coat cuff and for a moment entombed missus Sparkler s hand wrist bracelet and all Where his own hand had shrunk to was not made manifest but it was as remote from missus Sparkler s sense of touch as if he had been a highly meritorious Chelsea Veteran or Greenwich Pensioner Thoroughly convinced as he went out of the room that it was the longest day that ever did come to an end at last and that there never was a woman not wholly devoid of personal attractions so worn out by idiotic and lumpish people Fanny passed into the balcony for a breath of air Waters of vexation filled her eyes and they had the effect of making the famous mister Merdle in going down the street appear to leap and waltz and gyrate as if he were possessed of several Devils CHAPTER twenty five The Chief Butler Resigns the Seals of Office The dinner party was at the great Physician s Bar was there and in full force Ferdinand Barnacle was there and in his most engaging state Few ways of life were hidden from Physician and he was oftener in its darkest places than even Bishop There were brilliant ladies about London who perfectly doted on him my dear as the most charming creature and the most delightful person who would have been shocked to find themselves so close to him if they could have known on what sights those thoughtful eyes of his had rested within an hour or two and near to whose beds and under what roofs his composed figure had stood But Physician was a composed man who performed neither on his own trumpet nor on the trumpets of other people Many wonderful things did he see and hear and much irreconcilable moral contradiction did he pass his life among yet his equality of compassion was no more disturbed than the Divine Master s of all healing was He went like the rain among the just and unjust doing all the good he could and neither proclaiming it in the synagogues nor at the corner of streets As no man of large experience of humanity however quietly carried it may be can fail to be invested with an interest peculiar to the possession of such knowledge Physician was an attractive man Even the daintier gentlemen and ladies who had no idea of his secret and who would have been startled out of more wits than they had by the monstrous impropriety of his proposing to them Come and see what I see confessed his attraction Where he was something real was And half a grain of reality like the smallest portion of some other scarce natural productions will flavour an enormous quantity of diluent It came to pass therefore that Physician s little dinners always presented people in their least conventional lights The guests said to themselves whether they were conscious of it or no Here is a man who really has an acquaintance with us as we are who is admitted to some of us every day with our wigs and paint off who hears the wanderings of our minds and sees the undisguised expression of our faces when both are past our control we may as well make an approach to reality with him for the man has got the better of us and is too strong for us Therefore Physician s guests came out so surprisingly at his round table that they were almost natural Bar s knowledge of that agglomeration of jurymen which is called humanity was as sharp as a razor yet a razor is not a generally convenient instrument and Physician s plain bright scalpel though far less keen was adaptable to far wider purposes Bar knew all about the gullibility and knavery of people but Physician could have given him a better insight into their tendernesses and affections in one week of his rounds than Westminster Hall and all the circuits put together in threescore years and ten Bar always had a suspicion of this and perhaps was glad to encourage it for if the world were really a great Law Court one would think that the last day of Term could not too soon arrive and so he liked and respected Physician quite as much as any other kind of man did mister Merdle s default left a Banquo s chair at the table but if he had been there he would have merely made the difference of Banquo in it and consequently he was no loss Bar who picked up all sorts of odds and ends about Westminster Hall much as a raven would have done if he had passed as much of his time there had been picking up a great many straws lately and tossing them about to try which way the Merdle wind blew He now had a little talk on the subject with missus Merdle herself sidling up to that lady of course with his double eye glass and his jury droop A certain bird said Bar and he looked as if it could have been no other bird than a magpie has been whispering among us lawyers lately that there is to be an addition to the titled personages of this realm Really said missus Merdle Yes said Bar Has not the bird been whispering in very different ears from ours in lovely ears He looked expressively at missus Merdle s nearest ear ring Do you mean mine asked missus Merdle When I say lovely said Bar I always mean you You never mean anything I think returned missus Merdle not displeased Oh cruelly unjust said Bar But the bird I am the last person in the world to hear news observed missus Merdle carelessly arranging her stronghold Who is it What an admirable witness you would make said Bar No jury unless we could empanel one of blind men could resist you if you were ever so bad a one but you would be such a good one Why you ridiculous man asked missus Merdle laughing Bar waved his double eye glass three or four times between himself and the Bosom as a rallying answer and inquired in his most insinuating accents What am I to call the most elegant accomplished and charming of women a few weeks or it may be a few days hence Didn t your bird tell you what to call her answered missus Merdle Do ask it to morrow and tell me the next time you see me what it says This led to further passages of similar pleasantry between the two but Bar with all his sharpness got nothing out of them Physician on the other hand taking missus Merdle down to her carriage and attending on her as she put on her cloak inquired into the symptoms with his usual calm directness May I ask he said is this true about Merdle My dear doctor she returned you ask me the very question that I was half disposed to ask you To ask me Why me Upon my honour I think mister Merdle reposes greater confidence in you than in any one On the contrary he tells me absolutely nothing even professionally You have heard the talk of course Of course I have But you know what mister Merdle is you know how taciturn and reserved he is I assure you I have no idea what foundation for it there may be I should like it to be true why should I deny that to you You would know better if I did Just so said Physician But whether it is all true or partly true or entirely false I am wholly unable to say It is a most provoking situation a most absurd situation but you know mister Merdle and are not surprised Physician was not surprised handed her into her carriage and bade her Good Night He stood for a moment at his own hall door looking sedately at the elegant equipage as it rattled away On his return up stairs the rest of the guests soon dispersed and he was left alone Being a great reader of all kinds of literature and never at all apologetic for that weakness he sat down comfortably to read The clock upon his study table pointed to a few minutes short of twelve when his attention was called to it by a ringing at the door bell A man of plain habits he had sent his servants to bed and must needs go down to open the door He went down and there found a man without hat or coat whose shirt sleeves were rolled up tight to his shoulders For a moment he thought the man had been fighting the rather as he was much agitated and out of breath A second look however showed him that the man was particularly clean and not otherwise discomposed as to his dress than as it answered this description I come from the warm baths sir round in the neighbouring street And what is the matter at the warm baths Would you please to come directly sir We found that lying on the table He put into the physician s hand a scrap of paper Physician looked at it and read his own name and address written in pencil nothing more He looked closer at the writing looked at the man took his hat from its peg put the key of his door in his pocket and they hurried away together When they came to the warm baths all the other people belonging to that establishment were looking out for them at the door and running up and down the passages Request everybody else to keep back if you please said the physician aloud to the master and do you take me straight to the place my friend to the messenger The messenger hurried before him along a grove of little rooms and turning into one at the end of the grove looked round the door Physician was close upon him and looked round the door too There was a bath in that corner from which the water had been hastily drained off Lying in it as in a grave or sarcophagus with a hurried drapery of sheet and blanket thrown across it was the body of a heavily made man with an obtuse head and coarse mean common features A sky light had been opened to release the steam with which the room had been filled but it hung condensed into water drops heavily upon the walls and heavily upon the face and figure in the bath The room was still hot and the marble of the bath still warm but the face and figure were clammy to the touch The white marble at the bottom of the bath was veined with a dreadful red On the ledge at the side were an empty laudanum bottle and a tortoise shell handled penknife soiled but not with ink Separation of jugular vein death rapid been dead at least half an hour This echo of the physician s words ran through the passages and little rooms and through the house while he was yet straightening himself from having bent down to reach to the bottom of the bath and while he was yet dabbling his hands in water redly veining it as the marble was veined before it mingled into one tint He turned his eyes to the dress upon the sofa and to the watch money and pocket book on the table A folded note half buckled up in the pocket book and half protruding from it caught his observant glance He looked at it touched it pulled it a little further out from among the leaves said quietly This is addressed to me and opened and read it There were no directions for him to give The people of the house knew what to do the proper authorities were soon brought and they took an equable business like possession of the deceased and of what had been his property with no greater disturbance of manner or countenance than usually attends the winding up of a clock Physician was glad to walk out into the night air was even glad in spite of his great experience to sit down upon a door step for a little while feeling sick and faint Bar was a near neighbour of his and when he came to the house he saw a light in the room where he knew his friend often sat late getting up his work As the light was never there when Bar was not it gave him assurance that Bar was not yet in bed In fact this busy bee had a verdict to get to morrow against evidence and was improving the shining hours in setting snares for the gentlemen of the jury Physician s knock astonished Bar but as he immediately suspected that somebody had come to tell him that somebody else was robbing him or otherwise trying to get the better of him he came down promptly and softly He had been clearing his head with a lotion of cold water as a good preparative to providing hot water for the heads of the jury and had been reading with the neck of his shirt thrown wide open that he might the more freely choke the opposite witnesses In consequence he came down looking rather wild Seeing Physician the least expected of men he looked wilder and said What s the matter You asked me once what Merdle s complaint was Extraordinary answer I know I did I told you I had not found out Yes I know you did I have found it out My God said Bar starting back and clapping his hand upon the other s breast And so have I I see it in your face They went into the nearest room where Physician gave him the letter to read He read it through half a dozen times There was not much in it as to quantity but it made a great demand on his close and continuous attention He could not sufficiently give utterance to his regret that he had not himself found a clue to this The smallest clue he said would have made him master of the case and what a case it would have been to have got to the bottom of Physician had engaged to break the intelligence in Harley Street Bar could not at once return to his inveiglements of the most enlightened and remarkable jury he had ever seen in that box with whom he could tell his learned friend no shallow sophistry would go down and no unhappily abused professional tact and skill prevail this was the way he meant to begin with them so he said he would go too and would loiter to and fro near the house while his friend was inside They walked there the better to recover self possession in the air and the wings of day were fluttering the night when Physician knocked at the door A footman of rainbow hues in the public eye was sitting up for his master that is to say was fast asleep in the kitchen over a couple of candles and a newspaper demonstrating the great accumulation of mathematical odds against the probabilities of a house being set on fire by accident When this serving man was roused Physician had still to await the rousing of the Chief Butler At last that noble creature came into the dining room in a flannel gown and list shoes but with his cravat on and a Chief Butler all over It was morning now Physician had opened the shutters of one window while waiting that he might see the light missus Merdle s maid must be called and told to get missus Merdle up and prepare her as gently as she can to see me I have dreadful news to break to her Thus Physician to the Chief Butler The latter who had a candle in his hand called his man to take it away Then he approached the window with dignity looking on at Physician s news exactly as he had looked on at the dinners in that very room mister Merdle is dead I should wish said the Chief Butler to give a month s notice mister Merdle has destroyed himself Sir said the Chief Butler that is very unpleasant to the feelings of one in my position as calculated to awaken prejudice and I should wish to leave immediately If you are not shocked are you not surprised man demanded the Physician warmly The Chief Butler erect and calm replied in these memorable words Sir mister Merdle never was the gentleman and no ungentlemanly act on mister Merdle s part would surprise me Is there anybody else I can send to you or any other directions I can give before I leave respecting what you would wish to be done When Physician after discharging himself of his trust up stairs rejoined Bar in the street he said no more of his interview with missus Merdle than that he had not yet told her all but that what he had told her she had borne pretty well Bar had devoted his leisure in the street to the construction of a most ingenious man trap for catching the whole of his jury at a blow having got that matter settled in his mind it was lucid on the late catastrophe and they walked home slowly discussing it in every bearing Before parting at the Physician s door they both looked up at the sunny morning sky into which the smoke of a few early fires and the breath and voices of a few early stirrers were peacefully rising and then looked round upon the immense city and said if all those hundreds and thousands of beggared people who were yet asleep could only know as they two spoke the ruin that impended over them what a fearful cry against one miserable soul would go up to Heaven The report that the great man was dead got about with astonishing rapidity At first he was dead of all the diseases that ever were known and of several bran new maladies invented with the speed of Light to meet the demand of the occasion He had concealed a dropsy from infancy he had inherited a large estate of water on the chest from his grandfather he had had an operation performed upon him every morning of his life for eighteen years he had been subject to the explosion of important veins in his body after the manner of fireworks he had had something the matter with his lungs he had had something the matter with his heart he had had something the matter with his brain Five hundred people who sat down to breakfast entirely uninformed on the whole subject believed before they had done breakfast that they privately and personally knew Physician to have said to mister Merdle You must expect to go out some day like the snuff of a candle and that they knew mister Merdle to have said to Physician A man can die but once By about eleven o clock in the forenoon something the matter with the brain became the favourite theory against the field and by twelve the something had been distinctly ascertained to be Pressure Pressure was so entirely satisfactory to the public mind and seemed to make everybody so comfortable that it might have lasted all day but for Bar s having taken the real state of the case into Court at half past nine This led to its beginning to be currently whispered all over London by about one that mister Merdle had killed himself Pressure however so far from being overthrown by the discovery became a greater favourite than ever There was a general moralising upon Pressure in every street All the people who had tried to make money and had not been able to do it said There you were You no sooner began to devote yourself to the pursuit of wealth than you got Pressure The idle people improved the occasion in a similar manner See said they what you brought yourself to by work work work You persisted in working you overdid it Pressure came on and you were done for This consideration was very potent in many quarters but nowhere more so than among the young clerks and partners who had never been in the slightest danger of overdoing it These one and all declared quite piously that they hoped they would never forget the warning as long as they lived and that their conduct might be so regulated as to keep off Pressure and preserve them a comfort to their friends for many years But at about the time of High Change Pressure began to wane and appalling whispers to circulate east west north and south At first they were faint and went no further than a doubt whether mister Merdle s wealth would be found to be as vast as had been supposed whether there might not be a temporary difficulty in realising it whether there might not even be a temporary suspension say a month or so on the part of the wonderful Bank As the whispers became louder which they did from that time every minute they became more threatening He had sprung from nothing by no natural growth or process that any one could account for he had been after all a low ignorant fellow he had been a down looking man and no one had ever been able to catch his eye he had been taken up by all sorts of people in quite an unaccountable manner he had never had any money of his own his ventures had been utterly reckless and his expenditure had been most enormous In steady progression as the day declined the talk rose in sound and purpose He had left a letter at the Baths addressed to his physician and his physician had got the letter and the letter would be produced at the Inquest on the morrow and it would fall like a thunderbolt upon the multitude he had deluded Numbers of men in every profession and trade would be blighted by his insolvency old people who had been in easy circumstances all their lives would have no place of repentance for their trust in him but the workhouse legions of women and children would have their whole future desolated by the hand of this mighty scoundrel Every partaker of his magnificent feasts would be seen to have been a sharer in the plunder of innumerable homes every servile worshipper of riches who had helped to set him on his pedestal would have done better to worship the Devil point blank So the talk lashed louder and higher by confirmation on confirmation and by edition after edition of the evening papers swelled into such a roar when night came as might have brought one to believe that a solitary watcher on the gallery above the Dome of saint Paul s would have perceived the night air to be laden with a heavy muttering of the name of Merdle coupled with every form of execration For by that time it was known that the late mister Merdle s complaint had been simply Forgery and Robbery He the uncouth object of such wide spread adulation the sitter at great men s feasts the roc s egg of great ladies assemblies the subduer of exclusiveness the leveller of pride the patron of patrons the bargain driver with a Minister for Lordships of the Circumlocution Office the recipient of more acknowledgment within some ten or fifteen years at most than had been bestowed in England upon all peaceful public benefactors and upon all the leaders of all the Arts and Sciences with all their works to testify for them during two centuries at least he the shining wonder the new constellation to be followed by the wise men bringing gifts until it stopped over a certain carrion at the bottom of a bath and disappeared was simply the greatest Forger and the greatest Thief that ever cheated the gallows CHAPTER twenty six Reaping the Whirlwind With a precursory sound of hurried breath and hurried feet mister Pancks rushed into Arthur Clennam s Counting house The Inquest was over the letter was public the Bank was broken the other model structures of straw had taken fire and were turned to smoke The admired piratical ship had blown up in the midst of a vast fleet of ships of all rates and boats of all sizes and on the deep was nothing but ruin nothing but burning hulls bursting magazines great guns self exploded tearing friends and neighbours to pieces drowning men clinging to unseaworthy spars and going down every minute spent swimmers floating dead and sharks The usual diligence and order of the Counting house at the Works were overthrown Unopened letters and unsorted papers lay strewn about the desk In the midst of these tokens of prostrated energy and dismissed hope the master of the Counting house stood idle in his usual place with his arms crossed on the desk and his head bowed down upon them mister Pancks rushed in and saw him and stood still In another minute mister Pancks s arms were on the desk and mister Pancks s head was bowed down upon them and for some time they remained in these attitudes idle and silent with the width of the little room between them mister Pancks was the first to lift up his head and speak I persuaded you to it mister Clennam I know it Say what you will You can t say more to me than I say to myself You can t say more than I deserve O Pancks Pancks returned Clennam don t speak of deserving What do I myself deserve Better luck said Pancks I pursued Clennam without attending to him who have ruined my partner Pancks Pancks I have ruined Doyce The honest self helpful indefatigable old man who has worked his way all through his life the man who has contended against so much disappointment and who has brought out of it such a good and hopeful nature the man I have felt so much for and meant to be so true and useful to I have ruined him brought him to shame and disgrace ruined him ruined him The agony into which the reflection wrought his mind was so distressing to see that mister Pancks took hold of himself by the hair of his head and tore it in desperation at the spectacle Reproach me cried Pancks Reproach me sir or I ll do myself an injury Say You fool you villain Say Ass how could you do it Beast what did you mean by it Catch hold of me somewhere Say something abusive to me All the time mister Pancks was tearing at his tough hair in a most pitiless and cruel manner If you had never yielded to this fatal mania Pancks said Clennam more in commiseration than retaliation it would have been how much better for you and how much better for me At me again sir cried Pancks grinding his teeth in remorse At me again If you had never gone into those accursed calculations and brought out your results with such abominable clearness groaned Clennam it would have been how much better for you Pancks and how much better for me At me again sir exclaimed Pancks loosening his hold of his hair at me again and again Clennam however finding him already beginning to be pacified had said all he wanted to say and more He wrung his hand only adding Blind leaders of the blind Pancks Blind leaders of the blind But Doyce Doyce Doyce my injured partner That brought his head down on the desk once more Their former attitudes and their former silence were once more first encroached upon by Pancks Not been to bed sir since it began to get about Been high and low on the chance of finding some hope of saving any cinders from the fire All in vain All gone All vanished I know it returned Clennam too well mister Pancks filled up a pause with a groan that came out of the very depths of his soul Only yesterday Pancks said Arthur only yesterday Monday I had the fixed intention of selling realising and making an end of it I can t say as much for myself sir returned Pancks Though it s wonderful how many people I ve heard of who were going to realise yesterday of all days in the three hundred and sixty five if it hadn t been too late His steam like breathings usually droll in their effect were more tragic than so many groans while from head to foot he was in that begrimed besmeared neglected state that he might have been an authentic portrait of Misfortune which could scarcely be discerned through its want of cleaning mister Clennam had you laid out everything He got over the break before the last word and also brought out the last word itself with great difficulty Everything mister Pancks took hold of his tough hair again and gave it such a wrench that he pulled out several prongs of it After looking at these with an eye of wild hatred he put them in his pocket My course said Clennam brushing away some tears that had been silently dropping down his face must be taken at once What wretched amends I can make must be made I must clear my unfortunate partner s reputation I must retain nothing for myself I must resign to our creditors the power of management I have so much abused and I must work out as much of my fault or crime as is susceptible of being worked out in the rest of my days Is it impossible sir to tide over the present Out of the question Nothing can be tided over now Pancks The sooner the business can pass out of my hands the better for it There are engagements to be met this week which would bring the catastrophe before many days were over even if I would postpone it for a single day by going on for that space secretly knowing what I know All last night I thought of what I would do what remains is to do it Not entirely of yourself said Pancks whose face was as damp as if his steam were turning into water as fast as he dismally blew it off Have some legal help Perhaps I had better Have Rugg There is not much to do He will do it as well as another Shall I fetch Rugg mister Clennam If you could spare the time I should be much obliged to you mister Pancks put on his hat that moment and steamed away to Pentonville While he was gone Arthur never raised his head from the desk but remained in that one position mister Pancks brought his friend and professional adviser mister Rugg back with him mister Rugg had had such ample experience on the road of mister Pancks s being at that present in an irrational state of mind that he opened his professional mediation by requesting that gentleman to take himself out of the way mister Pancks crushed and submissive obeyed He is not unlike what my daughter was sir when we began the Breach of Promise action of Rugg and Bawkins in which she was Plaintiff said mister Rugg He takes too strong and direct an interest in the case His feelings are worked upon There is no getting on in our profession with feelings worked upon sir As he pulled off his gloves and put them in his hat he saw in a side glance or two that a great change had come over his client I am sorry to perceive sir said mister Rugg that you have been allowing your own feelings to be worked upon Now pray don t pray don t These losses are much to be deplored sir but we must look em in the face If the money I have sacrificed had been all my own mister Rugg sighed mister Clennam I should have cared far less Indeed sir said mister Rugg rubbing his hands with a cheerful air You surprise me That s singular sir I have generally found in my experience that it s their own money people are most particular about I have seen people get rid of a good deal of other people s money and bear it very well very well indeed With these comforting remarks mister Rugg seated himself on an office stool at the desk and proceeded to business Now mister Clennam by your leave let us go into the matter Let us see the state of the case The question is simple The question is the usual plain straightforward common sense question What can we do for ourself What can we do for ourself This is not the question with me mister Rugg said Arthur You mistake it in the beginning It is what can I do for my partner how can I best make reparation to him I am afraid sir do you know argued mister Rugg persuasively that you are still allowing your feeling to be worked upon I don t like the term reparation sir except as a lever in the hands of counsel Will you excuse my saying that I feel it my duty to offer you the caution that you really must not allow your feelings to be worked upon mister Rugg said Clennam nerving himself to go through with what he had resolved upon and surprising that gentleman by appearing in his despondency to have a settled determination of purpose you give me the impression that you will not be much disposed to adopt the course I have made up my mind to take If your disapproval of it should render you unwilling to discharge such business as it necessitates I am sorry for it and must seek other aid But I will represent to you at once that to argue against it with me is useless Good sir answered mister Rugg shrugging his shoulders Good sir Since the business is to be done by some hands let it be done by mine Such was my principle in the case of Rugg and Bawkins Such is my principle in most cases Clennam then proceeded to state to mister Rugg his fixed resolution He told mister Rugg that his partner was a man of great simplicity and integrity and that in all he meant to do he was guided above all things by a knowledge of his partner s character and a respect for his feelings He explained that his partner was then absent on an enterprise of importance and that it particularly behoved himself publicly to accept the blame of what he had rashly done and publicly to exonerate his partner from all participation in the responsibility of it lest the successful conduct of that enterprise should be endangered by the slightest suspicion wrongly attaching to his partner s honour and credit in another country He told mister Rugg that to clear his partner morally to the fullest extent and publicly and unreservedly to declare that he Arthur Clennam of that Firm had of his own sole act and even expressly against his partner s caution embarked its resources in the swindles that had lately perished was the only real atonement within his power was a better atonement to the particular man than it would be to many men and was therefore the atonement he had first to make With this view his intention was to print a declaration to the foregoing effect which he had already drawn up and besides circulating it among all who had dealings with the House to advertise it in the public papers Concurrently with this measure the description of which cost mister Rugg innumerable wry faces and great uneasiness in his limbs he would address a letter to all the creditors exonerating his partner in a solemn manner informing them of the stoppage of the House until their pleasure could be known and his partner communicated with and humbly submitting himself to their direction If through their consideration for his partner s innocence the affairs could ever be got into such train as that the business could be profitably resumed and its present downfall overcome then his own share in it should revert to his partner as the only reparation he could make to him in money value for the distress and loss he had unhappily brought upon him and he himself at as mall a salary as he could live upon would ask to be allowed to serve the business as a faithful clerk Though mister Rugg saw plainly there was no preventing this from being done still the wryness of his face and the uneasiness of his limbs so sorely required the propitiation of a Protest that he made one I offer no objection sir said he I argue no point with you I will carry out your views sir but under protest mister Rugg then stated not without prolixity the heads of his protest These were in effect because the whole town or he might say the whole country was in the first madness of the late discovery and the resentment against the victims would be very strong those who had not been deluded being certain to wax exceedingly wroth with them for not having been as wise as they were and those who had been deluded being certain to find excuses and reasons for themselves of which they were equally certain to see that other sufferers were wholly devoid not to mention the great probability of every individual sufferer persuading himself to his violent indignation that but for the example of all the other sufferers he never would have put himself in the way of suffering Because such a declaration as Clennam s made at such a time would certainly draw down upon him a storm of animosity rendering it impossible to calculate on forbearance in the creditors or on unanimity among them and exposing him a solitary target to a straggling cross fire which might bring him down from half a dozen quarters at once To all this Clennam merely replied that granting the whole protest nothing in it lessened the force or could lessen the force of the voluntary and public exoneration of his partner He therefore once and for all requested mister Rugg s immediate aid in getting the business despatched Upon that mister Rugg fell to work and Arthur retaining no property to himself but his clothes and books and a little loose money placed his small private banker s account with the papers of the business The disclosure was made and the storm raged fearfully Thousands of people were wildly staring about for somebody alive to heap reproaches on and this notable case courting publicity set the living somebody so much wanted on a scaffold When people who had nothing to do with the case were so sensible of its flagrancy people who lost money by it could scarcely be expected to deal mildly with it Letters of reproach and invective showered in from the creditors and mister Rugg who sat upon the high stool every day and read them all informed his client within a week that he feared there were writs out I must take the consequences of what I have done said Clennam The writs will find me here On the very next morning as he was turning in Bleeding Heart Yard by missus Plornish s corner missus Plornish stood at the door waiting for him and mysteriously besought him to step into Happy Cottage There he found mister Rugg I thought I d wait for you here I wouldn t go on to the Counting house this morning if I was you sir Why not mister Rugg There are as many as five out to my knowledge It cannot be too soon over said Clennam Let them take me at once Yes but said mister Rugg getting between him and the door hear reason hear reason They ll take you soon enough mister Clennam I don t doubt but hear reason It almost always happens in these cases that some insignificant matter pushes itself in front and makes much of itself Now I find there s a little one out a mere Palace Court jurisdiction and I have reason to believe that a caption may be made upon that I wouldn t be taken upon that Why not asked Clennam I d be taken on a full grown one sir said mister Rugg It s as well to keep up appearances As your professional adviser I should prefer your being taken on a writ from one of the Superior Courts if you have no objection to do me that favour It looks better mister Rugg said Arthur in his dejection my only wish is that it should be over I will go on and take my chance Another word of reason sir cried mister Rugg Now this is reason The other may be taste but this is reason If you should be taken on a little one sir you would go to the Marshalsea Now you know what the Marshalsea is Very close Excessively confined Whereas in the King s Bench mister Rugg waved his right hand freely as expressing abundance of space I would rather said Clennam be taken to the Marshalsea than to any other prison Do you say so indeed sir returned mister Rugg Then this is taste too and we may be walking He was a little offended at first but he soon overlooked it They walked through the Yard to the other end The Bleeding Hearts were more interested in Arthur since his reverses than formerly now regarding him as one who was true to the place and had taken up his freedom Many of them came out to look after him and to observe to one another with great unctuousness that he was pulled down by it missus Plornish and her father stood at the top of the steps at their own end much depressed and shaking their heads There was nobody visibly in waiting when Arthur and mister Rugg arrived at the Counting house But an elderly member of the Jewish persuasion preserved in rum followed them close and looked in at the glass before mister Rugg had opened one of the day s letters Oh said mister Rugg looking up How do you do Step in mister Clennam I think this is the gentleman I was mentioning This gentleman explained the object of his visit to be a tyfling madder ob bithznithz and executed his legal function Shall I accompany you mister Clennam asked mister Rugg politely rubbing his hands I would rather go alone thank you Be so good as send me my clothes mister Rugg in a light airy way replied in the affirmative and shook hands with him He and his attendant then went down stairs got into the first conveyance they found and drove to the old gates Where I little thought Heaven forgive me said Clennam to himself that I should ever enter thus mister Chivery was on the Lock and Young John was in the Lodge either newly released from it or waiting to take his own spell of duty Both were more astonished on seeing who the prisoner was than one might have thought turnkeys would have been The elder mister Chivery shook hands with him in a shame faced kind of way and said I don t call to mind sir as I was ever less glad to see you The younger mister Chivery more distant did not shake hands with him at all he stood looking at him in a state of indecision so observable that it even came within the observation of Clennam with his heavy eyes and heavy heart Presently afterwards Young John disappeared into the jail As Clennam knew enough of the place to know that he was required to remain in the Lodge a certain time he took a seat in a corner and feigned to be occupied with the perusal of letters from his pocket They did not so engross his attention but that he saw with gratitude how the elder mister Chivery kept the Lodge clear of prisoners how he signed to some with his keys not to come in how he nudged others with his elbows to go out and how he made his misery as easy to him as he could Arthur was sitting with his eyes fixed on the floor recalling the past brooding over the present and not attending to either when he felt himself touched upon the shoulder It was by Young John and he said You can come now He got up and followed Young John When they had gone a step or two within the inner iron gate Young John turned and said to him You want a room I have got you one I thank you heartily Young John turned again and took him in at the old doorway up the old staircase into the old room Arthur stretched out his hand Young John looked at it looked at him sternly swelled choked and said I don t know as I can No I find I can t But I thought you d like the room and here it is for you Surprise at this inconsistent behaviour yielded when he was gone he went away directly to the feelings which the empty room awakened in Clennam s wounded breast and to the crowding associations with the one good and gentle creature who had sanctified it Her absence in his altered fortunes made it and him in it so very desolate and so much in need of such a face of love and truth that he turned against the wall to weep sobbing out as his heart relieved itself O my Little Dorrit CHAPTER twenty seven The Pupil of the Marshalsea The day was sunny and the Marshalsea with the hot noon striking upon it was unwontedly quiet Arthur Clennam dropped into a solitary arm chair itself as faded as any debtor in the jail and yielded himself to his thoughts In the unnatural peace of having gone through the dreaded arrest and got there the first change of feeling which the prison most commonly induced and from which dangerous resting place so many men had slipped down to the depths of degradation and disgrace by so many ways he could think of some passages in his life almost as if he were removed from them into another state of existence Taking into account where he was the interest that had first brought him there when he had been free to keep away and the gentle presence that was equally inseparable from the walls and bars about him and from the impalpable remembrances of his later life which no walls or bars could imprison it was not remarkable that everything his memory turned upon should bring him round again to Little Dorrit Yet it was remarkable to him not because of the fact itself but because of the reminder it brought with it how much the dear little creature had influenced his better resolutions None of us clearly know to whom or to what we are indebted in this wise until some marked stop in the whirling wheel of life brings the right perception with it It comes with sickness it comes with sorrow it comes with the loss of the dearly loved it is one of the most frequent uses of adversity It came to Clennam in his adversity strongly and tenderly When I first gathered myself together he thought and set something like purpose before my jaded eyes whom had I before me toiling on for a good object s sake without encouragement without notice against ignoble obstacles that would have turned an army of received heroes and heroines One weak girl When I tried to conquer my misplaced love and to be generous to the man who was more fortunate than I though he should never know it or repay me with a gracious word in whom had I watched patience self denial self subdual charitable construction the noblest generosity of the affections In the same poor girl If I a man with a man s advantages and means and energies had slighted the whisper in my heart that if my father had erred it was my first duty to conceal the fault and to repair it what youthful figure with tender feet going almost bare on the damp ground with spare hands ever working with its slight shape but half protected from the sharp weather would have stood before me to put me to shame Little Dorrit s So always as he sat alone in the faded chair thinking Always Little Dorrit Until it seemed to him as if he met the reward of having wandered away from her and suffered anything to pass between him and his remembrance of her virtues His door was opened and the head of the elder Chivery was put in a very little way without being turned towards him I am off the Lock mister Clennam and going out Can I do anything for you Many thanks Nothing You ll excuse me opening the door said mister Chivery but I couldn t make you hear Did you knock Half a dozen times Rousing himself Clennam observed that the prison had awakened from its noontide doze that the inmates were loitering about the shady yard and that it was late in the afternoon He had been thinking for hours Your things is come said mister Chivery and my son is going to carry em up I should have sent em up but for his wishing to carry em himself Indeed he would have em himself and so I couldn t send em up mister Clennam could I say a word to you Pray come in said Arthur for mister Chivery s head was still put in at the door a very little way and mister Chivery had but one ear upon him instead of both eyes This was native delicacy in mister Chivery true politeness though his exterior had very much of a turnkey about it and not the least of a gentleman Thank you sir said mister Chivery without advancing it s no odds me coming in mister Clennam don t you take no notice of my son if you ll be so good in case you find him cut up anyways difficult My son has a art and my son s art is in the right place Me and his mother knows where to find it and we find it sitiwated correct With this mysterious speech mister Chivery took his ear away and shut the door He might have been gone ten minutes when his son succeeded him Here s your portmanteau he said to Arthur putting it carefully down It s very kind of you I am ashamed that you should have the trouble He was gone before it came to that but soon returned saying exactly as before Here s your black box which he also put down with care I am very sensible of this attention I hope we may shake hands now mister John Young John however drew back turning his right wrist in a socket made of his left thumb and middle finger and said as he had said at first I don t know as I can No I find I can t He then stood regarding the prisoner sternly though with a swelling humour in his eyes that looked like pity Why are you angry with me said Clennam and yet so ready to do me these kind services There must be some mistake between us If I have done anything to occasion it I am sorry No mistake sir returned John turning the wrist backwards and forwards in the socket for which it was rather tight No mistake sir in the feelings with which my eyes behold you at the present moment If I was at all fairly equal to your weight mister Clennam which I am not and if you weren t under a cloud which you are and if it wasn t against all rules of the Marshalsea which it is those feelings are such that they would stimulate me more to having it out with you in a Round on the present spot than to anything else I could name Arthur looked at him for a moment in some wonder and some little anger Well well he said A mistake a mistake Turning away he sat down with a heavy sigh in the faded chair again Young John followed him with his eyes and after a short pause cried out I beg your pardon Freely granted said Clennam waving his hand without raising his sunken head Say no more I am not worth it This furniture sir said Young John in a voice of mild and soft explanation belongs to me I am in the habit of letting it out to parties without furniture that have the room It an t much but it s at your service Free I mean I could not think of letting you have it on any other terms You re welcome to it for nothing Arthur raised his head again to thank him and to say he could not accept the favour John was still turning his wrist and still contending with himself in his former divided manner What is the matter between us said Arthur I decline to name it sir returned Young John suddenly turning loud and sharp Nothing s the matter Arthur looked at him again in vain for an explanation of his behaviour After a while Arthur turned away his head again Young John said presently afterwards with the utmost mildness The little round table sir that s nigh your elbow was you know whose I needn t mention him he died a great gentleman I bought it of an individual that he gave it to and that lived here after him But the individual wasn t any ways equal to him Most individuals would find it hard to come up to his level Arthur drew the little table nearer rested his arm upon it and kept it there Perhaps you may not be aware sir said Young John that I intruded upon him when he was over here in London On the whole he was of opinion that it WAS an intrusion though he was so good as to ask me to sit down and to inquire after father and all other old friends Leastways humblest acquaintances He looked to me a good deal changed and I said so when I came back I asked him if Miss Amy was well And she was I should have thought you would have known without putting the question to such as me returned Young John after appearing to take a large invisible pill Since you do put me the question I am sorry I can t answer it But the truth is he looked upon the inquiry as a liberty and said What was that to me It was then I became quite aware I was intruding of which I had been fearful before However he spoke very handsome afterwards very handsome They were both silent for several minutes except that Young John remarked at about the middle of the pause He both spoke and acted very handsome It was again Young John who broke the silence by inquiring If it s not a liberty how long may it be your intentions sir to go without eating and drinking I have not felt the want of anything yet returned Clennam I have no appetite just now The more reason why you should take some support sir urged Young John If you find yourself going on sitting here for hours and hours partaking of no refreshment because you have no appetite why then you should and must partake of refreshment without an appetite I m going to have tea in my own apartment If it s not a liberty please to come and take a cup Or I can bring a tray here in two minutes Feeling that Young John would impose that trouble on himself if he refused and also feeling anxious to show that he bore in mind both the elder mister Chivery s entreaty and the younger mister Chivery s apology Arthur rose and expressed his willingness to take a cup of tea in mister John s apartment Young John locked his door for him as they went out slided the key into his pocket with great dexterity and led the way to his own residence It was at the top of the house nearest to the gateway It was the room to which Clennam had hurried on the day when the enriched family had left the prison for ever and where he had lifted her insensible from the floor He foresaw where they were going as soon as their feet touched the staircase The room was so far changed that it was papered now and had been repainted and was far more comfortably furnished but he could recall it just as he had seen it in that single glance when he raised her from the ground and carried her down to the carriage Young John looked hard at him biting his fingers I see you recollect the room mister Clennam I recollect it well Heaven bless her Oblivious of the tea Young John continued to bite his fingers and to look at his visitor as long as his visitor continued to glance about the room Finally he made a start at the teapot gustily rattled a quantity of tea into it from a canister and set off for the common kitchen to fill it with hot water The room was so eloquent to Clennam in the changed circumstances of his return to the miserable Marshalsea it spoke to him so mournfully of her and of his loss of her that it would have gone hard with him to resist it even though he had not been alone Alone he did not try He had his hand on the insensible wall as tenderly as if it had been herself that he touched and pronounced her name in a low voice He stood at the window looking over the prison parapet with its grim spiked border and breathed a benediction through the summer haze towards the distant land where she was rich and prosperous Young John was some time absent and when he came back showed that he had been outside by bringing with him fresh butter in a cabbage leaf some thin slices of boiled ham in another cabbage leaf and a little basket of water cresses and salad herbs When these were arranged upon the table to his satisfaction they sat down to tea Clennam tried to do honour to the meal but unavailingly The ham sickened him the bread seemed to turn to sand in his mouth He could force nothing upon himself but a cup of tea Try a little something green said Young John handing him the basket He took a sprig or so of water cress and tried again but the bread turned to a heavier sand than before and the ham though it was good enough of itself seemed to blow a faint simoom of ham through the whole Marshalsea Try a little more something green sir said Young John and again handed the basket It was so like handing green meat into the cage of a dull imprisoned bird and John had so evidently brought the little basket as a handful of fresh relief from the stale hot paving stones and bricks of the jail that Clennam said with a smile It was very kind of you to think of putting this between the wires but I cannot even get this down to day As if the difficulty were contagious Young John soon pushed away his own plate and fell to folding the cabbage leaf that had contained the ham When he had folded it into a number of layers one over another so that it was small in the palm of his hand he began to flatten it between both his hands and to eye Clennam attentively I wonder he at length said compressing his green packet with some force that if it s not worth your while to take care of yourself for your own sake it s not worth doing for some one else s Truly returned Arthur with a sigh and a smile I don t know for whose mister Clennam said John warmly I am surprised that a gentleman who is capable of the straightforwardness that you are capable of should be capable of the mean action of making me such an answer mister Clennam I am surprised that a gentleman who is capable of having a heart of his own should be capable of the heartlessness of treating mine in that way I am astonished at it sir Really and truly I am astonished Having got upon his feet to emphasise his concluding words Young John sat down again and fell to rolling his green packet on his right leg never taking his eyes off Clennam but surveying him with a fixed look of indignant reproach I had got over it sir said John I had conquered it knowing that it must be conquered and had come to the resolution to think no more about it I shouldn t have given my mind to it again I hope if to this prison you had not been brought and in an hour unfortunate for me this day In his agitation Young John adopted his mother s powerful construction of sentences When you first came upon me sir in the Lodge this day more as if a Upas tree had been made a capture of than a private defendant such mingled streams of feelings broke loose again within me that everything was for the first few minutes swept away before them and I was going round and round in a vortex I got out of it I struggled and got out of it If it was the last word I had to speak against that vortex with my utmost powers I strove and out of it I came I argued that if I had been rude apologies was due and those apologies without a question of demeaning I did make And now when I ve been so wishful to show that one thought is next to being a holy one with me and goes before all others now after all you dodge me when I ever so gently hint at it and throw me back upon myself For do not sir said Young John do not be so base as to deny that dodge you do and thrown me back upon myself you have All amazement Arthur gazed at him like one lost only saying What is it What do you mean John But John being in that state of mind in which nothing would seem to be more impossible to a certain class of people than the giving of an answer went ahead blindly I hadn t John declared no I hadn t and I never had the audaciousness to think I am sure that all was anything but lost I hadn t no why should I say I hadn t if I ever had any hope that it was possible to be so blest not after the words that passed not even if barriers insurmountable had not been raised But is that a reason why I am to have no memory why I am to have no thoughts why I am to have no sacred spots nor anything What can you mean cried Arthur It s all very well to trample on it sir John went on scouring a very prairie of wild words if a person can make up his mind to be guilty of the action It s all very well to trample on it but it s there It may be that it couldn t be trampled upon if it wasn t there But that doesn t make it gentlemanly that doesn t make it honourable that doesn t justify throwing a person back upon himself after he has struggled and strived out of himself like a butterfly The world may sneer at a turnkey but he s a man when he isn t a woman which among female criminals he s expected to be Ridiculous as the incoherence of his talk was there was yet a truthfulness in Young John s simple sentimental character and a sense of being wounded in some very tender respect expressed in his burning face and in the agitation of his voice and manner which Arthur must have been cruel to disregard He turned his thoughts back to the starting point of this unknown injury and in the meantime Young John having rolled his green packet pretty round cut it carefully into three pieces and laid it on a plate as if it were some particular delicacy It seems to me just possible said Arthur when he had retraced the conversation to the water cresses and back again that you have made some reference to Miss Dorrit It is just possible sir returned John Chivery I don t understand it I hope I may not be so unlucky as to make you think I mean to offend you again for I never have meant to offend you yet when I say I don t understand it Sir said Young John will you have the perfidy to deny that you know and long have known that I felt towards Miss Dorrit call it not the presumption of love but adoration and sacrifice Indeed John I will not have any perfidy if I know it why you should suspect me of it I am at a loss to think Did you ever hear from missus Chivery your mother that I went to see her once No sir returned John shortly Never heard of such a thing But I did Can you imagine why No sir returned John shortly I can t imagine why I will tell you I was solicitous to promote Miss Dorrit s happiness and if I could have supposed that Miss Dorrit returned your affection Poor John Chivery turned crimson to the tips of his ears Miss Dorrit never did sir I wish to be honourable and true so far as in my humble way I can and I would scorn to pretend for a moment that she ever did or that she ever led me to believe she did no nor even that it was ever to be expected in any cool reason that she would or could She was far above me in all respects at all times As likewise added John similarly was her general teel family His chivalrous feeling towards all that belonged to her made him so very respectable in spite of his small stature and his rather weak legs and his very weak hair and his poetical temperament that a Goliath might have sat in his place demanding less consideration at Arthur s hands You speak John he said with cordial admiration like a Man Well sir returned John brushing his hand across his eyes then I wish you d do the same He was quick with this unexpected retort and it again made Arthur regard him with a wondering expression of face Leastways said John stretching his hand across the tea tray if too strong a remark withdrawn But why not why not When I say to you mister Clennam take care of yourself for some one else s sake why not be open though a turnkey Why did I get you the room which I knew you d like best Why did I carry up your things Not that I found em heavy I don t mention em on that accounts far from it Why have I cultivated you in the manner I have done since the morning On the ground of your own merits No They re very great I ve no doubt at all but not on the ground of them Another s merits have had their weight and have had far more weight with Me Then why not speak free Unaffectedly John said Clennam you are so good a fellow and I have so true a respect for your character that if I have appeared to be less sensible than I really am of the fact that the kind services you have rendered me to day are attributable to my having been trusted by Miss Dorrit as her friend I confess it to be a fault and I ask your forgiveness Oh why not John repeated with returning scorn why not speak free I declare to you returned Arthur that I do not understand you Look at me Consider the trouble I have been in Is it likely that I would wilfully add to my other self reproaches that of being ungrateful or treacherous to you I do not understand you John s incredulous face slowly softened into a face of doubt He rose backed into the garret window of the room beckoned Arthur to come there and stood looking at him thoughtfully mister Clennam do you mean to say that you don t know What John Lord said Young John appealing with a gasp to the spikes on the wall He says What Clennam looked at the spikes and looked at John and looked at the spikes and looked at John He says What And what is more exclaimed Young John surveying him in a doleful maze he appears to mean it Do you see this window sir Of course I see this window See this room Why of course I see this room That wall opposite and that yard down below They have all been witnesses of it from day to day from night to night from week to week from month to month For how often have I seen Miss Dorrit here when she has not seen me Witnesses of what said Clennam Of Miss Dorrit s love For whom You said John And touched him with the back of his hand upon the breast and backed to his chair and sat down on it with a pale face holding the arms and shaking his head at him If he had dealt Clennam a heavy blow instead of laying that light touch upon him its effect could not have been to shake him more He stood amazed his eyes looking at John his lips parted and seeming now and then to form the word Me without uttering it his hands dropped at his sides his whole appearance that of a man who has been awakened from sleep and stupefied by intelligence beyond his full comprehension Me he at length said aloud Ah groaned Young John You He did what he could to muster a smile and returned Your fancy You are completely mistaken I mistaken sir said Young John I completely mistaken on that subject No mister Clennam don t tell me so On any other if you like for I don t set up to be a penetrating character and am well aware of my own deficiencies But I mistaken on a point that has caused me more smart in my breast than a flight of savages arrows could have done I mistaken on a point that almost sent me into my grave as I sometimes wished it would if the grave could only have been made compatible with the tobacco business and father and mother s feelings I mistaken on a point that even at the present moment makes me take out my pocket handkercher like a great girl as people say though I am sure I don t know why a great girl should be a term of reproach for every rightly constituted male mind loves em great and small Don t tell me so don t tell me so Still highly respectable at bottom though absurd enough upon the surface Young John took out his pocket handkerchief with a genuine absence both of display and concealment which is only to be seen in a man with a great deal of good in him when he takes out his pocket handkerchief for the purpose of wiping his eyes Having dried them and indulged in the harmless luxury of a sob and a sniff he put it up again The touch was still in its influence so like a blow that Arthur could not get many words together to close the subject with He assured John Chivery when he had returned his handkerchief to his pocket that he did all honour to his disinterestedness and to the fidelity of his remembrance of Miss Dorrit As to the impression on his mind of which he had just relieved it here John interposed and said No impression Certainty as to that they might perhaps speak of it at another time but would say no more now Feeling low spirited and weary he would go back to his room with John s leave and come out no more that night John assented and he crept back in the shadow of the wall to his own lodging The feeling of the blow was still so strong upon him that when the dirty old woman was gone whom he found sitting on the stairs outside his door waiting to make his bed and who gave him to understand while doing it that she had received her instructions from mister Chivery not the old un but the young un he sat down in the faded arm chair pressing his head between his hands as if he had been stunned Little Dorrit love him More bewildering to him than his misery far Consider the improbability He had been accustomed to call her his child and his dear child and to invite her confidence by dwelling upon the difference in their respective ages and to speak of himself as one who was turning old Yet she might not have thought him old Something reminded him that he had not thought himself so until the roses had floated away upon the river He had her two letters among other papers in his box and he took them out and read them There seemed to be a sound in them like the sound of her sweet voice It fell upon his ear with many tones of tenderness that were not insusceptible of the new meaning Now it was that the quiet desolation of her answer No No No made to him that night in that very room that night when he had been shown the dawn of her altered fortune and when other words had passed between them which he had been destined to remember in humiliation and a prisoner rushed into his mind Consider the improbability But it had a preponderating tendency when considered to become fainter There was another and a curious inquiry of his own heart s that concurrently became stronger In the reluctance he had felt to believe that she loved any one in his desire to set that question at rest in a half formed consciousness he had had that there would be a kind of nobleness in his helping her love for any one was there no suppressed something on his own side that he had hushed as it arose Had he ever whispered to himself that he must not think of such a thing as her loving him that he must not take advantage of her gratitude that he must keep his experience in remembrance as a warning and reproof that he must regard such youthful hopes as having passed away as his friend s dead daughter had passed away that he must be steady in saying to himself that the time had gone by him and he was too saddened and old He had kissed her when he raised her from the ground on the day when she had been so consistently and expressively forgotten Quite as he might have kissed her if she had been conscious No difference The darkness found him occupied with these thoughts The darkness also found mister and missus Plornish knocking at his door They brought with them a basket filled with choice selections from that stock in trade which met with such a quick sale and produced such a slow return missus Plornish was affected to tears mister Plornish amiably growled in his philosophical but not lucid manner that there was ups you see and there was downs It was in vain to ask why ups why downs there they was you know He had heerd it given for a truth that accordin as the world went round which round it did rewolve undoubted even the best of gentlemen must take his turn of standing with his ed upside down and all his air a flying the wrong way into what you might call Space Wery well then What mister Plornish said was wery well then That gentleman s ed would come up ards when his turn come that gentleman s air would be a pleasure to look upon being all smooth again and wery well then It has been already stated that missus Plornish not being philosophical wept It further happened that missus Plornish not being philosophical was intelligible It may have arisen out of her softened state of mind out of her sex s wit out of a woman s quick association of ideas or out of a woman s no association of ideas but it further happened somehow that missus Plornish s intelligibility displayed itself upon the very subject of Arthur s meditations The way father has been talking about you mister Clennam said missus Plornish you hardly would believe It s made him quite poorly As to his voice this misfortune has took it away You know what a sweet singer father is but he couldn t get a note out for the children at tea if you ll credit what I tell you While speaking missus Plornish shook her head and wiped her eyes and looked retrospectively about the room As to mister Baptist pursued missus Plornish whatever he ll do when he comes to know of it I can t conceive nor yet imagine He d have been here before now you may be sure but that he s away on confidential business of your own The persevering manner in which he follows up that business and gives himself no rest from it it really do said missus Plornish winding up in the Italian manner as I say to him Mooshattonisha padrona Though not conceited missus Plornish felt that she had turned this Tuscan sentence with peculiar elegance mister Plornish could not conceal his exultation in her accomplishments as a linguist But what I say is mister Clennam the good woman went on there s always something to be thankful for as I am sure you will yourself admit Speaking in this room it s not hard to think what the present something is It s a thing to be thankful for indeed that Miss Dorrit is not here to know it Arthur thought she looked at him with particular expression It s a thing reiterated missus Plornish to be thankful for indeed that Miss Dorrit is far away It s to be hoped she is not likely to hear of it If she had been here to see it sir it s not to be doubted that the sight of you missus Plornish repeated those words not to be doubted that the sight of you in misfortune and trouble would have been almost too much for her affectionate heart There s nothing I can think of that would have touched Miss Dorrit so bad as that Of a certainty missus Plornish did look at him now with a sort of quivering defiance in her friendly emotion Yes said she And it shows what notice father takes though at his time of life that he says to me this afternoon which Happy Cottage knows I neither make it up nor any ways enlarge Mary it s much to be rejoiced in that Miss Dorrit is not on the spot to behold it Those were father s words Father s own words was Much to be rejoiced in Mary that Miss Dorrit is not on the spot to behold it I says to father then I says to him Father you are right That missus Plornish concluded with the air of a very precise legal witness is what passed betwixt father and me And I tell you nothing but what did pass betwixt me and father mister Plornish as being of a more laconic temperament embraced this opportunity of interposing with the suggestion that she should now leave mister Clennam to himself For you see said mister Plornish gravely I know what it is old gal repeating that valuable remark several times as if it appeared to him to include some great moral secret Finally the worthy couple went away arm in arm Little Dorrit Little Dorrit Again for hours Always Little Dorrit Happily if it ever had been so it was over and better over Granted that she had loved him and he had known it and had suffered himself to love her what a road to have led her away upon the road that would have brought her back to this miserable place He ought to be much comforted by the reflection that she was quit of it forever that she was or would soon be married vague rumours of her father s projects in that direction had reached Bleeding Heart Yard with the news of her sister s marriage and that the Marshalsea gate had shut for ever on all those perplexed possibilities of a time that was gone Dear Little Dorrit Looking back upon his own poor story she was its vanishing point Every thing in its perspective led to her innocent figure He had travelled thousands of miles towards it previous unquiet hopes and doubts had worked themselves out before it it was the centre of the interest of his life it was the termination of everything that was good and pleasant in it beyond there was nothing but mere waste and darkened sky As ill at ease as on the first night of his lying down to sleep within those dreary walls he wore the night out with such thoughts What time Young John lay wrapt in peaceful slumber after composing and arranging the following monumental inscription on his pillow STRANGER RESPECT THE TOMB OF JOHN CHIVERY JUNIOR WHO DIED AT AN ADVANCED AGE NOT NECESSARY TO MENTION HE ENCOUNTERED HIS RIVAL IN A DISTRESSED STATE AND FELT INCLINED TO HAVE A ROUND WITH HIM BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE LOVED ONE CONQUERED THOSE FEELINGS OF BITTERNESS AND BECAME MAGNANIMOUS CHAPTER twenty eight An Appearance in the Marshalsea The opinion of the community outside the prison gates bore hard on Clennam as time went on and he made no friends among the community within Too depressed to associate with the herd in the yard who got together to forget their cares too retiring and too unhappy to join in the poor socialities of the tavern he kept his own room and was held in distrust Some said he was proud some objected that he was sullen and reserved some were contemptuous of him for that he was a poor spirited dog who pined under his debts The whole population were shy of him on these various counts of indictment but especially the last which involved a species of domestic treason and he soon became so confirmed in his seclusion that his only time for walking up and down was when the evening Club were assembled at their songs and toasts and sentiments and when the yard was nearly left to the women and children Imprisonment began to tell upon him He knew that he idled and moped After what he had known of the influences of imprisonment within the four small walls of the very room he occupied this consciousness made him afraid of himself Shrinking from the observation of other men and shrinking from his own he began to change very sensibly Anybody might see that the shadow of the wall was dark upon him One day when he might have been some ten or twelve weeks in jail and when he had been trying to read and had not been able to release even the imaginary people of the book from the Marshalsea a footstep stopped at his door and a hand tapped at it He arose and opened it and an agreeable voice accosted him with How do you do mister Clennam I hope I am not unwelcome in calling to see you It was the sprightly young Barnacle Ferdinand He looked very good natured and prepossessing though overpoweringly gay and free in contrast with the squalid prison You are surprised to see me mister Clennam he said taking the seat which Clennam offered him I must confess to being much surprised Not disagreeably I hope By no means Thank you Frankly said the engaging young Barnacle I have been excessively sorry to hear that you were under the necessity of a temporary retirement here and I hope of course as between two private gentlemen that our place has had nothing to do with it Your office Our Circumlocution place I cannot charge any part of my reverses upon that remarkable establishment Upon my life said the vivacious young Barnacle I am heartily glad to know it It is quite a relief to me to hear you say it I should have so exceedingly regretted our place having had anything to do with your difficulties Clennam again assured him that he absolved it of the responsibility That s right said Ferdinand I am very happy to hear it I was rather afraid in my own mind that we might have helped to floor you because there is no doubt that it is our misfortune to do that kind of thing now and then We don t want to do it but if men will be gravelled why we can t help it Without giving an unqualified assent to what you say returned Arthur gloomily I am much obliged to you for your interest in me No but really Our place is said the easy young Barnacle the most inoffensive place possible You ll say we are a humbug I won t say we are not but all that sort of thing is intended to be and must be Don t you see I do not said Clennam You don t regard it from the right point of view It is the point of view that is the essential thing Regard our place from the point of view that we only ask you to leave us alone and we are as capital a Department as you ll find anywhere Is your place there to be left alone asked Clennam You exactly hit it returned Ferdinand It is there with the express intention that everything shall be left alone That is what it means That is what it s for No doubt there s a certain form to be kept up that it s for something else but it s only a form Why good Heaven we are nothing but forms Think what a lot of our forms you have gone through And you have never got any nearer to an end Never said Clennam Look at it from the right point of view and there you have us official and effectual It s like a limited game of cricket A field of outsiders are always going in to bowl at the Public Service and we block the balls Clennam asked what became of the bowlers The airy young Barnacle replied that they grew tired got dead beat got lamed got their backs broken died off gave it up went in for other games And this occasions me to congratulate myself again he pursued on the circumstance that our place has had nothing to do with your temporary retirement It very easily might have had a hand in it because it is undeniable that we are sometimes a most unlucky place in our effects upon people who will not leave us alone mister Clennam I am quite unreserved with you As between yourself and myself I know I may be I was so when I first saw you making the mistake of not leaving us alone because I perceived that you were inexperienced and sanguine and had I hope you ll not object to my saying some simplicity Not at all Some simplicity Therefore I felt what a pity it was and I went out of my way to hint to you which really was not official but I never am official when I can help it something to the effect that if I were you I wouldn t bother myself However you did bother yourself and you have since bothered yourself Now don t do it any more I am not likely to have the opportunity said Clennam Oh yes you are You ll leave here Everybody leaves here There are no ends of ways of leaving here Now don t come back to us That entreaty is the second object of my call Pray don t come back to us Upon my honour said Ferdinand in a very friendly and confiding way I shall be greatly vexed if you don t take warning by the past and keep away from us And the invention said Clennam My good fellow returned Ferdinand if you ll excuse the freedom of that form of address nobody wants to know of the invention and nobody cares twopence halfpenny about it Nobody in the Office that is to say Nor out of it Everybody is ready to dislike and ridicule any invention You have no idea how many people want to be left alone You have no idea how the Genius of the country overlook the Parliamentary nature of the phrase and don t be bored by it tends to being left alone Believe me mister Clennam said the sprightly young Barnacle in his pleasantest manner our place is not a wicked Giant to be charged at full tilt but only a windmill showing you as it grinds immense quantities of chaff which way the country wind blows If I could believe that said Clennam it would be a dismal prospect for all of us Oh Don t say so returned Ferdinand It s all right We must have humbug we all like humbug we couldn t get on without humbug A little humbug and a groove and everything goes on admirably if you leave it alone With this hopeful confession of his faith as the head of the rising Barnacles who were born of woman to be followed under a variety of watchwords which they utterly repudiated and disbelieved Ferdinand rose Nothing could be more agreeable than his frank and courteous bearing or adapted with a more gentlemanly instinct to the circumstances of his visit Is it fair to ask he said as Clennam gave him his hand with a real feeling of thankfulness for his candour and good humour whether it is true that our late lamented Merdle is the cause of this passing inconvenience I am one of the many he has ruined Yes He must have been an exceedingly clever fellow said Ferdinand Barnacle Arthur not being in the mood to extol the memory of the deceased was silent A consummate rascal of course said Ferdinand but remarkably clever One cannot help admiring the fellow Must have been such a master of humbug Knew people so well got over them so completely did so much with them In his easy way he was really moved to genuine admiration I hope said Arthur that he and his dupes may be a warning to people not to have so much done with them again My dear mister Clennam returned Ferdinand laughing have you really such a verdant hope The next man who has as large a capacity and as genuine a taste for swindling will succeed as well Pardon me but I think you really have no idea how the human bees will swarm to the beating of any old tin kettle in that fact lies the complete manual of governing them When they can be got to believe that the kettle is made of the precious metals in that fact lies the whole power of men like our late lamented No doubt there are here and there said Ferdinand politely exceptional cases where people have been taken in for what appeared to them to be much better reasons and I need not go far to find such a case but they don t invalidate the rule Good day I hope that when I have the pleasure of seeing you next this passing cloud will have given place to sunshine Don t come a step beyond the door I know the way out perfectly Good day With those words the best and brightest of the Barnacles went down stairs hummed his way through the Lodge mounted his horse in the front court yard and rode off to keep an appointment with his noble kinsman who wanted a little coaching before he could triumphantly answer certain infidel Snobs who were going to question the Nobs about their statesmanship He must have passed mister Rugg on his way out for a minute or two afterwards that ruddy headed gentleman shone in at the door like an elderly Phoebus How do you do to day sir said mister Rugg Is there any little thing I can do for you to day sir No I thank you mister Rugg s enjoyment of embarrassed affairs was like a housekeeper s enjoyment in pickling and preserving or a washerwoman s enjoyment of a heavy wash or a dustman s enjoyment of an overflowing dust bin or any other professional enjoyment of a mess in the way of business I still look round from time to time sir said mister Rugg cheerfully to see whether any lingering Detainers are accumulating at the gate They have fallen in pretty thick sir as thick as we could have expected He remarked upon the circumstance as if it were matter of congratulation rubbing his hands briskly and rolling his head a little As thick repeated mister Rugg as we could reasonably have expected Quite a shower bath of em I don t often intrude upon you now when I look round because I know you are not inclined for company and that if you wished to see me you would leave word in the Lodge But I am here pretty well every day sir Would this be an unseasonable time sir asked mister Rugg coaxingly for me to offer an observation As seasonable a time as any other Hum Public opinion sir said mister Rugg has been busy with you I don t doubt it Might it not be advisable sir said mister Rugg more coaxingly yet now to make at last and after all a trifling concession to public opinion We all do it in one way or another The fact is we must do it I cannot set myself right with it mister Rugg and have no business to expect that I ever shall Don t say that sir don t say that The cost of being moved to the Bench is almost insignificant and if the general feeling is strong that you ought to be there why really I thought you had settled mister Rugg said Arthur that my determination to remain here was a matter of taste Well sir well But is it good taste is it good taste That s the Question mister Rugg was so soothingly persuasive as to be quite pathetic I was almost going to say is it good feeling This is an extensive affair of yours and your remaining here where a man can come for a pound or two is remarked upon as not in keeping It is not in keeping I can t tell you sir in how many quarters I heard it mentioned I heard comments made upon it last night in a Parlour frequented by what I should call if I did not look in there now and then myself the best legal company I heard there comments on it that I was sorry to hear They hurt me on your account Again only this morning at breakfast My daughter but a woman you ll say yet still with a feeling for these things and even with some little personal experience as the plaintiff in Rugg and Bawkins was expressing her great surprise her great surprise Now under these circumstances and considering that none of us can quite set ourselves above public opinion wouldn t a trifling concession to that opinion be Come sir said Rugg I will put it on the lowest ground of argument and say amiable Arthur s thoughts had once more wandered away to Little Dorrit and the question remained unanswered As to myself sir said mister Rugg hoping that his eloquence had reduced him to a state of indecision it is a principle of mine not to consider myself when a client s inclinations are in the scale But knowing your considerate character and general wish to oblige I will repeat that I should prefer your being in the Bench Your case has made a noise it is a creditable case to be professionally concerned in I should feel on a better standing with my connection if you went to the Bench Don t let that influence you sir I merely state the fact So errant had the prisoner s attention already grown in solitude and dejection and so accustomed had it become to commune with only one silent figure within the ever frowning walls that Clennam had to shake off a kind of stupor before he could look at mister Rugg recall the thread of his talk and hurriedly say I am unchanged and unchangeable in my decision Pray let it be let it be mister Rugg without concealing that he was nettled and mortified replied Oh Beyond a doubt sir I have travelled out of the record sir I am aware in putting the point to you But really when I herd it remarked in several companies and in very good company that however worthy of a foreigner it is not worthy of the spirit of an Englishman to remain in the Marshalsea when the glorious liberties of his island home admit of his removal to the Bench I thought I would depart from the narrow professional line marked out to me and mention it Personally said mister Rugg I have no opinion on the topic That s well returned Arthur Oh None at all sir said mister Rugg If I had I should have been unwilling some minutes ago to see a client of mine visited in this place by a gentleman of a high family riding a saddle horse But it was not my business If I had I might have wished to be now empowered to mention to another gentleman a gentleman of military exterior at present waiting in the Lodge that my client had never intended to remain here and was on the eve of removal to a superior abode But my course as a professional machine is clear I have nothing to do with it Is it your good pleasure to see the gentleman sir Who is waiting to see me did you say I did take that unprofessional liberty sir Hearing that I was your professional adviser he declined to interpose before my very limited function was performed Happily said mister Rugg with sarcasm I did not so far travel out of the record as to ask the gentleman for his name I suppose I have no resource but to see him sighed Clennam wearily Then it IS your good pleasure sir retorted Rugg Am I honoured by your instructions to mention as much to the gentleman as I pass out I am Thank you sir I take my leave His leave he took accordingly in dudgeon The gentleman of military exterior had so imperfectly awakened Clennam s curiosity in the existing state of his mind that a half forgetfulness of such a visitor s having been referred to was already creeping over it as a part of the sombre veil which almost always dimmed it now when a heavy footstep on the stairs aroused him It appeared to ascend them not very promptly or spontaneously yet with a display of stride and clatter meant to be insulting As it paused for a moment on the landing outside his door he could not recall his association with the peculiarity of its sound though he thought he had one Only a moment was given him for consideration His door was immediately swung open by a thump and in the doorway stood the missing Blandois the cause of many anxieties Salve fellow jail bird said he You want me it seems Here I am Before Arthur could speak to him in his indignant wonder Cavalletto followed him into the room mister Pancks followed Cavalletto Neither of the two had been there since its present occupant had had possession of it mister Pancks breathing hard sidled near the window put his hat on the ground stirred his hair up with both hands and folded his arms like a man who had come to a pause in a hard day s work mister Baptist never taking his eyes from his dreaded chum of old softly sat down on the floor with his back against the door and one of his ankles in each hand resuming the attitude except that it was now expressive of unwinking watchfulness in which he had sat before the same man in the deeper shade of another prison one hot morning at Marseilles I have it on the witnessing of these two madmen said Monsieur Blandois otherwise Lagnier otherwise Rigaud that you want me brother bird Here I am Glancing round contemptuously at the bedstead which was turned up by day he leaned his back against it as a resting place without removing his hat from his head and stood defiantly lounging with his hands in his pockets You villain of ill omen said Arthur You have purposely cast a dreadful suspicion upon my mother s house Why have you done it What prompted you to the devilish invention Monsieur Rigaud after frowning at him for a moment laughed Hear this noble gentleman Listen all the world to this creature of Virtue But take care take care It is possible my friend that your ardour is a little compromising Holy Blue It is possible Signore interposed Cavalletto also addressing Arthur for to commence hear me I received your instructions to find him Rigaud is it not It is the truth I go consequentementally it would have given missus Plornish great concern if she could have been persuaded that his occasional lengthening of an adverb in this way was the chief fault of his English first among my countrymen I ask them what news in Londra of foreigners arrived Then I go among the French Then I go among the Germans They all tell me The great part of us know well the other and they all tell me But no person can tell me nothing of him Rigaud Fifteen times said Cavalletto thrice throwing out his left hand with all its fingers spread and doing it so rapidly that the sense of sight could hardly follow the action I ask of him in every place where go the foreigners and fifteen times repeating the same swift performance they know nothing But At this significant Italian rest on the word But his backhanded shake of his right forefinger came into play a very little and very cautiously But After a long time when I have not been able to find that he is here in Londra some one tells me of a soldier with white hair hey not hair like this that he carries white who lives retired secrettementally in a certain place But with another rest upon the word who sometimes in the after dinner walks and smokes It is necessary as they say in Italy and as they know poor people to have patience I have patience I ask where is this certain place One believes it is here one believes it is there Eh well It is not here it is not there I wait patientissamentally At last I find it Then I watch then I hide until he walks and smokes He is a soldier with grey hair But a very decided rest indeed and a very vigorous play from side to side of the back handed forefinger he is also this man that you see It was noticeable that in his old habit of submission to one who had been at the trouble of asserting superiority over him he even then bestowed upon Rigaud a confused bend of his head after thus pointing him out Eh well Signore he cried in conclusion addressing Arthur again I waited for a good opportunity I writed some words to Signor Panco an air of novelty came over mister Pancks with this designation to come and help I showed him Rigaud at his window to Signor Panco who was often the spy in the day I slept at night near the door of the house At last we entered only this to day and now you see him As he would not come up in presence of the illustrious Advocate such was mister Baptist s honourable mention of mister Rugg we waited down below there together and Signor Panco guarded the street At the close of this recital Arthur turned his eyes upon the impudent and wicked face As it met his the nose came down over the moustache and the moustache went up under the nose When nose and moustache had settled into their places again Monsieur Rigaud loudly snapped his fingers half a dozen times bending forward to jerk the snaps at Arthur as if they were palpable missiles which he jerked into his face Now Philosopher said Rigaud What do you want with me I want to know returned Arthur without disguising his abhorrence how you dare direct a suspicion of murder against my mother s house Dare cried Rigaud Ho ho Hear him Dare Is it dare By Heaven my small boy but you are a little imprudent I want that suspicion to be cleared away said Arthur You shall be taken there and be publicly seen I want to know moreover what business you had there when I had a burning desire to fling you down stairs Don t frown at me man I have seen enough of you to know that you are a bully and coward I need no revival of my spirits from the effects of this wretched place to tell you so plain a fact and one that you know so well White to the lips Rigaud stroked his moustache muttering By Heaven my small boy but you are a little compromising of my lady your respectable mother and seemed for a minute undecided how to act His indecision was soon gone He sat himself down with a threatening swagger and said Give me a bottle of wine You can buy wine here Send one of your madmen to get me a bottle of wine I won t talk to you without wine Come Yes or no Fetch him what he wants Cavalletto said Arthur scornfully producing the money Contraband beast added Rigaud bring Port wine I ll drink nothing but Porto Porto The contraband beast however assuring all present with his significant finger that he peremptorily declined to leave his post at the door Signor Panco offered his services He soon returned with the bottle of wine which according to the custom of the place originating in a scarcity of corkscrews among the Collegians in common with a scarcity of much else was already opened for use Madman A large glass said Rigaud Signor Panco put a tumbler before him not without a visible conflict of feeling on the question of throwing it at his head Haha boasted Rigaud Once a gentleman and always a gentleman A gentleman from the beginning and a gentleman to the end What the Devil A gentleman must be waited on I hope It s a part of my character to be waited on He half filled the tumbler as he said it and drank off the contents when he had done saying it Hah smacking his lips Not a very old prisoner that I judge by your looks brave sir that imprisonment will subdue your blood much sooner than it softens this hot wine You are mellowing losing body and colour already I salute you He tossed off another half glass holding it up both before and afterwards so as to display his small white hand To business he then continued To conversation You have shown yourself more free of speech than body sir I have used the freedom of telling you what you know yourself to be You know yourself as we all know you to be far worse than that Add always a gentleman and it s no matter Except in that regard we are all alike For example you couldn t for your life be a gentleman I couldn t for my life be otherwise How great the difference Let us go on Words sir never influence the course of the cards or the course of the dice Do you know that You do I also play a game and words are without power over it Now that he was confronted with Cavalletto and knew that his story was known whatever thin disguise he had worn he dropped and faced it out with a bare face as the infamous wretch he was No my son he resumed with a snap of his fingers I play my game to the end in spite of words and Death of my Body and Death of my Soul I ll win it You want to know why I played this little trick that you have interrupted Know then that I had and that I have do you understand me have a commodity to sell to my lady your respectable mother I described my precious commodity and fixed my price Touching the bargain your admirable mother was a little too calm too stolid too immovable and statue like In fine your admirable mother vexed me To make variety in my position and to amuse myself what a gentleman must be amused at somebody s expense I conceived the happy idea of disappearing An idea see you that your characteristic mother and my Flintwinch would have been well enough pleased to execute Ah Bah bah bah don t look as from high to low at me I repeat it Well enough pleased excessively enchanted and with all their hearts ravished How strongly will you have it He threw out the lees of his glass on the ground so that they nearly spattered Cavalletto This seemed to draw his attention to him anew He set down his glass and said I ll not fill it What I am born to be served Come then you Cavalletto and fill The little man looked at Clennam whose eyes were occupied with Rigaud and seeing no prohibition got up from the ground and poured out from the bottle into the glass The blending as he did so of his old submission with a sense of something humorous the striving of that with a certain smouldering ferocity which might have flashed fire in an instant as the born gentleman seemed to think for he had a wary eye upon him and the easy yielding of all to a good natured careless predominant propensity to sit down on the ground again formed a very remarkable combination of character This happy idea brave sir Rigaud resumed after drinking was a happy idea for several reasons It amused me it worried your dear mama and my Flintwinch it caused you agonies my terms for a lesson in politeness towards a gentleman and it suggested to all the amiable persons interested that your entirely devoted is a man to fear By Heaven he is a man to fear Beyond this it might have restored her wit to my lady your mother might under the pressing little suspicion your wisdom has recognised have persuaded her at last to announce covertly in the journals that the difficulties of a certain contract would be removed by the appearance of a certain important party to it Perhaps yes perhaps no But that you have interrupted Now what is it you say What is it you want Never had Clennam felt more acutely that he was a prisoner in bonds than when he saw this man before him and could not accompany him to his mother s house All the undiscernible difficulties and dangers he had ever feared were closing in when he could not stir hand or foot Perhaps my friend philosopher man of virtue Imbecile what you will perhaps said Rigaud pausing in his drink to look out of his glass with his horrible smile you would have done better to leave me alone No At least said Clennam you are known to be alive and unharmed At least you cannot escape from these two witnesses and they can produce you before any public authorities or before hundreds of people But will not produce me before one said Rigaud snapping his fingers again with an air of triumphant menace To the Devil with your witnesses To the Devil with your produced To the Devil with yourself What Do I know what I know for that Have I my commodity on sale for that Bah poor debtor You have interrupted my little project Let it pass How then What remains To you nothing to me all Produce me Is that what you want I will produce myself only too quickly Contrabandist Give me pen ink and paper Cavalletto got up again as before and laid them before him in his former manner Rigaud after some villainous thinking and smiling wrote and read aloud as follows To missus CLENNAM Wait answer Prison of the Marshalsea At the apartment of your son Dear Madam I am in despair to be informed to day by our prisoner here who has had the goodness to employ spies to seek me living for politic reasons in retirement that you have had fears for my safety Reassure yourself dear madam I am well I am strong and constant With the greatest impatience I should fly to your house but that I foresee it to be possible under the circumstances that you will not yet have quite definitively arranged the little proposition I have had the honour to submit to you I name one week from this day for a last final visit on my part when you will unconditionally accept it or reject it with its train of consequences I suppress my ardour to embrace you and achieve this interesting business in order that you may have leisure to adjust its details to our perfect mutual satisfaction In the meanwhile it is not too much to propose our prisoner having deranged my housekeeping that my expenses of lodging and nourishment at an hotel shall be paid by you Receive dear madam the assurance of my highest and most distinguished consideration RIGAUD BLANDOIS A thousand friendships to that dear Flintwinch I kiss the hands of Madame F When he had finished this epistle Rigaud folded it and tossed it with a flourish at Clennam s feet Hola you Apropos of producing let somebody produce that at its address and produce the answer here Cavalletto said Arthur Will you take this fellow s letter But Cavalletto s significant finger again expressing that his post was at the door to keep watch over Rigaud now he had found him with so much trouble and that the duty of his post was to sit on the floor backed up by the door looking at Rigaud and holding his own ankles Signor Panco once more volunteered His services being accepted Cavalletto suffered the door to open barely wide enough to admit of his squeezing himself out and immediately shut it on him Touch me with a finger touch me with an epithet question my superiority as I sit here drinking my wine at my pleasure said Rigaud and I follow the letter and cancel my week s grace You wanted me You have got me How do you like me You know returned Clennam with a bitter sense of his helplessness that when I sought you I was not a prisoner To the Devil with you and your prison retorted Rigaud leisurely as he took from his pocket a case containing the materials for making cigarettes and employed his facile hands in folding a few for present use I care for neither of you Contrabandist A light Again Cavalletto got up and gave him what he wanted There had been something dreadful in the noiseless skill of his cold white hands with the fingers lithely twisting about and twining one over another like serpents Clennam could not prevent himself from shuddering inwardly as if he had been looking on at a nest of those creatures Hola Pig cried Rigaud with a noisy stimulating cry as if Cavalletto were an Italian horse or mule What The infernal old jail was a respectable one to this There was dignity in the bars and stones of that place It was a prison for men But this Bah A hospital for imbeciles He smoked his cigarette out with his ugly smile so fixed upon his face that he looked as though he were smoking with his drooping beak of a nose rather than with his mouth like a fancy in a weird picture When he had lighted a second cigarette at the still burning end of the first he said to Clennam One must pass the time in the madman s absence One must talk One can t drink strong wine all day long or I would have another bottle She s handsome sir Though not exactly to my taste still by the Thunder and the Lightning handsome I felicitate you on your admiration I neither know nor ask said Clennam of whom you speak Della bella Gowana sir as they say in Italy Of the Gowan the fair Gowan Of whose husband you were the follower I think Sir Follower You are insolent The friend Do you sell all your friends Rigaud took his cigarette from his mouth and eyed him with a momentary revelation of surprise But he put it between his lips again as he answered with coolness I sell anything that commands a price How do your lawyers live your politicians your intriguers your men of the Exchange How do you live How do you come here Have you sold no friend Lady of mine I rather think yes Clennam turned away from him towards the window and sat looking out at the wall Effectively sir said Rigaud Society sells itself and sells me and I sell Society I perceive you have acquaintance with another lady Also handsome A strong spirit Let us see How do they call her Wade He received no answer but could easily discern that he had hit the mark Yes he went on that handsome lady and strong spirit addresses me in the street and I am not insensible I respond That handsome lady and strong spirit does me the favour to remark in full confidence I have my curiosity and I have my chagrins You are not more than ordinarily honourable perhaps I announce myself Madame a gentleman from the birth and a gentleman to the death but NOT more than ordinarily honourable I despise such a weak fantasy Thereupon she is pleased to compliment The difference between you and the rest is she answers that you say so For she knows Society I accept her congratulations with gallantry and politeness Politeness and little gallantries are inseparable from my character She then makes a proposition which is in effect that she has seen us much together that it appears to her that I am for the passing time the cat of the house the friend of the family that her curiosity and her chagrins awaken the fancy to be acquainted with their movements to know the manner of their life how the fair Gowana is beloved how the fair Gowana is cherished and so on She is not rich but offers such and such little recompenses for the little cares and derangements of such services and I graciously to do everything graciously is a part of my character consent to accept them O yes So goes the world It is the mode Though Clennam s back was turned while he spoke and thenceforth to the end of the interview he kept those glittering eyes of his that were too near together upon him and evidently saw in the very carriage of the head as he passed with his braggart recklessness from clause to clause of what he said that he was saying nothing which Clennam did not already know Whoof The fair Gowana he said lighting a third cigarette with a sound as if his lightest breath could blow her away Charming but imprudent For it was not well of the fair Gowana to make mysteries of letters from old lovers in her bedchamber on the mountain that her husband might not see them No no That was not well Whoof The Gowana was mistaken there I earnestly hope cried Arthur aloud that Pancks may not be long gone for this man s presence pollutes the room Ah But he ll flourish here and everywhere said Rigaud with an exulting look and snap of his fingers He always has he always will Stretching his body out on the only three chairs in the room besides that on which Clennam sat he sang smiting himself on the breast as the gallant personage of the song Who passes by this road so late Compagnon de la Majolaine Who passes by this road so late Always gay Sing the Refrain pig You could sing it once in another jail Sing it Or by every Saint who was stoned to death I ll be affronted and compromising and then some people who are not dead yet had better have been stoned along with them Of all the king s knights tis the flower Compagnon de la Majolaine Of all the king s knights tis the flower Always gay Partly in his old habit of submission partly because his not doing it might injure his benefactor and partly because he would as soon do it as anything else Cavalletto took up the Refrain this time Rigaud laughed and fell to smoking with his eyes shut Possibly another quarter of an hour elapsed before mister Pancks s step was heard upon the stairs but the interval seemed to Clennam insupportably long His step was attended by another step and when Cavalletto opened the door he admitted mister Pancks and mister Flintwinch The latter was no sooner visible than Rigaud rushed at him and embraced him boisterously How do you find yourself sir said mister Flintwinch as soon as he could disengage himself which he struggled to do with very little ceremony Thank you no I don t want any more This was in reference to another menace of attention from his recovered friend Well Arthur You remember what I said to you about sleeping dogs and missing ones It s come true you see He was as imperturbable as ever to all appearance and nodded his head in a moralising way as he looked round the room And this is the Marshalsea prison for debt said mister Flintwinch Hah you have brought your pigs to a very indifferent market Arthur If Arthur had patience Rigaud had not He took his little Flintwinch with fierce playfulness by the two lapels of his coat and cried To the Devil with the Market to the Devil with the Pigs and to the Devil with the Pig Driver Now Give me the answer to my letter If you can make it convenient to let go a moment sir returned mister Flintwinch I ll first hand mister Arthur a little note that I have for him He did so It was in his mother s maimed writing on a slip of paper and contained only these words I hope it is enough that you have ruined yourself Rest contented without more ruin Jeremiah Flintwinch is my messenger and representative Your affectionate M C Clennam read this twice in silence and then tore it to pieces Rigaud in the meanwhile stepped into a chair and sat himself on the back with his feet upon the seat Now Beau Flintwinch he said when he had closely watched the note to its destruction the answer to my letter missus Clennam did not write mister Blandois her hands being cramped and she thinking it as well to send it verbally by me mister Flintwinch screwed this out of himself unwillingly and rustily She sends her compliments and says she doesn t on the whole wish to term you unreasonable and that she agrees But without prejudicing the appointment that stands for this day week Monsieur Rigaud after indulging in a fit of laughter descended from his throne saying Good I go to seek an hotel But there his eyes encountered Cavalletto who was still at his post Come Pig he added I have had you for a follower against my will now I ll have you against yours I tell you my little reptiles I am born to be served I demand the service of this contrabandist as my domestic until this day week In answer to Cavalletto s look of inquiry Clennam made him a sign to go but he added aloud unless you are afraid of him Cavalletto replied with a very emphatic finger negative No master I am not afraid of him when I no more keep it secrettementally that he was once my comrade Rigaud took no notice of either remark until he had lighted his last cigarette and was quite ready for walking Afraid of him he said then looking round upon them all Whoof My children my babies my little dolls you are all afraid of him You give him his bottle of wine here you give him meat drink and lodging there you dare not touch him with a finger or an epithet No It is his character to triumph Whoof Of all the king s knights he s the flower And he s always gay With this adaptation of the Refrain to himself he stalked out of the room closely followed by Cavalletto whom perhaps he had pressed into his service because he tolerably well knew it would not be easy to get rid of him mister Flintwinch after scraping his chin and looking about with caustic disparagement of the Pig Market nodded to Arthur and followed mister Pancks still penitent and depressed followed too after receiving with great attention a secret word or two of instructions from Arthur and whispering back that he would see this affair out and stand by it to the end The prisoner with the feeling that he was more despised more scorned and repudiated more helpless altogether more miserable and fallen than before was left alone again CHAPTER twenty nine A Plea in the Marshalsea Haggard anxiety and remorse are bad companions to be barred up with Brooding all day and resting very little indeed at night will not arm a man against misery Next morning Clennam felt that his health was sinking as his spirits had already sunk and that the weight under which he bent was bearing him down Night after night he had risen from his bed of wretchedness at twelve or one o clock and had sat at his window watching the sickly lamps in the yard and looking upward for the first wan trace of day hours before it was possible that the sky could show it to him Now when the night came he could not even persuade himself to undress For a burning restlessness set in an agonised impatience of the prison and a conviction that he was going to break his heart and die there which caused him indescribable suffering His dread and hatred of the place became so intense that he felt it a labour to draw his breath in it The sensation of being stifled sometimes so overpowered him that he would stand at the window holding his throat and gasping At the same time a longing for other air and a yearning to be beyond the blind blank wall made him feel as if he must go mad with the ardour of the desire Many other prisoners had had experience of this condition before him and its violence and continuity had worn themselves out in their cases as they did in his Two nights and a day exhausted it It came back by fits but those grew fainter and returned at lengthening intervals A desolate calm succeeded and the middle of the week found him settled down in the despondency of low slow fever With Cavalletto and Pancks away he had no visitors to fear but mister and missus Plornish His anxiety in reference to that worthy pair was that they should not come near him for in the morbid state of his nerves he sought to be left alone and spared the being seen so subdued and weak He wrote a note to missus Plornish representing himself as occupied with his affairs and bound by the necessity of devoting himself to them to remain for a time even without the pleasant interruption of a sight of her kind face As to Young John who looked in daily at a certain hour when the turnkeys were relieved to ask if he could do anything for him he always made a pretence of being engaged in writing and to answer cheerfully in the negative The subject of their only long conversation had never been revived between them Through all these changes of unhappiness however it had never lost its hold on Clennam s mind The sixth day of the appointed week was a moist hot misty day It seemed as though the prison s poverty and shabbiness and dirt were growing in the sultry atmosphere With an aching head and a weary heart Clennam had watched the miserable night out listening to the fall of rain on the yard pavement thinking of its softer fall upon the country earth A blurred circle of yellow haze had risen up in the sky in lieu of sun and he had watched the patch it put upon his wall like a bit of the prison s raggedness He had heard the gates open and the badly shod feet that waited outside shuffle in and the sweeping and pumping and moving about begin which commenced the prison morning So ill and faint that he was obliged to rest many times in the process of getting himself washed he had at length crept to his chair by the open window In it he sat dozing while the old woman who arranged his room went through her morning s work Light of head with want of sleep and want of food his appetite and even his sense of taste having forsaken him he had been two or three times conscious in the night of going astray He had heard fragments of tunes and songs in the warm wind which he knew had no existence Now that he began to doze in exhaustion he heard them again and voices seemed to address him and he answered and started Dozing and dreaming without the power of reckoning time so that a minute might have been an hour and an hour a minute some abiding impression of a garden stole over him a garden of flowers with a damp warm wind gently stirring their scents It required such a painful effort to lift his head for the purpose of inquiring into this or inquiring into anything that the impression appeared to have become quite an old and importunate one when he looked round Beside the tea cup on his table he saw then a blooming nosegay a wonderful handful of the choicest and most lovely flowers Nothing had ever appeared so beautiful in his sight He took them up and inhaled their fragrance and he lifted them to his hot head and he put them down and opened his parched hands to them as cold hands are opened to receive the cheering of a fire It was not until he had delighted in them for some time that he wondered who had sent them and opened his door to ask the woman who must have put them there how they had come into her hands But she was gone and seemed to have been long gone for the tea she had left for him on the table was cold He tried to drink some but could not bear the odour of it so he crept back to his chair by the open window and put the flowers on the little round table of old When the first faintness consequent on having moved about had left him he subsided into his former state One of the night tunes was playing in the wind when the door of his room seemed to open to a light touch and after a moment s pause a quiet figure seemed to stand there with a black mantle on it It seemed to draw the mantle off and drop it on the ground and then it seemed to be his Little Dorrit in her old worn dress It seemed to tremble and to clasp its hands and to smile and to burst into tears He roused himself and cried out And then he saw in the loving pitying sorrowing dear face as in a mirror how changed he was and she came towards him and with her hands laid on his breast to keep him in his chair and with her knees upon the floor at his feet and with her lips raised up to kiss him and with her tears dropping on him as the rain from Heaven had dropped upon the flowers Little Dorrit a living presence called him by his name O my best friend Dear mister Clennam don t let me see you weep Unless you weep with pleasure to see me I hope you do Your own poor child come back So faithful tender and unspoiled by Fortune In the sound of her voice in the light of her eyes in the touch of her hands so Angelically comforting and true As he embraced her she said to him They never told me you were ill and drawing an arm softly round his neck laid his head upon her bosom put a hand upon his head and resting her cheek upon that hand nursed him as lovingly and GOD knows as innocently as she had nursed her father in that room when she had been but a baby needing all the care from others that she took of them When he could speak he said Is it possible that you have come to me And in this dress I hoped you would like me better in this dress than any other I have always kept it by me to remind me though I wanted no reminding I am not alone you see I have brought an old friend with me Looking round he saw Maggy in her big cap which had been long abandoned with a basket on her arm as in the bygone days chuckling rapturously It was only yesterday evening that I came to London with my brother I sent round to missus Plornish almost as soon as we arrived that I might hear of you and let you know I had come Then I heard that you were here Did you happen to think of me in the night I almost believe you must have thought of me a little I thought of you so anxiously and it appeared so long to morning I have thought of you he hesitated what to call her She perceived it in an instant You have not spoken to me by my right name yet You know what my right name always is with you I have thought of you Little Dorrit every day every hour every minute since I have been here Have you Have you He saw the bright delight of her face and the flush that kindled in it with a feeling of shame He a broken bankrupt sick dishonoured prisoner I was here before the gates were opened but I was afraid to come straight to you I should have done you more harm than good at first for the prison was so familiar and yet so strange and it brought back so many remembrances of my poor father and of you too that at first it overpowered me But we went to mister Chivery before we came to the gate and he brought us in and got John s room for us my poor old room you know and we waited there a little I brought the flowers to the door but you didn t hear me She looked something more womanly than when she had gone away and the ripening touch of the Italian sun was visible upon her face But otherwise she was quite unchanged The same deep timid earnestness that he had always seen in her and never without emotion he saw still If it had a new meaning that smote him to the heart the change was in his perception not in her She took off her old bonnet hung it in the old place and noiselessly began with Maggy s help to make his room as fresh and neat as it could be made and to sprinkle it with a pleasant smelling water When that was done the basket which was filled with grapes and other fruit was unpacked and all its contents were quietly put away When that was done a moment s whisper despatched Maggy to despatch somebody else to fill the basket again which soon came back replenished with new stores from which a present provision of cooling drink and jelly and a prospective supply of roast chicken and wine and water were the first extracts These various arrangements completed she took out her old needle case to make him a curtain for his window and thus with a quiet reigning in the room that seemed to diffuse itself through the else noisy prison he found himself composed in his chair with Little Dorrit working at his side To see the modest head again bent down over its task and the nimble fingers busy at their old work though she was not so absorbed in it but that her compassionate eyes were often raised to his face and when they drooped again had tears in them to be so consoled and comforted and to believe that all the devotion of this great nature was turned to him in his adversity to pour out its inexhaustible wealth of goodness upon him did not steady Clennam s trembling voice or hand or strengthen him in his weakness Yet it inspired him with an inward fortitude that rose with his love And how dearly he loved her now what words can tell As they sat side by side in the shadow of the wall the shadow fell like light upon him She would not let him speak much and he lay back in his chair looking at her Now and again she would rise and give him the glass that he might drink or would smooth the resting place of his head then she would gently resume her seat by him and bend over her work again The shadow moved with the sun but she never moved from his side except to wait upon him The sun went down and she was still there She had done her work now and her hand faltering on the arm of his chair since its last tending of him was hesitating there yet He laid his hand upon it and it clasped him with a trembling supplication Dear mister Clennam I must say something to you before I go I have put it off from hour to hour but I must say it I too dear Little Dorrit I have put off what I must say She nervously moved her hand towards his lips as if to stop him then it dropped trembling into its former place I am not going abroad again My brother is but I am not He was always attached to me and he is so grateful to me now so much too grateful for it is only because I happened to be with him in his illness that he says I shall be free to stay where I like best and to do what I like best He only wishes me to be happy he says There was one bright star shining in the sky She looked up at it While she spoke as if it were the fervent purpose of her own heart shining above her You will understand I dare say without my telling you that my brother has come home to find my dear father s will and to take possession of his property He says if there is a will he is sure I shall be left rich and if there is none that he will make me so He would have spoken but she put up her trembling hand again and he stopped I have no use for money I have no wish for it It would be of no value at all to me but for your sake I could not be rich and you here I must always be much worse than poor with you distressed Will you let me lend you all I have Will you let me give it you Will you let me show you that I have never forgotten that I never can forget your protection of me when this was my home Dear mister Clennam make me of all the world the happiest by saying Yes Make me as happy as I can be in leaving you here by saying nothing to night and letting me go away with the hope that you will think of it kindly and that for my sake not for yours for mine for nobody s but mine you will give me the greatest joy I can experience on earth the joy of knowing that I have been serviceable to you and that I have paid some little of the great debt of my affection and gratitude I can t say what I wish to say I can t visit you here where I have lived so long I can t think of you here where I have seen so much and be as calm and comforting as I ought My tears will make their way I cannot keep them back But pray pray pray do not turn from your Little Dorrit now in your affliction Pray pray pray I beg you and implore you with all my grieving heart my friend my dear take all I have and make it a Blessing to me The star had shone on her face until now when her face sank upon his hand and her own It had grown darker when he raised her in his encircling arm and softly answered her No darling Little Dorrit No my child I must not hear of such a sacrifice Liberty and hope would be so dear bought at such a price that I could never support their weight never bear the reproach of possessing them But with what ardent thankfulness and love I say this I may call Heaven to witness And yet you will not let me be faithful to you in your affliction Say dearest Little Dorrit and yet I will try to be faithful to you If in the bygone days when this was your home and when this was your dress I had understood myself I speak only of myself better and had read the secrets of my own breast more distinctly if through my reserve and self mistrust I had discerned a light that I see brightly now when it has passed far away and my weak footsteps can never overtake it if I had then known and told you that I loved and honoured you not as the poor child I used to call you but as a woman whose true hand would raise me high above myself and make me a far happier and better man if I had so used the opportunity there is no recalling as I wish I had O I wish I had and if something had kept us apart then when I was moderately thriving and when you were poor I might have met your noble offer of your fortune dearest girl with other words than these and still have blushed to touch it But as it is I must never touch it never She besought him more pathetically and earnestly with her little supplicatory hand than she could have done in any words I am disgraced enough my Little Dorrit I must not descend so low as that and carry you so dear so generous so good down with me GOD bless you GOD reward you It is past He took her in his arms as if she had been his daughter Always so much older so much rougher and so much less worthy even what I was must be dismissed by both of us and you must see me only as I am I put this parting kiss upon your cheek my child who might have been more near to me who never could have been more dear a ruined man far removed from you for ever separated from you whose course is run while yours is but beginning I have not the courage to ask to be forgotten by you in my humiliation but I ask to be remembered only as I am The bell began to ring warning visitors to depart He took her mantle from the wall and tenderly wrapped it round her One other word my Little Dorrit A hard one to me but it is a necessary one The time when you and this prison had anything in common has long gone by Do you understand O you will never say to me she cried weeping bitterly and holding up her clasped hands in entreaty that I am not to come back any more You will surely not desert me so I would say it if I could but I have not the courage quite to shut out this dear face and abandon all hope of its return But do not come soon do not come often This is now a tainted place and I well know the taint of it clings to me You belong to much brighter and better scenes You are not to look back here my Little Dorrit you are to look away to very different and much happier paths Again GOD bless you in them GOD reward you Maggy who had fallen into very low spirits here cried Oh get him into a hospital do get him into a hospital Mother He ll never look like hisself again if he an t got into a hospital And then the little woman as was always a spinning at her wheel she can go to the cupboard with the Princess and say what do you keep the Chicking there for and then they can take it out and give it to him and then all be happy The interruption was seasonable for the bell had nearly rung itself out Again tenderly wrapping her mantle about her and taking her on his arm though but for her visit he was almost too weak to walk Arthur led Little Dorrit down stairs She was the last visitor to pass out at the Lodge and the gate jarred heavily and hopelessly upon her With the funeral clang that it sounded into Arthur s heart his sense of weakness returned It was a toilsome journey up stairs to his room and he re entered its dark solitary precincts in unutterable misery When it was almost midnight and the prison had long been quiet a cautious creak came up the stairs and a cautious tap of a key was given at his door It was Young John He glided in in his stockings and held the door closed while he spoke in a whisper It s against all rules but I don t mind I was determined to come through and come to you What is the matter Nothing s the matter sir I was waiting in the court yard for Miss Dorrit when she came out I thought you d like some one to see that she was safe Thank you thank you You took her home John I saw her to her hotel The same that mister Dorrit was at Miss Dorrit walked all the way and talked to me so kind it quite knocked me over Why do you think she walked instead of riding I don t know John To talk about you She said to me John you was always honourable and if you ll promise me that you will take care of him and never let him want for help and comfort when I am not there my mind will be at rest so far I promised her And I ll stand by you said John Chivery for ever Clennam much affected stretched out his hand to this honest spirit Before I take it said John looking at it without coming from the door guess what message Miss Dorrit gave me Clennam shook his head Tell him repeated John in a distinct though quavering voice that his Little Dorrit sent him her undying love Now it s delivered Have I been honourable sir Very very Will you tell Miss Dorrit I ve been honourable sir I will indeed There s my hand sir said John and I ll stand by you forever After a hearty squeeze he disappeared with the same cautious creak upon the stair crept shoeless over the pavement of the yard and locking the gates behind him passed out into the front where he had left his shoes If the same way had been paved with burning ploughshares it is not at all improbable that John would have traversed it with the same devotion for the same purpose CHAPTER thirty Closing in The last day of the appointed week touched the bars of the Marshalsea gate Black all night since the gate had clashed upon Little Dorrit its iron stripes were turned by the early glowing sun into stripes of gold Far aslant across the city over its jumbled roofs and through the open tracery of its church towers struck the long bright rays bars of the prison of this lower world Throughout the day the old house within the gateway remained untroubled by any visitors But when the sun was low three men turned in at the gateway and made for the dilapidated house Rigaud was the first and walked by himself smoking mister Baptist was the second and jogged close after him looking at no other object mister Pancks was the third and carried his hat under his arm for the liberation of his restive hair the weather being extremely hot They all came together at the door steps You pair of madmen said Rigaud facing about Don t go yet We don t mean to said mister Pancks Giving him a dark glance in acknowledgment of his answer Rigaud knocked loudly He had charged himself with drink for the playing out of his game and was impatient to begin He had hardly finished one long resounding knock when he turned to the knocker again and began another That was not yet finished when Jeremiah Flintwinch opened the door and they all clanked into the stone hall Rigaud thrusting mister Flintwinch aside proceeded straight up stairs His two attendants followed him mister Flintwinch followed them and they all came trooping into missus Clennam s quiet room It was in its usual state except that one of the windows was wide open and Affery sat on its old fashioned window seat mending a stocking The usual articles were on the little table the usual deadened fire was in the grate the bed had its usual pall upon it and the mistress of all sat on her black bier like sofa propped up by her black angular bolster that was like the headsman s block Yet there was a nameless air of preparation in the room as if it were strung up for an occasion From what the room derived it every one of its small variety of objects being in the fixed spot it had occupied for years no one could have said without looking attentively at its mistress and that too with a previous knowledge of her face Although her unchanging black dress was in every plait precisely as of old and her unchanging attitude was rigidly preserved a very slight additional setting of her features and contraction of her gloomy forehead was so powerfully marked that it marked everything about her Who are these she said wonderingly as the two attendants entered What do these people want here Who are these dear madame is it returned Rigaud Faith they are friends of your son the prisoner And what do they want here is it Death madame I don t know You will do well to ask them You know you told us at the door not to go yet said Pancks And you know you told me at the door you didn t mean to go retorted Rigaud In a word madame permit me to present two spies of the prisoner s madmen but spies If you wish them to remain here during our little conversation say the word It is nothing to me Why should I wish them to remain here said missus Clennam What have I to do with them Then dearest madame said Rigaud throwing himself into an arm chair so heavily that the old room trembled you will do well to dismiss them It is your affair They are not my spies not my rascals Hark You Pancks said missus Clennam bending her brows upon him angrily you Casby s clerk Attend to your employer s business and your own Go And take that other man with you Thank you ma am returned mister Pancks I am glad to say I see no objection to our both retiring We have done all we undertook to do for mister Clennam His constant anxiety has been and it grew worse upon him when he became a prisoner that this agreeable gentleman should be brought back here to the place from which he slipped away Here he is brought back And I will say added mister Pancks to his ill looking face that in my opinion the world would be no worse for his slipping out of it altogether Your opinion is not asked answered missus Clennam Go I am sorry not to leave you in better company ma am said Pancks and sorry too that mister Clennam can t be present It s my fault that is You mean his own she returned No I mean mine ma am said Pancks for it was my misfortune to lead him into a ruinous investment mister Pancks still clung to that word and never said speculation Though I can prove by figures added mister Pancks with an anxious countenance that it ought to have been a good investment I have gone over it since it failed every day of my life and it comes out regarded as a question of figures triumphant The present is not a time or place mister Pancks pursued with a longing glance into his hat where he kept his calculations for entering upon the figures but the figures are not to be disputed mister Clennam ought to have been at this moment in his carriage and pair and I ought to have been worth from three to five thousand pound mister Pancks put his hair erect with a general aspect of confidence that could hardly have been surpassed if he had had the amount in his pocket These incontrovertible figures had been the occupation of every moment of his leisure since he had lost his money and were destined to afford him consolation to the end of his days However said mister Pancks enough of that Altro old boy you have seen the figures and you know how they come out mister Baptist who had not the slightest arithmetical power of compensating himself in this way nodded with a fine display of bright teeth At whom mister Flintwinch had been looking and to whom he then said Oh it s you is it I thought I remembered your face but I wasn t certain till I saw your teeth Ah yes to be sure It was this officious refugee said Jeremiah to missus Clennam who came knocking at the door on the night when Arthur and Chatterbox were here and who asked me a whole Catechism of questions about mister Blandois It is true mister Baptist cheerfully admitted And behold him padrone I have found him consequentementally I shouldn t have objected returned mister Flintwinch to your having broken your neck consequentementally And now said mister Pancks whose eye had often stealthily wandered to the window seat and the stocking that was being mended there I ve only one other word to say before I go If mister Clennam was here but unfortunately though he has so far got the better of this fine gentleman as to return him to this place against his will he is ill and in prison ill and in prison poor fellow if he was here said mister Pancks taking one step aside towards the window seat and laying his right hand upon the stocking he would say Affery tell your dreams mister Pancks held up his right forefinger between his nose and the stocking with a ghostly air of warning turned steamed out and towed mister Baptist after him The house door was heard to close upon them their steps were heard passing over the dull pavement of the echoing court yard and still nobody had added a word missus Clennam and Jeremiah had exchanged a look and had then looked and looked still at Affery who sat mending the stocking with great assiduity Come said mister Flintwinch at length screwing himself a curve or two in the direction of the window seat and rubbing the palms of his hands on his coat tail as if he were preparing them to do something Whatever has to be said among us had better be begun to be said without more loss of time So Affery my woman take yourself away In a moment Affery had thrown the stocking down started up caught hold of the windowsill with her right hand lodged herself upon the window seat with her right knee and was flourishing her left hand beating expected assailants off No I won t Jeremiah no I won t no I won t I won t go I ll stay here I ll hear all I don t know and say all I know I will at last if I die for it I will I will I will I will mister Flintwinch stiffening with indignation and amazement moistened the fingers of one hand at his lips softly described a circle with them in the palm of the other hand and continued with a menacing grin to screw himself in the direction of his wife gasping some remark as he advanced of which in his choking anger only the words Such a dose were audible Not a bit nearer Jeremiah cried Affery never ceasing to beat the air Don t come a bit nearer to me or I ll rouse the neighbourhood I ll throw myself out of window I ll scream Fire and Murder I ll wake the dead Stop where you are or I ll make shrieks enough to wake the dead The determined voice of missus Clennam echoed Stop Jeremiah had stopped already It is closing in Flintwinch Let her alone Affery do you turn against me after these many years I do if it s turning against you to hear what I don t know and say what I know I have broke out now and I can t go back I am determined to do it I will do it I will I will I will If that s turning against you yes I turn against both of you two clever ones I told Arthur when he first come home to stand up against you I told him it was no reason because I was afeard of my life of you that he should be All manner of things have been a going on since then and I won t be run up by Jeremiah nor yet I won t be dazed and scared nor made a party to I don t know what no more I won t I won t I won t I ll up for Arthur when he has nothing left and is ill and in prison and can t up for himself I will I will I will I will How do you know you heap of confusion asked missus Clennam sternly that in doing what you are doing now you are even serving Arthur I don t know nothing rightly about anything said Affery and if ever you said a true word in your life it s when you call me a heap of confusion for you two clever ones have done your most to make me such You married me whether I liked it or not and you ve led me pretty well ever since such a life of dreaming and frightening as never was known and what do you expect me to be but a heap of confusion You wanted to make me such and I am such but I won t submit no longer no I won t I won t I won t I won t She was still beating the air against all comers After gazing at her in silence missus Clennam turned to Rigaud You see and hear this foolish creature Do you object to such a piece of distraction remaining where she is I madame he replied do I That s a question for you I do not she said gloomily There is little left to choose now Flintwinch it is closing in mister Flintwinch replied by directing a look of red vengeance at his wife and then as if to pinion himself from falling upon her screwed his crossed arms into the breast of his waistcoat and with his chin very near one of his elbows stood in a corner watching Rigaud in the oddest attitude Rigaud for his part arose from his chair and seated himself on the table with his legs dangling In this easy attitude he met missus Clennam s set face with his moustache going up and his nose coming down Madame I am a gentleman Of whom she interrupted in her steady tones I have heard disparagement in connection with a French jail and an accusation of murder He kissed his hand to her with his exaggerated gallantry Perfectly Exactly Of a lady too What absurdity How incredible I had the honour of making a great success then I hope to have the honour of making a great success now I kiss your hands Madame I am a gentleman I was going to observe who when he says I will definitely finish this or that affair at the present sitting does definitely finish it I announce to you that we are arrived at our last sitting on our little business You do me the favour to follow and to comprehend She kept her eyes fixed upon him with a frown Yes Further I am a gentleman to whom mere mercenary trade bargains are unknown but to whom money is always acceptable as the means of pursuing his pleasures You do me the favour to follow and to comprehend Scarcely necessary to ask one would say Yes Further I am a gentleman of the softest and sweetest disposition but who if trifled with becomes enraged Noble natures under such circumstances become enraged I possess a noble nature When the lion is awakened that is to say when I enrage the satisfaction of my animosity is as acceptable to me as money You always do me the favour to follow and to comprehend Yes she answered somewhat louder than before Do not let me derange you pray be tranquil I have said we are now arrived at our last sitting Allow me to recall the two sittings we have held It is not necessary Death madame he burst out it s my fancy Besides it clears the way The first sitting was limited I had the honour of making your acquaintance of presenting my letter I am a Knight of Industry at your service madame but my polished manners had won me so much of success as a master of languages among your compatriots who are as stiff as their own starch is to one another but are ready to relax to a foreign gentleman of polished manners and of observing one or two little things he glanced around the room and smiled about this honourable house to know which was necessary to assure me and to convince me that I had the distinguished pleasure of making the acquaintance of the lady I sought I achieved this I gave my word of honour to our dear Flintwinch that I would return I gracefully departed Her face neither acquiesced nor demurred The same when he paused and when he spoke it as yet showed him always the one attentive frown and the dark revelation before mentioned of her being nerved for the occasion I say gracefully departed because it was graceful to retire without alarming a lady To be morally graceful not less than physically is a part of the character of Rigaud Blandois It was also politic as leaving you with something overhanging you to expect me again with a little anxiety on a day not named But your slave is politic By Heaven madame politic Let us return On the day not named I have again the honour to render myself at your house I intimate that I have something to sell which if not bought will compromise madame whom I highly esteem I explain myself generally I demand I think it was a thousand pounds Will you correct me Thus forced to speak she replied with constraint You demanded as much as a thousand pounds I demand at present Two Such are the evils of delay But to return once more We are not accordant we differ on that occasion I am playful playfulness is a part of my amiable character Playfully I become as one slain and hidden For it may alone be worth half the sum to madame to be freed from the suspicions that my droll idea awakens Accident and spies intermix themselves against my playfulness and spoil the fruit perhaps who knows only you and Flintwinch when it is just ripe Thus madame I am here for the last time Listen Definitely the last As he struck his straggling boot heels against the flap of the table meeting her frown with an insolent gaze he began to change his tone for a fierce one Bah Stop an instant Let us advance by steps Here is my Hotel note to be paid according to contract Five minutes hence we may be at daggers points I ll not leave it till then or you ll cheat me Pay it Count me the money Take it from his hand and pay it Flintwinch said missus Clennam He spirted it into mister Flintwinch s face when the old man advanced to take it and held forth his hand repeating noisily Pay it Count it out Good money Jeremiah picked the bill up looked at the total with a bloodshot eye took a small canvas bag from his pocket and told the amount into his hand Rigaud chinked the money weighed it in his hand threw it up a little way and caught it chinked it again The sound of it to the bold Rigaud Blandois is like the taste of fresh meat to the tiger Say then madame How much He turned upon her suddenly with a menacing gesture of the weighted hand that clenched the money as if he were going to strike her with it I tell you again as I told you before that we are not rich here as you suppose us to be and that your demand is excessive I have not the present means of complying with such a demand if I had ever so great an inclination If cried Rigaud Hear this lady with her If Will you say that you have not the inclination I will say what presents itself to me and not what presents itself to you Say it then As to the inclination Quick Come to the inclination and I know what to do She was no quicker and no slower in her reply It would seem that you have obtained possession of a paper or of papers which I assuredly have the inclination to recover Rigaud with a loud laugh drummed his heels against the table and chinked his money I think so I believe you there The paper might be worth to me a sum of money I cannot say how much or how little What the Devil he asked savagely Not after a week s grace to consider No I will not out of my scanty means for I tell you again we are poor here and not rich I will not offer any price for a power that I do not know the worst and the fullest extent of This is the third time of your hinting and threatening You must speak explicitly or you may go where you will and do what you will It is better to be torn to pieces at a spring than to be a mouse at the caprice of such a cat He looked at her so hard with those eyes too near together that the sinister sight of each crossing that of the other seemed to make the bridge of his hooked nose crooked After a long survey he said with the further setting off of his internal smile You are a bold woman I am a resolved woman You always were What She always was is it not so my little Flintwinch Flintwinch say nothing to him It is for him to say here and now all he can or to go hence and do all he can You know this to be our determination Leave him to his action on it She did not shrink under his evil leer or avoid it He turned it upon her again but she remained steady at the point to which she had fixed herself He got off the table placed a chair near the sofa sat down in it and leaned an arm upon the sofa close to her own which he touched with his hand Her face was ever frowning attentive and settled It is your pleasure then madame that I shall relate a morsel of family history in this little family society said Rigaud with a warning play of his lithe fingers on her arm I am something of a doctor Let me touch your pulse She suffered him to take her wrist in his hand Holding it he proceeded to say A history of a strange marriage and a strange mother and a revenge and a suppression Aye aye aye this pulse is beating curiously It appears to me that it doubles while I touch it Are these the usual changes of your malady madame There was a struggle in her maimed arm as she twisted it away but there was none in her face On his face there was his own smile I have lived an adventurous life I am an adventurous character I have known many adventurers interesting spirits amiable society To one of them I owe my knowledge and my proofs I repeat it estimable lady proofs of the ravishing little family history I go to commence You will be charmed with it But bah I forget One should name a history Shall I name it the history of a house But bah again There are so many houses Shall I name it the history of this house Leaning over the sofa poised on two legs of his chair and his left elbow that hand often tapping her arm to beat his words home his legs crossed his right hand sometimes arranging his hair sometimes smoothing his moustache sometimes striking his nose always threatening her whatever it did coarse insolent rapacious cruel and powerful he pursued his narrative at his ease In fine then I name it the history of this house I commence it There live here let us suppose an uncle and nephew The uncle a rigid old gentleman of strong force of character the nephew habitually timid repressed and under constraint Mistress Affery fixedly attentive in the window seat biting the rolled up end of her apron and trembling from head to foot here cried out Jeremiah keep off from me I ve heerd in my dreams of Arthur s father and his uncle He s a talking of them It was before my time here but I ve heerd in my dreams that Arthur s father was a poor irresolute frightened chap who had had everything but his orphan life scared out of him when he was young and that he had no voice in the choice of his wife even but his uncle chose her There she sits I heerd it in my dreams and you said it to her own self As mister Flintwinch shook his fist at her and as missus Clennam gazed upon her Rigaud kissed his hand to her Perfectly right dear Madame Flintwinch You have a genius for dreaming I don t want none of your praises returned Affery I don t want to have nothing at all to say to you But Jeremiah said they was dreams and I ll tell em as such Here she put her apron in her mouth again as if she were stopping somebody else s mouth perhaps Jeremiah s which was chattering with threats as if he were grimly cold Our beloved Madame Flintwinch said Rigaud developing all of a sudden a fine susceptibility and spirituality is right to a marvel Yes So runs the history Monsieur the uncle commands the nephew to marry Monsieur says to him in effect My nephew I introduce to you a lady of strong force of character like myself a resolved lady a stern lady a lady who has a will that can break the weak to powder a lady without pity without love implacable revengeful cold as the stone but raging as the fire Ah what fortitude Ah what superiority of intellectual strength Truly a proud and noble character that I describe in the supposed words of Monsieur the uncle Ha ha ha Death of my soul I love the sweet lady missus Clennam s face had changed There was a remarkable darkness of colour on it and the brow was more contracted Madame madame said Rigaud tapping her on the arm as if his cruel hand were sounding a musical instrument I perceive I interest you I perceive I awaken your sympathy Let us go on The drooping nose and the ascending moustache had however to be hidden for a moment with the white hand before he could go on he enjoyed the effect he made so much The nephew being as the lucid Madame Flintwinch has remarked a poor devil who has had everything but his orphan life frightened and famished out of him the nephew abases his head and makes response My uncle it is to you to command Do as you will Monsieur the uncle does as he will It is what he always does The auspicious nuptials take place the newly married come home to this charming mansion the lady is received let us suppose by Flintwinch Hey old intriguer Jeremiah with his eyes upon his mistress made no reply Rigaud looked from one to the other struck his ugly nose and made a clucking with his tongue Soon the lady makes a singular and exciting discovery Thereupon full of anger full of jealousy full of vengeance she forms see you madame a scheme of retribution the weight of which she ingeniously forces her crushed husband to bear himself as well as execute upon her enemy What superior intelligence Keep off Jeremiah cried the palpitating Affery taking her apron from her mouth again But it was one of my dreams that you told her when you quarrelled with her one winter evening at dusk there she sits and you looking at her that she oughtn t to have let Arthur when he come home suspect his father only that she had always had the strength and the power and that she ought to have stood up more to Arthur for his father It was in the same dream where you said to her that she was not not something but I don t know what for she burst out tremendous and stopped you You know the dream as well as I do When you come down stairs into the kitchen with the candle in your hand and hitched my apron off my head When you told me I had been dreaming When you wouldn t believe the noises After this explosion Affery put her apron into her mouth again always keeping her hand on the window sill and her knee on the window seat ready to cry out or jump out if her lord and master approached Rigaud had not lost a word of this Haha he cried lifting his eyebrows folding his arms and leaning back in his chair Assuredly Madame Flintwinch is an oracle How shall we interpret the oracle you and I and the old intriguer He said that you were not And you burst out and stopped him What was it you were not What is it you are not Say then madame Under this ferocious banter she sat breathing harder and her mouth was disturbed Her lips quivered and opened in spite of her utmost efforts to keep them still Come then madame Speak then Our old intriguer said that you were not and you stopped him He was going to say that you were not what I know already but I want a little confidence from you How then You are not what She tried again to repress herself but broke out vehemently Not Arthur s mother Good said Rigaud You are amenable With the set expression of her face all torn away by the explosion of her passion and with a bursting from every rent feature of the smouldering fire so long pent up she cried out I will tell it myself I will not hear it from your lips and with the taint of your wickedness upon it Since it must be seen I will have it seen by the light I stood in Not another word Hear me Unless you are a more obstinate and more persisting woman than even I know you to be mister Flintwinch interposed you had better leave mister Rigaud mister Blandois mister Beelzebub to tell it in his own way What does it signify when he knows all about it He does not know all about it He knows all he cares about it mister Flintwinch testily urged He does not know me What do you suppose he cares for you you conceited woman said mister Flintwinch I tell you Flintwinch I will speak I tell you when it has come to this I will tell it with my own lips and will express myself throughout it What Have I suffered nothing in this room no deprivation no imprisonment that I should condescend at last to contemplate myself in such a glass as that Can you see him Can you hear him If your wife were a hundred times the ingrate that she is and if I were a thousand times more hopeless than I am of inducing her to be silent if this man is silenced I would tell it myself before I would bear the torment of the hearing it from him Rigaud pushed his chair a little back pushed his legs out straight before him and sat with his arms folded over against her You do not know what it is she went on addressing him to be brought up strictly and straitly I was so brought up Mine was no light youth of sinful gaiety and pleasure Mine were days of wholesome repression punishment and fear The corruption of our hearts the evil of our ways the curse that is upon us the terrors that surround us these were the themes of my childhood They formed my character and filled me with an abhorrence of evil doers When old mister Gilbert Clennam proposed his orphan nephew to my father for my husband my father impressed upon me that his bringing up had been like mine one of severe restraint He told me that besides the discipline his spirit had undergone he had lived in a starved house where rioting and gaiety were unknown and where every day was a day of toil and trial like the last He told me that he had been a man in years long before his uncle had acknowledged him as one and that from his school days to that hour his uncle s roof has been a sanctuary to him from the contagion of the irreligious and dissolute When within a twelvemonth of our marriage I found my husband at that time when my father spoke of him to have sinned against the Lord and outraged me by holding a guilty creature in my place was I to doubt that it had been appointed to me to make the discovery and that it was appointed to me to lay the hand of punishment upon that creature of perdition Was I to dismiss in a moment not my own wrongs what was I but all the rejection of sin and all the war against it in which I had been bred She laid her wrathful hand upon the watch on the table No Do not forget The initials of those words are within here now and were within here then I was appointed to find the old letter that referred to them and that told me what they meant and whose work they were and why they were worked lying with this watch in his secret drawer But for that appointment there would have been no discovery Do not forget It spoke to me like a voice from an angry cloud Do not forget the deadly sin do not forget the appointed discovery do not forget the appointed suffering I did not forget Was it my own wrong I remembered Mine I was but a servant and a minister What power could I have over them but that they were bound in the bonds of their sin and delivered to me More than forty years had passed over the grey head of this determined woman since the time she recalled More than forty years of strife and struggle with the whisper that by whatever name she called her vindictive pride and rage nothing through all eternity could change their nature Yet gone those more than forty years and come this Nemesis now looking her in the face she still abided by her old impiety still reversed the order of Creation and breathed her own breath into a clay image of her Creator Verily verily travellers have seen many monstrous idols in many countries but no human eyes have ever seen more daring gross and shocking images of the Divine nature than we creatures of the dust make in our own likenesses of our own bad passions When I forced him to give her up to me by her name and place of abode she went on in her torrent of indignation and defence when I accused her and she fell hiding her face at my feet was it my injury that I asserted were they my reproaches that I poured upon her Those who were appointed of old to go to wicked kings and accuse them were they not ministers and servants And had not I unworthy and far removed from them sin to denounce When she pleaded to me her youth and his wretched and hard life that was her phrase for the virtuous training he had belied and the desecrated ceremony of marriage there had secretly been between them and the terrors of want and shame that had overwhelmed them both when I was first appointed to be the instrument of their punishment and the love for she said the word to me down at my feet in which she had abandoned him and left him to me was it my enemy that became my footstool were they the words of my wrath that made her shrink and quiver Not unto me the strength be ascribed not unto me the wringing of the expiation Many years had come and gone since she had had the free use even of her fingers but it was noticeable that she had already more than once struck her clenched hand vigorously upon the table and that when she said these words she raised her whole arm in the air as though it had been a common action with her And what was the repentance that was extorted from the hardness of her heart and the blackness of her depravity I vindictive and implacable It may be so to such as you who know no righteousness and no appointment except Satan s Laugh but I will be known as I know myself and as Flintwinch knows me though it is only to you and this half witted woman Add to yourself madame said Rigaud I have my little suspicions that madame is rather solicitous to be justified to herself It is false It is not so I have no need to be she said with great energy and anger Truly retorted Rigaud Hah I ask what was the penitence in works that was demanded of her You have a child I have none You love that child Give him to me He shall believe himself to be my son and he shall be believed by every one to be my son To save you from exposure his father shall swear never to see or communicate with you more equally to save him from being stripped by his uncle and to save your child from being a beggar you shall swear never to see or communicate with either of them more That done and your present means derived from my husband renounced I charge myself with your support You may with your place of retreat unknown then leave if you please uncontradicted by me the lie that when you passed out of all knowledge but mine you merited a good name That was all She had to sacrifice her sinful and shameful affections no more She was then free to bear her load of guilt in secret and to break her heart in secret and through such present misery light enough for her I think to purchase her redemption from endless misery if she could If in this I punished her here did I not open to her a way hereafter If she knew herself to be surrounded by insatiable vengeance and unquenchable fires were they mine If I threatened her then and afterwards with the terrors that encompassed her did I hold them in my right hand She turned the watch upon the table and opened it and with an unsoftening face looked at the worked letters within They did not forget It is appointed against such offences that the offenders shall not be able to forget If the presence of Arthur was a daily reproach to his father and if the absence of Arthur was a daily agony to his mother that was the just dispensation of Jehovah As well might it be charged upon me that the stings of an awakened conscience drove her mad and that it was the will of the Disposer of all things that she should live so many years I devoted myself to reclaim the otherwise predestined and lost boy to give him the reputation of an honest origin to bring him up in fear and trembling and in a life of practical contrition for the sins that were heavy on his head before his entrance into this condemned world Was that a cruelty Was I too not visited with consequences of the original offence in which I had no complicity Arthur s father and I lived no further apart with half the globe between us than when we were together in this house He died and sent this watch back to me with its Do not forget I do NOT forget though I do not read it as he did I read in it that I was appointed to do these things I have so read these three letters since I have had them lying on this table and I did so read them with equal distinctness when they were thousands of miles away As she took the watch case in her hand with that new freedom in the use of her hand of which she showed no consciousness whatever bending her eyes upon it as if she were defying it to move her Rigaud cried with a loud and contemptuous snapping of his fingers Come madame Time runs out Come lady of piety it must be You can tell nothing I don t know Come to the money stolen or I will Death of my soul I have had enough of your other jargon Come straight to the stolen money Wretch that you are she answered and now her hands clasped her head through what fatal error of Flintwinch s through what incompleteness on his part who was the only other person helping in these things and trusted with them through whose and what bringing together of the ashes of a burnt paper you have become possessed of that codicil I know no more than how you acquired the rest of your power here And yet interrupted Rigaud it is my odd fortune to have by me in a convenient place that I know of that same short little addition to the will of Monsieur Gilbert Clennam written by a lady and witnessed by the same lady and our old intriguer Ah bah old intriguer crooked little puppet Madame let us go on Time presses You or I to finish I she answered with increased determination if it were possible I because I will not endure to be shown myself and have myself shown to any one with your horrible distortion upon me You with your practices of infamous foreign prisons and galleys would make it the money that impelled me It was not the money Bah bah bah I repudiate for the moment my politeness and say Lies lies lies You know you suppressed the deed and kept the money Not for the money s sake wretch She made a struggle as if she were starting up even as if in her vehemence she had almost risen on her disabled feet If Gilbert Clennam reduced to imbecility at the point of death and labouring under the delusion of some imaginary relenting towards a girl of whom he had heard that his nephew had once had a fancy for her which he had crushed out of him and that she afterwards drooped away into melancholy and withdrawal from all who knew her if in that state of weakness he dictated to me whose life she had darkened with her sin and who had been appointed to know her wickedness from her own hand and her own lips a bequest meant as a recompense to her for supposed unmerited suffering was there no difference between my spurning that injustice and coveting mere money a thing which you and your comrades in the prisons may steal from anyone Time presses madame Take care If this house was blazing from the roof to the ground she returned I would stay in it to justify myself against my righteous motives being classed with those of stabbers and thieves Rigaud snapped his fingers tauntingly in her face One thousand guineas to the little beauty you slowly hunted to death One thousand guineas to the youngest daughter her patron might have at fifty or if he had none brother s youngest daughter on her coming of age as the remembrance his disinterestedness may like best of his protection of a friendless young orphan girl Two thousand guineas What You will never come to the money That patron she was vehemently proceeding when he checked her Names Call him mister Frederick Dorrit No more evasions That Frederick Dorrit was the beginning of it all If he had not been a player of music and had not kept in those days of his youth and prosperity an idle house where singers and players and such like children of Evil turned their backs on the Light and their faces to the Darkness she might have remained in her lowly station and might not have been raised out of it to be cast down But no Satan entered into that Frederick Dorrit and counselled him that he was a man of innocent and laudable tastes who did kind actions and that here was a poor girl with a voice for singing music with Then he is to have her taught Then Arthur s father who has all along been secretly pining in the ways of virtuous ruggedness for those accursed snares which are called the Arts becomes acquainted with her And so a graceless orphan training to be a singing girl carries it by that Frederick Dorrit s agency against me and I am humbled and deceived Not I that is to say she added quickly as colour flushed into her face a greater than I What am I Jeremiah Flintwinch who had been gradually screwing himself towards her and who was now very near her elbow without her knowing it made a specially wry face of objection when she said these words and moreover twitched his gaiters as if such pretensions were equivalent to little barbs in his legs Lastly she continued for I am at the end of these things and I will say no more of them and you shall say no more of them and all that remains will be to determine whether the knowledge of them can be kept among us who are here present lastly when I suppressed that paper with the knowledge of Arthur s father But not with his consent you know said mister Flintwinch Who said with his consent She started to find Jeremiah so near her and drew back her head looking at him with some rising distrust You were often enough between us when he would have had me produce it and I would not to have contradicted me if I had said with his consent I say when I suppressed that paper I made no effort to destroy it but kept it by me here in this house many years The rest of the Gilbert property being left to Arthur s father I could at any time without unsettling more than the two sums have made a pretence of finding it But besides that I must have supported such pretence by a direct falsehood a great responsibility I have seen no new reason in all the time I have been tried here to bring it to light It was a rewarding of sin the wrong result of a delusion I did what I was appointed to do and I have undergone within these four walls what I was appointed to undergo When the paper was at last destroyed as I thought in my presence she had long been dead and her patron Frederick Dorrit had long been deservedly ruined and imbecile He had no daughter I had found the niece before then and what I did for her was better for her far than the money of which she would have had no good She added after a moment as though she addressed the watch She herself was innocent and I might not have forgotten to relinquish it to her at my death and sat looking at it Shall I recall something to you worthy madame said Rigaud The little paper was in this house on the night when our friend the prisoner jail comrade of my soul came home from foreign countries Shall I recall yet something more to you The little singing bird that never was fledged was long kept in a cage by a guardian of your appointing well enough known to our old intriguer here Shall we coax our old intriguer to tell us when he saw him last I ll tell you cried Affery unstopping her mouth I dreamed it first of all my dreams Jeremiah if you come a nigh me now I ll scream to be heard at saint Paul s The person as this man has spoken of was Jeremiah s own twin brother and he was here in the dead of the night on the night when Arthur come home and Jeremiah with his own hands give him this paper along with I don t know what more and he took it away in an iron box Help Murder Save me from Jere mi ah mister Flintwinch had made a run at her but Rigaud had caught him in his arms midway After a moment s wrestle with him Flintwinch gave up and put his hands in his pockets What cried Rigaud rallying him as he poked and jerked him back with his elbows assault a lady with such a genius for dreaming Ha ha ha Why she ll be a fortune to you as an exhibition All that she dreams comes true Ha ha ha You re so like him Little Flintwinch So like him as I knew him when I first spoke English for him to the host in the Cabaret of the Three Billiard Tables in the little street of the high roofs by the wharf at Antwerp Ah but he was a brave boy to drink Ah but he was a brave boy to smoke Ah but he lived in a sweet bachelor apartment furnished on the fifth floor above the wood and charcoal merchant s and the dress maker s and the chair maker s and the maker of tubs where I knew him too and wherewith his cognac and tobacco he had twelve sleeps a day and one fit until he had a fit too much and ascended to the skies Ha ha ha What does it matter how I took possession of the papers in his iron box Perhaps he confided it to my hands for you perhaps it was locked and my curiosity was piqued perhaps I suppressed it Ha ha ha What does it matter so that I have it safe We are not particular here hey Flintwinch We are not particular here is it not so madame Retiring before him with vicious counter jerks of his own elbows mister Flintwinch had got back into his corner where he now stood with his hands in his pockets taking breath and returning missus Clennam s stare Ha ha ha But what s this cried Rigaud It appears as if you don t know one the other Permit me Madame Clennam who suppresses to present Monsieur Flintwinch who intrigues mister Flintwinch unpocketing one of his hands to scrape his jaw advanced a step or so in that attitude still returning missus Clennam s look and thus addressed her Now I know what you mean by opening your eyes so wide at me but you needn t take the trouble because I don t care for it I ve been telling you for how many years that you re one of the most opinionated and obstinate of women That s what YOU are You call yourself humble and sinful but you are the most Bumptious of your sex That s what YOU are I have told you over and over again when we have had a tiff that you wanted to make everything go down before you but I wouldn t go down before you that you wanted to swallow up everybody alive but I wouldn t be swallowed up alive Why didn t you destroy the paper when you first laid hands upon it I advised you to but no it s not your way to take advice You must keep it forsooth Perhaps you may carry it out at some other time forsooth As if I didn t know better than that I think I see your pride carrying it out with a chance of being suspected of having kept it by you But that s the way you cheat yourself Just as you cheat yourself into making out that you didn t do all this business because you were a rigorous woman all slight and spite and power and unforgiveness but because you were a servant and a minister and were appointed to do it Who are you that you should be appointed to do it That may be your religion but it s my gammon And to tell you all the truth while I am about it said mister Flintwinch crossing his arms and becoming the express image of irascible doggedness I have been rasped rasped these forty years by your taking such high ground even with me who knows better the effect of it being coolly to put me on low ground I admire you very much you are a woman of strong head and great talent but the strongest head and the greatest talent can t rasp a man for forty years without making him sore So I don t care for your present eyes Now I am coming to the paper and mark what I say You put it away somewhere and you kept your own counsel where You re an active woman at that time and if you want to get that paper you can get it But mark There comes a time when you are struck into what you are now and then if you want to get that paper you can t get it So it lies long years in its hiding place At last when we are expecting Arthur home every day and when any day may bring him home and it s impossible to say what rummaging he may make about the house I recommend you five thousand times if you can t get at it to let me get at it that it may be put in the fire But no no one but you knows where it is and that s power and call yourself whatever humble names you will I call you a female Lucifer in appetite for power On a Sunday night Arthur comes home He has not been in this room ten minutes when he speaks of his father s watch You know very well that the Do Not Forget at the time when his father sent that watch to you could only mean the rest of the story being then all dead and over Do Not Forget the suppression Make restitution Arthur s ways have frightened you a bit and the paper shall be burnt after all So before that jumping jade and Jezebel mister Flintwinch grinned at his wife has got you into bed you at last tell me where you have put the paper among the old ledgers in the cellars where Arthur himself went prowling the very next morning But it s not to be burnt on a Sunday night No you are strict you are we must wait over twelve o clock and get into Monday Now all this is a swallowing of me up alive that rasps me so feeling a little out of temper and not being as strict as yourself I take a look at the document before twelve o clock to refresh my memory as to its appearance fold up one of the many yellow old papers in the cellars like it and afterwards when we have got into Monday morning and I have by the light of your lamp to walk from you lying on that bed to this grate make a little exchange like the conjuror and burn accordingly My brother Ephraim the lunatic keeper I wish he had had himself to keep in a strait waistcoat had had many jobs since the close of the long job he got from you but had not done well His wife died not that that was much mine might have died instead and welcome he speculated unsuccessfully in lunatics he got into difficulty about over roasting a patient to bring him to reason and he got into debt He was going out of the way on what he had been able to scrape up and a trifle from me He was here that early Monday morning waiting for the tide in short he was going to Antwerp where I am afraid you ll be shocked at my saying And be damned to him he made the acquaintance of this gentleman He had come a long way and I thought then was only sleepy but I suppose now was drunk When Arthur s mother had been under the care of him and his wife she had been always writing incessantly writing mostly letters of confession to you and Prayers for forgiveness My brother had handed from time to time lots of these sheets to me I thought I might as well keep them to myself as have them swallowed up alive too so I kept them in a box looking over them when I felt in the humour Convinced that it was advisable to get the paper out of the place with Arthur coming about it I put it into this same box and I locked the whole up with two locks and I trusted it to my brother to take away and keep till I should write about it I did write about it and never got an answer I didn t know what to make of it till this gentleman favoured us with his first visit Of course I began to suspect how it was then and I don t want his word for it now to understand how he gets his knowledge from my papers and your paper and my brother s cognac and tobacco talk I wish he d had to gag himself Now I have only one thing more to say you hammer headed woman and that is that I haven t altogether made up my mind whether I might or might not have ever given you any trouble about the codicil I think not and that I should have been quite satisfied with knowing I had got the better of you and that I held the power over you In the present state of circumstances I have no more explanation to give you till this time to morrow night So you may as well said mister Flintwinch terminating his oration with a screw keep your eyes open at somebody else for it s no use keeping em open at me She slowly withdrew them when he had ceased and dropped her forehead on her hand Her other hand pressed hard upon the table and again the curious stir was observable in her as if she were going to rise This box can never bring elsewhere the price it will bring here This knowledge can never be of the same profit to you sold to any other person as sold to me But I have not the present means of raising the sum you have demanded I have not prospered What will you take now and what at another time and how am I to be assured of your silence My angel said Rigaud I have said what I will take and time presses Before coming here I placed copies of the most important of these papers in another hand Put off the time till the Marshalsea gate shall be shut for the night and it will be too late to treat The prisoner will have read them She put her two hands to her head again uttered a loud exclamation and started to her feet She staggered for a moment as if she would have fallen then stood firm Say what you mean Say what you mean man Before her ghostly figure so long unused to its erect attitude and so stiffened in it Rigaud fell back and dropped his voice It was to all the three almost as if a dead woman had risen Miss Dorrit answered Rigaud the little niece of Monsieur Frederick whom I have known across the water is attached to the prisoner Miss Dorrit little niece of Monsieur Frederick watches at this moment over the prisoner who is ill For her I with my own hands left a packet at the prison on my way here with a letter of instructions FOR HIS SAKE she will do anything for his sake to keep it without breaking the seal in case of its being reclaimed before the hour of shutting up to night if it should not be reclaimed before the ringing of the prison bell to give it to him and it encloses a second copy for herself which he must give to her What I don t trust myself among you now we have got so far without giving my secret a second life And as to its not bringing me elsewhere the price it will bring here say then madame have you limited and settled the price the little niece will give for his sake to hush it up Once more I say time presses The packet not reclaimed before the ringing of the bell to night you cannot buy I sell then to the little girl Once more the stir and struggle in her and she ran to a closet tore the door open took down a hood or shawl and wrapped it over her head Affery who had watched her in terror darted to her in the middle of the room caught hold of her dress and went on her knees to her Don t don t don t What are you doing Where are you going You re a fearful woman but I don t bear you no ill will I can do poor Arthur no good now that I see and you needn t be afraid of me I ll keep your secret Don t go out you ll fall dead in the street Only promise me that if it s the poor thing that s kept here secretly you ll let me take charge of her and be her nurse Only promise me that and never be afraid of me missus Clennam stood still for an instant at the height of her rapid haste saying in stern amazement Kept here She has been dead a score of years or more Ask Flintwinch ask HIM They can both tell you that she died when Arthur went abroad So much the worse said Affery with a shiver for she haunts the house then Who else rustles about it making signals by dropping dust so softly Who else comes and goes and marks the walls with long crooked touches when we are all a bed Who else holds the door sometimes But don t go out don t go out Mistress you ll die in the street Her mistress only disengaged her dress from the beseeching hands said to Rigaud Wait here till I come back and ran out of the room They saw her from the window run wildly through the court yard and out at the gateway For a few moments they stood motionless Affery was the first to move and she wringing her hands pursued her mistress Next Jeremiah Flintwinch slowly backing to the door with one hand in a pocket and the other rubbing his chin twisted himself out in his reticent way speechlessly Rigaud left alone composed himself upon the window seat of the open window in the old Marseilles jail attitude He laid his cigarettes and fire box ready to his hand and fell to smoking Whoof Almost as dull as the infernal old jail Warmer but almost as dismal Wait till she comes back Yes certainly but where is she gone and how long will she be gone No matter Rigaud Lagnier Blandois my amiable subject you will get your money You will enrich yourself You have lived a gentleman you will die a gentleman You triumph my little boy but it is your character to triumph Whoof In the hour of his triumph his moustache went up and his nose came down as he ogled a great beam over his head with particular satisfaction CHAPTER thirty one Closed The sun had set and the streets were dim in the dusty twilight when the figure so long unused to them hurried on its way In the immediate neighbourhood of the old house it attracted little attention for there were only a few straggling people to notice it but ascending from the river by the crooked ways that led to London Bridge and passing into the great main road it became surrounded by astonishment Resolute and wild of look rapid of foot and yet weak and uncertain conspicuously dressed in its black garments and with its hurried head covering gaunt and of an unearthly paleness it pressed forward taking no more heed of the throng than a sleep walker More remarkable by being so removed from the crowd it was among than if it had been lifted on a pedestal to be seen the figure attracted all eyes Saunterers pricked up their attention to observe it busy people crossing it slackened their pace and turned their heads companions pausing and standing aside whispered one another to look at this spectral woman who was coming by and the sweep of the figure as it passed seemed to create a vortex drawing the most idle and most curious after it Made giddy by the turbulent irruption of this multitude of staring faces into her cell of years by the confusing sensation of being in the air and the yet more confusing sensation of being afoot by the unexpected changes in half remembered objects and the want of likeness between the controllable pictures her imagination had often drawn of the life from which she was secluded and the overwhelming rush of the reality she held her way as if she were environed by distracting thoughts rather than by external humanity and observation But having crossed the bridge and gone some distance straight onward she remembered that she must ask for a direction and it was only then when she stopped and turned to look about her for a promising place of inquiry that she found herself surrounded by an eager glare of faces Why are you encircling me she asked trembling None of those who were nearest answered but from the outer ring there arose a shrill cry of Cause you re mad I am sure as sane as any one here I want to find the Marshalsea prison The shrill outer circle again retorted Then that ud show you was mad if nothing else did cause it s right opposite A short mild quiet looking young man made his way through to her as a whooping ensued on this reply and said Was it the Marshalsea you wanted I m going on duty there Come across with me She laid her hand upon his arm and he took her over the way the crowd rather injured by the near prospect of losing her pressing before and behind and on either side and recommending an adjournment to Bedlam After a momentary whirl in the outer court yard the prison door opened and shut upon them In the Lodge which seemed by contrast with the outer noise a place of refuge and peace a yellow lamp was already striving with the prison shadows Why John said the turnkey who admitted them What is it Nothing father only this lady not knowing her way and being badgered by the boys Who did you want ma am Miss Dorrit Is she here The young man became more interested Yes she is here What might your name be missus Clennam mister Clennam s mother asked the young man She pressed her lips together and hesitated Yes She had better be told it is his mother You see said the young man the Marshal s family living in the country at present the Marshal has given Miss Dorrit one of the rooms in his house to use when she likes Don t you think you had better come up there and let me bring Miss Dorrit She signified her assent and he unlocked a door and conducted her up a side staircase into a dwelling house above He showed her into a darkening room and left her The room looked down into the darkening prison yard with its inmates strolling here and there leaning out of windows communing as much apart as they could with friends who were going away and generally wearing out their imprisonment as they best might that summer evening The air was heavy and hot the closeness of the place oppressive and from without there arose a rush of free sounds like the jarring memory of such things in a headache and heartache She stood at the window bewildered looking down into this prison as it were out of her own different prison when a soft word or two of surprise made her start and Little Dorrit stood before her Is it possible missus Clennam that you are so happily recovered as Little Dorrit stopped for there was neither happiness nor health in the face that turned to her This is not recovery it is not strength I don t know what it is With an agitated wave of her hand she put all that aside You have a packet left with you which you were to give to Arthur if it was not reclaimed before this place closed to night Yes I reclaim it Little Dorrit took it from her bosom and gave it into her hand which remained stretched out after receiving it Have you any idea of its contents Frightened by her being there with that new power Of Movement in her which as she said herself was not strength and which was unreal to look upon as though a picture or statue had been animated Little Dorrit answered No Read them Little Dorrit took the packet from the still outstretched hand and broke the seal missus Clennam then gave her the inner packet that was addressed to herself and held the other The shadow of the wall and of the prison buildings which made the room sombre at noon made it too dark to read there with the dusk deepening apace save in the window In the window where a little of the bright summer evening sky could shine upon her Little Dorrit stood and read After a broken exclamation or so of wonder and of terror she read in silence When she had finished she looked round and her old mistress bowed herself before her You know now what I have done I think so I am afraid so though my mind is so hurried and so sorry and has so much to pity that it has not been able to follow all I have read said Little Dorrit tremulously I will restore to you what I have withheld from you Forgive me Can you forgive me I can and Heaven knows I do Do not kiss my dress and kneel to me you are too old to kneel to me I forgive you freely without that I have more yet to ask Not in that posture said Little Dorrit It is unnatural to see your grey hair lower than mine Pray rise let me help you With that she raised her up and stood rather shrinking from her but looking at her earnestly The great petition that I make to you there is another which grows out of it the great supplication that I address to your merciful and gentle heart is that you will not disclose this to Arthur until I am dead If you think when you have had time for consideration that it can do him any good to know it while I am yet alive then tell him But you will not think that and in such case will you promise me to spare me until I am dead I am so sorry and what I have read has so confused my thoughts returned Little Dorrit that I can scarcely give you a steady answer If I should be quite sure that to be acquainted with it will do mister Clennam no good I know you are attached to him and will make him the first consideration It is right that he should be the first consideration I ask that But having regarded him and still finding that you may spare me for the little time I shall remain on earth will you do it I will GOD bless you She stood in the shadow so that she was only a veiled form to Little Dorrit in the light but the sound of her voice in saying those three grateful words was at once fervent and broken broken by emotion as unfamiliar to her frozen eyes as action to her frozen limbs You will wonder perhaps she said in a stronger tone that I can better bear to be known to you whom I have wronged than to the son of my enemy who wronged me For she did wrong me She not only sinned grievously against the Lord but she wronged me What Arthur s father was to me she made him From our marriage day I was his dread and that she made me I was the scourge of both and that is referable to her You love Arthur I can see the blush upon your face may it be the dawn of happier days to both of you and you will have thought already that he is as merciful and kind as you and why do I not trust myself to him as soon as to you Have you not thought so No thought said Little Dorrit can be quite a stranger to my heart that springs out of the knowledge that mister Clennam is always to be relied upon for being kind and generous and good I do not doubt it Yet Arthur is of the whole world the one person from whom I would conceal this while I am in it I kept over him as a child in the days of his first remembrance my restraining and correcting hand I was stern with him knowing that the transgressions of the parents are visited on their offspring and that there was an angry mark upon him at his birth I have sat with him and his father seeing the weakness of his father yearning to unbend to him and forcing it back that the child might work out his release in bondage and hardship I have seen him with his mother s face looking up at me in awe from his little books and trying to soften me with his mother s ways that hardened me The shrinking of her auditress stopped her for a moment in her flow of words delivered in a retrospective gloomy voice For his good Not for the satisfaction of my injury What was I and what was the worth of that before the curse of Heaven I have seen that child grow up not to be pious in a chosen way his mother s influence lay too heavy on him for that but still to be just and upright and to be submissive to me He never loved me as I once half hoped he might so frail we are and so do the corrupt affections of the flesh war with our trusts and tasks but he always respected me and ordered himself dutifully to me He does to this hour With an empty place in his heart that he has never known the meaning of he has turned away from me and gone his separate road but even that he has done considerately and with deference These have been his relations towards me Yours have been of a much slighter kind spread over a much shorter time When you have sat at your needle in my room you have been in fear of me but you have supposed me to have been doing you a kindness you are better informed now and know me to have done you an injury Your misconstruction and misunderstanding of the cause in which and the motives with which I have worked out this work is lighter to endure than his would be I would not for any worldly recompense I can imagine have him in a moment however blindly throw me down from the station I have held before him all his life and change me altogether into something he would cast out of his respect and think detected and exposed Let him do it if it must be done when I am not here to see it Let me never feel while I am still alive that I die before his face and utterly perish away from him like one consumed by lightning and swallowed by an earthquake Her pride was very strong in her the pain of it and of her old passions was very sharp with her when she thus expressed herself Not less so when she added Even now I see YOU shrink from me as if I had been cruel Little Dorrit could not gainsay it She tried not to show it but she recoiled with dread from the state of mind that had burnt so fiercely and lasted so long It presented itself to her with no sophistry upon it in its own plain nature I have done said missus Clennam what it was given to me to do I have set myself against evil not against good I have been an instrument of severity against sin Have not mere sinners like myself been commissioned to lay it low in all time In all time repeated Little Dorrit Even if my own wrong had prevailed with me and my own vengeance had moved me could I have found no justification None in the old days when the innocent perished with the guilty two a thousand to one When the wrath of the hater of the unrighteous was not slaked even in blood and yet found favour O missus Clennam missus Clennam said Little Dorrit angry feelings and unforgiving deeds are no comfort and no guide to you and me My life has been passed in this poor prison and my teaching has been very defective but let me implore you to remember later and better days Be guided only by the healer of the sick the raiser of the dead the friend of all who were afflicted and forlorn the patient Master who shed tears of compassion for our infirmities We cannot but be right if we put all the rest away and do everything in remembrance of Him There is no vengeance and no infliction of suffering in His life I am sure There can be no confusion in following Him and seeking for no other footsteps I am certain In the softened light of the window looking from the scene of her early trials to the shining sky she was not in stronger opposition to the black figure in the shade than the life and doctrine on which she rested were to that figure s history It bent its head low again and said not a word It remained thus until the first warning bell began to ring Hark cried missus Clennam starting I said I had another petition It is one that does not admit of delay The man who brought you this packet and possesses these proofs is now waiting at my house to be bought off I can keep this from Arthur only by buying him off He asks a large sum more than I can get together to pay him without having time He refuses to make any abatement because his threat is that if he fails with me he will come to you Will you return with me and show him that you already know it Will you return with me and try to prevail with him Will you come and help me with him Do not refuse what I ask in Arthur s name though I dare not ask it for Arthur s sake Little Dorrit yielded willingly She glided away into the prison for a few moments returned and said she was ready to go They went out by another staircase avoiding the lodge and coming into the front court yard now all quiet and deserted gained the street It was one of those summer evenings when there is no greater darkness than a long twilight The vista of street and bridge was plain to see and the sky was serene and beautiful People stood and sat at their doors playing with children and enjoying the evening numbers were walking for air the worry of the day had almost worried itself out and few but themselves were hurried As they crossed the bridge the clear steeples of the many churches looked as if they had advanced out of the murk that usually enshrouded them and come much nearer The smoke that rose into the sky had lost its dingy hue and taken a brightness upon it The beauties of the sunset had not faded from the long light films of cloud that lay at peace in the horizon From a radiant centre over the whole length and breadth of the tranquil firmament great shoots of light streamed among the early stars like signs of the blessed later covenant of peace and hope that changed the crown of thorns into a glory Less remarkable now that she was not alone and it was darker missus Clennam hurried on at Little Dorrit s side unmolested They left the great thoroughfare at the turning by which she had entered it and wound their way down among the silent empty cross streets Their feet were at the gateway when there was a sudden noise like thunder What was that Let us make haste in cried missus Clennam They were in the gateway Little Dorrit with a piercing cry held her back In one swift instant the old house was before them with the man lying smoking in the window another thundering sound and it heaved surged outward opened asunder in fifty places collapsed and fell Deafened by the noise stifled choked and blinded by the dust they hid their faces and stood rooted to the spot The dust storm driving between them and the placid sky parted for a moment and showed them the stars As they looked up wildly crying for help the great pile of chimneys which was then alone left standing like a tower in a whirlwind rocked broke and hailed itself down upon the heap of ruin as if every tumbling fragment were intent on burying the crushed wretch deeper So blackened by the flying particles of rubbish as to be unrecognisable they ran back from the gateway into the street crying and shrieking There missus Clennam dropped upon the stones and she never from that hour moved so much as a finger again or had the power to speak one word For upwards of three years she reclined in a wheeled chair looking attentively at those about her and appearing to understand what they said but the rigid silence she had so long held was evermore enforced upon her and except that she could move her eyes and faintly express a negative and affirmative with her head she lived and died a statue Affery had been looking for them at the prison and had caught sight of them at a distance on the bridge She came up to receive her old mistress in her arms to help to carry her into a neighbouring house and to be faithful to her The mystery of the noises was out now Affery like greater people had always been right in her facts and always wrong in the theories she deduced from them When the storm of dust had cleared away and the summer night was calm again numbers of people choked up every avenue of access and parties of diggers were formed to relieve one another in digging among the ruins There had been a hundred people in the house at the time of its fall there had been fifty there had been fifteen there had been two Rumour finally settled the number at two the foreigner and mister Flintwinch The diggers dug all through the short night by flaring pipes of gas and on a level with the early sun and deeper and deeper below it as it rose into its zenith and aslant of it as it declined and on a level with it again as it departed Sturdy digging and shovelling and carrying away in carts barrows and baskets went on without intermission by night and by day but it was night for the second time when they found the dirty heap of rubbish that had been the foreigner before his head had been shivered to atoms like so much glass by the great beam that lay upon him crushing him Still they had not come upon Flintwinch yet so the sturdy digging and shovelling and carrying away went on without intermission by night and by day It got about that the old house had had famous cellarage which indeed was true and that Flintwinch had been in a cellar at the moment or had had time to escape into one and that he was safe under its strong arch and even that he had been heard to cry in hollow subterranean suffocated notes Here I am At the opposite extremity of the town it was even known that the excavators had been able to open a communication with him through a pipe and that he had received both soup and brandy by that channel and that he had said with admirable fortitude that he was All right my lads with the exception of his collar bone But the digging and shovelling and carrying away went on without intermission until the ruins were all dug out and the cellars opened to the light and still no Flintwinch living or dead all right or all wrong had been turned up by pick or spade It began then to be perceived that Flintwinch had not been there at the time of the fall and it began then to be perceived that he had been rather busy elsewhere converting securities into as much money as could be got for them on the shortest notice and turning to his own exclusive account his authority to act for the Firm Affery remembering that the clever one had said he would explain himself further in four and twenty hours time determined for her part that his taking himself off within that period with all he could get was the final satisfactory sum and substance of his promised explanation but she held her peace devoutly thankful to be quit of him As it seemed reasonable to conclude that a man who had never been buried could not be unburied the diggers gave him up when their task was done and did not dig down for him into the depths of the earth This was taken in ill part by a great many people who persisted in believing that Flintwinch was lying somewhere among the London geological formation Nor was their belief much shaken by repeated intelligence which came over in course of time that an old man who wore the tie of his neckcloth under one ear and who was very well known to be an Englishman consorted with the Dutchmen on the quaint banks of the canals of the Hague and in the drinking shops of Amsterdam under the style and designation of Mynheer von Flyntevynge CHAPTER thirty two Going Arthur continuing to lie very ill in the Marshalsea and mister Rugg descrying no break in the legal sky affording a hope of his enlargement mister Pancks suffered desperately from self reproaches If it had not been for those infallible figures which proved that Arthur instead of pining in imprisonment ought to be promenading in a carriage and pair and that mister Pancks instead of being restricted to his clerkly wages ought to have from three to five thousand pounds of his own at his immediate disposal that unhappy arithmetician would probably have taken to his bed and there have made one of the many obscure persons who turned their faces to the wall and died as a last sacrifice to the late mister Merdle s greatness Solely supported by his unimpugnable calculations mister Pancks led an unhappy and restless life constantly carrying his figures about with him in his hat and not only going over them himself on every possible occasion but entreating every human being he could lay hold of to go over them with him and observe what a clear case it was Down in Bleeding Heart Yard there was scarcely an inhabitant of note to whom mister Pancks had not imparted his demonstration and as figures are catching a kind of cyphering measles broke out in that locality under the influence of which the whole Yard was light headed The more restless mister Pancks grew in his mind the more impatient he became of the Patriarch In their later conferences his snorting assumed an irritable sound which boded the Patriarch no good likewise mister Pancks had on several occasions looked harder at the Patriarchal bumps than was quite reconcilable with the fact of his not being a painter or a peruke maker in search of the living model However he steamed in and out of his little back Dock according as he was wanted or not wanted in the Patriarchal presence and business had gone on in its customary course Bleeding Heart Yard had been harrowed by mister Pancks and cropped by mister Casby at the regular seasons mister Pancks had taken all the drudgery and all the dirt of the business as his share mister Casby had taken all the profits all the ethereal vapour and all the moonshine as his share and in the form of words which that benevolent beamer generally employed on Saturday evenings when he twirled his fat thumbs after striking the week s balance everything had been satisfactory to all parties all parties satisfactory sir to all parties The Dock of the Steam Tug Pancks had a leaden roof which frying in the very hot sunshine may have heated the vessel Be that as it may one glowing Saturday evening on being hailed by the lumbering bottle green ship the Tug instantly came working out of the Dock in a highly heated condition mister Pancks was the Patriarchal remark you have been remiss you have been remiss sir What do you mean by that was the short rejoinder The Patriarchal state always a state of calmness and composure was so particularly serene that evening as to be provoking Everybody else within the bills of mortality was hot but the Patriarch was perfectly cool Everybody was thirsty and the Patriarch was drinking There was a fragrance of limes or lemons about him and he made a drink of golden sherry which shone in a large tumbler as if he were drinking the evening sunshine This was bad but not the worst The worst was that with his big blue eyes and his polished head and his long white hair and his bottle green legs stretched out before him terminating in his easy shoes easily crossed at the instep he had a radiant appearance of having in his extensive benevolence made the drink for the human species while he himself wanted nothing but his own milk of human kindness Wherefore mister Pancks said What do you mean by that and put his hair up with both hands in a highly portentous manner I mean mister Pancks that you must be sharper with the people sharper with the people much sharper with the people sir You don t squeeze them You don t squeeze them Your receipts are not up to the mark You must squeeze them sir or our connection will not continue to be as satisfactory as I could wish it to be to all parties All parties Don t I squeeze em retorted mister Pancks What else am I made for You are made for nothing else mister Pancks You are made to do your duty but you don t do your duty You are paid to squeeze and you must squeeze to pay The Patriarch so much surprised himself by this brilliant turn after doctor Johnson which he had not in the least expected or intended that he laughed aloud and repeated with great satisfaction as he twirled his thumbs and nodded at his youthful portrait Paid to squeeze sir and must squeeze to pay Oh said Pancks Anything more Yes sir yes sir Something more You will please mister Pancks to squeeze the Yard again the first thing on Monday morning Oh said Pancks Ain t that too soon I squeezed it dry to day Nonsense sir Not near the mark not near the mark Oh said Pancks watching him as he benevolently gulped down a good draught of his mixture Anything more Yes sir yes sir something more I am not at all pleased mister Pancks with my daughter not at all pleased Besides calling much too often to inquire for missus Clennam missus Clennam who is not just now in circumstances that are by any means calculated to to be satisfactory to all parties she goes mister Pancks unless I am much deceived to inquire for mister Clennam in jail In jail He s laid up you know said Pancks Perhaps it s kind Pooh pooh mister Pancks She has nothing to do with that nothing to do with that I can t allow it Let him pay his debts and come out come out pay his debts and come out Although mister Pancks s hair was standing up like strong wire he gave it another double handed impulse in the perpendicular direction and smiled at his proprietor in a most hideous manner You will please to mention to my daughter mister Pancks that I can t allow it can t allow it said the Patriarch blandly Oh said Pancks You couldn t mention it yourself No sir no you are paid to mention it the blundering old booby could not resist the temptation of trying it again and you must mention it to pay mention it to pay Oh said Pancks Anything more Yes sir It appears to me mister Pancks that you yourself are too often and too much in that direction that direction I recommend you mister Pancks to dismiss from your attention both your own losses and other people s losses and to mind your business mind your business mister Pancks acknowledged this recommendation with such an extraordinarily abrupt short and loud utterance of the monosyllable Oh that even the unwieldy Patriarch moved his blue eyes in something of a hurry to look at him mister Pancks with a sniff of corresponding intensity then added Anything more Not at present sir not at present I am going said the Patriarch finishing his mixture and rising with an amiable air to take a little stroll a little stroll Perhaps I shall find you here when I come back If not sir duty duty squeeze squeeze squeeze on Monday squeeze on Monday mister Pancks after another stiffening of his hair looked on at the Patriarchal assumption of the broad brimmed hat with a momentary appearance of indecision contending with a sense of injury He was also hotter than at first and breathed harder But he suffered mister Casby to go out without offering any further remark and then took a peep at him over the little green window blinds I thought so he observed I knew where you were bound to Good He then steamed back to his Dock put it carefully in order took down his hat looked round the Dock said Good bye and puffed away on his own account He steered straight for missus Plornish s end of Bleeding Heart Yard and arrived there at the top of the steps hotter than ever At the top of the steps resisting missus Plornish s invitations to come and sit along with father in Happy Cottage which to his relief were not so numerous as they would have been on any other night than Saturday when the connection who so gallantly supported the business with everything but money gave their orders freely at the top of the steps mister Pancks remained until he beheld the Patriarch who always entered the Yard at the other end slowly advancing beaming and surrounded by suitors Then mister Pancks descended and bore down upon him with his utmost pressure of steam on The Patriarch approaching with his usual benignity was surprised to see mister Pancks but supposed him to have been stimulated to an immediate squeeze instead of postponing that operation until Monday The population of the Yard were astonished at the meeting for the two powers had never been seen there together within the memory of the oldest Bleeding Heart But they were overcome by unutterable amazement when mister Pancks going close up to the most venerable of men and halting in front of the bottle green waistcoat made a trigger of his right thumb and forefinger applied the same to the brim of the broad brimmed hat and with singular smartness and precision shot it off the polished head as if it had been a large marble Having taken this little liberty with the Patriarchal person mister Pancks further astounded and attracted the Bleeding Hearts by saying in an audible voice Now you sugary swindler I mean to have it out with you mister Pancks and the Patriarch were instantly the centre of a press all eyes and ears windows were thrown open and door steps were thronged What do you pretend to be said mister Pancks What s your moral game What do you go in for Benevolence an t it You benevolent Here mister Pancks apparently without the intention of hitting him but merely to relieve his mind and expend his superfluous power in wholesome exercise aimed a blow at the bumpy head which the bumpy head ducked to avoid This singular performance was repeated to the ever increasing admiration of the spectators at the end of every succeeding article of mister Pancks s oration I have discharged myself from your service said Pancks that I may tell you what you are You re one of a lot of impostors that are the worst lot of all the lots to be met with Speaking as a sufferer by both I don t know that I wouldn t as soon have the Merdle lot as your lot You re a driver in disguise a screwer by deputy a wringer and squeezer and shaver by substitute You re a philanthropic sneak You re a shabby deceiver The repetition of the performance at this point was received with a burst of laughter Ask these good people who s the hard man here They ll tell you Pancks I believe This was confirmed with cries of Certainly and Hear But I tell you good people Casby This mound of meekness this lump of love this bottle green smiler this is your driver said Pancks If you want to see the man who would flay you alive here he is Don t look for him in me at thirty shillings a week but look for him in Casby at I don t know how much a year Good cried several voices Hear mister Pancks Hear mister Pancks cried that gentleman after repeating the popular performance Yes I should think so It s almost time to hear mister Pancks mister Pancks has come down into the Yard to night on purpose that you should hear him Pancks is only the Works but here s the Winder The audience would have gone over to mister Pancks as one man woman and child but for the long grey silken locks and the broad brimmed hat Here s the Stop said Pancks that sets the tune to be ground And there is but one tune and its name is Grind Grind Grind Here s the Proprietor and here s his Grubber Why good people when he comes smoothly spinning through the Yard to night like a slow going benevolent Humming Top and when you come about him with your complaints of the Grubber you don t know what a cheat the Proprietor is What do you think of his showing himself to night that I may have all the blame on Monday What do you think of his having had me over the coals this very evening because I don t squeeze you enough What do you think of my being at the present moment under special orders to squeeze you dry on Monday The reply was given in a murmur of Shame and Shabby Shabby snorted Pancks Yes I should think so The lot that your Casby belongs to is the shabbiest of all the lots Setting their Grubbers on at a wretched pittance to do what they re ashamed and afraid to do and pretend not to do but what they will have done or give a man no rest Imposing on you to give their Grubbers nothing but blame and to give them nothing but credit Why the worst looking cheat in all this town who gets the value of eighteenpence under false pretences an t half such a cheat as this sign post of The Casby s Head here Cries of That s true and No more he an t And see what you get of these fellows besides said Pancks See what more you get of these precious Humming Tops revolving among you with such smoothness that you ve no idea of the pattern painted on em or the little window in em I wish to call your attention to myself for a moment I an t an agreeable style of chap I know that very well The auditory were divided on this point its more uncompromising members crying No you are not and its politer materials Yes you are I am in general said mister Pancks a dry uncomfortable dreary Plodder and Grubber That s your humble servant There s his full length portrait painted by himself and presented to you warranted a likeness But what s a man to be with such a man as this for his Proprietor What can be expected of him Did anybody ever find boiled mutton and caper sauce growing in a cocoa nut None of the Bleeding Hearts ever had it was clear from the alacrity of their response Well said mister Pancks and neither will you find in Grubbers like myself under Proprietors like this pleasant qualities I ve been a Grubber from a boy What has my life been Fag and grind fag and grind turn the wheel turn the wheel I haven t been agreeable to myself and I haven t been likely to be agreeable to anybody else If I was a shilling a week less useful in ten years time this impostor would give me a shilling a week less if as useful a man could be got at sixpence cheaper he would be taken in my place at sixpence cheaper Bargain and sale bless you Fixed principles It s a mighty fine sign post is The Casby s Head said mister Pancks surveying it with anything rather than admiration but the real name of the House is the Sham s Arms Its motto is Keep the Grubber always at it Is any gentleman present said mister Pancks breaking off and looking round acquainted with the English Grammar Bleeding Heart Yard was shy of claiming that acquaintance It s no matter said mister Pancks I merely wish to remark that the task this Proprietor has set me has been never to leave off conjugating the Imperative Mood Present Tense of the verb To keep always at it Keep thou always at it Let him keep always at it Keep we or do we keep always at it Keep ye or do ye or you keep always at it Let them keep always at it Here is your benevolent Patriarch of a Casby and there is his golden rule He is uncommonly improving to look at and I am not at all so He is as sweet as honey and I am as dull as ditch water He provides the pitch and I handle it and it sticks to me Now said mister Pancks closing upon his late Proprietor again from whom he had withdrawn a little for the better display of him to the Yard as I am not accustomed to speak in public and as I have made a rather lengthy speech all circumstances considered I shall bring my observations to a close by requesting you to get out of this The Last of the Patriarchs had been so seized by assault and required so much room to catch an idea in an so much more room to turn it in that he had not a word to offer in reply He appeared to be meditating some Patriarchal way out of his delicate position when mister Pancks once more suddenly applying the trigger to his hat shot it off again with his former dexterity On the preceding occasion one or two of the Bleeding Heart Yarders had obsequiously picked it up and handed it to its owner but mister Pancks had now so far impressed his audience that the Patriarch had to turn and stoop for it himself Quick as lightning mister Pancks who for some moments had had his right hand in his coat pocket whipped out a pair of shears swooped upon the Patriarch behind and snipped off short the sacred locks that flowed upon his shoulders In a paroxysm of animosity and rapidity mister Pancks then caught the broad brimmed hat out of the astounded Patriarch s hand cut it down into a mere stewpan and fixed it on the Patriarch s head Before the frightful results of this desperate action mister Pancks himself recoiled in consternation A bare polled goggle eyed big headed lumbering personage stood staring at him not in the least impressive not in the least venerable who seemed to have started out of the earth to ask what was become of Casby After staring at this phantom in return in silent awe mister Pancks threw down his shears and fled for a place of hiding where he might lie sheltered from the consequences of his crime mister Pancks deemed it prudent to use all possible despatch in making off though he was pursued by nothing but the sound of laughter in Bleeding Heart Yard rippling through the air and making it ring again CHAPTER thirty three Going The changes of a fevered room are slow and fluctuating but the changes of the fevered world are rapid and irrevocable It was Little Dorrit s lot to wait upon both kinds of change The Marshalsea walls during a portion of every day again embraced her in their shadows as their child while she thought for Clennam worked for him watched him and only left him still to devote her utmost love and care to him Her part in the life outside the gate urged its pressing claims upon her too and her patience untiringly responded to them Here was Fanny proud fitful whimsical further advanced in that disqualified state for going into society which had so much fretted her on the evening of the tortoise shell knife resolved always to want comfort resolved not to be comforted resolved to be deeply wronged and resolved that nobody should have the audacity to think her so Here was her brother a weak proud tipsy young old man shaking from head to foot talking as indistinctly as if some of the money he plumed himself upon had got into his mouth and couldn t be got out unable to walk alone in any act of his life and patronising the sister whom he selfishly loved he always had that negative merit ill starred and ill launched Tip because he suffered her to lead him Here was missus Merdle in gauzy mourning the original cap whereof had possibly been rent to pieces in a fit of grief but had certainly yielded to a highly becoming article from the Parisian market warring with Fanny foot to foot and breasting her with her desolate bosom every hour in the day Here was poor mister Sparkler not knowing how to keep the peace between them but humbly inclining to the opinion that they could do no better than agree that they were both remarkably fine women and that there was no nonsense about either of them for which gentle recommendation they united in falling upon him frightfully Then too here was missus General got home from foreign parts sending a Prune and a Prism by post every other day demanding a new Testimonial by way of recommendation to some vacant appointment or other Of which remarkable gentlewoman it may be finally observed that there surely never was a gentlewoman of whose transcendent fitness for any vacant appointment on the face of this earth so many people were as the warmth of her Testimonials evinced so perfectly satisfied or who was so very unfortunate in having a large circle of ardent and distinguished admirers who never themselves happened to want her in any capacity On the first crash of the eminent mister Merdle s decease many important persons had been unable to determine whether they should cut missus Merdle or comfort her As it seemed however essential to the strength of their own case that they should admit her to have been cruelly deceived they graciously made the admission and continued to know her It followed that missus Merdle as a woman of fashion and good breeding who had been sacrificed to the wiles of a vulgar barbarian for mister Merdle was found out from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot the moment he was found out in his pocket must be actively championed by her order for her order s sake She returned this fealty by causing it to be understood that she was even more incensed against the felonious shade of the deceased than anybody else was thus on the whole she came out of her furnace like a wise woman and did exceedingly well mister Sparkler s lordship was fortunately one of those shelves on which a gentleman is considered to be put away for life unless there should be reasons for hoisting him up with the Barnacle crane to a more lucrative height That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours the Standard of four Quarterings and was a perfect Nelson in respect of nailing them to the mast On the profits of his intrepidity missus Sparkler and missus Merdle inhabiting different floors of the genteel little temple of inconvenience to which the smell of the day before yesterday s soup and coach horses was as constant as Death to man arrayed themselves to fight it out in the lists of Society sworn rivals And Little Dorrit seeing all these things as they developed themselves could not but wonder anxiously into what back corner of the genteel establishment Fanny s children would be poked by and by and who would take care of those unborn little victims Arthur being far too ill to be spoken with on subjects of emotion or anxiety and his recovery greatly depending on the repose into which his weakness could be hushed Little Dorrit s sole reliance during this heavy period was on mister Meagles He was still abroad but she had written to him through his daughter immediately after first seeing Arthur in the Marshalsea and since confiding her uneasiness to him on the points on which she was most anxious but especially on one To that one the continued absence of mister Meagles abroad instead of his comforting presence in the Marshalsea was referable Without disclosing the precise nature of the documents that had fallen into Rigaud s hands Little Dorrit had confided the general outline of that story to mister Meagles to whom she had also recounted his fate The old cautious habits of the scales and scoop at once showed mister Meagles the importance of recovering the original papers wherefore he wrote back to Little Dorrit strongly confirming her in the solicitude she expressed on that head and adding that he would not come over to England without making some attempt to trace them out By this time mister Henry Gowan had made up his mind that it would be agreeable to him not to know the Meagleses He was so considerate as to lay no injunctions on his wife in that particular but he mentioned to mister Meagles that personally they did not appear to him to get on together and that he thought it would be a good thing if politely and without any scene or anything of that sort they agreed that they were the best fellows in the world but were best apart Poor mister Meagles who was already sensible that he did not advance his daughter s happiness by being constantly slighted in her presence said Good Henry You are my Pet s husband you have displaced me in the course of nature if you wish it good This arrangement involved the contingent advantage which perhaps Henry Gowan had not foreseen that both mister and missus Meagles were more liberal than before to their daughter when their communication was only with her and her young child and that his high spirit found itself better provided with money without being under the degrading necessity of knowing whence it came mister Meagles at such a period naturally seized an occupation with great ardour He knew from his daughter the various towns which Rigaud had been haunting and the various hotels at which he had been living for some time back The occupation he set himself was to visit these with all discretion and speed and in the event of finding anywhere that he had left a bill unpaid and a box or parcel behind to pay such bill and bring away such box or parcel With no other attendant than Mother mister Meagles went upon his pilgrimage and encountered a number of adventures Not the least of his difficulties was that he never knew what was said to him and that he pursued his inquiries among people who never knew what he said to them Still with an unshaken confidence that the English tongue was somehow the mother tongue of the whole world only the people were too stupid to know it mister Meagles harangued innkeepers in the most voluble manner entered into loud explanations of the most complicated sort and utterly renounced replies in the native language of the respondents on the ground that they were all bosh Sometimes interpreters were called in whom mister Meagles addressed in such idiomatic terms of speech as instantly to extinguish and shut up which made the matter worse On a balance of the account however it may be doubted whether he lost much for although he found no property he found so many debts and various associations of discredit with the proper name which was the only word he made intelligible that he was almost everywhere overwhelmed with injurious accusations On no fewer than four occasions the police were called in to receive denunciations of mister Meagles as a Knight of Industry a good for nothing and a thief all of which opprobrious language he bore with the best temper having no idea what it meant and was in the most ignominious manner escorted to steam boats and public carriages to be got rid of talking all the while like a cheerful and fluent Briton as he was with Mother under his arm But in his own tongue and in his own head mister Meagles was a clear shrewd persevering man When he had worked round as he called it to Paris in his pilgrimage and had wholly failed in it so far he was not disheartened The nearer to England I follow him you see Mother argued mister Meagles the nearer I am likely to come to the papers whether they turn up or no Because it is only reasonable to conclude that he would deposit them somewhere where they would be safe from people over in England and where they would yet be accessible to himself don t you see At Paris mister Meagles found a letter from Little Dorrit lying waiting for him in which she mentioned that she had been able to talk for a minute or two with mister Clennam about this man who was no more and that when she told mister Clennam that his friend mister Meagles who was on his way to see him had an interest in ascertaining something about the man if he could he had asked her to tell mister Meagles that he had been known to Miss Wade then living in such a street at Calais Oho said mister Meagles As soon afterwards as might be in those Diligence days mister Meagles rang the cracked bell at the cracked gate and it jarred open and the peasant woman stood in the dark doorway saying Ice say Seer Who In acknowledgment of whose address mister Meagles murmured to himself that there was some sense about these Calais people who really did know something of what you and themselves were up to and returned Miss Wade my dear He was then shown into the presence of Miss Wade It s some time since we met said mister Meagles clearing his throat I hope you have been pretty well Miss Wade Without hoping that he or anybody else had been pretty well Miss Wade asked him to what she was indebted for the honour of seeing him again mister Meagles in the meanwhile glanced all round the room without observing anything in the shape of a box Why the truth is Miss Wade said mister Meagles in a comfortable managing not to say coaxing voice it is possible that you may be able to throw a light upon a little something that is at present dark Any unpleasant bygones between us are bygones I hope Can t be helped now You recollect my daughter Time changes so A mother In his innocence mister Meagles could not have struck a worse key note He paused for any expression of interest but paused in vain That is not the subject you wished to enter on she said after a cold silence No no returned mister Meagles No I thought your good nature might I thought you knew she interrupted with a smile that my good nature is not to be calculated upon Don t say so said mister Meagles you do yourself an injustice However to come to the point For he was sensible of having gained nothing by approaching it in a roundabout way I have heard from my friend Clennam who you will be sorry to hear has been and still is very ill He paused again and again she was silent that you had some knowledge of one Blandois lately killed in London by a violent accident Now don t mistake me I know it was a slight knowledge said mister Meagles dexterously forestalling an angry interruption which he saw about to break I am fully aware of that It was a slight knowledge I know But the question is mister Meagles s voice here became comfortable again did he on his way to England last time leave a box of papers or a bundle of papers or some papers or other in some receptacle or other any papers with you begging you to allow him to leave them here for a short time until he wanted them The question is she repeated Whose question is Mine said mister Meagles And not only mine but Clennam s question and other people s question Now I am sure continued mister Meagles whose heart was overflowing with Pet that you can t have any unkind feeling towards my daughter it s impossible Well It s her question too being one in which a particular friend of hers is nearly interested So here I am frankly to say that is the question and to ask Now did he Upon my word she returned I seem to be a mark for everybody who knew anything of a man I once in my life hired and paid and dismissed to aim their questions at Now don t remonstrated mister Meagles don t Don t take offence because it s the plainest question in the world and might be asked of any one The documents I refer to were not his own were wrongfully obtained might at some time or other be troublesome to an innocent person to have in keeping and are sought by the people to whom they really belong He passed through Calais going to London and there were reasons why he should not take them with him then why he should wish to be able to put his hand upon them readily and why he should distrust leaving them with people of his own sort Did he leave them here I declare if I knew how to avoid giving you offence I would take any pains to do it I put the question personally but there s nothing personal in it I might put it to any one I have put it already to many people Did he leave them here Did he leave anything here No Then unfortunately Miss Wade you know nothing about them I know nothing about them I have now answered your unaccountable question He did not leave them here and I know nothing about them There said mister Meagles rising I am sorry for it that s over and I hope there is not much harm done Tattycoram well Miss Wade Harriet well O yes I have put my foot in it again said mister Meagles thus corrected I can t keep my foot out of it here it seems Perhaps if I had thought twice about it I might never have given her the jingling name But when one means to be good natured and sportive with young people one doesn t think twice Her old friend leaves a kind word for her Miss Wade if you should think proper to deliver it She said nothing as to that and mister Meagles taking his honest face out of the dull room where it shone like a sun took it to the Hotel where he had left missus Meagles and where he made the Report Beaten Mother no effects He took it next to the London Steam Packet which sailed in the night and next to the Marshalsea The faithful John was on duty when Father and Mother Meagles presented themselves at the wicket towards nightfall Miss Dorrit was not there then he said but she had been there in the morning and invariably came in the evening mister Clennam was slowly mending and Maggy and missus Plornish and mister Baptist took care of him by turns Miss Dorrit was sure to come back that evening before the bell rang There was the room the Marshal had lent her up stairs in which they could wait for her if they pleased Mistrustful that it might be hazardous to Arthur to see him without preparation mister Meagles accepted the offer and they were left shut up in the room looking down through its barred window into the jail The cramped area of the prison had such an effect on missus Meagles that she began to weep and such an effect on mister Meagles that he began to gasp for air He was walking up and down the room panting and making himself worse by laboriously fanning himself with her handkerchief when he turned towards the opening door Eh Good gracious said mister Meagles this is not Miss Dorrit Why Mother look Tattycoram No other And in Tattycoram s arms was an iron box some two feet square Such a box had Affery Flintwinch seen in the first of her dreams going out of the old house in the dead of the night under Double s arm This Tattycoram put on the ground at her old master s feet this Tattycoram fell on her knees by and beat her hands upon crying half in exultation and half in despair half in laughter and half in tears Pardon dear Master take me back dear Mistress here it is Tatty exclaimed mister Meagles What you wanted said Tattycoram Here it is I was put in the next room not to see you I heard you ask her about it I heard her say she hadn t got it I was there when he left it and I took it at bedtime and brought it away Here it is Why my girl cried mister Meagles more breathless than before how did you come over I came in the boat with you I was sitting wrapped up at the other end When you took a coach at the wharf I took another coach and followed you here She never would have given it up after what you had said to her about its being wanted she would sooner have sunk it in the sea or burnt it But here it is The glow and rapture that the girl was in with her Here it is She never wanted it to be left I must say that for her but he left it and I knew well that after what you said and after her denying it she never would have given it up But here it is Dear Master dear Mistress take me back again and give me back the dear old name Let this intercede for me Here it is Father and Mother Meagles never deserved their names better than when they took the headstrong foundling girl into their protection again Oh I have been so wretched cried Tattycoram weeping much more always so unhappy and so repentant I was afraid of her from the first time I saw her I knew she had got a power over me through understanding what was bad in me so well It was a madness in me and she could raise it whenever she liked I used to think when I got into that state that people were all against me because of my first beginning and the kinder they were to me the worse fault I found in them I made it out that they triumphed above me and that they wanted to make me envy them when I know when I even knew then that they never thought of such a thing And my beautiful young mistress not so happy as she ought to have been and I gone away from her Such a brute and a wretch as she must think me But you ll say a word to her for me and ask her to be as forgiving as you two are For I am not so bad as I was pleaded Tattycoram I am bad enough but not so bad as I was indeed I have had Miss Wade before me all this time as if it was my own self grown ripe turning everything the wrong way and twisting all good into evil I have had her before me all this time finding no pleasure in anything but keeping me as miserable suspicious and tormenting as herself Not that she had much to do to do that cried Tattycoram in a closing great burst of distress for I was as bad as bad could be I only mean to say that after what I have gone through I hope I shall never be quite so bad again and that I shall get better by very slow degrees I ll try very hard I won t stop at five and twenty sir I ll count five and twenty hundred five and twenty thousand Another opening of the door and Tattycoram subsided and Little Dorrit came in and mister Meagles with pride and joy produced the box and her gentle face was lighted up with grateful happiness and joy The secret was safe now She could keep her own part of it from him he should never know of her loss in time to come he should know all that was of import to himself but he should never know what concerned her only That was all passed all forgiven all forgotten Now my dear Miss Dorrit said mister Meagles I am a man of business or at least was and I am going to take my measures promptly in that character Had I better see Arthur to night I think not to night I will go to his room and ascertain how he is But I think it will be better not to see him to night I am much of your opinion my dear said mister Meagles and therefore I have not been any nearer to him than this dismal room Then I shall probably not see him for some little time to come But I ll explain what I mean when you come back She left the room mister Meagles looking through the bars of the window saw her pass out of the Lodge below him into the prison yard He said gently Tattycoram come to me a moment my good girl She went up to the window You see that young lady who was here just now that little quiet fragile figure passing along there Tatty Look The people stand out of the way to let her go by The men see the poor shabby fellows pull off their hats to her quite politely and now she glides in at that doorway See her Tattycoram Yes sir I have heard tell Tatty that she was once regularly called the child of this place She was born here and lived here many years I can t breathe here A doleful place to be born and bred in Tattycoram Yes indeed sir If she had constantly thought of herself and settled with herself that everybody visited this place upon her turned it against her and cast it at her she would have led an irritable and probably an useless existence Yet I have heard tell Tattycoram that her young life has been one of active resignation goodness and noble service Shall I tell you what I consider those eyes of hers that were here just now to have always looked at to get that expression Yes if you please sir Duty Tattycoram Begin it early and do it well and there is no antecedent to it in any origin or station that will tell against us with the Almighty or with ourselves They remained at the window Mother joining them and pitying the prisoners until she was seen coming back She was soon in the room and recommended that Arthur whom she had left calm and composed should not be visited that night Good said mister Meagles cheerily I have not a doubt that s best I shall trust my remembrances then my sweet nurse in your hands and I well know they couldn t be in better I am off again to morrow morning Little Dorrit surprised asked him where My dear said mister Meagles I can t live without breathing This place has taken my breath away and I shall never get it back again until Arthur is out of this place How is that a reason for going off again to morrow morning You shall understand said mister Meagles To night we three will put up at a City Hotel To morrow morning Mother and Tattycoram will go down to Twickenham where missus Tickit sitting attended by doctor Buchan in the parlour window will think them a couple of ghosts and I shall go abroad again for Doyce We must have Dan here Now I tell you my love it s of no use writing and planning and conditionally speculating upon this and that and the other at uncertain intervals and distances we must have Doyce here I devote myself at daybreak to morrow morning to bringing Doyce here It s nothing to me to go and find him I m an old traveller and all foreign languages and customs are alike to me I never understand anything about any of em Therefore I can t be put to any inconvenience Go at once I must it stands to reason because I can t live without breathing freely and I can t breathe freely until Arthur is out of this Marshalsea I am stifled at the present moment and have scarcely breath enough to say this much and to carry this precious box down stairs for you They got into the street as the bell began to ring mister Meagles carrying the box Little Dorrit had no conveyance there which rather surprised him He called a coach for her and she got into it and he placed the box beside her when she was seated In her joy and gratitude she kissed his hand I don t like that my dear said mister Meagles It goes against my feeling of what s right that YOU should do homage to ME at the Marshalsea Gate She bent forward and kissed his cheek You remind me of the days said mister Meagles suddenly drooping but she s very fond of him and hides his faults and thinks that no one sees them and he certainly is well connected and of a very good family It was the only comfort he had in the loss of his daughter and if he made the most of it who could blame him CHAPTER thirty four Gone On a healthy autumn day the Marshalsea prisoner weak but otherwise restored sat listening to a voice that read to him On a healthy autumn day when the golden fields had been reaped and ploughed again when the summer fruits had ripened and waned when the green perspectives of hops had been laid low by the busy pickers when the apples clustering in the orchards were russet and the berries of the mountain ash were crimson among the yellowing foliage Already in the woods glimpses of the hardy winter that was coming were to be caught through unaccustomed openings among the boughs where the prospect shone defined and clear free from the bloom of the drowsy summer weather which had rested on it as the bloom lies on the plum So from the seashore the ocean was no longer to be seen lying asleep in the heat but its thousand sparkling eyes were open and its whole breadth was in joyful animation from the cool sand on the beach to the little sails on the horizon drifting away like autumn tinted leaves that had drifted from the trees Changeless and barren looking ignorantly at all the seasons with its fixed pinched face of poverty and care the prison had not a touch of any of these beauties on it Blossom what would its bricks and bars bore uniformly the same dead crop Yet Clennam listening to the voice as it read to him heard in it all that great Nature was doing heard in it all the soothing songs she sings to man At no Mother s knee but hers had he ever dwelt in his youth on hopeful promises on playful fancies on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the early fostered seeds of the imagination on the oaks of retreat from blighting winds that have the germs of their strong roots in nursery acorns But in the tones of the voice that read to him there were memories of an old feeling of such things and echoes of every merciful and loving whisper that had ever stolen to him in his life When the voice stopped he put his hand over his eyes murmuring that the light was strong upon them Little Dorrit put the book by and presently arose quietly to shade the window Maggy sat at her needlework in her old place The light softened Little Dorrit brought her chair closer to his side This will soon be over now dear mister Clennam Not only are mister Doyce s letters to you so full of friendship and encouragement but mister Rugg says his letters to him are so full of help and that everybody now a little anger is past is so considerate and speaks so well of you that it will soon be over now Dear girl Dear heart Good angel You praise me far too much And yet it is such an exquisite pleasure to me to hear you speak so feelingly and to and to see said Little Dorrit raising her eyes to his how deeply you mean it that I cannot say Don t He lifted her hand to his lips You have been here many many times when I have not seen you Little Dorrit Yes I have been here sometimes when I have not come into the room Very often Rather often said Little Dorrit timidly Every day I think said Little Dorrit after hesitating that I have been here at least twice every day He might have released the little light hand after fervently kissing it again but that with a very gentle lingering where it was it seemed to court being retained He took it in both of his and it lay softly on his breast Dear Little Dorrit it is not my imprisonment only that will soon be over This sacrifice of you must be ended We must learn to part again and to take our different ways so wide asunder You have not forgotten what we said together when you came back O no I have not forgotten it But something has been You feel quite strong to day don t you Quite strong The hand he held crept up a little nearer his face Do you feel quite strong enough to know what a great fortune I have got I shall be very glad to be told No fortune can be too great or good for Little Dorrit I have been anxiously waiting to tell you I have been longing and longing to tell you You are sure you will not take it Never You are quite sure you will not take half of it Never dear Little Dorrit As she looked at him silently there was something in her affectionate face that he did not quite comprehend something that could have broken into tears in a moment and yet that was happy and proud You will be sorry to hear what I have to tell you about Fanny Poor Fanny has lost everything She has nothing left but her husband s income All that papa gave her when she married was lost as your money was lost It was in the same hands and it is all gone Arthur was more shocked than surprised to hear it I had hoped it might not be so bad he said but I had feared a heavy loss there knowing the connection between her husband and the defaulter Yes It is all gone I am very sorry for Fanny very very very sorry for poor Fanny My poor brother too Had he property in the same hands Yes And it s all gone How much do you think my own great fortune is As Arthur looked at her inquiringly with a new apprehension on him she withdrew her hand and laid her face down on the spot where it had rested I have nothing in the world I am as poor as when I lived here When papa came over to England he confided everything he had to the same hands and it is all swept away O my dearest and best are you quite sure you will not share my fortune with me now Locked in his arms held to his heart with his manly tears upon her own cheek she drew the slight hand round his neck and clasped it in its fellow hand Never to part my dearest Arthur never any more until the last I never was rich before I never was proud before I never was happy before I am rich in being taken by you I am proud in having been resigned by you I am happy in being with you in this prison as I should be happy in coming back to it with you if it should be the will of GOD and comforting and serving you with all my love and truth I am yours anywhere everywhere I love you dearly I would rather pass my life here with you and go out daily working for our bread than I would have the greatest fortune that ever was told and be the greatest lady that ever was honoured O if poor papa may only know how blest at last my heart is in this room where he suffered for so many years Maggy had of course been staring from the first and had of course been crying her eyes out long before this Maggy was now so overjoyed that after hugging her little mother with all her might she went down stairs like a clog hornpipe to find somebody or other to whom to impart her gladness Whom should Maggy meet but Flora and mister F s Aunt opportunely coming in And whom else as a consequence of that meeting should Little Dorrit find waiting for herself when a good two or three hours afterwards she went out Flora s eyes were a little red and she seemed rather out of spirits mister F s Aunt was so stiffened that she had the appearance of being past bending by any means short of powerful mechanical pressure Her bonnet was cocked up behind in a terrific manner and her stony reticule was as rigid as if it had been petrified by the Gorgon s head and had got it at that moment inside With these imposing attributes mister F s Aunt publicly seated on the steps of the Marshal s official residence had been for the two or three hours in question a great boon to the younger inhabitants of the Borough whose sallies of humour she had considerably flushed herself by resenting at the point of her umbrella from time to time Painfully aware Miss Dorrit I am sure said Flora that to propose an adjournment to any place to one so far removed by fortune and so courted and caressed by the best society must ever appear intruding even if not a pie shop far below your present sphere and a back parlour though a civil man but if for the sake of Arthur cannot overcome it more improper now than ever late Doyce and Clennam one last remark I might wish to make one last explanation I might wish to offer perhaps your good nature might excuse under pretence of three kidney ones the humble place of conversation Rightly interpreting this rather obscure speech Little Dorrit returned that she was quite at Flora s disposition Flora accordingly led the way across the road to the pie shop in question mister F s Aunt stalking across in the rear and putting herself in the way of being run over with a perseverance worthy of a better cause When the three kidney ones which were to be a blind to the conversation were set before them on three little tin platters each kidney one ornamented with a hole at the top into which the civil man poured hot gravy out of a spouted can as if he were feeding three lamps Flora took out her pocket handkerchief If Fancy s fair dreams she began have ever pictured that when Arthur cannot overcome it pray excuse me was restored to freedom even a pie as far from flaky as the present and so deficient in kidney as to be in that respect like a minced nutmeg might not prove unacceptable if offered by the hand of true regard such visions have for ever fled and all is cancelled but being aware that tender relations are in contemplation beg to state that I heartily wish well to both and find no fault with either not the least it may be withering to know that ere the hand of Time had made me much less slim than formerly and dreadfully red on the slightest exertion particularly after eating I well know when it takes the form of a rash it might have been and was not through the interruption of parents and mental torpor succeeded until the mysterious clue was held by mister F still I would not be ungenerous to either and I heartily wish well to both Little Dorrit took her hand and thanked her for all her old kindness Call it not kindness returned Flora giving her an honest kiss for you always were the best and dearest little thing that ever was if I may take the liberty and even in a money point of view a saving being Conscience itself though I must add much more agreeable than mine ever was to me for though not I hope more burdened than other people s yet I have always found it far readier to make one uncomfortable than comfortable and evidently taking a greater pleasure in doing it but I am wandering one hope I wish to express ere yet the closing scene draws in and it is that I do trust for the sake of old times and old sincerity that Arthur will know that I didn t desert him in his misfortunes but that I came backwards and forwards constantly to ask if I could do anything for him and that I sat in the pie shop where they very civilly fetched something warm in a tumbler from the hotel and really very nice hours after hours to keep him company over the way without his knowing it Flora really had tears in her eyes now and they showed her to great advantage Over and above which said Flora I earnestly beg you as the dearest thing that ever was if you ll still excuse the familiarity from one who moves in very different circles to let Arthur understand that I don t know after all whether it wasn t all nonsense between us though pleasant at the time and trying too and certainly mister F did work a change and the spell being broken nothing could be expected to take place without weaving it afresh which various circumstances have combined to prevent of which perhaps not the least powerful was that it was not to be I am not prepared to say that if it had been agreeable to Arthur and had brought itself about naturally in the first instance I should not have been very glad being of a lively disposition and moped at home where papa undoubtedly is the most aggravating of his sex and not improved since having been cut down by the hand of the Incendiary into something of which I never saw the counterpart in all my life but jealousy is not my character nor ill will though many faults Without having been able closely to follow missus Finching through this labyrinth Little Dorrit understood its purpose and cordially accepted the trust The withered chaplet my dear said Flora with great enjoyment is then perished the column is crumbled and the pyramid is standing upside down upon its what s his name call it not giddiness call it not weakness call it not folly I must now retire into privacy and look upon the ashes of departed joys no more but taking a further liberty of paying for the pastry which has formed the humble pretext of our interview will for ever say Adieu mister F s Aunt who had eaten her pie with great solemnity and who had been elaborating some grievous scheme of injury in her mind since her first assumption of that public position on the Marshal s steps took the present opportunity of addressing the following Sibyllic apostrophe to the relict of her late nephew Bring him for ard and I ll chuck him out o winder Flora tried in vain to soothe the excellent woman by explaining that they were going home to dinner mister F s Aunt persisted in replying Bring him for ard and I ll chuck him out o winder Having reiterated this demand an immense number of times with a sustained glare of defiance at Little Dorrit mister F s Aunt folded her arms and sat down in the corner of the pie shop parlour steadfastly refusing to budge until such time as he should have been brought for ard and the chucking portion of his destiny accomplished In this condition of things Flora confided to Little Dorrit that she had not seen mister F s Aunt so full of life and character for weeks that she would find it necessary to remain there hours perhaps until the inexorable old lady could be softened and that she could manage her best alone They parted therefore in the friendliest manner and with the kindest feeling on both sides mister F s Aunt holding out like a grim fortress and Flora becoming in need of refreshment a messenger was despatched to the hotel for the tumbler already glanced at which was afterwards replenished With the aid of its content a newspaper and some skimming of the cream of the pie stock Flora got through the remainder of the day in perfect good humour though occasionally embarrassed by the consequences of an idle rumour which circulated among the credulous infants of the neighbourhood to the effect that an old lady had sold herself to the pie shop to be made up and was then sitting in the pie shop parlour declining to complete her contract This attracted so many young persons of both sexes and when the shades of evening began to fall occasioned so much interruption to the business that the merchant became very pressing in his proposals that mister F s Aunt should be removed A conveyance was accordingly brought to the door which by the joint efforts of the merchant and Flora this remarkable woman was at last induced to enter though not without even then putting her head out of the window and demanding to have him brought for ard for the purpose originally mentioned As she was observed at this time to direct baleful glances towards the Marshalsea it has been supposed that this admirably consistent female intended by him Arthur Clennam This however is mere speculation who the person was who for the satisfaction of mister F s Aunt s mind ought to have been brought forward and never was brought forward will never be positively known The autumn days went on and Little Dorrit never came to the Marshalsea now and went away without seeing him No no no One morning as Arthur listened for the light feet that every morning ascended winged to his heart bringing the heavenly brightness of a new love into the room where the old love had wrought so hard and been so true one morning as he listened he heard her coming not alone Dear Arthur said her delighted voice outside the door I have some one here May I bring some one in He had thought from the tread there were two with her He answered Yes and she came in with mister Meagles Sun browned and jolly mister Meagles looked and he opened his arms and folded Arthur in them like a sun browned and jolly father Now I am all right said mister Meagles after a minute or so Now it s over Arthur my dear fellow confess at once that you expected me before I did said Arthur but Amy told me Little Dorrit Never any other name It was she who whispered it But my Little Dorrit told me that without asking for any further explanation I was not to expect you until I saw you And now you see me my boy said mister Meagles shaking him by the hand stoutly and now you shall have any explanation and every explanation The fact is I was here came straight to you from the Allongers and Marshongers or I should be ashamed to look you in the face this day but you were not in company trim at the moment and I had to start off again to catch Doyce Poor Doyce sighed Arthur Don t call him names that he don t deserve said mister Meagles He s not poor he s doing well enough Doyce is a wonderful fellow over there I assure you he is making out his case like a house a fire He has fallen on his legs has Dan Where they don t want things done and find a man to do em that man s off his legs but where they do want things done and find a man to do em that man s on his legs You won t have occasion to trouble the Circumlocution Office any more Let me tell you Dan has done without em What a load you take from my mind cried Arthur What happiness you give me Happiness retorted mister Meagles Don t talk about happiness till you see Dan I assure you Dan is directing works and executing labours over yonder that it would make your hair stand on end to look at He s no public offender bless you now He s medalled and ribboned and starred and crossed and I don t know what all d like a born nobleman But we mustn t talk about that over here Why not Oh egad said mister Meagles shaking his head very seriously he must hide all those things under lock and key when he comes over here They won t do over here In that particular Britannia is a Britannia in the Manger won t give her children such distinctions herself and won t allow them to be seen when they are given by other countries No no Dan said mister Meagles shaking his head again That won t do here If you had brought me except for Doyce s sake twice what I have lost cried Arthur you would not have given me the pleasure that you give me in this news Why of course of course assented mister Meagles Of course I know that my good fellow and therefore I come out with it in the first burst Now to go back about catching Doyce I caught Doyce Ran against him among a lot of those dirty brown dogs in women s nightcaps a great deal too big for em calling themselves Arabs and all sorts of incoherent races YOU know em Well He was coming straight to me and I was going to him and so we came back together Doyce in England exclaimed Arthur There said mister Meagles throwing open his arms I am the worst man in the world to manage a thing of this sort I don t know what I should have done if I had been in the diplomatic line right perhaps The long and short of it is Arthur we have both been in England this fortnight And if you go on to ask where Doyce is at the present moment why my plain answer is here he is And now I can breathe again at last Doyce darted in from behind the door caught Arthur by both hands and said the rest for himself There are only three branches of my subject my dear Clennam said Doyce proceeding to mould them severally with his plastic thumb on the palm of his hand and they re soon disposed of First not a word more from you about the past There was an error in your calculations I know what that is It affects the whole machine and failure is the consequence You will profit by the failure and will avoid it another time I have done a similar thing myself in construction often Every failure teaches a man something if he will learn and you are too sensible a man not to learn from this failure So much for firstly Secondly I was sorry you should have taken it so heavily to heart and reproached yourself so severely I was travelling home night and day to put matters right with the assistance of our friend when I fell in with our friend as he has informed you Thirdly We two agreed that after what you had undergone after your distress of mind and after your illness it would be a pleasant surprise if we could so far keep quiet as to get things perfectly arranged without your knowledge and then come and say that all the affairs were smooth that everything was right that the business stood in greater want of you than ever it did and that a new and prosperous career was opened before you and me as partners That s thirdly But you know we always make an allowance for friction and so I have reserved space to close in My dear Clennam I thoroughly confide in you you have it in your power to be quite as useful to me as I have or have had it in my power to be useful to you your old place awaits you and wants you very much there is nothing to detain you here one half hour longer There was silence which was not broken until Arthur had stood for some time at the window with his back towards them and until his little wife that was to be had gone to him and stayed by him I made a remark a little while ago said Daniel Doyce then which I am inclined to think was an incorrect one I said there was nothing to detain you here Clennam half an hour longer Am I mistaken in supposing that you would rather not leave here till to morrow morning Do I know without being very wise where you would like to go direct from these walls and from this room You do returned Arthur It has been our cherished purpose Very well said Doyce Then if this young lady will do me the honour of regarding me for four and twenty hours in the light of a father and will take a ride with me now towards Saint Paul s Churchyard I dare say I know what we want to get there Little Dorrit and he went out together soon afterwards and mister Meagles lingered behind to say a word to his friend I think Arthur you will not want Mother and me in the morning and we will keep away It might set Mother thinking about Pet she s a soft hearted woman She s best at the Cottage and I ll stay there and keep her company With that they parted for the time And the day ended and the night ended and the morning came and Little Dorrit simply dressed as usual and having no one with her but Maggy came into the prison with the sunshine The poor room was a happy room that morning Where in the world was there a room so full of quiet joy My dear love said Arthur Why does Maggy light the fire We shall be gone directly I asked her to do it I have taken such an odd fancy I want you to burn something for me What Only this folded paper If you will put it in the fire with your own hand just as it is my fancy will be gratified Superstitious darling Little Dorrit Is it a charm It is anything you like best my own she answered laughing with glistening eyes and standing on tiptoe to kiss him if you will only humour me when the fire burns up So they stood before the fire waiting Clennam with his arm about her waist and the fire shining as fire in that same place had often shone in Little Dorrit s eyes Is it bright enough now said Arthur Quite bright enough now said Little Dorrit Does the charm want any words to be said asked Arthur as he held the paper over the flame You can say if you don t mind I love you answered Little Dorrit So he said it and the paper burned away They passed very quietly along the yard for no one was there though many heads were stealthily peeping from the windows Only one face familiar of old was in the Lodge When they had both accosted it and spoken many kind words Little Dorrit turned back one last time with her hand stretched out saying Good bye good John I hope you will live very happy dear Then they went up the steps of the neighbouring Saint George s Church and went up to the altar where Daniel Doyce was waiting in his paternal character And there was Little Dorrit s old friend who had given her the Burial Register for a pillow full of admiration that she should come back to them to be married after all And they were married with the sun shining on them through the painted figure of Our Saviour on the window And they went into the very room where Little Dorrit had slumbered after her party to sign the Marriage Register And there mister Pancks destined to be chief clerk to Doyce and Clennam and afterwards partner in the house sinking the Incendiary in the peaceful friend looked in at the door to see it done with Flora gallantly supported on one arm and Maggy on the other and a back ground of John Chivery and father and other turnkeys who had run round for the moment deserting the parent Marshalsea for its happy child Nor had Flora the least signs of seclusion upon her notwithstanding her recent declaration but on the contrary was wonderfully smart and enjoyed the ceremonies mightily though in a fluttered way Little Dorrit s old friend held the inkstand as she signed her name and the clerk paused in taking off the good clergyman s surplice and all the witnesses looked on with special interest For you see said Little Dorrit s old friend this young lady is one of our curiosities and has come now to the third volume of our Registers Her birth is in what I call the first volume she lay asleep on this very floor with her pretty head on what I call the second volume and she s now a writing her little name as a bride in what I call the third volume They all gave place when the signing was done and Little Dorrit and her husband walked out of the church alone They paused for a moment on the steps of the portico looking at the fresh perspective of the street in the autumn morning sun s bright rays and then went down Went down into a modest life of usefulness and happiness Went down to give a mother s care in the fulness of time to Fanny s neglected children no less than to their own and to leave that lady going into Society for ever and a day Went down to give a tender nurse and friend to Tip for some few years who was never vexed by the great exactions he made of her in return for the riches he might have given her if he had ever had them and who lovingly closed his eyes upon the Marshalsea and all its blighted fruits They went quietly down into the roaring streets inseparable and blessed and as they passed along in sunshine and shade the noisy and the eager and the arrogant and the froward and the vain fretted and chafed and made their usual uproar End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LITTLE DORRIT This file
