by Nick Hodson of London England The Dark House by George Manville Fenn It would be hard to praise this book highly enough It is in essence a murder and detection mystery the sort of thing that great mid twentieth century writers like Agatha Christie wrote so well This is a quite masterly book a short one at that a book full of suspense and surprises Unusual to find such a book dating from the nineteenth century An extremely wealthy but reclusive man has died leaving an eccentric will which hints at great riches hidden somewhere in the house Most of the people at the reading of the will did not know the deceased in person but had received kindnesses from him for instance by the payment of school and university fees The principal beneficiary a great nephew also did not know him The only two people who really knew him were the old lawyer who dealt with his affairs and an old Indian servant Yet when the will had been read and they all went to where the treasure gold jewels and bank notes were supposed to be hidden nothing could be found There are an unusual number of deaths by murder and in self defence as the story unfolds and we are left in total suspense until the very end of the very last chapter The person who works out where the treasure must be and how it got there does not come on the scene until almost the last chapter and even then he has to go on business to America before he can come in and explain his theory which proves to be right This book makes an excellent audiobook and you will certainly like it THE DARK HOUSE BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN CHAPTER ONE NUMBER nineA ALBEMARLE SQUARE Don t drink our sherry Charles mister Preenham the butler stood by the table in the gloomy servants hall as if he had received a shock No sir I took em up the beer at first and they shook their heads and asked for wine and when I took em the sherry they shook their heads again and the one who speaks English said they want key aunty Well all I have got to say exclaimed the portly cook is that if I had known what was going to take place I wouldn t have stopped an hour after the old man died It s wicked And something awful will happen as sure as my name s Thompson Don t say that missus Thompson said the mild looking butler It is very dreadful though Dreadful isn t the word Are we ancient Egyptians I declare ever since them Hightalians have been in the house going about like three dark conspirators in a play I ve had the creeps I say it didn t ought to be allowed What am I to say to them sir said the footman a strongly built man with shifty eyes and quickly twitching lips Well look here Charles said the butler slowly wiping his mouth with his hand We have no Chianti wine You must take them a bottle of Chambertin My ejaculated cook Chambertin sir It s mister Girtle s orders They ve come here straight from Paris on purpose and they are to have everything they want The butler left the gloomy room and missus Thompson a stout lady who moved only when she was obliged turned to the thin elderly housemaid Mark my words Ann she said It s contr y to nature and it ll bring a curse Well said the woman it can t make the house more dull than it has been I don t know said the cook I never see a house before where there was no need to shut the shutters and pull down the blinds because some one s dead Well it is a gloomy place Ann but we ve done all these years most as we liked One meal a day and the rest at his club and never any company There ain t many places like that No sighed Ann I suppose we shall all have to go Oh I don t know my dear mister Ramo says he thinks master s left all his money to his great nephew mister Capel and may be he ll have the house painted up and the rooms cleaned and keep lots of company An he may marry this Miss Dungeon ain t her name D E n g h i e n said the housemaid spelling it slowly I don t know what you call it She s very handsome but so orty I like Miss Lawrence Only to think master never seeing a soul and living all these years in this great shut up house and then as soon as the breath s out of his body all these relatives turning up Where the carcase is there the eagles are gathered together said cook solemnly Oh don t talk like that cook You re not obliged to listen my dear said cook rubbing her knees gently I declare it s been grievous to me continued the housemaid all those beautiful rooms full of splendid furniture and one not allowed to do more than keep em just clean Not a blind drawn up or a window opened It s always been as if there was a funeral in the house Think master was crossed in love No Not he mister Ramo said that master was twice over married to great Indian princesses abroad I s pose they left him all their money Oh here is mister Ramo The door had opened and a tall thin old Hindoo with piercing dark eyes and wrinkled brown face came softly in He was dressed in a long dark red silken cassock that seemed as if woven in one piece and fitted his spare form rather closely from neck to heel a white cloth girdle was tied round his waist and for sole ornament there were a couple of plain gold rings in his ears As he entered he raised his thin largely veined brown hands to his closely cropped head half making the native salaam and then said in good English mister Preenham not here He ll be back directly mister Ramo said the cook There there do sit down you look worn out The Hindoo shook his head and walked to the window which looked out into an inner area At that moment the butler entered and the Hindoo turned to him quickly and laid his hand upon his arm There there don t fret about it mister Ramo said the butler It s what we must all come to some day Yes but this this said the Hindoo in a low excited voice Is is it right The butler was silent for a few moments Well he said at last it s right and its wrong as you may say It s master s own orders for there it was in his own handwriting in his desk Instructions for my solicitor mister Girtle showed it me being an old family servant Yes yes he showed it to me Oh it was all there continued the butler Well as I was saying it s right so far but it s wrong because it s not like a Christian burial No no cried the Hindoo excitedly Those men they make me mad I cannot bear it Look he cried he should have died out in my country where we would have laid him on sweet scented woods and baskets of spices and gums and there where the sun shines and the palm trees wave I his old servant would have fired the pile and he would have risen up in the clouds of smoke and among the pure clear flames of fire till nothing but the ashes was left Yes yes that would have been his end he cried with flashing eyes as he seemed to mentally picture the scene and then thy servant could have died with thee Oh Sahib Sahib Sahib He clasped his hands together the fire died from his eyes which became suffused with tears and as he uttered the last word thrice in a low moaning voice he stood rocking himself to and fro The two women looked horrified and shuddered but the piteous grief was magnetic and in the deep silence that fell they began to sob while the butler blew his nose softly coughed and at last laid his hand upon the old servant s shoulder Shake hands mister Ramo he said huskily Fifteen years you and me s been together and if we haven t hit it as we might well it was only natural me being an Englishman and you almost a black but it s this as brings us all together natives and furreners and all He was a good master God bless him and I m sorry he s gone The old Indian looked up at him half wonderingly for a few moments Then taking the extended hand in both of his he held it for a time and pressed it to his heart dropped it and turned to go Won t you take something mister Ramo No no said the Indian shaking his head and he glided softly out of the servants hall went silently in his soft yellow leather slippers down a long passage and up a flight of stone stairs to pass through a glass door and stand in the large gloomy hall in the middle of one of the marble squares that turned the floor into a vast chess board round which the giant pieces seemed to be waiting to commence the game For the faint light that came through the thick ground glass fanlight over the great double doors was diffused among black bronze statues and white marble figures of Greek and Roman knights In one place seated meditatively with hands resting upon the knees there was an Indian god seeming to watch the floor In another a great Japanese warrior while towards the bottom of the great winding staircase whose stone steps were covered with heavy dark carpet was a marble that imagination might easily have taken for a queen Here and there the panelled walls were ornamented with stands of Indian arms and armour conical helmets once worn by Eastern chiefs with pendent curtains and suits of chain mail Bloodthirsty daggers curved scimitars spears clumsy matchlocks and long straight swords whose hilt was an iron gauntlet in which the warrior s fingers were laced as they grasped a handle placed at right angles to the blade after the fashion of a spade There were shields too and bows and arrows and tulwars and kukris any number of warlike implements from the East while beside the statues the West had to show some curious chairs and a full length portrait of an Englishman in the prime of life a handsome bold faced man in the uniform of one of John Company s regiments his helmet in his hand and his breast adorned with orders and jewels of foreign make The old Indian servant stood there like one of the statues as the dining room door opened and three dark closely shaven and moustached men in black came out softly and went silently up the stairs There was something singularly furtive and strange about them as they followed one another in silence all three alike in their dress coats and turned down white collars beneath which was a narrow strip of ribbon knotted in front They passed on and on up the great winding stairs past the drawing room from whence came the low buzz of voices to a door at the back of the house beside a great stained glass window whose weird lights shone down upon a lion skin rug Here the first man stopped for his companions to reach his side Then whispering a few words to them he took a key from his pocket opened the door withdrew the key and entered the darkened room closing and locking the door as the old Indian crept softly up sank upon his knees upon the skin rug his hands clasped his head bent down and resting against the panels of the door CHAPTER TWO THE DEAD MAN S RELATIVES I can tell you very little mister Capel I have been your great uncle s confidential solicitor ever since he returned from India I was a mere boy when he went away He knew me then and when he came back he sought me out And that is twenty five years ago mister Girtle Yes The year you were born And he made you his confidant Yes he gave me his confidence as far as I think he gave it to any man And did he always live in this way Always He filled up the house with the vast collection of curiosities and things that he had been sending home for years and I expected that he would entertain and lead the life of an English gentleman but no the house has been closed for twenty five years mister Girtle a clean shaven old gentleman with yellow face dark restless eyes and bright grey hair took a pinch of snuff from a handsome gold box flicked a few grains from his white shirt front and said Hah Had my uncle met with any great disappointment said the first speaker a frank looking man with closely curling brown hair and a high white forehead What to make him take to this strange life Oh no He was peculiar but not unhappy He liked to be alone but he was always bright and cheerful at his club You met him there then said a fresh voice and a handsome dark young fellow who had been leaning back in an easy chair in the dim drawing room sat up quickly playing with his little black moustache Oh yes I used to dine with Colonel Capel when we had business to transact But here you say he led the life of a miser continued the young man crossing his legs and examining the toe of his patent leather boot I beg your pardon mister Gerard Artis I did not say that Your great uncle was no miser He spent money freely sometimes in charities Yes he continued turning to where two ladies were seated Colonel Capel was often very charitable I never saw his name in any charitable list said the darker of the two ladies speaking in a sweet silvery voice and her beautiful regular features seemed to attract both the previous speakers No Miss D Enghien I suppose not said the old man nodding his head and rising to begin walking up and down snuff box in hand Neither did I But he was very charitable in his own particular way and he was very kind Yes said the young man who had first spoken very kind I have him to thank for my school and college education Well yes said the old lawyer I suppose it is no breach of confidence to say that it is so And I have to thank him for mine and the pleasant life I have led mister Girtle have I not said the second of the ladies and but for the gloom the flush that came into her sweet face would have been plainly visible At that moment the footman entered with a letter upon a massive salver and as he walked straight to the old lawyer he cast quick furtive glances at the other occupants of the room A note eh said the old solicitor balancing his gold rimmed glasses upon his nose um um yes exactly very delicate of them to write Tell them I will see them shortly Charles The footman bowed and was retiring as silently as he came over the soft carpet when he was checked by the old solicitor You will tell mister Preenham to see that these gentlemen have every attention Yes sir The footman left the room almost without a sound for the door was opened and closed noiselessly The only thing that broke the terrible silence that seemed to reign was the faint clink of the silver tray against one of the metal buttons of the man s coat As for the magnificently furnished room with its heavy curtains and drawn down blinds it seemed to have grown darker so that the faint gleams of light that had hung in a dull way on the faces of the great mirrors and the gilded carving of console and cheffonier had died out It required no great effort of the imagination to believe that the influence of the dead man who had passed so many solitary years in that shut up house was still among them making itself felt with a weight from which they could not free themselves Paul Capel looked across at the beautiful face of Katrine D Enghien thinking of her creole extraction and the half French half American father who had married his relative He expected to see her looking agitated as her cousin Lydia Lawrence but she sat back with one arm gracefully hanging over the side of the chair her lustrous eyes half closed and a pang strongly akin to jealousy shot through him as it seemed that those eyes were resting on the young elegant at his side Yes said the old solicitor suddenly and his voice made all start but Miss D Enghien who did not even move her eyelids as I was saying he went on tapping his snuff box I can tell you very little mister Capel until the will is read Then there is a will said Miss D Enghien The old lawyer s brows wrinkled as he glanced at her in surprise Yes my dear young lady there is a will And it will be read of course directly after the funeral said the dark young man The lawyer did not reply I suppose you think it s bad form of a man asking such questions now but really mister Girtle it would be worse form for a fellow to be pulling a long face about one he never saw But he was your father s friend Oh yes of course Hence you sir are here continued the lawyer My instructions were clear enough I was to invite you here at this painful time and take my old friend s place as your host You have been most kind mister Girtle said Miss D Enghien I thank you madam and I grieve that you should have to be present at so painful a time My next instructions were to send for the Italian professor who is here to carry out the wishes of the deceased Horrible idea for a man to wish to be embalmed said Artis brutally Lydia Lawrence shuddered and turned away her face Paul Capel glanced indignantly at the speaker and then turned to gaze at Katrine D Enghien who sat perfectly unmoved her hand still hanging from the side of the chair as if to show the graceful contour of her arm Colonel Capel had been a great part of his life in the East mister Artis said the old lawyer coldly He had had the matter in his mind for some time How do you know that By the date on my instructions which also contained the Italian professor s card And I suppose we shall have a very eccentric will sir Yes said the lawyer quietly a very eccentric will Come that s refreshing said the young man with a fidgetty movement Well you are not very communicative mister Girtle You family solicitors are as close as your deed boxes Yes said the old lawyer closing his gold snuff box with a loud snap Well come it can be no breach of confidence to tell us when the funeral is to be The old lawyer took a turn or two up and down the room snuff box in hand the bright metal glistening as he swung his hand to and fro Then he stopped short and said slowly The successor to Colonel Capel s enormous property will inherit under extremely peculiar conditions duly set forth in the will it will be my duty to read to you After the funeral said Gerard Artis No sir there will be no funeral No funeral exclaimed Artis and Paul Capel in a breath and then they rose to their feet startled more than they would have cared to own for at that moment a strange wild cry seemed to come from the staircase followed by a heavy crash Good Heavens cried the old lawyer dropping his snuff box Katrine D Enghien alone remained unmoved with her head turned towards the door CHAPTER THREE ONE GUARDIAN OF THE TREASURE Paul Capel was the first to recover from the surprise and to hurry from the darkened room followed by Artis and the late Colonel s solicitor though it was into no blaze of light for the staircase was equally gloomy The source of the strange noise was not far to seek for as they reached the landing they became aware that a fierce struggle was going on in the direction of the room occupied by the late Colonel and hurrying there it was to find two men locked together one of whom was succeeding in holding the other down and wresting his neck from the sinewy hands which had torn off his white cravat Why Charles Ramo exclaimed mister Girtle in the midst of the hoarse panting sounds uttered by the contending men He s mad cried the former in a high pitched tone in which a man s rage was mingled with a schoolboy s whimpering fear He s mad sir He tried to strangle me Thief dog panted the old Hindoo with his dark features convulsed with passion Wanted rob his master The two young men had separated the combatants who now stood up the footman his vest and shirt torn open and his coat dragged half off the old man with one sleeve of his dark silk robe gone and the back rent to the waist while there was a fierce vindictive look in his working features as he had to be held to keep him from closing with the footman again What does this mean Charles cried mister Girtle as the butler and the other servants came hurrying up while the three Italians also stood upon the landing looking wonderingly on If you please sir I don t know said the footman in an ill used tone I was just going by the Colonel s door and I thought as was very natural that I should like to see what these gentlemen had done when mister Ramo sprang at me like a wild cat No no cried the old Indian whose English in his rage and excitement was less distinct a thief come to rob my dear lord a thief I hope sir said the footman growing calmer and looking in an injured way at mister Girtle you know me better than that sir mister Preenham here will tell you I ve cleaned the plate regular all the ten years I ve been here The old solicitor turned to the butler Yes sir Charles s duty has been to clean the plate but it is in my charge and I have kept the strictest account of it A little disposed to show temper sometimes sir but strictly honest and very clean This is a very sad and unseemly business at such a time said mister Girtle Ramo you have made a mistake No no cried the old Indian wrathfully Come come said mister Girtle be reasonable The police panted the old Indian Send for the police All right cried Charles defiantly send for the police and let em search me Silence cried mister Girtle Go down and arrange your dress sir mister Capel young ladies will you return to the drawing room Signori will you retire That will do Preenham Leave Ramo to me In another minute the old solicitor was left with Ramo who stood beneath the dim stained glass window with his arms folded and his brow knit You do not trust and believe me sir Don t talk nonsense Ramo You know I trust you as the most faithful fellow in the world He held out his hand as he spoke but the old Indian remained motionless for the moment then seizing the hand extended to him he bent over it holding it to his breast My dear lord s old friend he said That s better Ramo said mister Girtle Now go and change your dress No no cried the old man I must watch Nonsense man Don t think that every one who comes means to rob But I do cried the old Indian in a whisper They think of what we know you and I only Those foreign men the servants You must not be so suspicious Ramo It will be all right It will not be all right Sahib cried the old Indian Think of what there is in yonder But we have the secret Ramo Yes yes but suppose there were others who knew the secret who had heard of it Sahib I will be faithful to the dead The old Indian drew himself up with dignity and took his place once more before the door It has been shocking whispered the Indian I have been driven away while those foreign men did what they pleased in there It was maddening Ah He clapped his hands to his head What now Ramo Those three men Suppose He caught at his companion s arm whispered a few words and they entered the darkened room from which as the door opened and closed a peculiar aromatic odour floated out As the door was closed the sound of a bolt being shot inside was heard and directly after the face of Charles the footman appeared from the gloom below He came up the stairs rapidly glanced round and stepped softly to the closed door where he bent down listening As he stood in the recess the gloom was so great that he was almost invisible save his face while just beyond him a large group in bronze of a club armed centaur seemed to have the crouching man as part of the artist s design the centaur being apparently about to strike him down while to give realism to the scene a dull red glow from the stained glass window fell across his forehead As he listened there his ear to the key hole and his eyes watchfully wandering up and down the staircase a dull and smothered clang was heard as if in the distance like the closing of some heavy iron door Then there was a louder sound with a quick short report as if a powerful spring had been set in motion and shot home Then a door seemed to be closed and locked and the man glided quickly over the soft thick carpet melting away as it were in the gloom The door opened and from the darkness within mister Girtle and the old Indian stepped slowly out bringing with them a soft warm puff of the aromatic odour and as they grew more distinct in the faint light of the stained glass window everything was so still in the great house that there was a strange unreality about them fostered by the silence of their tread There now you are satisfied said the old lawyer gently Go and change your robe The Indian shook his head I will stay till your return inside the room Inside said the Indian Yes why not You and I have reached the time of life when death has ceased to have terrors He is only taking the sleep that comes to all There was a gentle sadness in the lawyer s voice and then turning the handle of the door he opened it and stood looking back You will not be long he said They are waiting for me in the drawing room The door closed just as the old Indian made a step forward to follow Then he stood with his hands clenched and eyes starting listening intently while the centaur s club seemed to be quivering in the gloom ready to crush him down The old man raised his hand to the door let it fall raised it again let it fall turned to go started back and then as if fighting hard with himself he turned once more and with an activity not to be expected in one of his years bounded up the staircase and disappeared Ten minutes had not elapsed before he seemed to come silently out of the gloom again and was half way to the door when there was a faint creak from below as if from a rusty hinge The old man stopped short crouching down by the balustrade listening his eyes shining in the dim twilight but no other sound was heard and he rose quickly ran softly down and with trembling hands opened the door mister Girtle came slowly out looking sad and depressed and laid his hand upon the Indian s shoulder You mean to watch then he said The Indian nodded quickly his eyes gazing searchingly at the lawyer the while Are you going in or here My place was at the Sahib s door Good said the solicitor bowing his head and he returned to the drawing room Ramo watching him suspiciously till the door closed As he stood there the dusky tint of the robe he now wore seemed to lend itself to the surrounding gloom being almost invisible against the portal as he remained there with his fingers nervously quivering and his face drawn by the agitation of his breast He shook his head violently the next moment clasped his hands together and sank down once more upon the lion skin mat bent to the very floor more like some rounded mass than a human being while the great centaur was indistinctly seen with his raised club as if about to repeat the blow that had crushed the old Indian into a motionless heap CHAPTER FOUR THE LAWYER S TIN BOX This has been a terrible week Katrine said Lydia Lawrence taking her cousin s hand Do you think so Oh yes I have not your sang froid I would give anything to go back to the country I have been curious to know all about the will That old man has been maddening He might have spoken But his instructions clear The will was to be read after he had lain there a week Lain in state said Katrine with a curl of her lip With a savage crouching on a lion skin at his door like some dog Pah It is absurd More like a scent in a French play than a bit of nineteenth century life Lydia sighed I felt greatly relieved when those dreadful men had gone What the Italian professors Pooh what a child you are I did not mind Lydia gazed at her with a feeling of shrinking wonder and there was something almost fierce in the beautiful eyes as Katrine sat there by one of the tables of the ill lit drawing room the two pairs of wax candles in old fashioned silver sticks seeming to emit but a feeble light and but for the warm glow of the fire the great room would have been sombre in the extreme What time is it Lydia There don t start like that What a kitten you are You spoke so suddenly dear It is half past ten Only half past ten Nearly an hour and a half before the play begins I wish we had kept the tea things Pray don t speak so lightly Katrine I can t help it It is so absurd for the old man to have left instructions for all this meretricious romance to surround his end As for old Girtle he seems to delight in it and goes about the house rubbing his hands like an undertaker Katrine Well he does Will read at half past eleven at night on the tenth day after the old man s death It is absurd Ah well I suppose a millionaire has a right to be eccentric if he likes Dear Katrine he was always so good Good Bah What did he ever do for me He hated my branch of the family and our Creole blood As if the D Enghiens were not a fine old French family before the Capels were heard of But Katrine I will speak I was dragged here to be present at this mummery to have for my share a hundred pounds to buy mourning and I vow I ll spend it in Chinese mourning and wear yellow instead of black Why don t those men come up instead of sitting smoking in that dining room and leaving us alone in this mausoleum of a place Here ring and send for them I m getting nervous too I m catching it from you weak little baby that you are At that moment the door opened and the two young men entered to go up to them both speaking to Lydia and then drawing their chairs nearer to Katrine Are you nearly ready for the play mister Capel she said after a time The play he exclaimed Yes the curtain will rise directly How do you feel Gerard Oh I don t know I want to hear how many chips the old boy has left me Deuced glad to get out of this tomb I say would you mind me lighting a cigar I don t mind said Katrine lightly Would you mind Miss Lawrence Mind your smoking here said Lydia hastily I I don t think I should but No no said Capel it is impossible For heaven s sake pay a little respect to the ladies if you cannot to the dead Artis started to his feet Look here Paul Capel he cried angrily you have taken upon yourself several times since I have been locked up here with you to use confoundedly offensive language to me How dare you speak to me like that Dare cried Capel rising Pooh he ejaculated throwing himself back and glancing at Katrine whose eyes seemed to flash with eager pleasure while Lydia half rose with extended hands I am forgetting myself Lydia sank back with a sigh while Katrine s eyes flashed and her lip curled Forgetting yourself cried Artis By Jove sir you ve done nothing else I suppose you expect to have all the old man s money but we shall see Don t be alarmed Miss Lawrence said Capel smiling I am not going to quarrel Ah here is mister Girtle The door opened and Charles entered with two more lighted candles one in each hand preceding mister Girtle who came in bearing a large tin deed box This he slowly proceeded to place upon the carpet beside a small table on which Charles deposited the candlesticks I think I am punctual said the lawyer taking his old gold watch from his fob and replacing it with a nod Yes nearly half past eleven Charles will you summon all the servants I think everyone is mentioned in the will he added as Charles left the room You will excuse all formalities I am strictly obeying instructions as to time and place The old gentleman took a jingling bunch of keys from his pocket bent down and opened the tin box from which he took out a square folded parchment crossed with broad green ribbons and bearing a great seal This he laid upon the table before him and sinking back in his chair proceeded to deliberately take snuff A dead silence reigned and in spite of himself Paul Capel felt agitated and sought from time to time to catch Katrine s eye while Lydia looked from one to the other sadly and Gerard Artis lay back in his chair The door once more opened and the servants filed in led by Preenham the butler Ramo coming last to stand with his arms folded and his head bent down upon his chest Be seated said mister Girtle and his voice sounded solemn and strange There was a rustling as the servants sat down in a row near the door Ramo doubling his legs beneath him and crouching on the floor The last will and testament of John Arthur Capel late Colonel in the Honourable East India Company s Service Special Commissioner with her Highness the Ranee of Illahad Resident at the court of her Highness the Begum of Rahahbad So read the confidential solicitor and friend of the deceased in a husky voice his gold rimmed glasses helping him to decipher the brown writing or endorsement of the yellow parchment Then he continued I have followed out the instructions of the deceased to the letter so far and now in continuance of these instructions in your presence I proceed to break this seal CHAPTER FIVE THE READING OF THE WILL There was a peculiar rustle in the gloomy room a faint sound as of catching of the breath and above all the sharp crackle of the broken wax as the seal was demolished and the green ribbon thrown aside Then after a prefatory Hem the old lawyer proceeded to read the will 
681-161945-0000	train-other-500	which was in the customary form and began with a series of bequests
none	none	 to the old and faithful servants of the house 
681-161945-0001	train-other-500	in respect of whose services
none	none	 and so that there should be no jealous feeling as to amounts he left each the sum 
681-161945-0002	train-other-500	of five hundred pounds free of duty and ten pounds to each to buy mourning To my old and faithful servant companion and friend read on the solicitor
none	none	 Ramo Ali Jee 
681-161945-0003	train-other-500	two hundred and fifty pounds per annum for the rest of his natural life the same to be secured in Three per cent Consols reverting at his death as hereinafter stated
681-161945-0004	train-other-500	Ramo did not move or utter a word To my old friend and adviser Joshua Girtle of the Inner Temple the plain gold signet ring on the fourth finger of my left hand
none	none	 Then followed a few more minor bequests and instructions of a very simple nature ending one long paragraph in the will and as mister Girtle removed his glasses 
681-161945-0005	train-other-500	and proceeded deliberately to wipe them the servants took advantage of the gloom where they sat to give each other a congratulatory shake of the hand I now come to the important bequests said mister Girtle
none	none	 rebalancing his glasses in his calm deliberate way 
681-161945-0006	train-other-500	To Katrine Leveillee D Enghien
none	none	 daughter of my niece Harriet D Enghien formerly Capel the gold bangle presented to me by the Ranee 
681-161945-0007	train-other-500	and one hundred pounds free of duty to buy mourning There what did I tell you said Katrine in a low sweet voice as she smiled at her companions To Gerard Artis
681-161945-0008	train-other-500	son of my cousin William Artis read on mister Girtle
none	none	 in the same monotonous unmoved way 
681-161945-0009	train-other-500	and then he stopped to draw one of the candles forward in front of the parchment The young man shifted his position uneasily and drew in his breath quickly as he thought
681-161945-0010	train-other-500	of the testator s immense wealth and glanced at Katrine I shall not get all he thought
none	none	 for he will leave something to Paul Capel 
681-161945-0011	train-other-500	Then after what seemed an age of suspense the old solicitor went on The sum of one hundred pounds free of duty to buy mourning There was a death like stillness as the lawyer paused
none	none	 Go on sir go on cried Artis in a harsh voice To Lydia Alicia No no finish the bequest to me 
681-161945-0012	train-other-500	I did sir One hundred pounds to buy mourning What Treat me worse than his servants I believe mister Artis if you will excuse me
681-161945-0013	train-other-500	that a testator has a perfect right to do what he likes with his own Then you influenced him cried Artis furiously I shall dispute the will The old gentleman smiled
none	none	 Influenced my old friend to leave me his signet ring eh mister Artis No sir the will was written by Colonel Capel himself and afterwards transferred to parchment If you will allow me I will proceed I shall dispute the will I say so at once cried Artis 
681-161945-0014	train-other-500	that there may be no mistake One hundred pounds each to Miss D Enghien and myself It is absurd paltry pitiful You never saw the testator mister Artis No sir
none	none	 Neither did you Miss D Enghien I Oh no He told me himself continued the old lawyer that he had never seen either Miss Lawrence or mister Paul Capel 
681-161945-0015	train-other-500	Lydia murmured an assent

none	none	 where he stood nearly invisible waiting until such time as he should be called upon to give up his share of the secret of the chamber beyond the dead man s room CHAPTER SIX A FIT OF GENEROSITY mister Paul Capel said the old solicitor allow me to add my congratulations and my hope that your fortune may prove a blessing But it is like a dream a romance cried Paul Capel All that wealth here in this house I wonder that he was not robbed My old friend took great precautions against that said mister Girtle As you will see it was impossible for any one to have stolen the valuables and notes But ought not this money to have been banked Of course or invested I have told him so often but he used to say he preferred to keep it as it was He had plenty for his wants and charities Your uncle was an eccentric man mister Capel there is no denying that Eccentric cried Artis Mad Well I give you all warning I shall take action and throw it into chancery He walked to the end of the room and Paul Capel looked after him uneasily as he saw Katrine follow You foolish boy she whispered am not I as badly used as you Be patient Wait What do you mean he whispered hastily She looked full in his eyes and he tried to read the mystery in their depths but without avail Why don t you speak he cried Some things are better left unspoken she replied Don t be rash I ll wait he whispered if you wish it I do wish it Take no notice of what I say or do Promise me that Promise me you will not make me jealous and I ll wait But maybe I shall make you jealous she said Still you know me Wait I m sorry for one thing mister Girtle said Paul Capel while this was going on May I ask what that is Oh yes Your simple bequest of a ring Will you you will not be offended mister Girtle out of this immense wealth allow me to make you some suitable Stop said the old gentleman laying his hand upon the speaker s arm My old friend wished to leave me a large sum but I chose that ring in preference Thank you all the same my dear young friend and I beg you will count upon me for help Well then there is something I should like to do at once Look here mister Girtle a million and a half With its strange burden Oh I don t mind that I want to do something over this money Miss Lawrence is well provided for but Miss D Enghien Well you had better marry her Do do you mean that No said the old man sternly I do not There is mister Artis too I should like To find him in funds to carry on a legal war against you for what he would call his rights My dear mister Capel may I as lawyer give you a bit of advice Certainly I ask it of you Then wait Capel drew back as the old gentleman proceeded to fold the will and lay it with other papers in the tin box while Ramo standing alone in the gloom with folded arms and apparently seeing nothing but observing every motion hearing almost every word noticed that Gerard Artis was watching the deposition of the will his hungry looks seeming to devour it as he felt that he would like to destroy it on the spot Ramo noted too that Paul Capel took a step or two towards where Katrine was talking eagerly to Artis Then he hesitated and turned off to where Lydia sat alone She too had been watching Paul Capel s actions and now that he turned to her she seemed to shrink back in her seat as if his coming troubled her Let me congratulate you mister Capel she said rather coldly Thank you he said with a sigh and she saw him glance in the direction of Katrine I think said mister Girtle loudly that we will now proceed to fulfil the next part of my instructions There was a sharp click heard here as he locked a little padlock on the tin box and Gerard Artis watched him thinking what a little there was between him and the obnoxious will Miss D Enghien Miss Lawrence will you kindly follow me Ramo lead the way It was like going from one gloom into another far deeper as the door was thrown open and Ramo led the way along the short wide passage bearing a silver candlestick whose light played softly on the great stained window when he stopped and illuminated the bronze club of the centaur still raised to strike The eyes of Gerard Artis were fixed upon the tin box containing the will the keen look of Katrine D Enghien on the old Indian servant as he took a key from his cummerbund while Paul Capel gazed with his soul in his glance on Katrine ignorant that with spirit sinking lower and lower Lydia was watching him The solicitor gave a glance around full of solemnity and awe as if to ask were all ready Then as if satisfied he made a sign to Ramo The Indian raised the candlestick above his head softly thrust in the key turned it and threw open the door when once more from the darkness within the strange aromatic odour floated forth mister Capel you are master here said the old lawyer softly Enter first CHAPTER SEVEN LYING IN STATE Paul Capel looked round at Katrine who gave him a sympathetic glance and entered the room taking a step forward and pausing for the rest to follow Ramo closed the door and drew a heavy curtain across whose rings made a peculiar thrilling noise on the thick brass rod Ramo then lit two wax candles upon the chimney piece and a couple more upon the dressing table whose united light was only sufficient to show in a dim way the extent of the room with its old fashioned bed and hangings of dark cloth similar curtains being over the window and across what seemed to be a second door opposite the couch There was an intense desire to look towards the bed but it was mastered by a strange shrinking and the visitors to the death chamber occupied themselves first in looking round at the objects that met their eye It was richly furnished and on every hand it seemed that its occupant had taken precautions to guard himself from the cold of England after a long sojourn in a hotter land A thick Turkey carpet was on the floor large skin rugs were by the fire place and bedside dressing table and wash stand Similar rugs were thrown over the easy chairs and on the comfortable couch by the ample fire place while here and there were trophies of foreign arms peculiarly shaped weapons lay on the dressing table and formed the ornamentation of the chimney piece In one corner of the room carefully arranged and hung upon a stand was a strangely grotesque object that in the semi darkness somewhat resembled a human figure but proved to be the tarnished uniform worn by the old officer coatee helmet sword and belts gorgeous with ornamentation a pair of pistols with silver butts and a small flag of faded silk and gilt stuff were grouped over a gold embroidered saddle and tarnished shabrack of Indian work Here too was one of the Indian figures of Buddha crouched upon an enormous bracket at this side of the room looking in the obscurity like a living watcher of the dead in an attitude of contemplation or prayer Ramo stood in the silent room holding the silver candlestick above his head motionless as another statue so much in keeping was he in his garb and colour with the surroundings But he was keenly watching every one the while and taking his cue from a mute question addressed by mister Girtle s eyes to Paul Capel he walked solemnly to the head of the heavily hung bed softly drew back one curtain and held the candle over his dead master s mortal remains Paul Capel felt a natural instinctive shrinking from approaching the bed but he did not hesitate stepping forward with reverence and even then his heart gave a throb of satisfaction that one of his female companions should have stepped calmly to his side Lying there as in a darkened tent with a couple of Indian tulwars crossed upon the bed s head was a perfectly plain oaken coffin of unusual size and without the slightest ornamentation save that on the lid resting against the side was a brass breastplate bearing the dead man s name age and the date of death Within wrapped in a rich robe of Indian fabric glittering with flowers wrought in gold thread lay the Colonel his face visible and presenting to those who gazed upon it for the first time the fine features of the old soldier with his closely cut grey hair ample beard and the scars of two sword cuts across brow and cheek There was no distortion The old man full of days lay calmly asleep and Paul Capel bent down and kissed the icy brow When he rose his companion pressed forward and as he gave way imitated his action when to his surprise he saw that it was not Katrine D Enghien but Lydia A low sigh fell upon their ears as they were leaving the bed s head and Paul raised his eyes to see that the old Indian was watching and in the semi darkness he saw him quickly raise a portion of Lydia s dress and hold it to his lips Drawing back they gave place to Katrine and Gerard Artis who walked to the bed s head stood for a moment or two and then as if moved by the same impulse both drew away The old Indian stepped back with his candlestick the polished silver of which seemed to glimmer and flash in the gloom the heavy curtain fell in its funereal folds and the group turned to mister Girtle The old man said a few words to Ramo who crossed the room to the dressing table taking one by one the candlesticks and placing them in Paul and Lydia s hands after which he took those from the chimney piece to give to Katrine and Gerard Artis the old lawyer taking the one the Indian had carried This done Ramo walked softly to the curtain that covered what seemed to be the second door and again there was the thrilling sound as the rings swept with a low rattle over the rod laying bare a strong iron door deep down in a narrow arched portal Opening his silken robe he drew out three keys of curious shape attached to a stout steel chain which seemed to be round his waist and softly placing one of them in the lock he turned it easily when a series of bolts shot back with a loud clang Then taking out the key he pressed the door with his shoulder and it swung slowly and heavily open apparently requiring all the old man s strength to throw it back Iron and of great thickness said mister Girtle in a low voice mister Capel shall I lead the way The Colonel s heir bowed and candle in hand the old lawyer passed through the doorway Ramo holding back the curtain and standing like the guardian of the place They saw mister Girtle take a couple of steps forward turn sharply and descend and as Paul Capel followed he found that to his left were half a dozen broad stone stairs flanked by a heavy balustrade and that the old lawyer was standing below holding up his light The next minute as they reached the floor of what seemed to be a good sized chamber there was the sound of the curtain being drawn as if to shut them in and Ramo came softly down the little flight of steps to stand at a distance with reverent mien By the light of the five candles they now saw that they were in a perfectly bare walled chamber apparently floor walls and groined roof of stone while in the centre stood a large massive cube of solid iron painted thickly to resemble stone So large was it that it seemed as if the remainder of the chamber left uncovered merely formed a passage to walk about the four sides This place the Colonel had constructed where a dressing room used to be said mister Girtle and his voice sounded peculiar being repeated in whispers from the wall in a hollow metallic ring that was oppressive as it was strange Why the place is like a vault with a tomb in it said Artis with an impatient tone in his voice It is a vault mister Artis said the old lawyer a vault in which is a tomb This he continued is all of enormous strength blocks of stone and concrete being beneath us and the walls and roof are of immense thickness The space to be blocked up is six feet through Humph highly interesting mister Showman muttered Artis and then at a look from Katrine he became attentive Colonel Capel continued the old lawyer had his own peculiar ideas and being an enormously wealthy man accustomed to command he considered he had a right to follow out his views I more than once pointed out to him when he made me his confidant that the proceedings he proposed might meet with opposition from the authorities but he replied calmly that the place was his own freehold and that everything was to be carried out privately but at the same time he would give as little excuse as possible for interference with his plans Besides he said once get the matter over and it would be forgotten in a week But in the name of common sense broke out Artis why Will you kindly retain your observations mister Artis until we have returned to the drawing room said the lawyer Artis was about to reply but Paul Capel saw that a look from Katrine restrained him and a jealous pang shot through his heart Balm came for the wound directly as Katrine raised her eyes to his let them rest there for a few moments and then veiled them as she gazed upon the floor Colonel Capel continued the old lawyer with his words whispering about the stone walls had a double intention in having the place constructed It was for his mausoleum after death for his strong room during life Within this iron room or chamber which would defy any burglar s tools is a chest of steel constructed from the Colonel s own designs to contain his enormous fortune and when that has been taken out at twelve o clock to morrow it is to be replaced by the coffin that lies in the next room by us who are present now to be closed up and locked the iron chamber is to be also closed then the iron door and lastly we are to see that portal completely walled up as I have already told you and forgotten But said Artis quickly is the large sum in notes here in this place Yes sir And the diamonds the pearls said Katrine Yes my dear young lady all are here And you have the keys I and Ramo the deceased s trusted servant But is Artis was about to continue it safe to trust that man but as he spoke he glanced at Ramo who was watching him My guide is the series of rules written by Colonel Capel sir said mister Girtle coldly Can we see the jewels said Katrine Yes you can show us the treasure cried Artis with a half laugh As we two are to have nothing we might be indulged with a peep The treasure is mister Paul Capel s sir said the old lawyer but even if he expressed a wish I could not depart from my instructions To morrow at noon I bid you all to meet me at the door of Colonel Capel s room To morrow said Artis To day The old lawyer glanced at his watch Yes he said to day I had forgotten that it was so late Will you kindly accompany me to the drawing room The Indian went first and drew back the curtain and they passed up into the bedroom where the old officer lay in state There they paused as Ramo drew back the iron door and turned the key when the bolts shot into their sockets and the curtain was drawn Then glancing at the bed they passed out of the room Ramo locking the door listening sharply with his ears twitching as he caught a faint creaking noise made by a lock in the lower part of the house How strange that bronze figure looks said mister Girtle glancing up at the great centaur looming indistinctly against the stained glass window in whose recess it stood Yes said Paul It is a fine work but it looks as if it were going to dash out some one s brains That is what I have always thought whenever I have entered or left that room I wish to Heaven it had both of you muttered Artis A hundred pounds Good God A hundred pounds The same thought may have entered Katrine D Enghien s head for as they moved towards the drawing room she laid her arm affectionately round Lydia s slight waist and said softly to herself A bangle and a hundred pounds Mon Dieu Then the drawing room door closed and Ramo stood in the dark leaning over the balustrade of the great well staircase listening intently till he saw a door open and a flash of light came out shining on the round full face of the old butler and the keen features of Charles the footman the latter bearing a tray of silver chamber candlesticks Ramo glided away and the two servants bore the tray to the drawing room asked if they would be wanted again and retired Good night dearest cried Katrine kissing Lydia affectionately I congratulate you I am not jealous Good night mister Girtle how tired you must be she said shaking hands Good night mister Artis Good night mister Capel I congratulate you heartily Good night Five minutes later the great drawing room was as still as the chamber of the dead and in the dark house on staircase and in hall statue and picture looked on and the kneeling idols crouched with their eyes closed to what was passing while the great bronze centaur stood with uplifted club ready to strike there where he seemed to be on guard at his dead master s door But he struck no blow and the night passed and the morning came a dull drizzling morning when the fog hung low and it was still like night when Preenham the butler knocked heavily at mister Girtle s door The old lawyer drew the wire and the night latch allowed the butler to rush in Hot water Preenham said the old man For Heaven s sake get up sir and I ll call mister Capel sir panted the butler What Something wrong Yes sir quick I m afraid there s murder done CHAPTER EIGHT THE HORRORS OF A MORN By the time mister Girtle was partly dressed and had hurried out on the landing Paul Capel and Gerard Artis had left their rooms ready to question him upon the cause of the alarm I don t know he said trembling Preenham came and roused me speaking of murder and bless my soul I did not know you were there Miss Lawrence too Katrine and Lydia had joined them there on the landing of the second floor where a chamber candlestick on a table was almost the only light for that which came through the ground glass at the top of the staircase was so much yellow gloom One of the maids Anne came and woke me said Katrine speaking very calmly as she looked from one to the other the most collected of any one present She said there was something wrong She woke me too cried Lydia who was trembling visibly and looked of a sallow grey mister Girtle will you come down It was the butler s voice and Paul Capel ran quickly down the stairs to the drawing room floor where the old butler ghastly pale with his hair sticking to his forehead had lit half a dozen candles and stood them some on a table some on the pedestal of the great bronze group outside Colonel Capel s door What is it Speak man cried Capel The ladies Don t let the ladies come It was too late they were already there and the women servants were dimly seen in the gloom at the foot of the stairs But what is wrong cried Capel I I The butler passed his hand over his humid face and looked piteously from one to the other Preenham Speak man At once said mister Girtle sternly I woke at half past seven sir he said in a trembling voice and wondered that I had not been called at seven mister Ramo sir always rose very early and called me and Charles but I was not surprised for since master s death he has slept outside his door I think I m almost sure though I never said anything to Man you are torturing us cried Capel Give him time said Artis who looked nervous and strange Yes let him speak said Katrine Go on mister Preenham and tell us Thank you ma am I will said the butler but but would you ladies go back to your room or the drawing room I ve something something I m not a child said Katrine Lydia dear you had better go I will stay with you said Lydia laying her hand upon Katrine s arm and after a helpless look round and a motion of his hands as if he washed them of any trouble that might come the old butler went on I didn t take much notice as we were late last night but as soon as I was dressed I knocked at Charles door he sleeps in a turn up bedstead in the servants hall The old man directed this piece of information to those around him and then went on There was no answer so I went in and Charles was not there Not there said mister Girtle quickly No sir The bed had not been slept in His livery was on the chair by it and his cupboard was open where he keeps his private clothes This is strange said mister Girtle Go on Yes sir I thought perhaps he had let himself out through the area gate sir He has done such things before and at a time like this I must speak plain Yes Let me have the truth Go on I was very angry sir and I meant to tell you for it seemed disgraceful at such a time Go on I will sir faltered the butler but you must not flurry me I have had a shock Let him go on his own way mister Capel said the old lawyer Preenham gave him a grateful look and continued I thought I d go and speak to mister Ramo and then I met Cook and Anne We were on the mat mister Preenham said a husky voice from below Yes missus Thompson quite right and they went on to the kitchen while I went up into the hall and undid the bolts of the front hall door and let down the chain Yes exactly Then I went up sir to see if mister Ramo was at master s door Yes go on said Capel excitedly And when I came to the door sir I found it was ajar and though I listened I could not hear a sound So I pushed the door against the big curtain and called softly Ramo mister Ramo but there was no answer and then I felt a bit alarmed and after waiting a moment I went down and got a light Well I called again sir twice and then pushing open the door a puff of wind nearly blew out the light Wind cried mister Girtle and he took a step towards the door Stop a minute sir please said the butler appealingly I went in quickly and the first thing I saw was the curtain dragged aside and the window open Yes go on cried mister Girtle for the butler was trembling so that he could hardly speak And the next sir I nearly fell over him there was poor mister Ramo lying in a pool of blood Oh The cry came from Lydia as she tottered and clung to Katrine calm amidst the horrors of the recital I put the candle on the floor sir and went down on my knee beside him cried the butler growing more and more agitated Look he said piteously pointing to his trousers and his hands I touched him sir but he was dead sir dead and I came up then and alarmed the house Artis looked at the butler narrowly as his eyes wandered from one to the other Have you been in since Preenham No sir I went and got the candles and lit all I could Capel was about to rush into the room but he stopped on the threshold Miss D Enghien Miss Lawrence this is no place for you Pray go back to your rooms Yes said Katrine slowly mister Capel is right Come dear with me She passed her arm round Lydia and the two seemed to fade away into the darkness as Capel mister Girtle Artis and lastly the butler went into the room CHAPTER NINE ANOTHER DISCOVERY It was precisely as the butler had said There was the window open a window looking out on to some leads And beyond them the low houses of a mews which ran at the back There at a short distance from the bed was the Colonel s faithful servant in a pool of blood with a kukri one of those ugly curved Indian knives clasped tightly in his hand Dead said mister Girtle and then rising quickly he ran to the further portal drew back the curtain and found the iron door closed There has been a terrible struggle here said Capel Look He pointed to where plainly seen on the white counterpane that half covered the heavy valance there was the mark of a bloody hand that had caught the quilt and dragged it a little down Yes said mister Girtle looking about at overturned chairs a small table driven out of its place and a carriage clock swept off and lying on the floor Yes there has been a terrible struggle He looked at the dead man and then in the direction of the strong chamber Artis saw and said maliciously Murder must mean robbery Impossible said the lawyer The door is shut Stop Let me see and stooping he thrust his hand inside the silken robe the old Indian wore There was a dead silence as he searched hastily and then drew out the keys and chain All safe he cried see here are the keys They slip off and on this spring swivel the old man always wore them there The key of that door the key of the iron chamber the key of the steel chest Gentlemen I shall remove the keys mister Capel they are yours now Take them No said Capel quietly Keep them sir Now what do you make of this It seems to me that the murderer must have come in by this door and encountered Ramo and after the terrible struggle have escaped by the window Exactly said mister Girtle Unless said Artis some one killed this black fellow when trying to rob his master Absurd cried Capel angrily as he bent down over the dead man Look here he cried whoever it was must have been wounded This knife is covered with blood His own perhaps said Artis May be so but I think not Now mister Girtle what next The police said the old lawyer huskily Preenham fetch me a little brandy this terrible scene has made me faint Go sir Leave you here Yes go at once said mister Girtle and there seemed to be an unwillingness to leave as the butler went out and closed the door You did not want that brandy said Artis quickly You wanted to get rid of him for a few minutes I know what you are thinking that it was that scoundrelly faced footman Yes you have guessed my thoughts And you suspect the butler I do not say that sir said the lawyer coldly We do not know that there has been any robbery until the plate is examined but we ought to have sent for a doctor at once I ll go said Capel and hurrying out of the room he ran down the stairs caught his hat from the stand and hurried from street to street till he saw the familiar red eyed lamp Five minutes after he was on his way back in a cab with a keen looking youngish man to whom he gave an account of the morning s discovery Have you given notice to the police No If I were you I should send a messenger straight to Scotland Yard It will save you from the blundering of some young constable Humph too late For as they reached the room there was the familiar helmet of one of the force the man having found the door left open by Capel and rung He was a heavy dull looking man who seemed as he stood in the darkened room to consider it his duty to thrust his hand in his belt and stare at the ghastly figure on the floor Meanwhile the doctor was busily examining the body of the Indian servant Quite dead said mister Girtle Yes Rigor mortis has set in Suicide Suicide sir Oh bless my soul no But that weapon Yes some one had an awful cut with that I should say continued the doctor and the constable mentally drew a line from the kukri to the open window out on to the leads and down into the mews What has caused his death I cannot tell you yet said the doctor Hold the light here closer please Hah that is the mark of a blow on the arm There is this wound on the chin and on the neck Hah Yes this seems more likely There has been a tremendous blow dealt here on the head but no fracture I think sort of blow a life preserver would give but really I cannot account so far for his death Unless What is this peculiar odour I told you said Capel pointing to the bed No I don t mean that said the doctor quickly I mean this about here Can you see any bottle He ran his hand down the side of the silk robe and then looked round where he knelt What do you mean doctor said mister Girtle There is the same odour that I should expect to notice in a case of suicide with poison Doesn t look much like that said Artis Why doctor look at the traces of the struggle I have looked at them sir replied the doctor but so far I detect no cause for death A proper examination may give different results but I must have the assistance of a colleague Done sir Finished said the constable who had remained for the time unnoticed Yes my man You will give notice of this at once and lock up the room All in good time sir I should like a look round Door open you say Yes said mister Girtle Window open Yes Well then the fellow who did it seems to have come in here and escaped there after getting a cut with that crooked knife He turned on his bull s eye lantern and made the light play from where the body lay over the Turkey carpet to the window where he turned off the light for there was sufficient for him to see and examine the seat and sill No stains no marks of hands on the window no footmarks outside on the leads not a spot He shook his head and came back Well my man said mister Girtle Don t be in a hurry sir Law moves slow and sure I was in the country before I got out of the rural into the metropolitan What has that to do with this cried Artis Everything sir said the constable turning sharply on the young man and watching him narrowly I ve known cases where windows have been set open to make it seem that some one s gone through But the murderer is not in the house said mister Girtle uneasily and we suspect Who s that said the constable sharply Oh you mister Butler Yes I ve brought the brandy for mister Girtle sir Never mind now said the policeman Set it down Gentlemen I ve got a theory about this here He turned on his bull s eye again as he spoke A theory cried Capel impatiently Yes sir You see that crooked knife thing Yes And the mark of the bloody hand on the counterpane where it is dragged Yes we saw that Well has any one looked under the bed No Then we shall find him there He stepped forward and raised the heavy valance directing the light beneath There he exclaimed What did I say CHAPTER TEN WHY DOCTOR HE S DEAD In one moment the slow heavy looking constable changed from a rustic loutish fellow to a man full of intelligent observation for as he raised the valance of the bed there indistinctly seen was the body of a man either through fear or to escape observation With a quick motion of the hand the constable opened the leather case at his side and drew his truncheon Stand at the window sir he said to Capel You sir keep the door Now then he cried as soon as he had been obeyed and in a sharp authoritative voice The game s up Out you came Capel set his teeth hard for all this was horrible in that chamber of death Do you hear cried the constable sharply for there was neither word nor movement from beneath the bed Oh very well he continued only I warn you I stand no nonsense And the occupants of the room prepared for a struggle with beating hearts The constable stepped back to them and from behind his hand said softly Be ready perhaps there s two He stepped back and stooped with his staff ready for a blow Now then he cried is it surrender There was no answer and he thrust his hand beneath the bed seized the man s leg and dragged him out into the room but only to loose his hold and start away Why doctor he cried he s dead The doctor caught up a candlestick and dropped on one knee beside the fresh horror while the light from the bull s eye was again brought to bear and mingled with the wan yellow rays that struggled in through the panes Good God gentlemen gasped the butler it s Charles The horribly distorted features were indeed those of the footman and the mystery of the death chamber began to grow lighter for it was evident that for some reason he had entered the room in the night For no good mission certainly a short whalebone handled life preserver hanging by a twisted thong from his wrist The hideous stains upon the kukri were clearly enough explained by the sight of a terrible gash in the man s throat and one of his hands was crimsoned and smeared the one that had left its print upon the quilt as in his death struggle he had rolled beneath the bed No one else there gentleman said the constable looking beneath the bed and making his lantern play there and about the curtains whilst as it shed its keen light across the calm sleeping face of the Colonel the man involuntarily took off his helmet and stepped back on tiptoe Dead some hours said the doctor rising It is clear enough said mister Girtle in the midst of the painful silence This poor Hindoo was the faithful old servant of my deceased friend and he died in defence of his master s property Yes yes cried the old butler excitedly Charles used to talk about master s money and diamonds in the servants hall I used to reprove him and say that talking about such things was tempting yourself Never asked you to be in it of course said the constable going close up to him Oh no never sir but are you quite sure both him and mister Ramo are dead Quite said the constable There you can say what you like but it s my duty to tell you that I shall take down anything you say and it may be used in evidence against you Against me cried the butler Yes against you But there was no occasion for the note book for Preenham closed his lips and did not speak again I think I will satisfy myself constable that all is safe here said mister Girtle Gentlemen will you come with me He crossed the room drew back the curtain over the portal and taking out his keys unlocked and pushed back the door descending with the others into the vault like chamber and examining the massive iron structure in the middle It is quite safe he said as the constable made the light of his lantern play here and there But you have not looked in the safe said Artis quickly There is no need sir No one could have opened it even with the keys but Ramo or myself Nothing has been touched The policeman drew a long breath and they returned to the death chamber mister Girtle carefully locking the iron door I don t think we shall want any detectives here gentlemen said the constable I shall stay on the premises but perhaps you will let the butler no I think one of you perhaps will be good enough to send in the first constable you see I am going back said the doctor I can do no more now policeman I will send a man to you Thankye sir if you will Of course you will give notice to the coroner and there will be a post mortem You leave that to me sir only send me one of our men They were stealing out on tiptoe when Capel went back and drew the heavy curtains right across the bed to shut from the old warrior the horrors that lay in the middle of the room The constable too stepped softly across to fasten the window Then following the others out he closed and locked the door turning round directly ducking down and involuntarily attempting to draw his truncheon as he raised his left arm to ward off a blow Bah he ejaculated Why it s a stature Looked just as if it was going to knock one down CHAPTER ELEVEN THE TREASURE A week of horror and anxiety during which the customary legal processes had been gone through A jury had visited the Dark House and been conducted through the two rooms to go away disappointed at not seeing the inside of the great iron safe Then after the evidence had been given by the various witnesses at the inquest including that of the two doctors who had performed the post mortem examination a verdict was returned which charged Charles Pillar with wilful murder and stated that the Indian had committed justifiable homicide The doctors had differed as it is proverbially said that they will doctor Heston the young medical man who had been called in first telling the jury that he was not satisfied that the blows given had caused the death and drawing attention to the peculiar odour he had noticed But the Coroner an old medical man sided with the colleague who pooh poohed the idea and the verdict was given The coroner was a good deal exercised in his mind whether some proceedings ought not to have been taken in respect to the remains of the late Colonel but he obtained no legal support and the terrible murder and attempted robbery at Number nineA Albemarle Square with the history of the embalming and the mysterious inner chamber were public property for the usual nine days when something fresh occurred and the interest died away Then once more there was the old peace in the Dark House where the remains of Colonel Capel lay in state in the mystery haunted room The servants were very reticent and consequently but little was heard of the proceedings in Albemarle Square A good many loiterers had stopped to stare at the darkened windows of the great mansion but as two coffins had been borne from the place it was forgotten outside that another still remained What might have been some busy body s business became no one s and the horrible tragedy tended towards the simplification of the dead man s instructions It is nine days now since the Colonel s commands should have been fulfilled said mister Girtle as they were seated at lunch in the darkened dining room the same party for Katrine had expressed her determination to stay in the house through all the trouble and Lydia had offered to remain with her Katrine and Lydia had kept a great deal to their rooms mister Girtle spent most of his time in the library busy over papers only appearing at meal times and consequently Paul Capel was thrown a great deal into the society of Gerard Artis treating him always in the most friendly way and declining to notice the barbs of the verbal arrows the other was fond of launching One of Artis s favourite allusions was to the house his companion inherited I felt horribly jealous of you at first he said Seemed such a pot of money but with special commands to live here with a haunted room and a mausoleum beyond it no thank you What shall you do with the chamber of horrors said Artis on another occasion You heard it is to be built up No no I mean the bedroom Ugh I shall take that as my own What A room haunted with the spirits of three dead men Bah Impossible Then came the ninth day and mister Girtle announced that on the next his instructions should be carried out precisely at twelve That will give you ample time mister Capel to visit a banker afterwards for after the late experience I should not lose an hour in depositing your great uncle s bequest in the hands of your banker You will go with me I hope The old man looked pleased and nodded But I had reckoned upon seeing the jewels said Katrine with a smile at the young heir which made his heart throb and Lydia shrink That pleasure must be deferred Miss D Enghien said the old lawyer crustily and no more was said At twelve o clock punctually the next day mister Girtle unlocked the door of the Colonel s room and fulfilling Ramo s duty held it back while the young men bore in lights Katrine and Lydia followed and the old butler looking shrunken and depressed came last to close the door and draw the curtain It was mid day but it might have been midnight Candles were lit again on chimney piece and dressing table and after the old solicitor had seen that the door was fastened within he took out his key drew the portal curtain at the end and then unlocked and slowly pushed open the iron door At a given order the butler solemnly carried a couple of candles down into the vault and stood there in the gloomy stone chamber where to those who stood waiting his return they seemed to cast a peculiarly weird light Then in utter silence the lid was placed over the calm sleeping features and the four men taking each a handle lifted and bore the coffin down There was some little difficulty in the sharp turn of the steps but in a few minutes all was done and the coffin lay upon the flagstones while the two girls stood hand clasping hand mister Girtle walked round to the back of the iron safe and stooped down when a peculiar clang was heard as if a spring had been set free and a large panel at the end where Capel was standing dropped down As the old lawyer came back candle in hand it was now seen that the panel that had fallen laid bare a key hole Upon the key being inserted in this and turned the panel flew back and glided over the key hole as soon as the key was drawn out displaying a second key hole crossed by a row of lettered brass slides These the old lawyer manipulated till the letters formed in a row a particular word when the second key hole was laid bare the key inserted and turned and one end of the iron safe revolved on a pair of huge pivots shewing the interior plain rectangular and dark with an oblong mass of black metal in the centre The steel chest said the old lawyer in a whisper as he stepped inside the great safe in which he could nearly stand upright Candle in hand he went to the other end put down the light for a moment to set his hands free to get a second key a curiously long thin key with the end of which he pushed something at the back of the chest Then going to one side he repeated the act went back round to the other side and again repeated it after which he came to the front and as he held down the light those who were intently watching his actions saw that there was a small circle of Roman figures with a hand like that of a small clock which he pushed round with the end of the key till it was at the letter V This done he bent over the chest and repeated the action twice upon the top Then as he stepped out a sharp sound was heard and a key hole was laid bare once more In this he placed the key turned it and the steel chest seemed to split open from end to end dividing in equal parts which slowly turned over on massive hinges leaving the centre a space large enough to hold the coffin wide open mister Capel said the old lawyer stepping aside the next duty is yours There lie the bank notes and the case of precious stones I give them over to your care Paul Capel hesitated for a moment glanced at his companions then back at the opening leading to the Colonel s room where Katrine and Lydia were watching The young man s heart beat heavily as he took the candle and stooping down entered the iron chamber to take from its hiding place his enormous fortune It was but a step and he had only to stretch out his hand to pick up the two cases but The steel chest held nothing The treasure was not there CHAPTER TWELVE THE END OF THE INSTRUCTIONS Paul Capel did not realise his position Is there some mistake mister Girtle Mistake There is nothing here Nothing there Nothing See for yourself The old man stepped in searched and came out with drops of sweat upon his yellow forehead Well exclaimed Capel excitedly as the old man stared in a dazed way It is gone said the old lawyer in a hoarse voice and his hands trembling violently Well mister Girtle said Capel at last in a voice that he vainly strove to make firm what have you to say To say said the old lawyer hastily Oh it is all a cock and bull story cried Artis There never was any treasure Silence sir cried the old lawyer recovering himself How can you speak like that in the presence of the dead Bah cried Artis Presence of the dead indeed Presence of a mummy Would you have me pull a long face as I went through the British Museum I would have you behave You look here cried Artis sharply You are executor and this treasure if there was one lay in your charge It s nothing to me If it were I should call in the police mister Capel cried the old lawyer excitedly I swear to you sir that the money and jewels were there a fortnight ago I came down here with Ramo and there lay the two cases with their contents Well said Capel what then We carefully closed up the place Then somebody must have been down since and taken the treasure away Only two men could have done this sir Ramo and myself That throws it on to you said Artis And my reputation sir will bear me out when I proclaim my innocence I don t know said Artis Sudden temptation kleptomania and that sort of thing The old lawyer turned his back mister Gerard Artis this is no time for such remarks as these said Capel mister Girtle what have you to say At present nothing sir I am astounded You know we came down on that dreadful morning and found the chamber intact besides it could not have been forced There were the keys said Artis But they have never left my person There were but the two sets of keys the Colonel s and mine Those were the Colonel s set that we found upon Ramo Rather strange that the Colonel should have given you a set said Artis No more strange than that a gentleman should trust a banker said Capel What going to side with the lawyer Capel made no reply only gazed searchingly at the old executor There may have been other keys mister Girtle Oh no The place was made some years ago for a sarcophagus and the makers never imagined that it would be used for a safe There was a dead silence Let us search again The cases may have slipped aside It is impossible said the old lawyer and as they two passed into the iron chamber Artis exchanged a glance with Katrine while the old butler stood looking dazed You see said mister Girtle holding down the light there is nowhere for the cases to have slipped all is of plain solid steel without a corner or crack But underneath said Capel Underneath Look for yourself said mister Girtle where there is not solid steel there is solid iron and beneath that massive stone The treasure seems to have been spirited away That s it said Artis The old man was not satisfied and he got up out of his coffin and hid it somewhere else Capel caught Artis by the collar I will not he began but mastering his indignant anger he let fall his arm There is nothing here he said let us look about the outside That was the work of a minute for on every hand there was the blank stone wall floor and roof and the exterior of the iron safe or tomb was perfectly rectangular and smooth What was the size of the cases One was about twelve inches by eight and three or four deep and the other rather smaller replied the old lawyer both too large for me to have juggled them into my pockets when I opened the steel chest mister Artis You held the keys and if you meant to take the treasure you had it before Enough of this cried Capel It is plain that the bequest has been taken away mister Girtle we will finish at once fulfil my uncle s commands Come He went to the head of the oaken coffin and took one handle when influenced by his example the others helped to raise it a little from the floor and it was thrust in and onward till it rested upon the bottom of the steel chest nearly filling the space Capel stood on the right of the entrance and for fully five minutes there was perfect silence in the solemn chamber Go on mister Girtle Capel said at last and the old man bent down thrust the key in the end gave a half turn and the two ponderous sides slowly curved over till they were nearly together leaving only a few inches of the shining brass breastplate visible Then there was a faint click and the left side fell heavily setting free the right which descended with a loud clang and closed tightly over a rebate in the lower side so closely that it was only by holding a candle near that the junction could be seen Go on and the old lawyer again inserted a key There was no show of effort on his part as the old lawyer turned the key when the end of the iron chamber closed in tightly and after once more examining the blank stone chamber they slowly ascended the steps Then the iron door was closed and locked and mister Girtle handed Capel the keys An hour later a couple of masons were at work with the stones that were below in the locked up cellar and the next day they had filled in a wall of six feet thick cemented over the face so that only a dark patch showed where the entrance to the colonel s tomb had been CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE YOUNG DOCTOR Look here said Artis you mustn t be offended with me I speak very plainly and if I can be of any use to you I will They were in the drawing room Preenham having announced that the masons had left I am not going to think of your remarks I was thinking of going to day continued Artis but I feel now that I ought not to go and leave you in a regular hole like this There is no need for you to stay Well no need of course but I suppose you will not kick me out Of course not You are welcome That s right said Artis You see he continued looking round to where Katrine and Lydia sat together I feel it due to myself to stop and show that I had no hand in that No one accused you mister Artis Oh no of course not that would be too good a joke Then I shall stay Our case is different said Lydia turning red and then pale mister Capel Miss D Enghien and I if we can be of no more use would like to say good bye this afternoon But why cried Capel as he glanced at the speaker and then fixed his eyes on Katrine There is no occasion for you to leave I think Miss Lawrence is right said Katrine But I want help and counsel from both of you You must not leave me yet It is impossible for us to stay Impossible Why Etiquette Is not mister Girtle here Are not things as they have been since we met I did not know that mister Girtle was going to stop said Katrine softly If I felt that we could be of any service Then you will stay cried Capel warmly Katrine hesitated looked up then down raised her eyes once more and left her chair to take Lydia s hand Let us go up stairs she said softly Lydia rose at once You do not speak said Capel Katrine did not answer till they reached the door and then she raised her eyes to his with a long timid look If Lydia consents so will I And you will stay Miss Lawrence to help me cried Capel warmly I will said Lydia gravely That s right cried Capel opening the door for them to pass out and catching Katrine s eye for a moment as she passed Curse her She s playing a dangerous game said Artis to himself as he watched the ladies leave the room Glancing aside he saw that the old lawyer was watching him narrowly I suppose you are not glad that I am going to stay mister Girtle he said For some things I am said the old man coolly For others I am not Just then Capel returned The two girls separated as they reached their rooms Katrine kissing Lydia s cheek and then as soon as she was alone her countenance changed and she sat gazing with glowing eyes that seemed full of some purpose upon which she was bent At the same time Lydia Lawrence sat with her face buried in her hands weeping silently and wishing that she were back in her country home Very little more was said below for mister Girtle had an engagement in the City and left the young men together You won t have a detective set to work No Well do as you like I m off for a run to get rid of this gloom Back to dinner Thank goodness said Artis breathing more freely and five minutes after he was slowly crossing the square wondering who the man was who had just gone up to the door he had left I ve seen his face before he muttered Why of course the young doctor What does he want Capel was thinking of the fortune that had slipped through his fingers Depressed and yet at times overjoyed for Katrine s glance had been full of hope But he must trace the money that had been taken and the gems how lovely they would look on Katrine s neck He sighed as he pictured her thus adorned and he was sinking into a day dream when the door opened softly and Preenham entered with the doctor s card Doctor Heston Show him up Capel motioned his visitor to a chair when the keen looking young doctor who was watching him narrowly said I dare say you are surprised to see me here Oh no A call I only make professional calls mister Capel I have come to you on an important matter Indeed exclaimed Capel Yes Respecting the death of one of those two men the Indian sir I m afraid there was some foul play there Foul play Why he was killed with a life preserver The doctor tapped with his fingers on his hat as if he was beating a funeral march Then quickly No sir the more I study this case the more I feel convinced that he was not CHAPTER FOURTEEN A CLEVER DIPLOMATIST Doctor Heston you surprise me There was the inquest Yes where my opinion sir was overruled by the coroner and my colleague both elderly medical men sir while I am young and comparatively inexperienced You are disposed to think that this is a case of professional jealousy I will be frank with you I did think so Exactly but pray disabuse your mind I am not jealous I am angry with myself for giving way in that case It seemed all very straightforward but it was not May I ask what you mean I mean sir that I am certain that our poor old Indian friend did not die from the blow that he received from that life preserver How then said Capel huskily It seems to me that he must have been poisoned in some way or another and I could not rest without coming to you Oh impossible Perhaps so sir but I am telling you what I believe Do you think he had any enemies here Oh no the servants seemed to have been on friendly terms Well it hardly seems like it That wretch must have yielded to a terrible temptation said Capel and the other was defending his master s goods What goods said the doctor Capel was silent I see sir there is more mystery about this than you care to explain Was there some heavy sum of money in the late Colonel s room and were these two men in league I don t think they were in league Was any one else interested in the matter Oh no impossible said Capel half aloud doctor Heston I am afraid there is a good deal of imagination in what you say Let me try and disabuse your mind I should be glad if you could Capel paced the room for a few minutes This has taken me quite by surprise Doctor Heston he said Give me a little time to think it over Will you keep perfectly private all that you have said to me I don t like to suspect men unjustly and yet I m afraid I ve done wrong in giving him time said the doctor as he went down Well a week is not an age As soon as he had left Paul Capel let his head go down upon his hands for his brain seemed to be in a whirl the death of Ramo the disappearance of the fortune the visit of the doctor It only wanted this latter with the hints he had thrown out to fire a train of latent suspicion in the young man s mind There was that open window that the policeman had declared had not been used Was he wrong Had others been in the conspiracy and turned afterwards on Ramo and Charles They might have been in the plot Or again they might have been defending their master s wealth against the wretch who had escaped with the treasure by the open window Those three Italians Had they anything to do with the matter The old butler He seemed so quiet and innocent But often beneath an air of innocency crime found a resting place Then he found himself suspecting mister Girtle and on the face of the evidence Capel laid before himself the case looked very black He knew everything he held the keys he the old friend and companion had been left merely a signet ring Impossible cried Capel half aloud I might as well suspect Artis or Miss Lawrence or Katrine herself May I come in said a voice that sent a thrill through the thinker and Katrine D Enghien stood in the doorway Come in Yes cried Capel advancing to meet her with open hands and moved by an impulse that he could not withstand Is anything the matter she said simply Yes no yes a great deal is the matter cried Capel There I must speak to you mister Capel she said half in alarm Forgive me if I seem impetuous he cried but I am greatly troubled in mind and I feel as if I would give anything for the sympathy of one who would listen to my troubles and help me with her counsel Surely you have all our sympathy mister Capel said Katrine innocently Yes I hope so he cried earnestly but I want more than that Katrine You must know that I love you mister Capel Pray do not be angry with me Is this a time or season to make such a declaration to me mister Capel said Katrine softly For some things no for other things yes I am in such sore need of help and counsel such as could be given me by the woman who returned my love No no don t leave me Hear me out As soon as I heard that will read it filled my heart with joy for it told me that I was rich and that these were riches which I could share with you Then when the discovery was made that the treasure had been stolen it was not the wealth that I regretted but I despaired because it seemed that you were farther from me But listen to me I am trying hard to discover how this large fortune has been swept away Katrine s eyes glittered Help me in my endeavours and tell me this some day if I make the discovery and am once more in a position to ask you to be my wife you will listen to me She raised her beautiful eyes to his and he caught her hand It was withdrawn and she said softly I am sorry you should think me so sordid Then you love me he cried I made no such confession The man to whom I give my hand will not be chosen for the sake of his money Then I may hope he cried mister Capel is it not your duty to find your fortune Yes but let me say our fortune he cried mister Capel do not speak to me again like this I should feel that I was standing in your light if I listened now But at some future time She looked at him softly and his breath went and came fast as her speaking eyes rested on his and he saw the damask red deepen in her cheeks Wait till that future time comes she whispered And you will help me he cried Yes she said at last I will help you all I can He would have caught her in his arms but she raised her hand I thought we were to be friends Friends he whispered I love you It must be then as a friend she said in her low voice but there was that in her look which made Capel s heart throb while when she extended her hand he kissed it without being aware that Lydia had entered the room and drawn back with a weary look of misery in her face that she vainly sought to hide CHAPTER FIFTEEN IN THE DARK Look here Kate I m not going back till I ve had a good try here to see if something can t be made out of this affair Katrine D Enghien sat in the drawing room of the Dark House with her eyes half closed as if listening to the ballad Lydia was singing in a low tone in the corner of the back room while Capel stood by turning over the leaves The old lawyer was in another corner at a card table on whose green surface lay a heap of papers and parchments one of which he took up from time to time and laid down after examining it by the light of the shaded lamp You said only yesterday that you were sick of this domestic cemetery said Katrine So I am for it s doleful enough for anything here only it makes me mad to see such a wealth of art treasures and plate belonging to this fellow Capel Then it is very evident that you did not filch the old man s treasure said Katrine Yes my dear very evident If I had I should not be here Unless you thought it better for the sake of throwing people off the scent said Katrine with a peculiar look in his face I say he cried returning the gaze what do you mean You don t think I killed those two fellows and got the plunder do you I don t know she replied Well then I didn t I never had the chance Or the brains to conceive such a coup Look here cried Artis Don t speak so loud Gerard Oh very well But look here Madam Clever did you manage that bit of business Katrine raised her soft white hands Don t do that said the young man You make me want to kiss them You would not be so foolish now I don t know And look here I don t like you being so thick with Capel Don t you He wants to marry me I ll break his neck first You will act sensibly and well mon cher said Katrine that is if you mean that we are to be married by and by Mean it Of course But not on a fortune of one hundred pounds each mon cher Good Heavens No Then hold your tongue and say nothing But I shall say something if I see you working up a flirtation with that cad You will say nothing do nothing see nothing We cannot marry and starve But tell me Kate honour bright you don t care for this Capel I care for him Tell me then what do you mean to do Have my share of that money said Katrine with a peculiar hardening of her face Bah I don t believe the treasure ever existed It was a craze on the old man s part You must be careful Don t say or do anything to annoy Paul Capel or mister Girtle We must stay here It was no craze on the old man s part maybe I can tell where the fortune is What You mean that Hush I am working for us both But tell me Hush She has finished the song said Katrine leaning back and clapping her hands softly Thank you thank you she said Oh what a while it is since I heard that dear old ballad The evening wore away till bed time when the butler brought in and lit the candles according to his custom Katrine and Lydia taking theirs and going at once and Gerard Artis following after partaking of a glass of soda water leaving the old lawyer and Capel together They sat in silence for some minutes when the old lawyer said I do not seem to get any nearer to the unravelling of this knot mister Capel Do you still adhere to the opinion that the treasure was there Yes and we shall find it soon By a masterly inactivity Oh no replied the old man for I am taking steps of my own to redeem myself I don t think those jewels can be sold or one of those notes changed without word being brought to me Capel felt won by the old man s manner He shook hands with him warmly and said Good night He went to the door with him and saw the light shine on the thin silvery hair as he went slowly up the staircase while his candle cast a grotesque shadow on the wall Then as Capel listened he heard the old man shut his chamber door open it softly and shut it again more loudly while with the great house seeming to be doubly steeped in darkness and silence Paul Capel went back to the lounge in which he had been seated leaving his chamber candle burning like a tiny star in the great sea of gloom and sat back thinking The candle burned lower as he thought on ransacking his memory for some slight clue that would help him to find his lost fortune The candle went out Had he been asleep He could not say He believed that he had been only thinking deeply At all events he was widely awake now as he sat back listening to the heavy beating of his own heart as he stared through the intense darkness towards the door upon whose panel he had felt sure he had heard a soft pat as if something had touched it A minute it might have been half an hour it seemed so long and there was a faint rustling and Paul Capel knew as he stared through that intense darkness that some one or something was coming silently towards where he sat CHAPTER SIXTEEN YOU HERE Paul Capel was not superstitious but a curious thrill ran through his nerves and his first impulse was to leap up and shout Who s there Then a thought flashed through his brain that whoever this was might have something to do with the disappearance of the treasure and he told himself that he would wait though the next moment he found himself frankly owning that a chill of dread had frozen his powers and that he could not have moved to save his life A minute s reflection told him that it could not be a burglar No one would come singly upon such a mission and the marauder would have been provided with a dark lantern or matches It must be some one in the house The superstitious fancies were cleared away as his heart gave a throb with the hope that he might now find the clue to the mystery that was hanging over the place Thought after thought flashed through his brain and as they dazed him with the wild conjectures the person whoever it was glided nearer and nearer and all doubt fled for whoever it was had stretched out a hand and touched the silver candlestick upon the table where he had set it down There was again silence and then it seemed to Capel as he sat there that the nocturnal visitor had made the table a starting point for a fresh departure in the dark and was going from him toward the back drawing room in the left hand corner of which the old lawyer had sat that night Doubtless there are people who can weigh every act before they commit themselves to it but the majority of us even the most thoughtful go on weighing a great many and then in the most important moments of our lives forget all about the balance or the mental weights and scales and so it was that all in an instant Paul Capel unable longer to bear the mental strain rose quickly from his seat took two strides forward and grasped at the intruder exclaiming Who s there He touched nothing he heard nothing and the old chill came back for a moment or two with its superstitious suggestions but he drew out a little silver match box which rattled as he opened it shook a match into his moist hand struck it and the faint little star of light flashed out Katrine you here he exclaimed There were candles on an occasional table and he lit one before the little wax match burned down and then he remained speechless for the moment gazing at Katrine D Enghien who stood within the back drawing room her long hair loosely knotted on her neck her white arms outstretched before her and half away from him She stood motionless as if turned to stone Katrine he cried again He took a step or two towards her his first impulse being to clasp her in his arms but as she stood motionless before him draped in a long grey peignoir that swept the ground there was something about her that repelled him so that he stood staring at her unable to speak Suddenly she turned from him and stood gazing at the corner where the piano stood walked slowly towards it and rested her hand upon it remaining there motionless for a few moments till catching up the candle Capel went towards her his pulses throbbing and his temples seeming to flush as if a hot breath from a furnace had passed over them But before he reached her she turned slowly and walked straight towards him her eyes wide open and gazing intently before her She would have walked right upon him had he not given way and then stood holding the candle while she went deliberately to the fire place rested her hands upon the mantel piece and stood there holding one bare white foot towards the extinct fire as if to warm it Capel set down the candle and advanced towards her when once more she turned and came straight towards him and this time he took her in his arms and kissed her quickly and passionately upon her cheek and lips His arms dropped to his sides though for he felt that she was icily cold and as involuntarily he gave place and she walked slowly past him to the open door out on to the broad landing and as he caught up the candle and followed he saw the tall grey figure go slowly on up and up the stairs and when he followed it to the first landing it was on the one above going slowly on to the bedroom at the end through whose door it passed and the lock gave a low soft click Paul Capel went back into the drawing room feeling half stunned and when he reached the middle of the room he paused candle in hand thinking Asleep he said at last Asleep and I dared to take her in my arms like that Then with an involuntary shiver the young man turned quickly round and went hastily up to his room to lie till morning tossing sleeplessly from side to side CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE TENTH NIGHT It might be thought Capel as he dwelt upon the adventure of that night Katrine had descended to breakfast the next morning and he fancied she blushed slightly as he pressed her hand but she looked so frankly in his face that he could not but think that she was ignorant of what had taken place The days slipped by and in company by a private understanding Capel and the old lawyer searched every article of furniture that could possibly have been made the receptacle of the lost treasure I ll help you of course my dear sir said the old man if you wish it but I really think we shall do no good There had been several talks about breaking up the party but Capel as host had always begged that his companions would stay urging mister Girtle to back him up by proposing that there should be no change until the whole of the business of the will was completed so far as the others were concerned I shall find my share at last Capel said laughingly And besides I have the house One afternoon when Artis had accompanied the ladies for a drive and the search was about to be recommenced mister Girtle sat down by his little table in the drawing room and said I have a little news for you mister Capel What have you found the clue Not yet said the old man quietly but I have found an angel A what An angel You did not know we had one in this house Indeed but I did cried Capel Ah yes said the old man looking at him thoughtfully but I m afraid we are not thinking of the same Indeed but we are said Capel warmly No one who has seen Miss D Enghien Could hesitate to say that she is a very handsome woman said the old lawyer but I was referring to Miss Lawrence A lady for whom I entertain the most profound esteem said Capel Which will be strengthened sir when I tell you that she came to me and made a proposition that The old lawyer s communication was checked by the announcement of a visitor for mister Capel and the doctor mister Heston was ushered in His visit was not productive of much for he had only to announce that he was more and more sure in his own mind that he was right the result being that Capel asked him to wait before taking any further steps and doctor Heston went away rather dissatisfied in his own mind If he does not follow up my proposals he said to himself I shall begin to think that he has some reason of his own for keeping the matter quiet The ladies returned directly the doctor had gone and Artis in pursuance of his instructions made himself so agreeable to Capel that he did not leave him alone with the old lawyer while at dinner and during the evening no opportunity was likely to occur for a private conversation I ll see you directly after breakfast to morrow morning mister Capel the old man said I should prefer a quiet business chat with you for the matter is important I should like to have heard it at once replied Capel but as you will Suspicion was very busy in the Dark House in those days for the butler had found that for several nights past chamber candles had been burned down in the sockets in one of the candlesticks which candlestick was left in the drawing room while a tall candlestick was afterwards taken up to the bedroom Preenham wanted to know why mister Capel or the young master as he termed him should want to sit up so late so he watched and saw that night after night he stayed down in the drawing room for hours But he found out nothing only that the cold struck even through the mat from the stone floor and that he was chilly enough when he went to bed in his pantry to require a liqueur of brandy to keep off rheumatism and similar attacks For Capel had remained up after the others had gone night after night blaming himself for behaving in an unfair unmanly spirit but unable to control the impulse which led him to long for such another adventure as on that special night But after a long day night watches grow wearisome to the most ardent lovers and when after nine nights spent in expectancy there was no result no soft gliding step heard upon stair or floor both Capel and Preenham grew weary and retired to their couches like the rest It was on the tenth night that Capel instead of going to bed at once sat musing over the old lawyer s words Then he began thinking of the doctor s visit and at last taking out his watch he saw it was close upon two The hour made him think of the night when he had encountered Katrine just at that time and moved by some impulse he knew not what he went to his door softly opened it and gazed out on to the gloomy staircase where all was silent as the grave No There was the faint creak of a hinge that had been opened and with his heart seeming to stand still Capel stood in the darkness listening till utterly wearied he was about to close his door when so softly that he could hardly distinguish the sweep of the dress something passed him going straight to the stairs and then he could just hear whoever it was descend CHAPTER EIGHTEEN NOCTURNAL PROCEEDINGS There was not a sound to be heard as Paul Capel stole softly down in his dressing gown and as he expected the drawing room door was closed but not latched Pushing it softly feeling certain that Katrine if it was she had entered there he followed and went on and on till he was about in the middle of the room and listening attentively He began to think that he must have been mistaken when there was a faint rustle and a heavy breath was drawn the sounds coming from the lesser drawing room He listened more intently his heart beating heavily and a strange singing in his ears Another sound as of something being touched The pen tray on the little card table where mister Girtle sat and worked and what was that Undoubtedly one of the keys that lay there Another and another was touched and as they were moved on the thin mahogany that formed the bottom of the receptacle for cards the sound seemed quite loud Then came a faint scraping sound and he knew as well as if he had seen it that a key was taken up Keys Yes there were several there which the old lawyer used Capel recalled that the key of the plate closet had been placed there when Preenham had handed it over He listened but there was no further sound Yes the low breathing could be heard and it suddenly dawned upon Capel that Katrine had been approaching him there she was close at hand He had only to stretch forth his arms and the next instant she would have been folded to his breast It was a hard fight but he had read of a sudden awakening under such conditions proving dangerous As he listened there was a faint rustling as the soft grey peignoir he knew so well passed over the thick carpet towards the door and if the listener had any doubt it was set aside by the light pat that he heard it was a hand touching the panel Capel waited a minute during which he heard the dress sweep against the edge of the door and then the sound was quite hushed He knew what that meant too the door had been drawn to and so he found it as he stepped lightly there opened it and passed out on to the great landing where he strained his eyes upward to try and make out the graceful draped figure as it went up the winding staircase to the bedroom It was not so dark there for a faint gloom it could not be called light fell from the great ground glass sky light at the top of the winding staircase like so much diluted darkness being poured down into a well That great winding staircase suddenly seemed to him full of horror as he stood there It had never struck him before but now how terrible it seemed That balustrade was so low Suppose poor girl in her sleep she should lean over it and fall down onto the white stones where the black fretwork of the glistening stove could be seen like a square patch against the white slabs There was no reason for such fancies but Paul Capel s hands grew wet with a cold perspiration I ought to have stopped her and awakened her at any risk he said as he still gazed up the great staircase and then his heart seemed to stand still for there was a faint click as of a lock shot back and it came either from on a level with where he stood or from down below In an instant he realised what had happened Katrine had been to fetch the key of the late Colonel s chamber and had gone in there He hesitated a moment and then going close he softly touched the door and felt it yield Just then there came a faint scratching noise and there was a gleam of light showing him that the heavy curtain was drawn Then the light shone more clearly and pressing the door a little more open he glided through He was about to peer out softly when the light was set down he heard the soft rustle of the dress an arm was thrust round from the far side of the curtain and the door was carefully closed The work of a spy he said But a slight sound attracted his attention and his curiosity mastered all other feelings Gently sliding his hand into his pocket he drew out a penknife and cut gently downwards making a slit a few inches in length This he drew slightly apart and gazed through to see that Katrine was standing with her back to him in the act of opening one of the large cabinets at the side of the bed CHAPTER NINETEEN BIRDS OF PREY Travellers in Mayfair will have noticed that every here and there old fashioned snug looking hostelries exist in out of the way places at the corner of a mews in a private street where they do not seem to belong and they are generally kept by ex butlers who have taken wives joined their savings and gone into business with the brewers help In the parlour of the Four in Hand Lower Maybush street a party of gentlemen s servants were playing bagatelle upon a bad board in a very smoky atmosphere while a knot of three men sat at one of the old narrow battered mahogany tables in a corner drinking cold gin and water and smoking bad cigars One was a little sharp eyed round headed man smartly dressed and evidently rather proud of a large gilt pin in his figured silk tie Another was tall and not ill looking he might have been a valet for there was a certain imitation gentility about his cut a valet whose master had been rather addicted to the turf and this had been reflected on his man to the extent of trousers rather too tight short hair and a horseshoe pin with pearl nails The third was rather a shabby looking man of forty undoubtedly a gentleman s servant out of place carrying the sign in the front of the reason why in the shape of a nose unduly ripened by being bathed in glasses of alcoholic drink Knew him how long did you say said the tall man tapping his chin with an ivory handled rattan cane Ten years poor chap said the ex servant It was very horrid Here never mind that said the brisk little man We don t want horrors Touch the bell Dick Come old fellow sip up your lotion and we ll have them filled again That cigar don t draw Try one of these Here three fours of gin cold he cried to the landlord and as soon as the glasses were refilled and cigars lighted the conversation went on to the accompaniment of rattling balls and laughter from the bagatelle players Well said the tall man in a low voice you can do as you like my lad but I should have thought that hard up as you are and I should say without much chance of getting another crib say at present you d have been glad to earn a honest quid or two The shabby looking man shook his head Here you re always putting on the pace too much Dick said the little man A fellow wants a little time He s on you see if he isn t My respects to you mister Barnes Hah nice flavoured drop of gin that You see you know the house well continued the tall man Often been of course Oh yes had many a glass of wine there when poor Charles was alive Rather a bit of mystery that said the little man I put that and that together and I set it down that he was trying the job on his own account and muffed it The shabby man shuddered and took a hearty draught of his gin and water There would be only us three in the game said the tall man softly and it would be share and share alike Why if we worked it right it would set you up Might take a pub on it Eh said the shabby man I say you might take a pub and drink yourself to death was added aside The little man winked at his tall companion unobserved by the other who looked dreamy Bars at all the lower windows eh Yes yes You couldn t get in there was the quick reply More ways of killing a cat than by hanging it Look here my lads there s a stable to let in the mews at the back The shabby man looked up quickly I had a look at it to day Any one could easily get to that window looking on the leads But that s the window where Well dead men tell no tales and they don t get in the way That s the place Oh no said the shabby man Bah you re not afraid I tell you it would be as easy as easy You can give me a plan of the place and all about it and why it s child s play my lad and won t hurt anybody Take everything out of that stable and have a cart in the coach house I say touch that bell again old man you are not going to let a fortune slip through your fingers I know The three occupants of the corner soon after rose to go halting half way down the street where the tall man said There s half a sovereign to keep the cold out till then Twelve o clock mind punctual The shabby man slouched away while the little fellow rubbed his hands There s half a ton of it there he whispered Think he ll stand to it No fear now we ve got him over his fright By jingo I m only afraid of one thing What s that That some one else will be on the job CHAPTER TWENTY ASLEEP OR AWAKE It was a painful and Paul Capel thought a degrading position but he blamed his passion telling himself that it was his duty to watch her in this sleep walking state lest ill should befall How thoroughly awake she seemed to be Her every act was that of a person perfectly herself and eager to find something that was hidden Softly and quickly she examined the cabinet opening drawer after drawer and taking out one after the other to see whether there was a concealed cavity behind Next she knelt down before a large carved oak chest and Capel saw how carefully she searched that and examined top and bottom to see whether either was false This done she walked to the bed and stood pondering there Crossing to the built up portal she drew the curtain aside revealing the half dry cement She shook her head and walked to the window where she carefully rearranged the heavy folds there to keep the rays of light from passing out and betraying her task to any one who might be at the upper windows of some house The act displayed the working of a brain that if slumbering still held a peculiar activity of an abnormal kind Once or twice he caught sight of Katrine s eyes that were not as he had seen them on that other night wide open and staring straight before her but bright eager and full of animation She must be awake he thought and the idea was strengthened as he saw her throw herself down upon a chair and with a peculiar action of her hands indicative of disappointment rest her elbows on her knee her chin upon her clenched fists and there she bent down her face intent her brows knit and looking ten years older as the candle cast a curious shadow on her countenance Then the lover intervened on her behalf No she could not be To suppose that she was awake was to credit her with being deceitful with cheating him into the belief that night that she was asleep He was about to spring out throw himself at her feet and waken her with his caresses but a chilling feeling of repulsion stayed him It might work mischief in the terrible fright it would give her at being awakened in that gloomy room And besides what a place to select for his passionate avowals It was secret and silent the very home for such a love as his but there was the terrible past Where she was seated but a short time back there lay the ghastly body of the murdered man Behind her was the bed where so recently a strange occupant was stretched and beneath it lay that other lately discovered horror Beyond that built up wall was the Colonel s tomb Love was impossible in such a place as that and did he want confirmation of the fact that Katrine was a somnambulist he felt that he had it here before him For no girl of her years would dare to come down in the dead of the night and enter that room haunted as it was with such terrible memories He stood watching her as she crouched there looking straight before her and as she suddenly sprang up and went to a picture painted upon a panel in the wall he found himself growing excited by the fancy that perhaps in the clairvoyant state of sleep she might be able to discover the mystery that had baffled them all He stood there wrapt in his thoughts till he saw her turn from the frame that she had tried to move in a dozen different ways her fingers playing here and there with marvellous quickness about the corners and prominent bits of carving as if she expected that any one might prove to be a secret spring Again she tried another picture darted to the group of statuary in the corner and tried to lift it back as if expecting that which she sought might be hidden beneath it and again there was the movement full of dejection and despair as she stood facing him with the light full upon her eyes She turned away despondently and then started upright with her eyes flashing and one hand raised in the involuntary movement of one who listens intently to some sound Had she heard something or was it fancy a part of her dream Paul Capel thought the latter for light as a fawn he saw Katrine dart across the room to where the candle stood The next moment they were in total darkness CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHAT THE SOUND WAS A faint rustle was plainly heard as Capel drew aside the curtain Then the sound ceased but he felt that as he had taken a step to the left Katrine must be exactly opposite to him In another moment she would come forward and touch him for he could not move from his position If he stood aside she would pass him and fasten him in the room He listened in the intense darkness and could just detect the short hurried breathing of one who was excited by dread But as he listened in the darkness clear now of the heavy curtain he heard another sound a peculiar scraping sound that seemed to come from outside the window It was that which had alarmed Katrine and made her extinguish the light The noise ceased Then it was repeated and directly after sounding muffled by the heavy curtain the window rattled a little in its frame as if shaken or pressed upon by some one outside The panting grew louder there was a warm breath upon Capel s cheek and the next moment he held Katrine in his arms She uttered a low cry of fear and struggled to escape Hush he whispered You have nothing to fear Are you awake There was no answer only a vigorous thrust from the hands placed upon his chest and he felt that she was trying to open the door trembling violently the while Katrine he whispered why do you not trust me Wake up There is nothing to fear He tried to clasp her in his arms again but with a quick movement she eluded him and as he caught at her again it seemed as if the great curtain had been thrust into his arms for he grasped that and as he flung it away the door struck him in the face and then closed he heard it locked and the key withdrawn Then he stood listening for the window rattled again and he wondered that the noise he had made in his slight struggle with Katrine had not been heard by whoever was on the sill There was a bell somewhere in the room but if he rang and roused up the butler the man would be horrified at hearing his old master s bedroom bell ringing in the dead of the night Even if that had not been the case what excuse could he make And could he explain his position to mister Girtle without making him the confidant of all that had passed And how could he relate to any one that Katrine had been wandering about the house in the middle of the night What would mister Girtle say Would he think it was somnambulism No he could not ring It was impossible and all the while there was that strange noise outside muffled by the curtain He walked cautiously through the intense darkness towards the window till he could touch the curtain and then passing to the left he softly drew it a little inward and looked out It was almost as dark out there as in but there was a faint glow from the lamps beyond the tall houses that closed in the back and against this he could dimly see the figure of a man standing on the sill while more indistinctly and quite low down there were the heads and shoulders of two more It seemed to him that the man standing on the sill was trying to pass some instrument through between the two sashes so as to force back the window catch What should he do Give the alarm down stairs he could not without compromising Katrine Alarm the nocturnal visitors That would be to give up a chance of getting hold of the clue What should he do Be a coward or now that the opportunity had come make a bold effort to capture these intruders Three to one Yes but he was in the fort and they had to attack and could he secure one bribery or punishment would make him tell all There was the sound going on at the window which was resisting the efforts and with palpitating heart and heavy breathing Capel asked himself the questions again Should he be cowardly or brave and make a daring effort to gain that which was his from the information these people could give There was a grating and clicking still going on as he stepped cautiously across the room the sound guiding him to the stand where his uncle s old East India uniform and accoutrements were grouped and the next minute his hands rested upon a pistol Useless for it was old fashioned and uncharged That was better His hand touched the ivory hilt of the curved sabre For a time the blade refused to leave its sheath then it gave way a little and he drew it forth laid the scabbard on the floor passed his hand through the wrist knot and thought that he would have to strike hard for a cavalry sabre is generally round edged and blunt As he thought of this he touched the edge of the sword with his thumb to find that this was no regulation blade but a keen edged tulwar set in an English hilt and armed with this Paul Capel felt himself fully a match for those who were working away at the window which did not yield Creak Crack Crack The catch flew back and there was a pause during which Capel drew near with the blade thrown over his left shoulder ready for delivering the first cut at the man who entered Then the window glided up the great curtain was drawn by an arm in his direction partly covering him and a light flashed across the room 
681-161962-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER TWENTY TWO A BLANK ADVENTURE The light played on the blade of the keen edged sword as if it were phosphorescent but the lambent quivering was not seen by the holder of the lantern
681-161962-0001	train-other-500	who hid Capel with his own hand as the light was flashed upon the bed and into the corners of the room and then turned off All right boys was whispered
681-161962-0002	train-other-500	and a man swung himself into the room Be quick and shut the window A second man crept softly in and the third was half in when he slipped threw out his hand to save himself
none	none	 struck against one of his companions and drove him back against the curtain and upon Capel Light Barkers Some one here Capel heard the words saw the flash and struck at the hand that held it 
681-161962-0003	train-other-500	The blade fell heavily upon the lantern and dashed it to the floor
none	none	 where it went out 
681-161962-0004	train-other-500	Raising the sword he struck again but as he did so one of the men sprang at him and the blow that fell was upon the fellow s shoulder and with the hilt of the sword
none	none	 Capel was borne back by the man s fierce spring 
681-161962-0005	train-other-500	his feet became entangled in the curtain and he fell heavily with his adversary upon him Quick Morris whispered a voice No no Curse you Shut the window There s only one
681-161962-0006	train-other-500	Where s your matches Quick light the glim Ah would you Lie still and bite that You just move again and I ll pull the trigger The barrel of a revolver had been thrust between Capel s teeth
681-161962-0007	train-other-500	and as he lay back with the man on his chest half stunned helpless and despairing he saw indistinctly the figure against the window heard the sash slide down and the darkness was complete
none	none	 as the curtain was drawn over the panes 
681-161962-0008	train-other-500	Then there was the faint streak of light as a match was struck the bull s eye lantern was picked up and re lit and the bright rays once more played all about the room
681-161962-0009	train-other-500	The man who held it then went to the door and listened It s all right he whispered You said nobody can t hear what goes on in this room These curtains would suffocate a trumpet Here you he cried to the third man
none	none	 don t stand shivering like that Take that carving knife out of his hand Pull the trigger Dick if he stirs This to the man kneeling on Capel s chest Capel lay absolutely powerless at that moment 
681-161962-0010	train-other-500	but as the third fellow caught him by the wrist the young man wrenched his head on one side and heaved himself up so that he partially dislodged the ruffian who held him down
none	none	 At the same time he swung the sabre round 
681-161962-0011	train-other-500	driving the third back
none	none	 and striking the principal adversary so sharp a blow that he slipped aside and Capel 
681-161962-0012	train-other-500	leaped to his feet At that moment the light was turned off and there was a rush made to get beyond his reach
none	none	 Capel also took advantage of the total darkness to step back 
681-161962-0013	train-other-500	but he held the weapon ready for a cut should an attack be made As he stood there panting a low whisper rose from the direction of the door and he just caught its import Give me the light
681-161962-0014	train-other-500	There was a click directly after and then from about the middle of the room the dazzling light of the bull s eye shone out
none	none	 full upon Capel as he stood with upraised sword while his assailants were in the dark Now then said the voice which he recognised as that of the man who had held the pistol to his mouth throw down that tool Give up you scoundrel cried Capel 
681-161962-0015	train-other-500	You can t escape Can t we said the man between his teeth More can t you Now then will you throw down that sword No said Capel furiously You ve walked into a trap so give up
681-161962-0016	train-other-500	Go on said the voice of the lesser man At that moment there was a bright flash of light a sharp report
none	none	 and Capel felt a sensation as if he had been struck a violent blow on the left shoulder which half spun him round while the round 
681-161962-0017	train-other-500	glistening disc of light seemed to have darted back to the side of the bed Half stunned but full of fight
none	none	 Capel turned and made for the light once more 
681-161962-0018	train-other-500	when there was another flash a quick shot and this time the blow seemed to have fallen on the top of his head and stunned and helpless the sword dropped from his hand and he fell on a chair
none	none	 and from that on to the floor You ve killed him You ve killed him Good job too Think I wanted my skin turned into pork crackling with that sword Hold yer row will yer or We shall be taken and hung Oh my arm Look here my dear pal 
681-161962-0019	train-other-500	said the little man if you want to preach just wait till this job s done Throw the light on the door Dick
none	none	 I dunno which is doors and which is windows with all these curtains Oh 
681-161962-0020	train-other-500	that s it is it Quiet will you He stood listening attentively It s all right There isn t a sound Let s go then at once What empty
none	none	 Not me eh Dick Taint likely Wait till I ve got two more cartridges in That s it Now then business But this poor fellow He s not killed only quieted Now then what is there here 
681-161962-0021	train-other-500	They made a hurried search of the room but with the exception of the silver tops of the bottles of the Colonel s dressing case there was nothing to excite their cupidity Then Capel s pockets were searched
681-161962-0022	train-other-500	but watch and purse were in his chamber while though the Colonel s room was full of costly objects they were not of the portable nature that would have made them valuable to the men
681-161962-0023	train-other-500	Now then said the tall man quickly it s of no use we must go down
none	none	 Where are the keys 
681-161962-0024	train-other-500	The little man took a bunch from the bag But
none	none	 suppose the old man s awake 
681-161962-0025	train-other-500	whispered the shivering ex servant faint from his wound
none	none	 Well if he is we must persuade him to go to sleep 
681-161962-0026	train-other-500	somehow till we ve done Here
none	none	 you come and hold the light while I hand him the keys 
681-161962-0027	train-other-500	The trembling man took the lantern while his leader went down on one knee
none	none	 and as his little companion handed him false keys and picklocks he busied himself trying to open the door 
681-161962-0028	train-other-500	Keep that light still will you he cried menacingly Why
none	none	 you re making it dance all over the door I want it on the key hole don t I 
681-161962-0029	train-other-500	Then the light shone full on the lock for a minute or two not more for he who held it kept turning his head
none	none	 to see if Capel was moving 
681-161962-0030	train-other-500	This brought forth a torrent of whispered oaths from both men Here let me have a try whispered the little man I can open it if you ll hold this blessed glim still I never see such a cur Then
681-161962-0031	train-other-500	in the coolest manner possible he took the other s place
none	none	 and tried key after key picklock 
681-161962-0032	train-other-500	after picklock and ended by throwing all into the bag with a growl of disgust It s one of them stoopid patents he cried Here give us a james A strong steel crowbar in two pieces was screwed together
681-161962-0033	train-other-500	and its sharp edge inserted between the door and the post but the great solid mahogany door stood firm only emitting now and then a loud crack sharp as that given by a cart whip
681-161962-0034	train-other-500	as the men strained at it in turn Here let s try a saw Centre bit A centre bit was fitted into a stock and a hole cut right through Into this after much greasing
none	none	 a key hole saw was thrust 
681-161962-0035	train-other-500	and not without emitting a loud noise the work of cutting began the sawdust falling lightly on the lion s skin but at the end of a few seconds a dull harsh sound
681-161962-0036	train-other-500	told that the saw was meeting metal and a fresh start had to be made For fully two hours did the men work to get through boring and sawing in place after place
681-161962-0037	train-other-500	but always to find that the door was strengthened in all directions with metal plates and at last the task was given up Look here growled the leader of the party that bed isn t used
none	none	 I want to know how that chap got in He hasn t any key 
681-161962-0038	train-other-500	Can t you get the door open then said the third man after the other had shaken his head Why don t you see we can t But we shall get nothing for our trouble
681-161962-0039	train-other-500	Nothing at all said the tall man quietly But There that ll do First of all you were so precious anxious to go Now you know we can t get down you re all for the job I say
681-161962-0040	train-other-500	is this the room where the murder was Yes don t talk about it Why not We haven t done another He ll come round What next Dick Cut was the laconic reply
none	none	 When there s all that plate asking of us to make up a small parcel and carry it away Don t patter Got all the tools Yes Then come along The light was played upon Capel s insensible face for a few moments and then to the intense relief of the ex servant the lantern was placed in the bag with the burglars tools and the window being thrown open one by one stole out the last closing the window behind him leaving Capel lying helpless and insensible in the locked up room CHAPTER TWENTY THREE WAITING FOR BREAKFAST Such a bright cheery morning Lydia said Katrine knocking at the bedroom door Oh you are up Breakfast must be ready The two girls descended to find that they were first Nobody down cried Katrine and I am so hungry Oh how wicked it seems on a morning like this to keep out all the light and sunshine Just then old mister Girtle came in looking as usual very quiet and thoughtful and after a while Artis came down looking dull and sleepy Where s the boss he said suddenly The what I do not understand you said the old lawyer The master the guardian of this tomb Where s Capel Oh said the old lawyer Possibly the fine morning may have tempted him to take a walk Are we going to wait for Capel said Artis I m so hungry I feel quite ashamed said Katrine but I think we ought to wait There is nothing to be ashamed of in a healthy young appetite my dear young lady said the old lawyer I have been reading in my room since six and I should like to begin I don t suppose he will be long mister Capel out Preenham I think not sir said the butler who was bringing in a covered dish Perhaps you had better tell him that we are all assembled He may have overslept himself At the end of five minutes the old butler was back to say that mister Capel had not answered when he knocked He may be ill said Lydia anxiously and then catching Katrine s eye she coloured warmly Preenham gave Artis a meaning look and that gentleman followed him out What is it mister Capel hasn t been to bed all night sir Not been to bed all night Preenham said the old lawyer who had followed Did you let him out last night No sir Then how can he have gone out I saw that the door was fastened after you had gone to bed and it was still fastened when I came down at six And at seven too sir said the butler He must be in the house said Artis Go and look round Is mister Capel ill said Katrine No no my dear I think not said the old lawyer I ll go too and see It is very strange said Katrine turning to Lydia who looked ashy pale I hope nothing is the matter dear She seemed so calm that Lydia took courage and returned to the breakfast table while followed by the old lawyer and Preenham Artis examined the dining room and study then ascended to the first floor tried the Colonel s door found it fast and went on into the drawing room I tried that door he said grimly because that is the chamber of horrors It is locked and the key is in my table said the old lawyer and then they searched the other rooms finding Capel s watch purse and pocketbook and looked at each other blankly He must be out said Artis No sir here s his hat and stick Artis stopped thinking and then bounded up the stairs again to the Colonel s door I thought so he said There s something wrong here Look He pointed to several holes through the mahogany door the mark of a saw scoring the panels and the reddish dust on the lion skin mat Is any one here he cried knocking I say Is any one here Pah Look at that He uttered a cry almost like a woman as he pointed to a place where the lion skin rug did not reach and there dimly seen by the gloomy light thrown by the stained glass window was a little thread of blood that had run beneath the door CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR DOCTOR AND NURSE The old lawyer ran from the door with an alacrity not to be expected in one of his years and returned directly with the key that he had found in his table Give it to me said Artis huskily and snatching the key he tried to insert it but his hand trembled so that he did not succeed and the next moment he shrank away Here open that door Preenham he said I daren t sir I daren t indeed Ah poor young man Give me the key said the old lawyer firmly and taking it he tried the door to find that the lock had been tampered with so that it was some minutes before he could get it to move Hadn t I better fetch the police sir faltered the butler No stop said the old lawyer turning the handle There is some one against the door He pushed hard and with some effort got it open so that he could have squeezed in It is all dark he said No it is the curtain and forcing his way through he drew back the hangings from the window It s poor Capel dead whispered Artis who had followed Here Preenham come in he cried angrily Oh how horrible poor lad The lawyer saw the naked sword lying on the carpet that the drawers and cabinet had been ransacked and that the window was not quite shut down He took this in at a glance as he ran to where Capel lay close to the door where he had dragged himself sometime during the early hours of the morn to lie exhausted after vainly trying to raise the alarm He s dead sir dead groaned the butler Hush cried the old lawyer harshly He s not dead mister Artis you are young and active Quick That doctor mister Heston You know where he lives You Preenham brandy Stop Tell the ladies mister Capel is ill Nothing more Don t spread the alarm Is anything very serious the matter said a voice at the door Yes no my dear Go away now cried the old lawyer mister Capel is ill There is something terribly wrong again said a deeper voice and white as ashes and closely followed by Katrine Lydia came in She uttered a faint cry and then wrested herself from Artis who tried to stop her No she cried imperiously changed as it were in an instant from a shivering girl into a thoughtful woman Quick go for help mister Girtle what can I do Yes let me help too said Katrine What is it has he tried to kill himself No cried Lydia turning upon her fiercely He was too true a man I m afraid there has been an attempt made by burglars said the old lawyer and that our young friend has been trying to defend the place but but he was locked in here the key was in my table and and I m afraid I m growing very old things seem so much confused now He put his hand to his head for a few moments and looked helplessly from one to the other Then his customary sang froid seemed to have returned This is not a sight for you ladies he said Pray go back I am not afraid mister Girtle said Katrine with a slight shudder as she looked eagerly about the room For her answer Lydia took water from the wash stand and began to bathe the blood smeared face kneeling down by Capel s side Just then Preenham entered with decanter and glass the former clattering against the latter as he poured out some of the contents Holding a little of the brandy to Capel s clenched teeth mister Girtle managed to trickle through a few drops at a time while Lydia continued the bathing and Katrine stood like some beautiful statue gazing down at them with wrinkled brow and clasped hands By this time the knowledge that something was wrong had reached the women servants and they had both come to the door No no keep them away Preenham said mister Girtle in answer to offers of assistance You go down too and be at the door ready to let the doctor in Yes sir I will said the old butler piteously but my young master will he live Please God said the lawyer simply But he is not dead sir There is your answer man said mister Girtle for just then Capel uttered a low moan The old butler bent down on one knee and Lydia darted at him a grateful look as she saw him lift and press one cold hand and then laying it down he rose and went out of the room on tiptoe raising his hands and his face towards Heaven Was he stabbed with that sword said Lydia in a hoarse whisper No I think not The doctor must soon be here was the reply In fact five minutes later there was a quick knock at the door and doctor Heston hurried in followed by Artis Give me the room he said quickly Ladies please go Katrine turned slowly and glanced at Lydia I may stay Doctor Heston she said I may be of use No words now he said sharply By and by you will be invaluable Well there stay He had thrown off his coat and rolled up his sleeves as he spoke and as Lydia bent her head and stood waiting Katrine left the room Then the deft handed medico was busy with his examination Head literally scored with a bullet he said Not a cut whispered mister Girtle pointing to the sword Bless me no Scored by a bullet An inch lower hallo What have we here He took out a knife and cut through the clothes where he could not draw them away from where the blood had oozed out just below the left shoulder Hah Yes Bullet Entered here passed out No Here it is Just below the skin He had raised the sufferer and found that the bullet had passed nearly through and was visible so near the surface that a slight cut would have given it exit Nothing vital touched I think said the doctor busying himself about the wound in the shoulder Ah That s right madam Nothing like a woman s hand after all about a sick man Why this must have happened hours ago The doctor chatted away quickly but his hands kept time with his voice He had laid down a small case of instruments with a roll of linen and turning from the arm once more he rapidly clipped away the hair and dressed the wound in the head a wound so horrible that Artis shuddered turned to the brandy decanter that the old butler stood holding with a helpless dazed look and poured out a good dram while Lydia knelt there very pale but calmly holding scissors lint or strapping to hand as they were required Now for the bullet said the doctor in a cheerful airy way mister Artis just lend a hand here Or no you look upset Put down that decanter butler This isn t a dinner party That s right Now kneel down here He softly raised Capel and placed him in a convenient position before turning to Lydia Really I think you would prefer to go now The girl s lips seemed to tighten and she shook her head As you please said the doctor testily I have no time to waste A little back mister Girtle I want all the light I can have Yes that s plain enough he muttered as with one hand resting on the injured man s shoulder where the bullet made quite a little lump he stretched out the other and from where it nestled in the case fitted amongst so much purple velvet he took out a small knife There was a pleasant look of satisfaction in the doctor s face as he took out the knife but the next moment he turned with an angry flash upon Lydia It was the natural instinctive act of one who loves seeking to protect the object loved For as doctor Heston took the knife in his hand Lydia s eyes dilated and she leaned forward caught the doctor s arm and gazed at the keen little blade with dilated eyes My dear young lady are you mad cried the doctor testily She raised her eyes to his in a look so full of appeal that he could read it as easily as if she had given it with the interpretation of words He was not accustomed to argue in a case like this but the girl s loving attempt to protect the insensible man touched him to the heart and dropping his sharp imperious manner he said gently But don t you see It is to do him good Lydia s hand trembled but she still grasped the doctor s arm Come come he said smiling You must not be alarmed Do you want the bullet to stay in and irritate the whole length of the wound She gave her head a sharp shake Well then be sensible my dear girl There get me a bit of lint he continued and you shall see how easily and well I will do this That s better Why taking a tooth out is ten times worse This is a mere trifle There that s a brave little woman He will not even feel it Lydia s hand had dropped from the doctor s arm and she drew a long breath watching him as if her eyes were drawn to his knife while he bent over Capel In a few minutes more the patient was lifted upon the bed and Lydia stood there with her hands clasped in dread for it seemed ominous to her that Capel should be compelled to lie there Can he not be taken up to his room No my brave little nurse no It would have been extremely nice for him but what he requires now is absolute rest and quiet Come come You are too strong minded a little woman to be superstitious Go where you will in old houses there has generally been a death in some of the bedrooms but believe me that does not affect the living Why if that were the case what should we do at the hospitals You are going to install yourself here then as nurse That s right Let my instructions be carried out and I ll come in again at noon Whispered conversation went on all through the house that day but though there had been the attempt at burglary mister Girtle hesitated about calling in the police again and on consulting the doctor he quite agreed that it would be better not to have them there It will only disturb my patient he said and depend upon it with a light and people sitting up the scoundrels will not come again Well said mister Girtle we will not communicate with the police at present The doctor came in at one and again at five and on leaving looked rather serious If he is not different to this at about nine when I come in again I ll get Sir Ronald Mackenzie to see him I ll warn him at once that he may be wanted Then you think his case serious Brain injuries always are At nine o clock when the doctor came his manner startled Lydia who had patiently watched the sufferer all day Yes he said I will have Sir Ronald s opinion I shall be back in half an hour He left the room and hurried down stairs while Lydia bent down and laid her cheek against the patient s burning hand He was delirious now and talking loudly and rapidly Yes it is there he kept on saying Count four stones from the left press on the fifth and it will swing around I have it safely do you hear safely This went on over and over again and as Lydia listened something she knew not what made her turn her head when it seemed to her that one of the bed curtains trembled and that in the gloom a hand was softly drawing one back that the sick man s words might be more plainly heard CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE HIGH WORDS Looking again in the direction of the hand but telling herself that it was fancy Lydia sat down to wait anxiously for the doctor s return while Capel went on talking more or less incoherently You know I love you he said softly Katrine darling you will be my wife Let the world go its own way what is it to us Lydia s head sank lower as the tears of misery began to fall fast The treasure he cried suddenly Ha ha ha Let them search for it months years They will never find it I have it safely Here I ll tell you He beckoned with his finger as he talked on rapidly and as Lydia raised her saddened countenance she saw that he was gazing at vacancy and gesticulating with his free hand Yes I ll tell you he said Let the fools hunt They ll never find it Well Why not It is mine Look You count along here do you see one eight six now press in the key There is a spring Press it home and turn The door opens and there it is For you dearest the jewels are all your own As he went on talking rapidly the curtain moved softly again and this time Lydia felt that it was no trick of the light or wind and rising from her seat she went softly round to the other side of the bed took hold of the curtain and swept it aside to leave Katrine standing there in the faint light shed by the shaded lamp What are you doing here I came to see if I could help you And glided in like a thief to hide there listening to his words What is it you want to know Was it to hear him say he loved you whispered Lydia with her face full of scorn I do not understand you You do understand And it was not for that You have heard him whisper to you no waste upon you loving words enough Really said Katrine who had recovered from her temporary confusion consequent upon the abrupt discovery of her presence Surely my darling little Lydia is not jealous Jealous Of you said Lydia scornfully No I am only sorry that he should have been so blind To your incomparable charms No to the character of the beautiful woman Beautiful Yes beautiful woman whose character How dare you cried Katrine and she struck the brave girl a sharp blow across the face with her open hand Beautiful as you are corrupt and cruel said Lydia without wincing I have not been blind I have seen your efforts to lead him on to tempt him into the belief that you loved him when your sole thought has been of the money that was to be his It is false cried Katrine It is true I would not stoop to watch you but I have seen enough to know you Go back to your companion the man who plots and plans with you to gain what you will never find and do not Do not what cried Katrine with a malignant look Lydia did not reply but hurried back to where Capel was trying to raise himself up trembling the while as he gazed towards the window Look he said harshly There Don t stop Katrine love There is danger Don t stop now Katrine s face wore a strange waxen hue as she caught the sick man s hand The painful position was brought to an end by the coming of the doctors Katrine s quick ear was the first to give her warning of their approach and without another word she softly left the room stealing away so quietly that when doctor Heston entered ushering in the great physician Lydia hardly realised that she was alone Still the same said doctor Heston Humph yes My dear madam will you permit me Lydia looked piteously in his face losing her self command the while as Heston led her from the room and closed the door while as she heard it locked on the inside and the sound of the rings passing over the rod she sank down sobbing on the lion skin rug burying her face in her hands and ignorant of the fact that she was being watched CHAPTER TWENTY SIX CAPEL S NURSES This is your doing doctor Heston said mister Girtle returning to the dining room indignantly with a card in his hand He had been seated at lunch with the doctor Katrine and Artis when Preenham had entered the room to say that a gentleman wished to see him on important business I dare say it is said the doctor but what have I done We the family had decided to refrain from communication with the police so as not to draw attention to the peculiar circumstances that have taken place in this house and I agreed somewhat unwillingly knowing mister Capel s feelings as to what has gone before Well said the doctor coolly for the old man seemed to have lost his self control No sir it is not well Someone has communicated with the police He held out the card in his hand and Katrine winced while Artis gave her an uneasy look No work of mine my dear sir my hands are too full of my patient Surely he does not say No no said mister Girtle hurriedly I have not seen him yet I was so angry that I returned at once I really beg your pardon but all this trouble has rather taken me off my balance He nodded and left the room and Katrine glanced at the doctor Over work and anxiety my dear madam he said I shall have to give him a little advice Now if you will excuse me I ll go up stairs But doctor cried Katrine is mister Capel really better It is hardly just to call him better while this delirium continues but you know what Sir Ronald said He went out of the dining room and ascended the stairs leaving Katrine with Artis Where are you going said the latter Up to Capel s room What again Yes she said again But what have you found out Wait and see Wait and see I m sick of it all he cried angrily I feel as if I were buried alive and to make matters worse you re always away Look here I don t like your going and nursing that fellow You stupid boy she said softly and she turned upon him a look that made him catch her in his arms and press his lips to hers For a few moments she made no resistance but seemed to be returning his caress Then with an angry wrench she extricated herself from his grasp How dare you she cried How dare Oh come that s good You are acting like a fool She sailed out of the room just as Preenham opened the door and as he drew back for her to pass Artis threw himself into a chair while Katrine slowly ascended the stairs listening intently to the low murmur of voices in the library A few minutes before the quiet grave looking professional nurse had ascended to the sick room from the housekeeper s room where she had just partaken of her dinner and found as she entered silently Lydia on her knees by the bedside with a straight bar of light from the window throwing her into bold relief against the dark curtains The nurse advanced softly and glanced at Capel who seemed to be sleeping easily and then lightly touched Lydia on the shoulder Asleep miss she said Lydia raised her white face haggard and livid with sleeplessness and anxiety No she said softly as she let herself sink into the low chair at the bed s head No not asleep But you are quite done up miss said the nurse Now pray do go and lie down for a few hours He is better I m sure of it I do know indeed I ve seen so much of this sort of thing I was in the French hospitals all through the war But are you sure I m quite certain miss Now you can t go on like this You must have rest Take my advice and go and have a good sleep and then you can come and watch again But if If anything happens miss I ll call you You promise me Faithfully miss There trust to me Lydia had risen and she tottered as she took a step or two when the nurse caught her in her arms and the poor girl s strength gave way entirely now The nurse s confident words that Capel was getting better robbed her of the last bond of self control and as the woman tenderly supported her and whispered a few soothing words Lydia s head went down on the nurse s breast and she burst into a low passionate fit of hysterical tears There you ll be better now whispered the nurse as Lydia raised her piteous white face Now go and have a few hours sleep Lydia nodded recovered her self command and went to the bed bent over and gazed earnestly in the patient s face and then left the room Poor dear said the nurse after a glance at the patient how she does love him Ah miss how you made me jump Did I nurse said Katrine I was obliged to come in gently How is he Better miss I think That s well You look very tired nurse Me miss Oh dear no But your strength ought to be saved for nights I can t watch at night I get too sleepy but I can now and I ll take your place Do you really wish it miss Yes Please said Katrine firmly and the woman quietly left the room to take no walk but to go up to the chamber set apart for her use and from long habit in catching rest when it could be found she threw herself upon her bed and was soon breathing heavily fast asleep In the adjoining room lay Lydia with her eyes closed hour after hour but painfully awake No sleep would come to her weary brain which seemed to grow more terribly active as the time rolled on She told herself that her love for Capel was madness Then hope tortured her with the idea that he might turn to her while her indignant maiden nature bade her forget him and show more pride But he is poor Hope seemed to say his fortune is gone and you are comparatively wealthy Wait and he will love you yet There was a hopeful smile dawning upon her lips as she softly left her room and went down the stairs with a feeling of restful content in her breast and then her heart seemed to stand still and a horrible feeling of self reproach attacked her as she felt that she had left her post just as some terrible crisis had been about to happen For there at the door where she had crouched in agony waiting to know the great physician s verdict now stood Gerard Artis gazing in as he held it partly open Lydia was as if turned to stone for the moment Then the reaction came and she quickly ran to the door to lay her hand upon Artis s shoulder He turned upon her a face distorted with jealous rage and then his countenance changed and indulging in a malicious laugh he drew on one side holding the curtain back and pointed mockingly to the scene within CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN AN ENCOUNTER One swift glance and then without noticing Artis Lydia glided into the room She had seen her hope crushed and that she must never dream again of that happy future She had not slept but she had left her post and while she had been absent another had stolen that last hope For after lying sleeping calmly and peacefully for an hour Capel heaved a long sigh and at last he opened his eyes in a quiet dreamy way gazing at but apparently not seeing Katrine as she knelt there in the light cast by the window Then she saw a look of intelligence come into his face and he spoke in a quiet and eager though feeble tone What is it Why why am I here Don t don t speak Yes I know Oh Katrine my love my love He raised his feeble arms till they clasped the beautiful neck as she bent down over him and her head rested upon his pillow side by side with his her soft dark hair half hid his pale cheek and he was whispering feebly his words of gratitude as Lydia slowly advanced into the room and unnoticed by either she laid her soft white hand upon Katrine s shoulder gripping it with a nervous force of which she herself was ignorant Katrine started up flushed her eyes sparkling with light and a look of triumph coming into her face as she saw who was there mister Capel s condition will not permit of this excitement said Lydia in a cold harsh voice Doctor Heston s orders were that he should be kept quiet That afternoon when mister Girtle entered the library he found a plainly dressed man awaiting him a man who save that he gave the idea of having once been a soldier might have passed for anything from a publican to an idler whose wife let lodgings and made it unnecessary for him to toil or spin Morning sir You had my card I see I ve called about the attempt made here the other night Attempt Yes sir the burglary How did you know there was an attempt Oh we get to know a little sir We re a body of incompetent men that every one abuses but we find out a few things a year You heard of this then Yes sir and we were a bit surprised that you didn t communicate with us Seems strange sir Strange yes my man but have we not had horrors enough Yes sir but Well said mister Girtle impatiently you have heard of it then What do you wish to do See the place sir Who is it that nearly killed that poor fellow How did you know that some one did mister Girtle s visitor laughed a quiet little laugh Oh we know sir He s horribly bad No decidedly better No sir I was at the hospital this morning and they don t think he ll live the day He has let it all out Look here my man we are confusing matters said mister Girtle Why you ve got a wounded man here Yes There my good fellow I suppose you must know all now I suppose we must sir said the officer with a grim smile Strange that you should so soon have another trouble here But you have not told me your informant Oh there s no secret about it sir Servant chap went to the bad and lost his character Old friend of your footman here who was killed He picks up with a couple of regular cracksmen and tells all he knows about the house and they put up the job Yes yes I see Well They get in and catch a Tartar for this chap was cut down by some one here and his mates got him away to a wretched hole where the people were so frightened that they gave information to the police that a man was dying on their premises Police took him to the hospital and when he found out how bad he was he made a clean breast of it all That s it sir Plain as A B C mister Girtle sat looking at the officer curiously Do you think he said at last that these men committed the other robbery The detective s eyes twinkled but not a muscle moved I should think it about certain sir Have you got the man s companions Yes sir both of them safe enough Then as this man confessed one thing I dare say he will the other He is dying you say Yes sir no doubt about it not so much from the sword cut as from bad health drink and the like Then he must be seen to day at once man We may get to know from him where they have disposed of the treasure Such a large sum Yes sir the officer quietly taking out a note book Now don t you think sir you being a solicitor it would have been better to let us do our work and you do yours What do you mean sir Only this sir that here s another thing You ve had a tremendous robbery here before and we ve known nothing about it till this minute when you let it all out mister Girtle gave his knee an impatient blow Yes sir you let it out When did it happen At the time of that terrible affair in the house You remember Yes sir I took a good deal of notice of it at the time sir but I had nothing to do with the case So a lot of money was taken then mister Girtle nodded I am not at liberty to say more mister Capel would not have the search made If you ll excuse me sir I ll give you another look in Perhaps to morrow you ll let me go over the place He went away hurriedly and straight off to the hospital where he had a long interview with the sick man obtaining all the information from him that he could before compelled by the poor wretch s weakness to cease the inquisition A tremendous big sum eh said the officer to himself I should like to have the finding of that They might be a bit generous to a man CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT mister PREENHAM S VISITOR There was a kind of civil war carried on at the old house over the nursing back of Paul Capel to health He suffered much but a strong constitution and youth were fine odds in his favour and he recovered after passing the crisis rapidly and well And during these days Lydia suffered a martyrdom seeing as she did how Katrine took advantage of Capel s weakness to tighten his bonds The detective came as he had promised and saw the room and the window making notes and a drawing thereof and then going to the mews at the back where he satisfied himself as to the means by which access had been obtained The evidence of Paul Capel was taken by a magistrate at his bedside as he was certified as unfit to be moved and in due time the law meted out its punishment upon the two criminals left but the detective was not at peace The officer who boasted of the name of Linnett was a very sleuth hound in his ways and he came upon mister Girtle at all manner of unexpected times while he was waiting for Paul Capel s return to health and tried to get information from him without avail Must have been a bit of imagination on the old man s part said mister Linnett Some of these old fellows half cracked as a rule believe that they are extremely rich I don t know though Old boy was very rich Wonderful What a house That young chap might very well be satisfied with what he has got In this spirit the detective turned his attention to the doctor approaching him with a bad feeling of weakness and not being satisfied with the dictum of the divisional surgeon He laughs at it you see sir said Linnett in the doctor s consulting room but I m bad Yes yes I see what is the matter with you my man said Heston I ll soon set you all right Lor what humbugs doctors are said the detective looking at his prescription as he went away I suppose I must take this stuff though before I go and see him again Curious thing nature said Heston as soon as the detective had gone that man thinks he s ill and there s nothing whatever the matter with him Fancy brought on from hard thought and work The doctor was wiser than the detective thought but in future visits the latter obtained a good deal of information among which was the doctor s theory that Ramo the old Indian servant had not died entirely from the struggle with Charles Pillar It was just about that time that Gerard Artis swore an oath That old mister Girtle took Lydia s hand gently between his and said tenderly No no my child You must not go I am very old and if you were to go now it would be like taking the light out of my life I know all I am not blind But wait Lydia shook her head If you love him my child wait It may be to save him and you would sacrifice yourself to do that And that mister Linnett went out of the area of the great gloomy house laughing to himself and casting up his total as he termed it Ha ha ha he exclaimed only to think of them knocking their heads about here and there and never so much as getting warm Detectives are all fools so the public say Blind as bats They want a better class of men He treated himself to a thoroughly good cigar and rolled out the blue clouds of smoke as he strode along wagging his umbrella behind him Always through all these years running down rogues What a temptation to a man to make a change and go the other way Million and a half o money in a shape as could be carried in a small black bag Why I could put my hand on it and go and set up somewhere as a king and never be found out Shall I It was quite dark and mister Linnett took a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and tucking his umbrella under his arm playfully fitted them on his own wrists No he said they wouldn t look well there CHAPTER TWENTY NINE THE PARTY BREAKS UP Dinner over of course Preenham Oh dear yes sir said that worthy taking Artis s hat and cane Carriage was ordered for half past seven and they ve gone to the theatre sir Gone where Theatre sir Haymarket sir Why Preenham It was mister Girtle sir proposed it Said it would be a pleasant change for everybody The carriage was ordered and dinner an hour sooner The sky will fall next said Artis with a sneering laugh Bring me some coffee in the library and no some brandy and soda and the cigars Yes sir Miss D Enghien s in the drawing room sir Had a bad headache and didn t go Why didn t you say that at first cried Artis and he went up two stairs at a time to find Katrine in the act of throwing herself into a chair and looking flushed and hot You here she said wearily My darling he cried If I had only known At last He threw himself at her feet clasped her waist and drew her half resisting towards him while before a minute had elapsed her arms were resting upon his shoulders and her eyes were half closed in a dreamy ecstasy as she yielded to the kisses that covered her face Suddenly with a quick motion she threw him off Quick some one she whispered Her ears were sharper than his and she had heard the dull rattle of the door handle I don t know what to take she said in a weary voice I suppose it will not be better before morning I have taken the brandy and soda into the library sir said Preenham Would you like it brought up here To be sure he cried The very thing for your headache Bring it up Preenham You madman cried Katrine angrily You take advantage of my weakness for you Another moment and we should have been discovered No no keep away Miss is as good as a mile You grow more reckless every day We must be careful Careful I m sick of being careful Hush The butler entered with a tray and the brandy and soda Open it sir Yes Two Now try that Best thing in the world for a bad head The old butler withdrew as softly as he had come in and Katrine took two or three sips from her glass while Artis tossed his off and then setting it down walked quickly to the door Katrine s eyes dilated and bending forward she listened and then sprang up and glided quickly across from the inner room to meet Artis half way and be clasped in his arms What have you done she cried Nothing You have fastened the door Nonsense I say you have Well suppose I have What then You madman Unfasten the door Not I I tell you that you are mad she cried trying to free herself Gerard dear Gerard be reasonable She writhed herself free and ran and turned the bolt back He followed to refasten it but she held him Think of the consequences of our being found locked in here Bah no one will come now till after eleven and if they did I don t care Look here he cried clasping her to his breast again suppose this Arabian Night sort of fortune were found do you think I am blind You would marry this Capel Well I won t have it he cried Why not she whispered and her creamy arms clasped about his neck We are so poor Gerard and we must have money to live Yes but at that cost he cried passionately Well what then Think Over a million which you should share Gerard dearest you will not be so foolish when I am so near this gigantic prize He is my complete slave I can do with him just what I will But Kate I believe you would He did not achieve his sentence but responded passionately to her caresses till he felt her suddenly grow rigid in his arms and then one arm was snatched from his neck and with her hand she struck him sharply across the face How dare you she cried Gerard Artis let his hands fall to his side and Katrine darted to a tall figure in evening dress standing just inside the door and flung herself at his knees Save me she half shrieked from the insults of this man Paul Capel drew himself aside and Katrine fell prostrate on the thick carpet as he gravely opened the door The girl sprang to her feet and darted out of the room while Capel after watching her for a moment or two closed the door turned the bolt and then threw his crush hat upon a table his black wrapper over a chair and tore off his white gloves changing the ivory handled malacca cane from hand to hand as he did so Home soon said Artis with a sneer as he slowly walked to the little table poured out some more brandy and gulped it down Yes replied Capel gravely Thank Heaven I did come home soon I came to spend an hour alone with the woman I loved And you were forestalled cried Artis Here what are you going to do Thrash a contemptible scoundrel within an inch of his life cried Capel and he made a grasp at Artis s arm But the latter eluded him bounded to the fire place and picked up the bright poker Keep off he cried or I ll murder you Cling Jingle He had struck the glass lustres of the great chandelier and the fragments fell tinkling down Crack A yell of pain A dull thud With a dexterous blow Capel caught Artis s right hand with the stout cane numbing his nerves so that the poker fell With a second blow he seemed to hamstring his adversary who staggered and would have fallen but for Capel s hand grasping him by the collar and then for two or three minutes there was a hail of blows falling and a terrible struggle going on The light chairs were kicked aside a table overturned a vase and several ornaments swept from a cheffonier and suppressed cries panting noises and blows filled the gloomy room till after one final stroke with the cane Capel dashed the helpless quivering man to the floor and placed his foot upon his breast An hour later when Preenham went up from a confidential talk with his fellow servants to admit mister Girtle and Lydia back from the theatre he found the front door open Had he been half an hour sooner he would have seen Katrine fully dressed supporting Artis down the dark stairs and out into the darkness of the great square where they were seen by the light of one of the street lamps to enter a cab and then they passed out of sight Preenham saw nothing and mister Girtle and Lydia ascended to the drawing room the latter feeling light hearted and happy in spite of the evening s disappointment The old lawyer uttered a cry of dismay as he saw the wreck and that Capel was seated in a low chair bent down with his face buried in his hands My dear boy What is it he cried as Lydia ran to his side and her soft hand was laid or his Don t touch me woman he almost yelled as he sprang from his chair Oh he said softly it is you He took and kissed her hand and then left the room Preenham what does this mean cried mister Girtle as the butler brought in lights and they learned the truth CHAPTER THIRTY WHERE THE TREASURE LAY Six months elapsed before mister Linnett put into execution the project he had had in his mind that night when he playfully tried the handcuffs on his wrists He had meant business as he termed it the next morning but on presenting himself at the chief office one of his superiors sent for him and announced an important task Extradition eh sir America Yes Cross at once put yourself in communication with the New York police and then spare no expense He must be found When shall I start sir Now mister Linnett did start now saying to himself as he entered a carriage for Liverpool Well they didn t set me the job It was my own doing and the news will keep So it came about that one morning when he presented himself at the Dark House he was saluted by mister Preenham with Why how do you do We thought we d quite lost you mister Linnett sir You look quite brown I ve been pretty well all over America since I saw you mister Preenham and now sir just go and give them my card and say I want to see them on very particular business Have you found out anything mister Linnett You wait a bit my dear sir Just take up the card mister Girtle was in the library with Paul Capel at the time for the old man had settled down there treating the younger as if he were a son He had talked several times of going but Capel begged him not to leave and he always stayed Well Preenham for me He said you and master sir the gentleman Ah Linnett The detective Will you see him No said Capel sternly I don t want that affair opened again But my dear boy There very well Show him up The detective came in smiling but only to encounter a stern look in return I ve called gentlemen about that little matter of the notes and jewels that were lost My good fellow said Capel angrily I will not have that matter taken up again It is dead Well sir the fact is you wouldn t let me take it up but I did it on my own account You did said mister Girtle Yes sir it took me months piecing together as I had to do it all from the outside without seeing the place I was sent abroad and have only just come back Last night however I took out my notes and went into it again and I think I can say I ve found the treasure Found it man cried Capel interested in spite of himself Where The place was thoroughly well searched Oh yes sir of course Then you know who took it Yes sir that s it Who was it then Ah come sir that s better Yes yes go on cried Capel excitedly and at that moment it was not the treasure that filled his eyes but the figure of a sweet gentle girl who had watched beside his sick bed Well the fact is gentlemen I very soon came to the conclusion that the great treasure had not been stolen Why said mister Girtle No notes were put in circulation that I could find old notes and no valuable jewels sold To be sure yes said mister Girtle My idea That wasn t worth much gentlemen but I felt sure from the beginning that the treasure was taken by someone on the premises Not that couple I ll swear said mister Girtle Nor the servants said Capel There sir it s all in a nutshell said Linnett hesitating Stop said mister Girtle What terms do you propose for this information Oh sir I wasn t hesitating about that but because I don t like letting it go now I ve found it It was so much trouble to find the clue I hardly like parting with it But here you are sir and if I may make terms I may say I m only a few pounds out of pocket ten will cover it but I should like it if mister Capel here would give me that Indian knife that kukri I ve a fancy for saving up that sort of article Take the horrible thing and welcome said Capel impatiently Well gentlemen I pieced together all that was published with Doctor Heston s notions the servants knowledge and my own ideas Well Well gentlemen it was that old Indian servant who took the treasure Impossible Not a bit He had the keys he knew how to use them He was as honest as the day cried mister Girtle Exactly sir that s just it Honesty made him take it Absurd said Capel Not a bit sir excuse me He knew that fellow Pillar the footman meant it You know he had a fight with him at the door Well granted said Capel He watched sir night and day and wouldn t leave the place and at last when I know said Capel those Italians Now you shouldn t take away people s character sir said the detective reproachfully It was that Indian He wasn t satisfied that the secret place was safe He was sure it would be broken open and so that night or the one before he took the treasure out and put it where he felt certain that no one would look for it And where was that cried Capel The detective smiled As I said gentlemen where no one would look for it And that was In the dead man s own charge sirs In the coffin Capel and mister Girtle sank back in their chairs And if you open that vault gentlemen and the iron tomb and the steel chest you ll find it safe and sound There s one more thing sir I should like to say and that is about that old Indian servant He was struck down no doubt or fainted after he had killed the footman defending the treasure I can t quite say what happened then but it looks to me as if some one came upon the old fellow when he was lying helpless some one who also meant to steal that treasure and that he or she or whoever it was chloroformed the old man to death I had it on the doctor s authority that he did not die of his wounds but this is only theory I can t say It was a theory that sent a chill through Paul Capel and he dared not put his thoughts about the fair Creole into shape All proved about the treasure precisely as mister Linnett had said for when with much compunction the various caskets were opened once again there lay the two cases beneath the cloth of gold robe safely in the keeping of the dead man whereat and for other reasons mister Linnett much rejoiced Later on old mister Girtle had his wish that of giving Lydia away to the man she loved one who often afterwards told her he wondered how he could have been so blind blind he said as the old place which was kept in accordance with the Colonel s last commands closed in front but bright and gay behind while Paul Capel used to say It is astonishing how much human sunshine can be got into a Dark House THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Dark House by Georg
