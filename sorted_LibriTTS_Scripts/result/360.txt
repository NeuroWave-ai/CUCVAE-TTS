the faithful and intelligent labors of his daughter aided by a few friends It was incomplete when submitted to Sainte Beuve but the portion with which the illustrious academician became acquainted was sufficient to allow him to estimate it as a whole with that soundness of judgment which characterized him as a literary critic He would however caution readers against accepting the biographer s interpretation of the author s views as in any sense authoritative advising them rather to await the publication of the remainder of Proudhon s writings that they may form an opinion for themselves Translator In an important work which his habitual readers certainly have not forgotten although death did not allow him to finish it Sainte Beuve thus judges the correspondence of the great publicist The letters of Proudhon even outside the circle of his particular friends will always be of value we can always learn something from them and here is the proper place to determine the general character of his correspondence It has always been large especially since he became so celebrated and to tell the truth I am persuaded that in the future the correspondence of Proudhon will be his principal vital work and that most of his books will be only accessory to and corroborative of this At any rate his books can be well understood only by the aid of his letters and the continual explanations which he makes to those who consult him in their doubt and request him to define more clearly his position There are among celebrated people many methods of correspondence There are those to whom letter writing is a bore and who assailed with questions and compliments reply in the greatest haste solely that the job may be over with and who return politeness for politeness mingling it with more or less wit This kind of correspondence though coming from celebrated people is insignificant and unworthy of collection and classification After those who write letters in performance of a disagreeable duty and almost side by side with them in point of insignificance I should put those who write in a manner wholly external wholly superficial devoted only to flattery lavishing praise like gold without counting it and those also who weigh every word who reply formally and pompously with a view to fine phrases and effects They exchange words only and choose them solely for their brilliancy and show You think it is you individually to whom they speak but they are addressing themselves in your person to the four corners of Europe Such letters are empty and teach as nothing but theatrical execution and the favorite pose of their writers I will not class among the latter the more prudent and sagacious authors who when writing to individuals keep one eye on posterity We know that many who pursue this method have written long finished charming flattering and tolerably natural letters Beranger furnishes us with the best example of this class Proudhon however is a man of entirely different nature and habits In writing he thinks of nothing but his idea and the person whom he addresses ad rem et ad hominem A man of conviction and doctrine to write does not weary him to be questioned does not annoy him When approached he cares only to know that your motive is not one of futile curiosity but the love of truth he assumes you to be serious he replies he examines your objections sometimes verbally sometimes in writing for as he remarks if there be some points which correspondence can never settle but which can be made clear by conversation in two minutes at other times just the opposite is the case an objection clearly stated in writing a doubt well expressed which elicits a direct and positive reply helps things along more than ten hours of oral intercourse In writing to you he does not hesitate to treat the subject anew he unfolds to you the foundation and superstructure of his thought rarely does he confess himself defeated it is not his way he holds to his position but admits the breaks the variations in short the EVOLUTION of his mind The history of his mind is in his letters there it must be sought Proudhon whoever addresses him is always ready he quits the page of the book on which he is at work to answer you with the same pen and that without losing patience without getting confused without sparing or complaining of his ink he is a public man devoted to the propagation of his idea by all methods and the best method with him is always the present one the latest one His very handwriting bold uniform legible even in the most tiresome passages betrays no haste no hurry to finish Each line is accurate nothing is left to chance the punctuation very correct and a little emphatic and decided indicates with precision and delicate distinction all the links in the chain of his argument He is devoted entirely to you to his business and yours while writing to you and never to anything else All the letters of his which I have seen are serious not one is commonplace But at the same time he is not at all artistic or affected he does not CONSTRUCT his letters he does not revise them he spends no time in reading them over we have a first draught excellent and clear a jet from the fountain head but that is all The new arguments which he discovers in support of his ideas and which opposition suggests to him are an agreeable surprise and shed a light which we should vainly search for even in his works His correspondence differs essentially from his books in that it gives you no uneasiness it places you in the very heart of the man explains him to you and leaves you with an impression of moral esteem and almost of intellectual security We feel his sincerity I know of no one to whom he can be more fitly compared in this respect than George Sand whose correspondence is large and at the same time full of sincerity His role and his nature correspond If he is writing to a young man who unbosoms himself to him in sceptical anxiety to a young woman who asks him to decide delicate questions of conduct for her his letter takes the form of a short moral essay of a father confessor s advice Has he perchance attended the theatre a rare thing for him to witness one of Ponsart s comedies or a drama of Charles Edmond s he feels bound to give an account of his impressions to the friend to whom he is indebted for this pleasure and his letter becomes a literary and philosophical criticism full of sense and like no other His familiarity is suited to his correspondent he affects no rudeness The terms of civility or affection which he employs towards his correspondents are sober measured appropriate to each and honest in their simplicity and cordiality When he speaks of morals and the family he seems at times like the patriarchs of the Bible His command of language is complete and he never fails to avail himself of it Now and then a coarse word a few personalities too bitter and quite unjust or injurious will have to be suppressed in printing time however as it passes away permits many things and renders them inoffensive Am I right in saying that Proudhon s correspondence always substantial will one day be the most accessible and attractive portion of his works Almost the whole of Proudhon s real biography is included in his correspondence Up to eighteen thirty seven the date of the first letter which we have been able to collect his life narrated by Sainte Beuve from whom we make numerous extracts may be summed up in a few pages Pierre Joseph Proudhon was born on the fifteenth of January eighteen oh nine in a suburb of Besancon called Mouillere His father and mother were employed in the great brewery belonging to M Renaud His father though a cousin of the jurist Proudhon the celebrated professor in the faculty of Dijon was a journeyman brewer His mother a genuine peasant was a common servant She was an orderly person of great good sense and as they who knew her say a superior woman of HEROIC character to use the expression of the venerable M Weiss the librarian at Besancon She it was especially that Proudhon resembled she and his grandfather Tournesi the soldier peasant of whom his mother told him and whose courageous deeds he has described in his work on Justice Proudhon who always felt a great veneration for his mother Catharine gave her name to the elder of his daughters In eighteen fourteen when Besancon was blockaded Mouillere which stood in front of the walls of the town was destroyed in the defence of the place and Proudhon s father established a cooper s shop in a suburb of Battant called Vignerons Very honest but simple minded and short sighted this cooper the father of five children of whom Pierre Joseph was the eldest passed his life in poverty At eight years of age Proudhon either made himself useful in the house or tended the cattle out of doors No one should fail to read that beautiful and precious page of his work on Justice in which he describes the rural sports which he enjoyed when a neatherd At the age of twelve he was a cellar boy in an inn This however did not prevent him from studying His mother was greatly aided by M Renaud the former owner of the brewery who had at that time retired from business and was engaged in the education of his children Proudhon entered school as a day scholar in the sixth class He was necessarily irregular in his attendance domestic cares and restraints sometimes kept him from his classes He succeeded nevertheless in his studies he showed great perseverance His family were so poor that they could not afford to furnish him with books he was obliged to borrow them from his comrades and copy the text of his lessons He has himself told us that he was obliged to leave his wooden shoes outside the door that he might not disturb the classes with his noise and that having no hat he went to school bareheaded One day towards the close of his studies on returning from the distribution of the prizes loaded with crowns he found nothing to eat in the house In his eagerness for labor and his thirst for knowledge Proudhon says Sainte Beuve was not content with the instruction of his teachers From his twelfth to his fourteenth year he was a constant frequenter of the town library One curiosity led to another and he called for book after book sometimes eight or ten at one sitting The learned librarian the friend and almost the brother of Charles Nodier M Weiss approached him one day and said smiling But my little friend what do you wish to do with all these books The child raised his head eyed his questioner and replied What s that to you And the good M Weiss remembers it to this day Forced to earn his living Proudhon could not continue his studies He entered a printing office in Besancon as a proof reader Becoming soon after a compositor he made a tour of France in this capacity At Toulon where he found himself without money and without work he had a scene with the mayor which he describes in his work on Justice Sainte Beuve says that after his tour of France his service book being filled with good certificates Proudhon was promoted to the position of foreman But he does not tell us for the reason that he had no knowledge of a letter written by Fallot of which we never heard until six months since that the printer at that time contemplated quitting his trade in order to become a teacher Towards eighteen twenty nine Fallot who was a little older than Proudhon and who after having obtained the Suard pension in eighteen thirty two died in his twenty ninth year while filling the position of assistant librarian at the Institute was charged Protestant though he was with the revisal of a Life of the Saints which was published at Besancon The book was in Latin and Fallot added some notes which also were in Latin But says Sainte Beuve it happened that some errors escaped his attention which Proudhon then proof reader in the printing office did not fail to point out to him Surprised at finding so good a Latin scholar in a workshop he desired to make his acquaintance and soon there sprung up between them a most earnest and intimate friendship a friendship of the intellect and of the heart Addressed to a printer between twenty two and twenty three years of age and predicting in formal terms his future fame Fallot s letter seems to us so interesting that we do not hesitate to reproduce it entire PARIS December five eighteen thirty one MY DEAR PROUDHON YOU have a right to be surprised at and even dissatisfied with my long delay in replying to your kind letter I will tell you the cause of it It became necessary to forward an account of your ideas to M J de Gray to hear his objections to reply to them and to await his definitive response which reached me but a short time ago for M J is a sort of financial king who takes no pains to be punctual in dealing with poor devils like ourselves I too am careless in matters of business I sometimes push my negligence even to disorder and the metaphysical musings which continually occupy my mind added to the amusements of Paris render me the most incapable man in the world for conducting a negotiation with despatch I have M Jobard s decision here it is In his judgment you are too learned and clever for his children he fears that you could not accommodate your mind and character to the childish notions common to their age and station In short he is what the world calls a good father that is he wants to spoil his children and in order to do this easily he thinks fit to retain his present instructor who is not very learned but who takes part in their games and joyous sports with wonderful facility who points out the letters of the alphabet to the little girl who takes the little boys to mass and who no less obliging than the worthy Abbe P of our acquaintance would readily dance for Madame s amusement Such a profession would not suit you you who have a free proud and manly soul you are refused let us dismiss the matter from our minds Perhaps another time my solicitude will be less unfortunate I can only ask your pardon for having thought of thus disposing of you almost without consulting you I find my excuse in the motives which guided me I had in view your well being and advancement in the ways of this world I see in your letter my comrade through its brilliant witticisms and beneath the frank and artless gayety with which you have sprinkled it a tinge of sadness and despondency which pains me You are unhappy my friend your present situation does not suit you you cannot remain in it it was not made for you it is beneath you you ought by all means to leave it before its injurious influence begins to affect your faculties and before you become settled as they say in the ways of your profession were it possible that such a thing could ever happen which I flatly deny You are unhappy you have not yet entered upon the path which Nature has marked out for you But faint hearted soul is that a cause for despondency Ought you to feel discouraged Struggle morbleu struggle persistently and you will triumph J J Rousseau groped about for forty years before his genius was revealed to him You are not J J Rousseau but listen I know not whether I should have divined the author of Emile when he was twenty years of age supposing that I had been his contemporary and had enjoyed the honor of his acquaintance But I have known you I have loved you I have divined your future if I may venture to say so for the first time in my life I am going to risk a prophecy Keep this letter read it again fifteen or twenty years hence perhaps twenty five and if at that time the prediction which I am about to make has not been fulfilled burn it as a piece of folly out of charity and respect for my memory This is my prediction you will be Proudhon in spite of yourself inevitably by the fact of your destiny a writer an author you will be a philosopher you will be one of the lights of the century and your name will occupy a place in the annals of the nineteenth century like those of Gassendi Descartes Malebranche and Bacon in the seventeenth and those of Diderot Montesquieu Helvetius Locke Hume and Holbach in the eighteenth Such will be your lot Do now what you will set type in a printing office bring up children bury yourself in deep seclusion seek obscure and lonely villages it is all one to me you cannot escape your destiny you cannot divest yourself of your noblest feature that active strong and inquiring mind with which you are endowed your place in the world has been appointed and it cannot remain empty Go where you please I expect you in Paris talking philosophy and the doctrines of Plato you will have to come whether you want to or not I who say this to you must feel very sure of it in order to be willing to put it upon paper since without reward for my prophetic skill to which I assure you I make not the slightest claim I run the risk of passing for a hare brained fellow in case I prove to be mistaken he plays a bold game who risks his good sense upon his cards in return for the very trifling and insignificant merit of having divined a young man s future When I say that I expect you in Paris I use only a proverbial phrase which you must not allow to mislead you as to my projects and plans To reside in Paris is disagreeable to me very much so and when this fine art fever which possesses me has left me I shall abandon the place without regret to seek a more peaceful residence in a provincial town provided always the town shall afford me the means of living bread a bed books rest and solitude How I miss my good Proudhon that dark obscure smoky chamber in which I dwelt in Besancon and where we spent so many pleasant hours in the discussion of philosophy Do you remember it But that is now far away Will that happy time ever return Shall we one day meet again Here my life is restless uncertain precarious and what is worse indolent illiterate and vagrant I do no work I live in idleness I ramble about I do not read I no longer study my books are forsaken now and then I glance over a few metaphysical works and after a days walk through dirty filthy crowded streets I lie down with empty head and tired body to repeat the performance on the following day What is the object of these walks you will ask I make visits my friend I hold interviews with stupid people Then a fit of curiosity seizes me the least inquisitive of beings there are museums libraries assemblies churches palaces gardens and theatres to visit I am fond of pictures fond of music fond of sculpture all these are beautiful and good but they cannot appease hunger nor take the place of my pleasant readings of Bailly Hume and Tennemann which I used to enjoy by my fireside when I was able to read But enough of complaints Do not allow this letter to affect you too much and do not think that I give way to dejection or despondency no I am a fatalist and I believe in my star I do not know yet what my calling is nor for what branch of polite literature I am best fitted I do not even know whether I am or ever shall be fitted for any but what matters it I suffer I labor I dream I enjoy I think and in a word when my last hour strikes I shall have lived Proudhon I love you I esteem you and believe me these are not mere phrases What interest could I have in flattering and praising a poor printer Are you rich that you may pay for courtiers Have you a sumptuous table a dashing wife and gold to scatter in order to attract them to your suite Have you the glory honors credit which would render your acquaintance pleasing to their vanity and pride No you are poor obscure abandoned but poor obscure and abandoned you have a friend and a friend who knows all the obligations which that word imposes upon honorable people when they venture to assume it That friend is myself put me to the test GUSTAVE FALLOT It appears from this letter that if at this period Proudhon had already exhibited to the eyes of a clairvoyant friend his genius for research and investigation it was in the direction of philosophical rather than of economical and social questions Having become foreman in the house of Gauthier company who carried on a large printing establishment at Besancon he corrected the proofs of ecclesiastical writers the Fathers of the Church As they were printing a Bible a Vulgate he was led to compare the Latin with the original Hebrew In this way says Sainte Beuve he learned Hebrew by himself and as everything was connected in his mind he was led to the study of comparative philology As the house of Gauthier published many works on Church history and theology he came also to acquire through this desire of his to investigate everything an extensive knowledge of theology which afterwards caused misinformed persons to think that he had been in an ecclesiastical seminary Towards eighteen thirty six Proudhon left the house of Gauthier and in company with an associate established a small printing office in Besancon His contribution to the partnership consisted not so much in capital as in his knowledge of the trade His partner committing suicide in eighteen thirty eight Proudhon was obliged to wind up the business an operation which he did not accomplish as quickly and as easily as he hoped He was then urged by his friends to enter the ranks of the competitors for the Suard pension This pension consisted of an income of fifteen hundred francs bequeathed to the Academy of Besancon by Madame Suard the widow of the academician to be given once in three years to the young man residing in the department of Doubs a bachelor of letters or of science and not possessing a fortune whom the Academy of Besancon SHOULD DEEM BEST FITTED FOR A LITERARY OR SCIENTIFIC CAREER OR FOR THE STUDY OF LAW OR OF MEDICINE The first to win the Suard pension was Gustave Fallot Mauvais who was a distinguished astronomer in the Academy of Sciences was the second Proudhon aspired to be the third To qualify himself he had to be received as a bachelor of letters and was obliged to write a letter to the Academy of Besancon In a phrase of this letter the terms of which he had to modify though he absolutely refused to change its spirit Proudhon expressed his firm resolve to labor for the amelioration of the condition of his brothers the working men The only thing which he had then published was an Essay on General Grammar which appeared without the author s signature While reprinting at Besancon the Primitive Elements of Languages Discovered by the Comparison of Hebrew roots with those of the Latin and French by the Abbe Bergier Proudhon had enlarged the edition of his Essay on General Grammar The date of the edition eighteen thirty seven proves that he did not at that time think of competing for the Suard pension In this work which continued and completed that of the Abbe Bergier Proudhon adopted the same point of view that of Moses and of Biblical tradition Two years later in February eighteen thirty nine being already in possession of the Suard pension he addressed to the Institute as a competitor for the Volney prize a memoir entitled Studies in Grammatical Classification and the Derivation of some French words It was his first work revised and presented in another form Four memoirs only were sent to the Institute none of which gained the prize Two honorable mentions were granted one of them to memoir No four that is to P J Proudhon printer at Besancon The judges were MM Amedde Jaubert Reinaud and Burnouf The committee said the report presented at the annual meeting of the five academies on Thursday May two eighteen thirty nine has paid especial attention to manuscripts No one and No four Still it does not feel able to grant the prize to either of these works because they do not appear to be sufficiently elaborated The committee which finds in No four some ingenious analyses particularly in regard to the mechanism of the Hebrew language regrets that the author has resorted to hazardous conjectures and has sometimes forgotten the special recommendation of the committee to pursue the experimental and comparative method Proudhon remembered this He attended the lectures of Eugene Burnouf and as soon as he became acquainted with the labors and discoveries of Bopp and his successors he definitively abandoned an hypothesis which had been condemned by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles lettres He then sold for the value of the paper the remaining copies of the Essay published by him in eighteen thirty seven In eighteen fifty they were still lying in a grocer s back shop A neighboring publisher then placed the edition on the market with the attractive name of Proudhon upon it A lawsuit ensued in which the author was beaten His enemies and at that time there were many of them would have been glad to have proved him a renegade and a recanter Proudhon in his work on Justice gives some interesting details of this lawsuit In possession of the Suard pension Proudhon took part in the contest proposed by the Academy of Besancon on the question of the utility of the celebration of Sunday His memoir obtained honorable mention together with a medal which was awarded him in open session on the twenty fourth of August eighteen thirty nine The reporter of the committee the Abbe Doney since made Bishop of Montauban called attention to the unquestionable superiority of his talent But says Sainte Beuve he reproached him with having adopted dangerous theories and with having touched upon questions of practical politics and social organization where upright intentions and zeal for the public welfare cannot justify rash solutions Was it policy we mean prudence which induced Proudhon to screen his ideas of equality behind the Mosaic law Sainte Beuve like many others seems to think so But we remember perfectly well that having asked Proudhon in August eighteen forty eight if he did not consider himself indebted in some respects to his fellow countryman Charles Fourier we received from him the following reply I have certainly read Fourier and have spoken of him more than once in my works but upon the whole I do not think that I owe anything to him My real masters those who have caused fertile ideas to spring up in my mind are three in number first the Bible next Adam Smith and last Hegel Freely confessed in the Celebration of Sunday the influence of the Bible on Proudhon is no less manifest in his first memoir on property Proudhon undoubtedly brought to this work many ideas of his own but is not the very foundation of ancient Jewish law to be found in its condemnation of usurious interest and its denial of the right of personal appropriation of land The first memoir on property appeared in eighteen forty under the title What is Property or an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government Proudhon dedicated it in a letter which served as the preface to the Academy of Besancon The latter finding itself brought to trial by its pensioner took the affair to heart and evoked it says Sainte Beuve with all possible haste The pension narrowly escaped being immediately withdrawn from the bold defender of the principle of equality of conditions M Vivien then Minister of Justice who was earnestly solicited to prosecute the author wished first to obtain the opinion of the economist Blanqui a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences Proudhon having presented to this academy a copy of his book M Blanqui was appointed to review it This review though it opposed Proudhon s views shielded him Treated as a savant by M Blanqui the author was not prosecuted He was always grateful to MM Blanqui and Vivien for their handsome conduct in the matter M Blanqui s review which was partially reproduced by Le Moniteur on the seventh of September eighteen forty naturally led Proudhon to address to him in the form of a letter his second memoir on property which appeared in April eighteen forty one Proudhon had endeavored in his first memoir to demonstrate that the pursuit of equality of conditions is the true principle of right and of government In the Letter to M Blanqui he passes in review the numerous and varied methods by which this principle gradually becomes realized in all societies especially in modern society In eighteen forty two a third memoir appeared entitled A Notice to Proprietors or a Letter to M Victor Considerant Editor of La Phalange in Reply to a Defence of Property Here the influence of Adam Smith manifested itself and was frankly admitted Did not Adam Smith find in the principle of equality the first of all the laws which govern wages There are other laws undoubtedly but Proudhon considers them all as springing from the principle of property as he defined it in his first memoir Thus in humanity there are two principles one which leads us to equality another which separates us from it By the former we treat each other as associates by the latter as strangers not to say enemies This distinction which is constantly met with throughout the three memoirs contained already in germ the idea which gave birth to the System of Economical Contradictions which appeared in eighteen forty six the idea of antinomy or contre loi The Notice to Proprietors was seized by the magistrates of Besancon and Proudhon was summoned to appear before the assizes of Doubs within a week He read his written defence to the jurors in person and was acquitted The jury like M Blanqui viewed him only as a philosopher an inquirer a savant In eighteen forty three Proudhon published the Creation of Order in Humanity a large volume which does not deal exclusively with questions of social economy Religion philosophy method certainty logic and dialectics are treated at considerable length Released from his printing office on the first of March of the same year Proudhon had to look for a chance to earn his living Messrs Gauthier Bros carriers by water between Mulhouse and Lyons the eldest of whom was Proudhon s companion in childhood conceived the happy thought of employing him of utilizing his ability in their business and in settling the numerous points of difficulty which daily arose Besides the large number of accounts which his new duties required him to make out and which retarded the publication of the System of Economical Contradictions until October eighteen forty six we ought to mention a work which before it appeared in pamphlet form was published in the Revue des Economistes Competition between Railroads and Navigable Ways Le Miserere or the Repentance of a King which he published in March eighteen forty five in the Revue Independante during that Lenten season when Lacordaire was preaching in Lyons proves that though devoting himself with ardor to the study of economical problems Proudhon had not lost his interest in questions of religious history Among his writings on these questions which he was unfortunately obliged to leave unfinished we may mention a nearly completed history of the early Christian heresies and of the struggle of Christianity against Caesarism We have said that in eighteen forty eight Proudhon recognized three masters Having no knowledge of the German language he could not have read the works of Hegel which at that time had not been translated into French It was Charles Grun a German who had come to France to study the various philosophical and socialistic systems who gave him the substance of the Hegelian ideas During the winter of eighteen forty four forty five Charles Grun had some long conversations with Proudhon which determined very decisively not the ideas which belonged exclusively to the bisontin thinker but the form of the important work on which he labored after eighteen forty three and which was published in eighteen forty six by Guillaumin Hegel s great idea which Proudhon appropriated and which he demonstrates with wonderful ability in the System of Economical Contradictions is as follows Antinomy that is the existence of two laws or tendencies which are opposed to each other is possible not only with two different things but with one and the same thing Considered in their thesis that is in the law or tendency which created them all the economical categories are rational competition monopoly the balance of trade and property as well as the division of labor machinery taxation and credit But like communism and population all these categories are antinomical all are opposed not only to each other but to themselves All is opposition and disorder is born of this system of opposition Hence the sub title of the work Philosophy of Misery No category can be suppressed the opposition antinomy or contre tendance which exists in each of them cannot be suppressed Where then lies the solution of the social problem Influenced by the Hegelian ideas Proudhon began to look for it in a superior synthesis which should reconcile the thesis and antithesis Afterwards while at work upon his book on Justice he saw that the antinomical terms do not cancel each other any more than the opposite poles of an electric pile destroy each other that they are the procreative cause of motion life and progress that the problem is to discover not their fusion which would be death but their equilibrium an equilibrium for ever unstable varying with the development of society On the cover of the System of Economical Contradictions Proudhon announced as soon to appear his Solution of the Social Problem This work upon which he was engaged when the Revolution of eighteen forty eight broke out had to be cut up into pamphlets and newspaper articles The two pamphlets which he published in March eighteen forty eight before he became editor of Le Representant du Peuple bear the same title Solution of the Social Problem The first which is mainly a criticism of the early acts of the provisional government is notable from the fact that in it Proudhon in advance of all others energetically opposed the establishment of national workshops The second Organization of Credit and Circulation sums up in a few pages his idea of economical progress a gradual reduction of interest profit rent taxes and wages All progress hitherto has been made in this manner in this manner it must continue to be made Those workingmen who favor a nominal increase of wages are unconsciously following a back track opposed to all their interests After having published in Le Representant du Peuple the statutes of the Bank of Exchange a bank which was to make no profits since it was to have no stockholders and which consequently was to discount commercial paper with out interest charging only a commission sufficient to defray its running expenses Proudhon endeavored in a number of articles to explain its mechanism and necessity These articles have been collected in one volume under the double title Resume of the Social Question Bank of Exchange His other articles those which up to December eighteen forty eight were inspired by the progress of events have been collected in another volume Revolutionary Ideas Almost unknown in March eighteen forty eight and struck off in April from the list of candidates for the Constituent Assembly by the delegation of workingmen which sat at the Luxembourg Proudhon had but a very small number of votes at the general elections of April At the complementary elections which were held in the early days of June he was elected in Paris by seventy seven thousand votes After the fatal days of June he published an article on le terme which caused the first suspension of Le Representant du Peuple It was at that time that he introduced a bill into the Assembly which being referred to the Committee on the Finances drew forth first the report of M Thiers and then the speech which Proudhon delivered on the thirty first of July in reply to this report Le Representant du Peuple reappearing a few days later he wrote a propos of the law requiring journals to give bonds his famous article on The Malthusians August ten eighteen forty eight Ten days afterwards Le Representant du Peuple again suspended definitively ceased to appear Le Peuple of which he was the editor in chief and the first number of which was issued in the early part of September appeared weekly at first for want of sufficient bonds it afterwards appeared daily with a double number once a week Before Le Peuple had obtained its first bond Proudhon published a remarkable pamphlet on the Right to Labor a right which he denied in the form in which it was then affirmed It was during the same period that he proposed at the Poissonniere banquet his Toast to the Revolution Proudhon who had been asked to preside at the banquet refused and proposed in his stead first Ledru Rollin and then in view of the reluctance of the organizers of the banquet the illustrious president of the party of the Mountain Lamennais It was evidently his intention to induce the representatives of the Extreme Left to proclaim at last with him the Democratic and Social Republic Lamennais being accepted by the organizers the Mountain promised to be present at the banquet The night before all seemed right when General Cavaignac replaced Minister Senart by Minister Dufaure Vivien The Mountain questioning the government proposed a vote of confidence in the old minister and tacitly of want of confidence in the new Proudhon abstained from voting on this proposition The Mountain declared that it would not attend the banquet if Proudhon was to be present Five Montagnards Mathieu of Drome at their head went to the temporary office of Le Peuple to notify him of this Citizen Proudhon said they to the organizers in his presence in abstaining from voting to day on the proposition of the Mountain has betrayed the Republican cause Proudhon vehemently questioned began his defence by recalling on the one hand the treatment which he had received from the dismissed minister and on the other the impartial conduct displayed towards him in eighteen forty by M Vivien the new minister He then attacked the Mountain by telling its delegates that it sought only a pretext and that really in spite of its professions of Socialism in private conversation whether with him or with the organizers of the banquet it had not the courage to publicly declare itself Socialist On the following day in his Toast to the Revolution a toast which was filled with allusions to the exciting scene of the night before Proudhon commenced his struggle against the Mountain His duel with Felix Pyat was one of the episodes of this struggle which became less bitter on Proudhon s side after the Mountain finally decided to publicly proclaim the Democratic and Social Republic The campaign for the election of a President of the Republic had just begun Proudhon made a very sharp attack on the candidacy of Louis Bonaparte in a pamphlet which is regarded as one of his literary chefs d oeuvre the Pamphlet on the Presidency An opponent of this institution against which he had voted in the Constituent Assembly he at first decided to take no part in the campaign But soon seeing that he was thus increasing the chances of Louis Bonaparte and that if as was not at all probable the latter should not obtain an absolute majority of the votes the Assembly would not fail to elect General Cavaignac he espoused for the sake of form the candidacy of Raspail who was supported by his friends in the Socialist Committee Charles Delescluze the editor in chief of La Revolution Democratique et Sociale who could not forgive him for having preferred Raspail to Ledru Rollin the candidate of the Mountain attacked him on the day after the election with a violence which overstepped all bounds At first Proudhon had the wisdom to refrain from answering him At length driven to an extremity he became aggressive himself and Delescluze sent him his seconds This time Proudhon positively refused to fight he would not have fought with Felix Pyat had not his courage been called in question On the twenty fifth of January eighteen forty nine Proudhon rising from a sick bed saw that the existence of the Constituent Assembly was endangered by the coalition of the monarchical parties with Louis Bonaparte who was already planning his coup d Etat He did not hesitate to openly attack the man who had just received five millions of votes He wanted to break the idol he succeeded only in getting prosecuted and condemned himself The prosecution demanded against him was authorized by a majority of the Constituent Assembly in spite of the speech which he delivered on that occasion Declared guilty by the jury he was sentenced in March eighteen forty nine to three years imprisonment and the payment of a fine of ten thousand francs Proudhon had not abandoned for a single moment his project of a Bank of Exchange which was to operate without capital with a sufficient number of merchants and manufacturers for adherents This bank which he then called the Bank of the People and around which he wished to gather the numerous working people s associations which had been formed since the twenty fourth of February eighteen forty eight had already obtained a certain number of subscribers and adherents the latter to the number of thirty seven thousand It was about to commence operations when Proudhon s sentence forced him to choose between imprisonment and exile He did not hesitate to abandon his project and return the money to the subscribers He explained the motives which led him to this decision in an article in Le Peuple Having fled to Belgium he remained there but a few days going thence to Paris under an assumed name to conceal himself in a house in the Rue de Chabrol From his hiding place he sent articles almost every day signed and unsigned to Le Peuple In the evening dressed in a blouse he went to some secluded spot to take the air Soon emboldened by habit he risked an evening promenade upon the Boulevards and afterwards carried his imprudence so far as to take a stroll by daylight in the neighborhood of the Gare du Nord It was not long before he was recognized by the police who arrested him on the sixth of June eighteen forty nine in the Rue du Faubourg Poissonniere Taken to the office of the prefect of police then to Sainte Pelagie he was in the Conciergerie on the day of the thirteenth of June eighteen forty nine which ended with the violent suppression of Le Peuple He then began to write the Confessions of a Revolutionist published towards the end of the year He had been again transferred to Sainte Pelagie when he married in December eighteen forty nine Mlle Euphrasie Piegard a young working girl whose hand he had requested in eighteen forty seven Madame Proudhon bore him four daughters of whom but two Catherine and Stephanie survived their father Stephanie died in eighteen seventy three In October eighteen forty nine Le Peuple was replaced by a new journal La Voix du Peuple which Proudhon edited from his prison cell In it were published his discussions with Pierre Leroux and Bastiat The political articles which he sent to La Voix du Peuple so displeased the government finally that it transferred him to Doullens where he was secretly confined for some time Afterwards taken back to Paris to appear before the assizes of the Seine in reference to an article in La Voix du Peuple he was defended by M Cremieux and acquitted From the Conciergerie he went again to Sainte Pelagie where he ended his three years in prison on the sixth of June eighteen fifty two La Voix du Peuple suppressed before the promulgation of the law of the thirty first of May had been replaced by a weekly sheet Le Peuple of eighteen fifty Established by the aid of the principal members of the Mountain this journal soon met with the fate of its predecessors In eighteen fifty one several months before the coup d Etat Proudhon published the General Idea of the Revolution of the Nineteenth Century in which after having shown the logical series of unitary governments from monarchy which is the first term to the direct government of the people which is the last he opposes the ideal of an archy or self government to the communistic or governmental ideal At this period the Socialist party discouraged by the elections of eighteen forty nine which resulted in a greater conservative triumph than those of eighteen forty eight and justly angry with the national representative body which had just passed the law of the thirty first of May eighteen fifty demanded direct legislation and direct government Proudhon who did not want at any price the plebiscitary system which he had good reason to regard as destructive of liberty did not hesitate to point out to those of his friends who expected every thing from direct legislation one of the antinomies of universal suffrage In so far as it is an institution intended to achieve for the benefit of the greatest number the social reforms to which landed suffrage is opposed universal suffrage is powerless especially if it pretends to legislate or govern directly For until the social reforms are accomplished the greatest number is of necessity the least enlightened and consequently the least capable of understanding and effecting reforms In regard to the antinomy pointed out by him of liberty and government whether the latter be monarchic aristocratic or democratic in form Proudhon whose chief desire was to preserve liberty naturally sought the solution in the free contract But though the free contract may be a practical solution of purely economical questions it cannot be made use of in politics Proudhon recognized this ten years later when his beautiful study on War and Peace led him to find in the FEDERATIVE PRINCIPLE the exact equilibrium of liberty and government The Social Revolution Demonstrated by the Coup d Etat appeared in eighteen fifty two a few months after his release from prison At that time terror prevailed to such an extent that no one was willing to publish his book without express permission from the government He succeeded in obtaining this permission by writing to Louis Bonaparte a letter which he published at the same time with the work The latter being offered for sale Proudhon was warned that he would not be allowed to publish any more books of the same character At that time he entertained the idea of writing a universal history entitled Chronos This project was never fulfilled Already the father of two children and about to be presented with a third Proudhon was obliged to devise some immediate means of gaining a living he resumed his labors and published at first anonymously the Manual of a Speculator in the Stock Exchange Later in eighteen fifty seven after having completed the work he did not hesitate to sign it acknowledging in the preface his indebtedness to his collaborator G Duchene Meantime he vainly sought permission to establish a journal or review This permission was steadily refused him The imperial government always suspected him after the publication of the Social Revolution Demonstrated by the Coup d Etat Towards the end of eighteen fifty three Proudhon issued in Belgium a pamphlet entitled The Philosophy of Progress Entirely inoffensive as it was this pamphlet which he endeavored to send into France was seized on the frontier Proudhon s complaints were of no avail The empire gave grants after grants to large companies A financial society having asked for the grant of a railroad in the east of France employed Proudhon to write several memoirs in support of this demand The grant was given to another company The author was offered an indemnity as compensation to be paid as was customary in such cases by the company which received the grant It is needless to say that Proudhon would accept nothing Then wishing to explain to the public as well as to the government the end which he had in view he published the work entitled Reforms to be Effected in the Management of Railroads Towards the end of eighteen fifty four Proudhon had already begun his book on Justice when he had a violent attack of cholera from which he recovered with great difficulty Ever afterwards his health was delicate At last on the twenty twod of April eighteen fifty eight he published in three large volumes the important work upon which he had labored since eighteen fifty four This work had two titles the first Justice in the Revolution and in the Church the second New Principles of Practical Philosophy addressed to His Highness Monseigneur Mathieu Cardinal Archbishop of Besancon On the twenty seventh of April when there had scarcely been time to read the work an order was issued by the magistrate for its seizure on the twenty eighth the seizure was effected To this first act of the magistracy the author of the incriminated book replied on the eleventh of May in a strongly motived petition demanding a revision of the concordat of eighteen oh two or in other words a new adjustment of the relations between Church and State At bottom this petition was but the logical consequence of the work itself An edition of a thousand copies being published on the seventeenth of May the Petition to the Senate was regarded by the public prosecutor as an aggravation of the offence or offences discovered in the body of the work to which it was an appendix and was seized in its turn on the twenty threed On the first of June the author appealed to the Senate in a second Petition which was deposited with the first in the office of the Secretary of the Assembly the guardian and guarantee according to the constitution of eighteen fifty two of the principles of eighty nine On the twod of June the two processes being united Proudhon appeared at the bar with his publisher the printer of the book and the printer of the petition to receive the sentence of the police magistrate which condemned him to three years imprisonment a fine of four thousand francs and the suppression of his work It is needless to say that the publisher and printers were also condemned by the sixth chamber Proudhon lodged an appeal he wrote a memoir which the law of eighteen nineteen in the absence of which he would have been liable to a new prosecution gave him the power to publish previous to the hearing Having decided to make use of the means which the law permitted he urged in vain the printers who were prosecuted with him to lend him their aid He then demanded of Attorney General Chaix d Est Ange a statement to the effect that the twenty third article of the law of the seventeenth of May eighteen nineteen allows a written defence and that a printer runs no risk in printing it The attorney general flatly refused Proudhon then started for Belgium where he printed his defence which could not of course cross the French frontier This memoir is entitled to rank with the best of Beaumarchais s it is entitled Justice prosecuted by the Church An Appeal from the Sentence passed upon P J Proudhon by the Police Magistrate of the Seine on the twod of June eighteen fifty eight A very close discussion of the grounds of the judgment of the sixth chamber it was at the same time an excellent resume of his great work Once in Belgium Proudhon did not fail to remain there In eighteen fifty nine after the general amnesty which followed the Italian war he at first thought himself included in it But the imperial government consulted by his friends notified him that in its opinion and in spite of the contrary advice of M Faustin Helie his condemnation was not of a political character Proudhon thus classed by the government with the authors of immoral works thought it beneath his dignity to protest and waited patiently for the advent of eighteen sixty three to allow him to return to France In Belgium where he was not slow in forming new friendships he published in eighteen fifty nine sixty in separate parts a new edition of his great work on Justice Each number contained in addition to the original text carefully reviewed and corrected numerous explanatory notes and some Tidings of the Revolution In these tidings which form a sort of review of the progress of ideas in Europe Proudhon sorrowfully asserts that after having for a long time marched at the head of the progressive nations France has become without appearing to suspect it the most retrogressive of nations and he considers her more than once as seriously threatened with moral death The Italian war led him to write a new work which he published in eighteen sixty one entitled War and Peace This work in which running counter to a multitude of ideas accepted until then without examination he pronounced for the first time against the restoration of an aristocratic and priestly Poland and against the establishment of a unitary government in Italy created for him a multitude of enemies Most of his friends disconcerted by his categorical affirmation of a right of force notified him that they decidedly disapproved of his new publication You see triumphantly cried those whom he had always combated this man is only a sophist Led by his previous studies to test every thing by the question of right Proudhon asks in his War and Peace whether there is a real right of which war is the vindication and victory the demonstration This right which he roughly calls the right of the strongest or the right of force and which is after all only the right of the most worthy to the preference in certain definite cases exists says Proudhon independently of war It cannot be legitimately vindicated except where necessity clearly demands the subordination of one will to another and within the limits in which it exists that is without ever involving the enslavement of one by the other Among nations the right of the majority which is only a corollary of the right of force is as unacceptable as universal monarchy Hence until equilibrium is established and recognized between States or national forces there must be war War says Proudhon is not always necessary to determine which side is the strongest and he has no trouble in proving this by examples drawn from the family the workshop and elsewhere Passing then to the study of war he proves that it by no means corresponds in practice to that which it ought to be according to his theory of the right of force The systematic horrors of war naturally lead him to seek a cause for it other than the vindication of this right and then only does the economist take it upon himself to denounce this cause to those who like himself want peace The necessity of finding abroad a compensation for the misery resulting in every nation from the absence of economical equilibrium is according to Proudhon the ever real though ever concealed cause of war The pages devoted to this demonstration and to his theory of poverty which he clearly distinguishes from misery and pauperism shed entirely new light upon the philosophy of history As for the author s conclusion it is a very simple one Since the treaty of Westphalia and especially since the treaties of eighteen fifteen equilibrium has been the international law of Europe It remains now not to destroy it but while maintaining it to labor peacefully in every nation protected by it for the equilibrium of economical forces The last line of the book evidently written to check imperial ambition is Humanity wants no more war In eighteen sixty one after Garibaldi s expedition and the battle of Castelfidardo Proudhon immediately saw that the establishment of Italian unity would be a severe blow to European equilibrium It was chiefly in order to maintain this equilibrium that he pronounced so energetically in favor of Italian federation even though it should be at first only a federation of monarchs In vain was it objected that in being established by France Italian unity would break European equilibrium in our favor Proudhon appealing to history showed that every State which breaks the equilibrium in its own favor only causes the other States to combine against it and thereby diminishes its influence and power He added that nations being essentially selfish Italy would not fail when opportunity offered to place her interest above her gratitude To maintain European equilibrium by diminishing great States and multiplying small ones to unite the latter in organized federations not for attack but for defence and with these federations which if they were not republican already would quickly become so to hold in check the great military monarchies such in the beginning of eighteen sixty one was the political programme of Proudhon The object of the federations he said will be to guarantee as far as possible the beneficent reign of peace and they will have the further effect of securing in every nation the triumph of liberty over despotism Where the largest unitary State is there liberty is in the greatest danger further if this State be democratic despotism without the counterpoise of majorities is to be feared With the federation it is not so The universal suffrage of the federal State is checked by the universal suffrage of the federated States and the latter is offset in its turn by PROPERTY the stronghold of liberty which it tends not to destroy but to balance with the institutions of MUTUALISM All these ideas and many others which were only hinted at in his work on War and Peace were developed by Proudhon in his subsequent publications one of which has for its motto Reforms always Utopias never The thinker had evidently finished his evolution The Council of State of the canton of Vaud having offered prizes for essays on the question of taxation previously discussed at a congress held at Lausanne Proudhon entered the ranks and carried off the first prize His memoir was published in eighteen sixty one under the title of The Theory of Taxation About the same time he wrote at Brussels in L Office de Publicite some remarkable articles on the question of literary property which was discussed at a congress held in Belgium These articles must not be confounded with Literary Majorats a more complete work on the same subject which was published in eighteen sixty three soon after his return to France Arbitrarily excepted from the amnesty in eighteen fifty nine Proudhon was pardoned two years later by a special act He did not wish to take advantage of this favor and seemed resolved to remain in Belgium until the twod of June eighteen sixty three the time when he was to acquire the privilege of prescription when an absurd and ridiculous riot excited in Brussels by an article published by him on federation and unity in Italy induced him to hasten his return to France Stones were thrown against the house in which he lived in the Faubourg d Ixelles After having placed his wife and daughters in safety among his friends at Brussels he arrived in Paris in September eighteen sixty two and published there Federation and Italian Unity a pamphlet which naturally commences with the article which served as a pretext for the rioters in Brussels Among the works begun by Proudhon while in Belgium which death did not allow him to finish we ought to mention a History of Poland which will be published later and The Theory of Property which appeared in eighteen sixty five before The Gospels Annotated and after the volume entitled The Principle of Art and its Social Destiny The publications of Proudhon in eighteen sixty three were one Literary Majorats An Examination of a Bill having for its object the Creation of a Perpetual Monopoly for the Benefit of Authors Inventors and Artists two The Federative Principle and the Necessity of Re establishing the Revolutionary party three The Sworn Democrats and the Refractories four Whether the Treaties of eighteen fifteen have ceased to exist Acts of the Future Congress The disease which was destined to kill him grew worse and worse but Proudhon labored constantly A series of articles published in eighteen sixty four in Le Messager de Paris have been collected in a pamphlet under the title of New Observations on Italian Unity He hoped to publish during the same year his work on The Political Capacity of the Working Classes but was unable to write the last chapter He grew weaker continually His doctor prescribed rest In the month of August he went to Franche Comte where he spent a month Having returned to Paris he resumed his labor with difficulty From the month of December onwards the heart disease made rapid progress the oppression became insupportable his legs were swollen and he could not sleep On the nineteenth of January eighteen sixty five he died towards two o clock in the morning in the arms of his wife his sister in law and the friend who writes these lines The publication of his correspondence to which his daughter Catherine is faithfully devoted will tend no doubt to increase his reputation as a thinker as a writer and as an honest man J A LANGLOIS PREFACE 
6880_216547_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The following letter served as a preface to the first edition of this memoir 
none	none	To the Members of the Academy of Besancon PARIS June thirty eighteen forty
6880_216547_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 GENTLEMEN In the course of your debate of the ninth of May eighteen thirty three in regard to the triennial pension established by Madame Suard you expressed the following wish 
none	none	The Academy requests the titulary to present it annually during the first fortnight in July with a succinct and logical statement of the various studies which he has pursued during the year which has just expired
6880_216547_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I now propose gentlemen to discharge this duty 
none	none	When I solicited your votes I boldly avowed my intention to bend my efforts to the discovery of some means of AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES This idea foreign as it may have seemed to the object of my candidacy you received favorably and by the precious distinction with which it has been your pleasure to honor me you changed this formal offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation 
6880_216547_000013_000002	train-clean-100	Thenceforth I understood with how worthy and honorable a society I had to deal my regard for its enlightenment my recognition of its benefits my enthusiasm for its glory were unbounded 
none	none	Convinced at once that in order to break loose from the beaten paths of opinions and systems it was necessary to proceed in my study of man and society by scientific methods and in a rigorous manner I devoted one year to philology and grammar linguistics or the natural history of speech being of all the sciences that which was best suited to the character of my mind seemed to bear the closest relation to the researches which I was about to commence A treatise written at this period upon one of the most interesting questions of comparative grammar two if it did not reveal the astonishing success at least bore witness to the thoroughness of my labors
6880_216547_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Since that time metaphysics and moral science have been my only studies my perception of the fact that these sciences though badly defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere are like the natural sciences susceptible of demonstration and certainty has already rewarded my efforts 
6880_216547_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 But gentlemen of all the masters whom I have followed to none do I owe so much as to you 
6880_216547_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Your company operation your programmes your instructions in agreement with my secret wishes and most cherished hopes have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point out my road this memoir on property is the child of your thought 
6880_216547_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 In eighteen thirty eight the Academy of Besancon proposed the following question TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION 
6880_216547_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Thereby it asked in less general terms what was the cause of the social evil and what was its remedy 
6880_216547_000018_000001	train-clean-100	You admitted that yourselves gentlemen when your committee reported that the competitors had enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular causes of suicide as well as the means of preventing each of them but that from this enumeration chronicled with more or less skill no positive information had been gained either as to the primary cause of the evil or as to its remedy 
6880_216547_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 In eighteen thirty nine your programme always original and varied in its academical expression became more exact 
6880_216547_000019_000001	train-clean-100	The investigations of eighteen thirty eight had pointed out as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the social malady the neglect of the principles of religion and morality the desire for wealth the passion for enjoyment and political disturbances 
none	none	All these data were embodied by you in a single proposition THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION
6880_216547_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 In a Christian tongue you asked gentlemen what was the true system of society 
none	none	A competitor three dared to maintain and believed that he had proved that the institution of a day of rest at weekly intervals is inseparably bound up with a political system based on the equality of conditions that without equality this institution is an anomaly and an impossibility that equality alone can revive this ancient and mysterious keeping of the seventh day 
6880_216547_000020_000002	train-clean-100	This argument did not meet with your approbation since without denying the relation pointed out by the competitor you judged and rightly gentlemen that the principle of equality of conditions not being demonstrated the ideas of the author were nothing more than hypotheses 
6880_216547_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Finally gentlemen this fundamental principle of equality you presented for competition in the following terms THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN 
6880_216547_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Instead of confining one to common places without breadth or significance it seems to me that your question should be developed as follows 
none	none	If the law has been able to render the right of heredity common to all the children of one father can it not render it equal for all his grandchildren and great grandchildren If the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the family can it not by the right of heredity cease to heed it in the race in the tribe in the nation
6880_216547_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Can equality by the right of succession be preserved between citizens as well as between cousins and brothers 
6880_216547_000025_000001	train-clean-100	In a word can the principle of succession become a principle of equality 
6880_216547_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 To sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question What is the principle of heredity 
none	none	What are the foundations of inequality What is property
6880_216547_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Such gentlemen is the object of the memoir that I offer you to day 
none	none	If I have rightly grasped the object of your thought if I succeed in bringing to light a truth which is indisputable but from causes which I am bold enough to claim to have explained has always been misunderstood if by an infallible method of investigation I establish the dogma of equality of conditions if I determine the principle of civil law the essence of justice and the form of society if I annihilate property forever to you gentlemen will redound all the glory for it is to your aid and your inspiration that I owe it
6880_216547_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 My purpose in this work is the application of method to the problems of philosophy every other intention is foreign to and even abusive of it 
6880_216547_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 I have spoken lightly of jurisprudence I had the right but I should be unjust did I not distinguish between this pretended science and the men who practise it 
none	none	Devoted to studies both laborious and severe entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow citizens by their knowledge and eloquence our legists deserve but one reproach that of an excessive deference to arbitrary laws
6880_216547_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 I have been pitiless in my criticism of the economists for them I confess that in general I have no liking 
none	none	The arrogance and the emptiness of their writings their impertinent pride and their unwarranted blunders have disgusted me 
6880_216547_000031_000002	train-clean-100	Whoever knowing them pardons them may read them 
6880_216547_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 I have severely blamed the learned Christian Church it was my duty This blame results from the facts which I call attention to why has the Church decreed concerning things which it does not understand 
6880_216547_000032_000001	train-clean-100	The Church has erred in dogma and in morals physics and mathematics testify against her 
6880_216547_000032_000002	train-clean-100	It may be wrong for me to say it but surely it is unfortunate for Christianity that it is true 
6880_216547_000032_000003	train-clean-100	To restore religion gentlemen it is necessary to condemn the Church 
6880_216547_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Perhaps you will regret gentlemen that in giving all my attention to method and evidence I have too much neglected form and style in vain should I have tried to do better 
6880_216547_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Literary hope and faith I have none The nineteenth century is in my eyes a genesic era in which new principles are elaborated but in which nothing that is written shall endure 
6880_216547_000033_000002	train-clean-100	That is the reason in my opinion why among so many men of talent France to day counts not one great writer 
6880_216547_000033_000003	train-clean-100	In a society like ours to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism 
6880_216547_000033_000004	train-clean-100	Of what use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of birth Pitiable actors in a tragedy nearing its end that which it behooves us to do is to precipitate the catastrophe 
6880_216547_000033_000005	train-clean-100	The most deserving among us is he who plays best this part 
6880_216547_000033_000006	train-clean-100	Well I no longer aspire to this sad success 
none	none	Why should I not confess it gentlemen 
6880_216547_000034_000001	train-clean-100	I have aspired to your suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner hating all which exists and full of projects for its destruction I shall finish this investigation in a spirit of calm and philosophical resignation 
6880_216547_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 your pensioner 
none	none	hating all which exists and full of projects for its destruction I shall finish this investigation in a spirit of calm and philosophical resignation I have derived more peace from the knowledge of the truth than anger from the feeling of oppression and the most precious fruit that I could wish to gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and its cause and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm My hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded perhaps at times I have been guilty in my indignation of confounding persons and things at present I can only despise and complain to cease to hate I only needed to know

6880_216547_000040_000000	train-clean-100	Two months after the receipt of this letter the Academy in its debate of August twenty fourth replied to the address of its pensioner by a note the text of which I give below 
none	none	A member calls the attention of the Academy to a pamphlet published last June by the titulary of the Suard pension entitled What is property and dedicated by the author to the Academy 
6880_216547_000041_000001	train-clean-100	He is of the opinion that the society owes it to justice to example and to its own dignity to publicly disavow all responsibility for the anti social doctrines contained in this publication 
none	none	In consequence he demands one That the Academy disavow and condemn in the most formal manner the work of the Suard pensioner as having been published without its assent and as attributing to it opinions diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members two 
6880_216547_000043_000001	train-clean-100	That the pensioner be charged in case he should publish a second edition of his book to omit the dedication 
none	none	three That this judgment of the Academy be placed upon the records
6880_216547_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 These three propositions put to vote are adopted 
none	none	After this ludicrous decree which its authors thought to render powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction I can only beg the reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our Academy While my patrons in the social and political sciences were fulminating anathemas against my brochure a man who was a stranger to Franche Comte who did not know me who might even have regarded himself as personally attacked by the too sharp judgment which I had passed upon the economists a publicist as learned as he was modest loved by the people whose sorrows he felt honored by the power which he sought to enlighten without flattering or disgracing it M Blanqui member of the Institute professor of political economy defender of property took up my defence before his associates and before the ministry and saved me from the blows of a justice which is always blind because it is always ignorant It seems to me that the reader will peruse with pleasure the letter which M Blanqui did me the honor to write to me upon the publication of my second memoir a letter as honorable to its author as it is flattering to him to whom it is addressed
6880_216547_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 PARIS May one eighteen forty one 
8534_216567_000006_000000	train-clean-360	MONSIEUR 
none	none	I hasten to thank you for forwarding to me your second memoir 
8534_216567_000039_000005	train-clean-360	upon property 
none	none	I have read it with all the interest that an acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire 
6880_216547_000050_000002	train-clean-100	I am very glad that you have modified somewhat the rudeness of form which gave to a work of such gravity the manner and appearance of a pamphlet for you quite frightened me sir and your talent was needed to reassure me in regard to your intentions 
none	none	One does not expend so much real knowledge with the purpose of inflaming his country 
6880_216547_000050_000004	train-clean-100	This proposition now coming into notice PROPERTY IS ROBBERY was of a nature to repel from your book even those serious minds who do not judge by appearances had you persisted in maintaining it in its rude simplicity 
6880_216547_000050_000005	train-clean-100	But if you have softened the form you are none the less faithful to the ground work of your doctrines and although you have done me the honor to give me a share in this perilous teaching I cannot accept a partnership which as far as talent goes would surely be a credit to me but which would compromise me in all other respects 
6880_216547_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 I agree with you in one thing only namely that all kinds of property get too frequently abused in this world 
6880_216547_000051_000001	train-clean-100	But I do not reason from the abuse to the abolition an heroic remedy too much like death which cures all evils 
6880_216547_000051_000002	train-clean-100	I will go farther I will confess that of all abuses the most hateful to me are those of property but once more there is a remedy for this evil without violating it all the more without destroying it 
6880_216547_000051_000003	train-clean-100	If the present laws allow abuse we can reconstruct them Our civil code is not the Koran it is not wrong to examine it 
6880_216547_000051_000004	train-clean-100	Change then the laws which govern the use of property but be sparing of anathemas for logically where is the honest man whose hands are entirely clean 
6880_216547_000051_000005	train-clean-100	Do you think that one can be a robber without knowing it without wishing it without suspecting it 
none	none	Do you not admit that society in its present state like every man has in its constitution all kinds of virtues and vices inherited from our ancestors 
6880_216547_000051_000007	train-clean-100	Is property then in your eyes a thing so simple and so abstract that you can re knead and equalize it if I may so speak in your metaphysical mill 
none	none	One who has said as many excellent and practical things as occur in these two beautiful and paradoxical improvisations of yours cannot be a pure and unwavering utopist You are too well acquainted with the economical and academical phraseology to play with the hard words of revolutions 
6880_216547_000051_000010	train-clean-100	I believe then that you have handled property as Rousseau eighty years ago handled letters with a magnificent and poetical display of wit and knowledge 
6880_216547_000051_000011	train-clean-100	Such at least is my opinion 
none	none	That is what I said to the Institute at the time when I presented my report upon your book I knew that they wished to proceed against you in the courts you perhaps do not know by how narrow a chance I succeeded in preventing them five What chagrin I should always have felt if the king s counsel that is to say the intellectual executioner had followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person I actually passed two terrible nights and I succeeded in restraining the secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical dissertation and not the manifesto of an incendiary Your style is too lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest questions of our social order use paving stones as their weapons 
6880_216547_000052_000005	train-clean-100	But see to it sir that ere long they do not come in spite of you to seek for ammunition in this formidable arsenal and that your vigorous metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophist of the market place who might discuss the question in the presence of a starving audience we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration 
6880_216547_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 I feel as deeply as you sir the abuses which you point out but I have so great an affection for order not that common and strait laced order with which the police are satisfied but the majestic and imposing order of human societies that I sometimes find myself embarrassed in attacking certain abuses 
none	none	I like to rebuild with one hand when I am compelled to destroy with the other 
6880_216547_000053_000002	train-clean-100	In pruning an old tree we guard against destruction of the buds and fruit 
6880_216547_000053_000003	train-clean-100	You know that as well as any one 
none	none	You are a wise and learned man you have a thoughtful mind 
6880_216547_000053_000005	train-clean-100	The terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are strong enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your intentions but you conclude in favor of the abolition of property 
6880_216547_000053_000006	train-clean-100	You wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind you attack the paternal sentiment in its sweetest illusions with one word you arrest the formation of capital and we build henceforth upon the sand instead of on a rock 
6880_216547_000053_000007	train-clean-100	That I cannot agree to and for that reason I have criticised your book so full of beautiful pages so brilliant with knowledge and fervor 
6880_216547_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 I wish sir that my impaired health would permit me to examine with you page by page the memoir which you have done me the honor to address to me publicly and personally I think I could offer some important criticisms 
6880_216547_000054_000001	train-clean-100	For the moment I must content myself with thanking you for the kind words in which you have seen fit to speak of me 
6880_216547_000054_000002	train-clean-100	We each possess the merit of sincerity I desire also the merit of prudence 
none	none	You know how deep seated is the disease under which the working people are suffering I know how many noble hearts beat under those rude garments and I feel an irresistible and fraternal sympathy with the thousands of brave people who rise early in the morning to labor to pay their taxes and to make our country strong 
6880_216547_000054_000004	train-clean-100	I try to serve and enlighten them whereas some endeavor to mislead them 
6880_216547_000054_000005	train-clean-100	You have not written directly for them 
6880_216547_000054_000006	train-clean-100	You have issued two magnificent manifestoes the second more guarded than the first issue a third more guarded than the second and you will take high rank in science whose first precept is calmness and impartiality 
6880_216547_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Farewell sir 
none	none	No man s esteem for another can exceed mine for you BLANQUI I should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent letter but I confess that I am more inclined to realize the prediction with which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of my antagonists 
6880_216547_000057_000001	train-clean-100	So much controversy fatigues and wearies me 
none	none	The intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in battle it is intelligence wasted M Blanqui acknowledges that property is abused in many harmful ways I call PROPERTY the sum these abuses exclusively To each of us property seems a polygon whose angles need knocking off but the operation performed M Blanqui maintains that the figure will still be a polygon an hypothesis admitted in mathematics although not proven while I consider that this figure will be a circle 
6880_216547_000057_000005	train-clean-100	Honest people can at least understand one another 
none	none	For the rest I allow that in the present state of the question the mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition of property 
6880_216547_000058_000001	train-clean-100	To gain the victory for one s cause it does not suffice simply to overthrow a principle generally recognized which has the indisputable merit of systematically recapitulating our political theories it is also necessary to establish the opposite principle and to formulate the system which must proceed from it 
6880_216547_000058_000002	train-clean-100	Still further it is necessary to show the method by which the new system will satisfy all the moral and political needs which induced the establishment of the first 
6880_216547_000058_000003	train-clean-100	On the following conditions then of subsequent evidence depends the correctness of my preceding arguments 
none	none	The discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing institutions save property or the sum of the abuses of property not only may find a place but may themselves serve as instruments of equality individual liberty the division of power the public ministry the jury system administrative and judicial organization the unity and completeness of instruction marriage the family heredity in direct and collateral succession the right of sale and exchange the right to make a will and even birthright a system which better than property guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage of all which from a superior point of view explains corrects and completes the theories of association hitherto proposed from Plato and Pythagoras to Babeuf Saint Simon and Fourier a system finally which serving as a means of transition is immediately applicable A work so vast requires I am aware the united efforts of twenty Montesquieus nevertheless if it is not given to a single man to finish a single one can commence the enterprise The road that he shall traverse will suffice to show the end and assure the result WHAT IS PROPERTY OR AN INQUIRY INTO THE PRINCIPLE OF RIGHT AND OF GOVERNMENT FIRST MEMOIR Adversus hostem aeterna auctertas esto Against the enemy revendication is eternal LAW OF THE TWELVE TABLES CHAPTER I METHOD PURSUED IN THIS WORK THE IDEA OF A REVOLUTION If I were asked to answer the following question WHAT IS SLAVERY and I should answer in one word IT IS MURDER my meaning would be understood at once No extended argument would be required to show that the power to take from a man his thought his will his personality is a power of life and death and that to enslave a man is to kill him Why then to this other question WHAT IS PROPERTY may I not likewise answer IT IS ROBBERY without the certainty of being misunderstood the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first I undertake to discuss the vital principle of our government and our institutions property I am in my right I may be mistaken in the conclusion which shall result from my investigations I am in my right I think best to place the last thought of my book first still am I in my right Such an author teaches that property is a civil right born of occupation and sanctioned by law another maintains that it is a natural right originating in labor and both of these doctrines totally opposed as they may seem are encouraged and applauded I contend that neither labor nor occupation nor law can create property that it is an effect without a cause am I censurable But murmurs arise PROPERTY IS ROBBERY That is the war cry of ninety three That is the signal of revolutions Reader calm yourself I am no agent of discord no firebrand of sedition I anticipate history by a few days I disclose a truth whose development we may try in vain to arrest I write the preamble of our future constitution This proposition which seems to you blasphemous PROPERTY IS ROBBERY would if our prejudices allowed us to consider it be recognized as the lightning rod to shield us from the coming thunderbolt but too many interests stand in the way Alas philosophy will not change the course of events destiny will fulfill itself regardless of prophecy Besides must not justice be done and our education be finished PROPERTY IS ROBBERY What a revolution in human ideas PROPRIETOR and ROBBER have been at all times expressions as contradictory as the beings whom they designate are hostile all languages have perpetuated this opposition On what authority then do you venture to attack universal consent and give the lie to the human race Who are you that you should question the judgment of the nations and the ages Of what consequence to you reader is my obscure individuality I live like you in a century in which reason submits only to fact and to evidence My name like yours is TRUTH SEEKER six My mission is written in these words of the law SPEAK WITHOUT HATRED AND WITHOUT FEAR TELL THAT WHICH THOU KNOWEST The work of our race is to build the temple of science and this science includes man and Nature Now truth reveals itself to all to day to Newton and Pascal tomorrow to the herdsman in the valley and the journeyman in the shop Each one contributes his stone to the edifice and his task accomplished disappears Eternity precedes us eternity follows us between two infinites of what account is one poor mortal that the century should inquire about him Disregard then reader my title and my character and attend only to my arguments It is in accordance with universal consent that I undertake to correct universal error from the OPINION of the human race I appeal to its FAITH Have the courage to follow me and if your will is untrammelled if your conscience is free if your mind can unite two propositions and deduce a third therefrom my ideas will inevitably become yours In beginning by giving you my last word it was my purpose to warn you not to defy you for I am certain that if you read me you will be compelled to assent The things of which I am to speak are so simple and clear that you will be astonished at not having perceived them before and you will say I have neglected to think Others offer you the spectacle of genius wresting Nature s secrets from her and unfolding before you her sublime messages you will find here only a series of experiments upon JUSTICE and RIGHT a sort of verification of the weights and measures of your conscience The operations shall be conducted under your very eyes and you shall weigh the result Nevertheless I build no system I ask an end to privilege the abolition of slavery equality of rights and the reign of law Justice nothing else that is the alpha and omega of my argument to others I leave the business of governing the world One day I asked myself Why is there so much sorrow and misery in society Must man always be wretched And not satisfied with the explanations given by the reformers these attributing the general distress to governmental cowardice and incapacity those to conspirators and emeutes still others to ignorance and general corruption and weary of the interminable quarrels of the tribune and the press I sought to fathom the matter myself I have consulted the masters of science I have read a hundred volumes of philosophy law political economy and history would to God that I had lived in a century in which so much reading had been useless I have made every effort to obtain exact information comparing doctrines replying to objections continually constructing equations and reductions from arguments and weighing thousands of syllogisms in the scales of the most rigorous logic In this laborious work I have collected many interesting facts which I shall share with my friends and the public as soon as I have leisure But I must say that I recognized at once that we had never understood the meaning of these words so common and yet so sacred JUSTICE EQUITY LIBERTY that concerning each of these principles our ideas have been utterly obscure and in fact that this ignorance was the sole cause both of the poverty that devours us and of all the calamities that have ever afflicted the human race My mind was frightened by this strange result I doubted my reason What said I that which eye has not seen nor ear heard nor insight penetrated you have discovered Wretch mistake not the visions of your diseased brain for the truths of science Do you not know great philosophers have said so that in points of practical morality universal error is a contradiction I resolved then to test my arguments and in entering upon this new labor I sought an answer to the following questions Is it possible that humanity can have been so long and so universally mistaken in the application of moral principles How and why could it be mistaken How can its error being universal be capable of correction These questions on the solution of which depended the certainty of my conclusions offered no lengthy resistance to analysis It will be seen in chapter V of this work that in morals as in all other branches of knowledge the gravest errors are the dogmas of science that even in works of justice to be mistaken is a privilege which ennobles man and that whatever philosophical merit may attach to me is infinitely small To name a thing is easy the difficulty is to discern it before its appearance In giving expression to the last stage of an idea an idea which permeates all minds which to morrow will be proclaimed by another if I fail to announce it to day I can claim no merit save that of priority of utterance Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the dawn Yes all men believe and repeat that equality of conditions is identical with equality of rights that PROPERTY and ROBBERY are synonymous terms that every social advantage accorded or rather usurped in the name of superior talent or service is iniquity and extortion All men in their hearts I say bear witness to these truths they need only to be made to understand it Before entering directly upon the question before me I must say a word of the road that I shall traverse When Pascal approached a geometrical problem he invented a method of solution to solve a problem in philosophy a method is equally necessary Well by how much do the problems of which philosophy treats surpass in the gravity of their results those discussed by geometry How much more imperatively then do they demand for their solution a profound and rigorous analysis It is a fact placed for ever beyond doubt say the modern psychologists that every perception received by the mind is determined by certain general laws which govern the mind is moulded so to speak in certain types pre existing in our understanding and which constitutes its original condition Hence say they if the mind has no innate IDEAS it has at least innate FORMS Thus for example every phenomenon is of necessity conceived by us as happening in TIME and SPACE that compels us to infer a CAUSE of its occurrence every thing which exists implies the ideas of SUBSTANCE MODE RELATION NUMBER C in a word we form no idea which is not related to some one of the general principles of reason independent of which nothing exists These axioms of the understanding add the psychologists these fundamental types by which all our judgments and ideas are inevitably shaped and which our sensations serve only to illuminate are known in the schools as CATEGORIES Their primordial existence in the mind is to day demonstrated they need only to be systematized and catalogued Aristotle recognized ten Kant increased the number to fifteen M Cousin has reduced it to three to two to one and the indisputable glory of this professor will be due to the fact that if he has not discovered the true theory of categories he has at least seen more clearly than any one else the vast importance of this question the greatest and perhaps the only one with which metaphysics has to deal I confess that I disbelieve in the innateness not only of IDEAS but also of FORMS or LAWS of our understanding and I hold the metaphysics of Reid and Kant to be still farther removed from the truth than that of Aristotle However as I do not wish to enter here into a discussion of the mind a task which would demand much labor and be of no interest to the public I shall admit the hypothesis that our most general and most necessary ideas such as time space substance and cause exist originally in the mind or at least are derived immediately from its constitution But it is a psychological fact none the less true and one to which the philosophers have paid too little attention that habit like a second nature has the power of fixing in the mind new categorical forms derived from the appearances which impress us and by them usually stripped of objective reality but whose influence over our judgments is no less predetermining than that of the original categories Hence we reason by the ETERNAL and ABSOLUTE laws of our mind and at the same time by the secondary rules ordinarily faulty which are suggested to us by imperfect observation This is the most fecund source of false prejudices and the permanent and often invincible cause of a multitude of errors The bias resulting from these prejudices is so strong that often even when we are fighting against a principle which our mind thinks false which is repugnant to our reason and which our conscience disapproves we defend it without knowing it we reason in accordance with it and we obey it while attacking it Enclosed within a circle our mind revolves about itself until a new observation creating within us new ideas brings to view an external principle which delivers us from the phantom by which our imagination is possessed Thus we know to day that by the laws of a universal magnetism whose cause is still unknown two bodies no obstacle intervening tend to unite by an accelerated impelling force which we call GRAVITATION It is gravitation which causes unsupported bodies to fall to the ground which gives them weight and which fastens us to the earth on which we live Ignorance of this cause was the sole obstacle which prevented the ancients from believing in the antipodes Can you not see said saint Augustine after Lactantius that if there were men under our feet their heads would point downward and that they would fall into the sky The bishop of Hippo who thought the earth flat because it appeared so to the eye supposed in consequence that if we should connect by straight lines the zenith with the nadir in different places these lines would be parallel with each other and in the direction of these lines he traced every movement from above to below Thence he naturally concluded that the stars were rolling torches set in the vault of the sky that if left to themselves they would fall to the earth in a shower of fire that the earth was one vast plain forming the lower portion of the world c If he had been asked by what the world itself was sustained he would have answered that he did not know but that to God nothing is impossible Such were the ideas of saint Augustine in regard to space and movement ideas fixed within him by a prejudice derived from an appearance and which had become with him a general and categorical rule of judgment Of the reason why bodies fall his mind knew nothing he could only say that a body falls because it falls With us the idea of a fall is more complex to the general ideas of space and movement which it implies we add that of attraction or direction towards a centre which gives us the higher idea of cause But if physics has fully corrected our judgment in this respect we still make use of the prejudice of saint Augustine and when we say that a thing has FALLEN we do not mean simply and in general that there has been an effect of gravitation but specially and in particular that it is towards the earth and FROM ABOVE TO BELOW that this movement has taken place Our mind is enlightened in vain the imagination prevails and our language remains forever incorrigible To DESCEND FROM HEAVEN is as incorrect an expression as to MOUNT TO HEAVEN and yet this expression will live as long as men use language All these phrases FROM ABOVE TO BELOW TO DESCEND FROM HEAVEN TO FALL FROM THE CLOUDS C are henceforth harmless because we know how to rectify them in practice but let us deign to consider for a moment how much they have retarded the progress of science If indeed it be a matter of little importance to statistics mechanics hydrodynamics and ballistics that the true cause of the fall of bodies should be known and that our ideas of the general movements in space should be exact it is quite otherwise when we undertake to explain the system of the universe the cause of tides the shape of the earth and its position in the heavens to understand these things we must leave the circle of appearances In all ages there have been ingenious mechanicians excellent architects skilful artillerymen any error into which it was possible for them to fall in regard to the rotundity of the earth and gravitation in no wise retarded the development of their art the solidity of their buildings and accuracy of their aim was not affected by it But sooner or later they were forced to grapple with phenomena which the supposed parallelism of all perpendiculars erected from the earth s surface rendered inexplicable then also commenced a struggle between the prejudices which for centuries had sufficed in daily practice and the unprecedented opinions which the testimony of the eyes seemed to contradict Thus on the one hand the falsest judgments whether based on isolated facts or only on appearances always embrace some truths whose sphere whether large or small affords room for a certain number of inferences beyond which we fall into absurdity The ideas of saint Augustine for example contained the following truths that bodies fall towards the earth that they fall in a straight line that either the sun or the earth moves that either the sky or the earth turns c These general facts always have been true our science has added nothing to them But on the other hand it being necessary to account for every thing we are obliged to seek for principles more and more comprehensive that is why we have had to abandon successively first the opinion that the world was flat then the theory which regards it as the stationary centre of the universe c If we pass now from physical nature to the moral world we still find ourselves subject to the same deceptions of appearance to the same influences of spontaneity and habit But the distinguishing feature of this second division of our knowledge is on the one hand the good or the evil which we derive from our opinions and on the other the obstinacy with which we defend the prejudice which is tormenting and killing us Whatever theory we embrace in regard to the shape of the earth and the cause of its weight the physics of the globe does not suffer and as for us our social economy can derive therefrom neither profit nor damage But it is in us and through us that the laws of our moral nature work now these laws cannot be executed without our deliberate aid and consequently unless we know them If then our science of moral laws is false it is evident that while desiring our own good we are accomplishing our own evil if it is only incomplete it may suffice for a time for our social progress but in the long run it will lead us into a wrong road and will finally precipitate us into an abyss of calamities Then it is that we need to exercise our highest judgments and be it said to our glory they are never found wanting but then also commences a furious struggle between old prejudices and new ideas Days of conflagration and anguish We are told of the time when with the same beliefs with the same institutions all the world seemed happy why complain of these beliefs why banish these institutions We are slow to admit that that happy age served the precise purpose of developing the principle of evil which lay dormant in society we accuse men and gods the powers of earth and the forces of Nature Instead of seeking the cause of the evil in his mind and heart man blames his masters his rivals his neighbors and himself nations arm themselves and slay and exterminate each other until equilibrium is restored by the vast depopulation and peace again arises from the ashes of the combatants So loath is humanity to touch the customs of its ancestors and to change the laws framed by the founders of communities and confirmed by the faithful observance of the ages Nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est Distrust all innovations wrote Titus Livius Undoubtedly it would be better were man not compelled to change but what because he is born ignorant because he exists only on condition of gradual self instruction must he abjure the light abdicate his reason and abandon himself to fortune Perfect health is better than convalescence should the sick man therefore refuse to be cured Reform reform cried ages since John the Baptist and Jesus Christ Reform reform cried our fathers fifty years ago and for a long time to come we shall shout Reform reform Seeing the misery of my age I said to myself Among the principles that support society there is one which it does not understand which its ignorance has vitiated and which causes all the evil that exists This principle is the most ancient of all for it is a characteristic of revolutions to tear down the most modern principles and to respect those of long standing Now the evil by which we suffer is anterior to all revolutions This principle impaired by our ignorance is honored and cherished for if it were not cherished it would harm nobody it would be without influence But this principle right in its purpose but misunderstood this principle as old as humanity what is it Can it be religion All men believe in God this dogma belongs at once to their conscience and their mind To humanity God is a fact as primitive an idea as inevitable a principle as necessary as are the categorical ideas of cause substance time and space to our understanding God is proven to us by the conscience prior to any inference of the mind just as the sun is proven to us by the testimony of the senses prior to all the arguments of physics We discover phenomena and laws by observation and experience only this deeper sense reveals to us existence Humanity believes that God is but in believing in God what does it believe In a word what is God The nature of this notion of Divinity this primitive universal notion born in the race the human mind has not yet fathomed At each step that we take in our investigation of Nature and of causes the idea of God is extended and exalted the farther science advances the more God seems to grow and broaden Anthropomorphism and idolatry constituted of necessity the faith of the mind in its youth the theology of infancy and poesy A harmless error if they had not endeavored to make it a rule of conduct and if they had been wise enough to respect the liberty of thought But having made God in his own image man wished to appropriate him still farther not satisfied with disfiguring the Almighty he treated him as his patrimony his goods his possessions God pictured in monstrous forms became throughout the world the property of man and of the State Such was the origin of the corruption of morals by religion and the source of pious feuds and holy wars Thank Heaven we have learned to allow every one his own beliefs we seek for moral laws outside the pale of religion Instead of legislating as to the nature and attributes of God the dogmas of theology and the destiny of our souls we wisely wait for science to tell us what to reject and what to accept God soul religion eternal objects of our unwearied thought and our most fatal aberrations terrible problems whose solution for ever attempted for ever remains unaccomplished concerning all these questions we may still be mistaken but at least our error is harmless With liberty in religion and the separation of the spiritual from the temporal power the influence of religious ideas upon the progress of society is purely negative no law no political or civil institution being founded on religion Neglect of duties imposed by religion may increase the general corruption but it is not the primary cause it is only an auxiliary or result It is universally admitted and especially in the matter which now engages our attention that the cause of the inequality of conditions among men of pauperism of universal misery and of governmental embarrassments can no longer be traced to religion we must go farther back and dig still deeper But what is there in man older and deeper than the religious sentiment There is man himself that is volition and conscience free will and law eternally antagonistic Man is at war with himself why Man say the theologians transgressed in the beginning our race is guilty of an ancient offence For this transgression humanity has fallen error and ignorance have become its sustenance Read history you will find universal proof of this necessity for evil in the permanent misery of nations Man suffers and always will suffer his disease is hereditary and constitutional Use palliatives employ emollients there is no remedy Nor is this argument peculiar to the theologians we find it expressed in equivalent language in the philosophical writings of the materialists believers in infinite perfectibility Destutt de Tracy teaches formally that poverty crime and war are the inevitable conditions of our social state necessary evils against which it would be folly to revolt So call it NECESSITY OF EVIL or ORIGINAL DEPRAVITY it is at bottom the same philosophy The first man transgressed If the votaries of the Bible interpreted it faithfully they would say MAN ORIGINALLY TRANSGRESSED that is made a mistake for TO TRANSGRESS TO FAIL TO MAKE A MISTAKE all mean the same thing The consequences of Adam s transgression are inherited by the race the first is ignorance Truly the race like the individual is born ignorant but in regard to a multitude of questions even in the moral and political spheres this ignorance of the race has been dispelled who says that it will not depart altogether Mankind makes continual progress toward truth and light ever triumphs over darkness Our disease is not then absolutely incurable and the theory of the theologians is worse than inadequate it is ridiculous since it is reducible to this tautology Man errs because he errs While the true statement is this Man errs because he learns Now if man arrives at a knowledge of all that he needs to know it is reasonable to believe that ceasing to err he will cease to suffer But if we question the doctors as to this law said to be engraved upon the heart of man we shall immediately see that they dispute about a matter of which they know nothing that concerning the most important questions there are almost as many opinions as authors that we find no two agreeing as to the best form of government the principle of authority and the nature of right that all sail hap hazard upon a shoreless and bottomless sea abandoned to the guidance of their private opinions which they modestly take to be right reason And in view of this medley of contradictory opinions we say The object of our investigations is the law the determination of the social principle Now the politicians that is the social scientists do not understand each other then the error lies in themselves and as every error has a reality for its object we must look in their books to find the truth which they have unconsciously deposited there Now of what do the lawyers and the publicists treat Of JUSTICE EQUITY LIBERTY NATURAL LAW CIVIL LAWS c But what is justice What is its principle its character its formula To this question our doctors evidently have no reply for otherwise their science starting with a principle clear and well defined would quit the region of probabilities and all disputes would end What is justice The theologians answer All justice comes from God That is true but we know no more than before The philosophers ought to be better informed they have argued so much about justice and injustice Unhappily an examination proves that their knowledge amounts to nothing and that with them as with the savages whose every prayer to the sun is simply O O it is a cry of admiration love and enthusiasm but who does not know that the sun attaches little meaning to the interjection O That is exactly our position toward the philosophers in regard to justice Justice they say is a DAUGHTER OF HEAVEN A LIGHT WHICH ILLUMINES EVERY MAN THAT COMES INTO THE WORLD THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PREROGATIVE OF OUR NATURE THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE BEASTS AND LIKENS US TO GOD and a thousand other similar things What I ask does this pious litany amount to To the prayer of the savages O All the most reasonable teachings of human wisdom concerning justice are summed up in that famous adage DO UNTO OTHERS THAT WHICH YOU WOULD THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU DO NOT UNTO OTHERS THAT WHICH YOU WOULD NOT THAT OTHERS SHOULD DO UNTO YOU But this rule of moral practice is unscientific what have I a right to wish that others should do or not do to me It is of no use to tell me that my duty is equal to my right unless I am told at the same time what my right is Let us try to arrive at something more precise and positive Justice is the central star which governs societies the pole around which the political world revolves the principle and the regulator of all transactions Nothing takes place between men save in the name of RIGHT nothing without the invocation of justice Justice is not the work of the law on the contrary the law is only a declaration and application of JUSTICE in all circumstances where men are liable to come in contact If then the idea that we form of justice and right were ill defined if it were imperfect or even false it is clear that all our legislative applications would be wrong our institutions vicious our politics erroneous consequently there would be disorder and social chaos This hypothesis of the perversion of justice in our minds and as a necessary result in our acts becomes a demonstrated fact when it is shown that the opinions of men have not borne a constant relation to the notion of justice and its applications that at different periods they have undergone modifications in a word that there has been progress in ideas Now that is what history proves by the most overwhelming testimony Eighteen Hundred years ago the world under the rule of the Caesars exhausted itself in slavery superstition and voluptuousness The people intoxicated and as it were stupefied by their long continued orgies had lost the very notion of right and duty war and dissipation by turns swept them away usury and the labor of machines that is of slaves by depriving them of the means of subsistence hindered them from continuing the species Barbarism sprang up again in a hideous form from this mass of corruption and spread like a devouring leprosy over the depopulated provinces The wise foresaw the downfall of the empire but could devise no remedy What could they think indeed To save this old society it would have been necessary to change the objects of public esteem and veneration and to abolish the rights affirmed by a justice purely secular they said Rome has conquered through her politics and her gods any change in theology and public opinion would be folly and sacrilege Rome merciful toward conquered nations though binding them in chains spared their lives slaves are the most fertile source of her wealth freedom of the nations would be the negation of her rights and the ruin of her finances Rome in fact enveloped in the pleasures and gorged with the spoils of the universe is kept alive by victory and government her luxury and her pleasures are the price of her conquests she can neither abdicate nor dispossess herself Thus Rome had the facts and the law on her side Her pretensions were justified by universal custom and the law of nations Her institutions were based upon idolatry in religion slavery in the State and epicurism in private life to touch those was to shake society to its foundations and to use our modern expression to open the abyss of revolutions So the idea occurred to no one and yet humanity was dying in blood and luxury All at once a man appeared calling himself The Word of God It is not known to this day who he was whence he came nor what suggested to him his ideas He went about proclaiming everywhere that the end of the existing society was at hand that the world was about to experience a new birth that the priests were vipers the lawyers ignoramuses and the philosophers hypocrites and liars that master and slave were equals that usury and every thing akin to it was robbery that proprietors and idlers would one day burn while the poor and pure in heart would find a haven of peace This man The Word of God was denounced and arrested as a public enemy by the priests and the lawyers who well understood how to induce the people to demand his death But this judicial murder though it put the finishing stroke to their crimes did not destroy the doctrinal seeds which The Word of God had sown After his death his original disciples travelled about in all directions preaching what they called the GOOD NEWS creating in their turn millions of missionaries and when their task seemed to be accomplished dying by the sword of Roman justice This persistent agitation the war of the executioners and martyrs lasted nearly three centuries ending in the conversion of the world Idolatry was destroyed slavery abolished dissolution made room for a more austere morality and the contempt for wealth was sometimes pushed almost to privation Society was saved by the negation of its own principles by a revolution in its religion and by violation of its most sacred rights In this revolution the idea of justice spread to an extent that had not before been dreamed of never to return to its original limits Heretofore justice had existed only for the masters seven it then commenced to exist for the slaves Nevertheless the new religion at that time had borne by no means all its fruits There was a perceptible improvement of the public morals and a partial release from oppression but other than that the SEEDS SOWN BY THE SON OF MAN having fallen into idolatrous hearts had produced nothing save innumerable discords and a quasi poetical mythology Instead of developing into their practical consequences the principles of morality and government taught by The Word of God his followers busied themselves in speculations as to his birth his origin his person and his actions they discussed his parables and from the conflict of the most extravagant opinions upon unanswerable questions and texts which no one understood was born THEOLOGY which may be defined as the SCIENCE OF THE INFINITELY ABSURD The truth of CHRISTIANITY did not survive the age of the apostles the GOSPEL commented upon and symbolized by the Greeks and Latins loaded with pagan fables became literally a mass of contradictions and to this day the reign of the INFALLIBLE CHURCH has been a long era of darkness It is said that the GATES OF HELL will not always prevail that THE WORD OF GOD will return and that one day men will know truth and justice but that will be the death of Greek and Roman Catholicism just as in the light of science disappeared the caprices of opinion The monsters which the successors of the apostles were bent on destroying frightened for a moment reappeared gradually thanks to the crazy fanaticism and sometimes the deliberate connivance of priests and theologians The history of the enfranchisement of the French communes offers constantly the spectacle of the ideas of justice and liberty spreading among the people in spite of the combined efforts of kings nobles and clergy In the year seventeen eighty nine of the Christian era the French nation divided by caste poor and oppressed struggled in the triple net of royal absolutism the tyranny of nobles and parliaments and priestly intolerance There was the right of the king and the right of the priest the right of the patrician and the right of the plebeian there were the privileges of birth province communes corporations and trades and at the bottom of all violence immorality and misery For some time they talked of reformation those who apparently desired it most favoring it only for their own profit and the people who were to be the gainers expecting little and saying nothing For a long time these poor people either from distrust incredulity or despair hesitated to ask for their rights it is said that the habit of serving had taken the courage away from those old communes which in the middle ages were so bold Finally a book appeared summing up the whole matter in these two propositions WHAT IS THE THIRD ESTATE NOTHING WHAT OUGHT IT TO BE EVERY THING Some one added by way of comment WHAT IS THE KING THE SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE This was a sudden revelation the veil was torn aside a thick bandage fell from all eyes The people commenced to reason thus If the king is our servant he ought to report to us If he ought to report to us he is subject to control If he can be controlled he is responsible If he is responsible he is punishable If he is punishable he ought to be punished according to his merits If he ought to be punished according to his merits he can be punished with death Five years after the publication of the brochure of Sieyes the third estate was every thing the king the nobility the clergy were no more In seventeen ninety three the nation without stopping at the constitutional fiction of the inviolability of the sovereign conducted Louis XVI to the scaffold in eighteen thirty it accompanied Charles X to Cherbourg In each case it may have erred in fact in its judgment of the offence but in right the logic which led to its action was irreproachable The people in punishing their sovereign did precisely that which the government of July was so severely censured for failing to do when it refused to execute Louis Bonaparte after the affair of Strasburg they struck the true culprit It was an application of the common law a solemn decree of justice enforcing the penal laws eight The spirit which gave rise to the movement of eighty nine was a spirit of negation that of itself proves that the order of things which was substituted for the old system was not methodical or well considered that born of anger and hatred it could not have the effect of a science based on observation and study that its foundations in a word were not derived from a profound knowledge of the laws of Nature and society Thus the people found that the republic among the so called new institutions was acting on the very principles against which they had fought and was swayed by all the prejudices which they had intended to destroy We congratulate ourselves with inconsiderate enthusiasm on the glorious French Revolution the regeneration of seventeen eighty nine the great changes that have been effected and the reversion of institutions a delusion a delusion When our ideas on any subject material intellectual or social undergo a thorough change in consequence of new observations I call that movement of the mind REVOLUTION If the ideas are simply extended or modified there is only PROGRESS Thus the system of Ptolemy was a step in astronomical progress that of Copernicus was a revolution So in seventeen eighty nine there was struggle and progress revolution there was none An examination of the reforms which were attempted proves this The nation so long a victim of monarchical selfishness thought to deliver itself for ever by declaring that it alone was sovereign But what was monarchy The sovereignty of one man What is democracy The sovereignty of the nation or rather of the national majority But it is in both cases the sovereignty of man instead of the sovereignty of the law the sovereignty of the will instead of the sovereignty of the reason in one word the passions instead of justice Undoubtedly when a nation passes from the monarchical to the democratic state there is progress because in multiplying the sovereigns we increase the opportunities of the reason to substitute itself for the will but in reality there is no revolution in the government since the principle remains the same Now we have the proof to day that with the most perfect democracy we cannot be free nine Nor is that all The nation king cannot exercise its sovereignty itself it is obliged to delegate it to agents this is constantly reiterated by those who seek to win its favor Be these agents five ten one hundred or a thousand of what consequence is the number and what matters the name It is always the government of man the rule of will and caprice I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized We know too how this sovereignty was exercised first by the Convention then by the Directory afterwards confiscated by the Consul As for the Emperor the strong man so much adored and mourned by the nation he never wanted to be dependent on it but as if intending to set its sovereignty at defiance he dared to demand its suffrage that is its abdication the abdication of this inalienable sovereignty and he obtained it But what is sovereignty It is they say the POWER TO MAKE LAW ten Another absurdity a relic of despotism The nation had long seen kings issuing their commands in this form FOR SUCH IS OUR PLEASURE it wished to taste in its turn the pleasure of making laws For fifty years it has brought them forth by myriads always be it understood through the agency of representatives The play is far from ended The definition of sovereignty was derived from the definition of the law The law they said is THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF THE SOVEREIGN then under a monarchy the law is the expression of the will of the king in a republic the law is the expression of the will of the people Aside from the difference in the number of wills the two systems are exactly identical both share the same error namely that the law is the expression of a will it ought to be the expression of a fact Moreover they followed good leaders they took the citizen of Geneva for their prophet and the contrat social for their Koran Bias and prejudice are apparent in all the phrases of the new legislators The nation had suffered from a multitude of exclusions and privileges its representatives issued the following declaration ALL MEN ARE EQUAL BY NATURE AND BEFORE THE LAW an ambiguous and redundant declaration MEN ARE EQUAL BY NATURE does that mean that they are equal in size beauty talents and virtue No they meant then political and civil equality Then it would have been sufficient to have said ALL MEN ARE EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW But what is equality before the law Neither the constitution of seventeen ninety nor that of ninety three nor the granted charter nor the accepted charter have defined it accurately All imply an inequality in fortune and station incompatible with even a shadow of equality in rights In this respect it may be said that all our constitutions have been faithful expressions of the popular will I am going to prove it Formerly the people were excluded from civil and military offices it was considered a wonder when the following high sounding article was inserted in the Declaration of Rights All citizens are equally eligible to office free nations know no qualifications in their choice of officers save virtues and talents They certainly ought to have admired so beautiful an idea they admired a piece of nonsense Why the sovereign people legislators and reformers see in public offices to speak plainly only opportunities for pecuniary advancement And because it regards them as a source of profit it decrees the eligibility of citizens For of what use would this precaution be if there were nothing to gain by it No one would think of ordaining that none but astronomers and geographers should be pilots nor of prohibiting stutterers from acting at the theatre and the opera The nation was still aping the kings like them it wished to award the lucrative positions to its friends and flatterers Unfortunately and this last feature completes the resemblance the nation did not control the list of livings that was in the hands of its agents and representatives They on the other hand took care not to thwart the will of their gracious sovereign This edifying article of the Declaration of Rights retained in the charters of eighteen fourteen and eighteen thirty implies several kinds of civil inequality that is of inequality before the law inequality ofstation since the public functions are sought only for the consideration and emoluments which they bring inequality of wealth since if it had been desired to equalize fortunes public service would have been regarded as a duty not as a reward inequality of privilege the law not stating what it means by TALENTS and VIRTUES Under the empire virtue and talent consisted simply in military bravery and devotion to the emperor that was shown when Napoleon created his nobility and attempted to connect it with the ancients To day the man who pays taxes to the amount of two hundred francs is virtuous the talented man is the honest pickpocket such truths as these are accounted trivial The people finally legalized property God forgive them for they knew not what they did For fifty years they have suffered for their miserable folly But how came the people whose voice they tell us is the voice of God and whose conscience is infallible how came the people to err How happens it that when seeking liberty and equality they fell back into privilege and slavery Always through copying the ancient regime Formerly the nobility and the clergy contributed towards the expenses of the State only by voluntary aid and gratuitous gift their property could not be seized even for debt while the plebeian overwhelmed by taxes and statute labor was continually tormented now by the king s tax gatherers now by those of the nobles and clergy He whose possessions were subject to mortmain could neither bequeath nor inherit property he was treated like the animals whose services and offspring belong to their master by right of accession The people wanted the conditions of OWNERSHIP to be alike for all they thought that every one should ENJOY AND FREELY DISPOSE OF HIS POSSESSIONS HIS INCOME AND THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND INDUSTRY The people did not invent property but as they had not the same privileges in regard to it which the nobles and clergy possessed they decreed that the right should be exercised by all under the same conditions The more obnoxious forms of property statute labor mortmain maitrise and exclusion from public office have disappeared the conditions of its enjoyment have been modified the principle still remains the same There has been progress in the regulation of the right there has been no revolution These then are the three fundamental principles of modern society established one after another by the movements of seventeen eighty nine and eighteen thirty one SOVEREIGNTY OF THE HUMAN WILL in short DESPOTISM two INEQUALITY OF WEALTH AND RANK three PROPERTY above JUSTICE always invoked as the guardian angel of sovereigns nobles and proprietors JUSTICE the general primitive categorical law of all society We must ascertain whether the ideas of DESPOTISM CIVIL INEQUALITY and PROPERTY are in harmony with the primitive notion of JUSTICE and necessarily follow from it assuming various forms according to the condition position and relation of persons or whether they are not rather the illegitimate result of a confusion of different things a fatal association of ideas And since justice deals especially with the questions of government the condition of persons and the possession of things we must ascertain under what conditions judging by universal opinion and the progress of the human mind government is just the condition of citizens is just and the possession of things is just then striking out every thing which fails to meet these conditions the result will at once tell us what legitimate government is what the legitimate condition of citizens is and what the legitimate possession of things is and finally as the last result of the analysis what JUSTICE is Is the authority of man over man just Everybody answers No the authority of man is only the authority of the law which ought to be justice and truth The private will counts for nothing in government which consists first in discovering truth and justice in order to make the law and second in superintending the execution of this law I do not now inquire whether our constitutional form of government satisfies these conditions whether for example the will of the ministry never influences the declaration and interpretation of the law or whether our deputies in their debates are more intent on conquering by argument than by force of numbers it is enough for me that my definition of a good government is allowed to be correct This idea is exact Yet we see that nothing seems more just to the Oriental nations than the despotism of their sovereigns that with the ancients and in the opinion of the philosophers themselves slavery was just that in the middle ages the nobles the priests and the bishops felt justified in holding slaves that Louis XIV thought that he was right when he said The State I am the State and that Napoleon deemed it a crime for the State to oppose his will The idea of justice then applied to sovereignty and government has not always been what it is to day it has gone on developing and shaping itself by degrees until it has arrived at its present state But has it reached its last phase I think not only as the last obstacle to be overcome arises from the institution of property which we have kept intact in order to finish the reform in government and consummate the revolution this very institution we must attack Is political and civil inequality just Some say yes others no To the first I would reply that when the people abolished all privileges of birth and caste they did it in all probability because it was for their advantage why then do they favor the privileges of fortune more than those of rank and race Because say they political inequality is a result of property and without property society is impossible thus the question just raised becomes a question of property To the second I content myself with this remark If you wish to enjoy political equality abolish property otherwise why do you complain Is property just Everybody answers without hesitation Yes property is just I say everybody for up to the present time no one who thoroughly understood the meaning of his words has answered no For it is no easy thing to reply understandingly to such a question only time and experience can furnish an answer Now this answer is given it is for us to understand it I undertake to prove it We are to proceed with the demonstration in the following order I We dispute not at all we refute nobody we deny nothing we accept as sound all the arguments alleged in favor of property and confine ourselves to a search for its principle in order that we may then ascertain whether this principle is faithfully expressed by property In fact property being defensible on no ground save that of justice the idea or at least the intention of justice must of necessity underlie all the arguments that have been made in defence of property and as on the other hand the right of property is only exercised over those things which can be appreciated by the senses justice secretly objectifying itself so to speak must take the shape of an algebraic formula By this method of investigation we soon see that every argument which has been invented in behalf of property WHATEVER IT MAY BE always and of necessity leads to equality that is to the negation of property The first part covers two chapters one treating of occupation the foundation of our right the other of labor and talent considered as causes of property and social inequality The first of these chapters will prove that the right of occupation OBSTRUCTS property the second that the right of labor DESTROYS it II Property then being of necessity conceived as existing only in connection with equality it remains to find out why in spite of this necessity of logic equality does not exist This new investigation also covers two chapters in the first considering the fact of property in itself we inquire whether this fact is real whether it exists whether it is possible for it would imply a contradiction were these two opposite forms of society equality and inequality both possible Then we discover singularly enough that property may indeed manifest itself accidentally but that as an institution and principle it is mathematically impossible So that the axiom of the school ab actu ad posse valet consecutio from the actual to the possible the inference is good is given the lie as far as property is concerned Finally in the last chapter calling psychology to our aid and probing man s nature to the bottom we shall disclose the principle of JUSTICE its formula and character we shall state with precision the organic law of society we shall explain the origin of property the causes of its establishment its long life and its approaching death we shall definitively establish its identity with robbery And after having shown that these three prejudices THE SOVEREIGNTY OF MAN THE INEQUALITY OF CONDITIONS AND PROPERTY are one and the same that they may be taken for each other and are reciprocally convertible we shall have no trouble in inferring therefrom by the principle of contradiction the basis of government and right There our investigations will end reserving the right to continue them in future works The importance of the subject which engages our attention is recognized by all minds Property says M Hennequin is the creative and conservative principle of civil society Property is one of those basic institutions new theories concerning which cannot be presented too soon for it must not be forgotten and the publicist and statesman must know that on the answer to the question whether property is the principle or the result of social order whether it is to be considered as a cause or an effect depends all morality and consequently all the authority of human institutions These words are a challenge to all men of hope and faith but although the cause of equality is a noble one no one has yet picked up the gauntlet thrown down by the advocates of property no one has been courageous enough to enter upon the struggle The spurious learning of haughty jurisprudence and the absurd aphorisms of a political economy controlled by property have puzzled the most generous minds it is a sort of password among the most influential friends of liberty and the interests of the people that EQUALITY IS A CHIMERA So many false theories and meaningless analogies influence minds otherwise keen but which are unconsciously controlled by popular prejudice Equality advances every day fit aequalitas Soldiers of liberty shall we desert our flag in the hour of triumph A defender of equality I shall speak without bitterness and without anger with the independence becoming a philosopher with the courage and firmness of a free man May I in this momentous struggle carry into all hearts the light with which I am filled and show by the success of my argument that equality failed to conquer by the sword only that it might conquer by the pen CHAPTER II PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT OCCUPATION AND CIVIL LAW AS EFFICIENT BASES OF PROPERTY DEFINITIONS The Roman law defined property as the right to use and abuse one s own within the limits of the law jus utendi et abutendi re sua guatenus juris ratio patitur A justification of the word ABUSE has been attempted on the ground that it signifies not senseless and immoral abuse but only absolute domain Vain distinction invented as an excuse for property and powerless against the frenzy of possession which it neither prevents nor represses The proprietor may if he chooses allow his crops to rot under foot sow his field with salt milk his cows on the sand change his vineyard into a desert and use his vegetable garden as a park do these things constitute abuse or not In the matter of property use and abuse are necessarily indistinguishable According to the Declaration of Rights published as a preface to the Constitution of ninety three property is the right to enjoy and dispose at will of one s goods one s income and the fruit of one s labor and industry Code Napoleon article five hundred forty four Property is the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner provided we do not overstep the limits prescribed by the laws and regulations These two definitions do not differ from that of the Roman law all give the proprietor an absolute right over a thing and as for the restriction imposed by the code PROVIDED WE DO NOT OVERSTEP THE LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS its object is not to limit property but to prevent the domain of one proprietor from interfering with that of another That is a confirmation of the principle not a limitation of it There are different kinds of property one Property pure and simple the dominant and seigniorial power over a thing or as they term it NAKED PROPERTY two POSSESSION Possession says Duranton is a matter of fact not of right Toullier Property is a right a legal power possession is a fact The tenant the farmer the commandite the usufructuary are possessors the owner who lets and lends for use the heir who is to come into possession on the death of a usufructuary are proprietors If I may venture the comparison a lover is a possessor a husband is a proprietor This double definition of property domain and possession is of the highest importance and it must be clearly understood in order to comprehend what is to follow From the distinction between possession and property arise two sorts of rights the jus in re the right in a thing the right by which I may reclaim the property which I have acquired in whatever hands I find it and the jus ad rem the right TO a thing which gives me a claim to become a proprietor Thus the right of the partners to a marriage over each other s person is the jus in re that of two who are betrothed is only the jus ad rem In the first possession and property are united the second includes only naked property With me who as a laborer have a right to the possession of the products of Nature and my own industry and who as a proletaire enjoy none of them it is by virtue of the jus ad rem that I demand admittance to the jus in re This distinction between the jus in re and the jus ad rem is the basis of the famous distinction between possessoire and petitoire actual categories of jurisprudence the whole of which is included within their vast boundaries Petitoire refers to every thing relating to property possessoire to that relating to possession In writing this memoir against property I bring against universal society an action petitoire I prove that those who do not possess to day are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess but instead of inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all I demand in the name of general security its entire abolition If I fail to win my case there is nothing left for us the proletarian class and myself but to cut our throats we can ask nothing more from the justice of nations for as the code of procedure art twenty six tells us in its energetic style THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAS BEEN NON SUITED IN AN ACTION PETITOIRE IS DEBARRED THEREBY FROM BRINGING AN ACTION POSSESSOIRE If on the contrary I gain the case we must then commence an action possessoire that we may be reinstated in the enjoyment of the wealth of which we are deprived by property I hope that we shall not be forced to that extremity but these two actions cannot be prosecuted at once such a course being prohibited by the same code of procedure Before going to the heart of the question it will not be useless to offer a few preliminary remarks one Property as a Natural Right The Declaration of Rights has placed property in its list of the natural and inalienable rights of man four in all LIBERTY EQUALITY PROPERTY SECURITY What rule did the legislators of ninety three follow in compiling this list None They laid down principles just as they discussed sovereignty and the laws from a general point of view and according to their own opinion They did every thing in their own blind way If we can believe Toullier The absolute rights can be reduced to three SECURITY LIBERTY PROPERTY Equality is eliminated by the Rennes professor why Is it because LIBERTY implies it or because property prohibits it On this point the author of Droit Civil Explique is silent it has not even occurred to him that the matter is under discussion Nevertheless if we compare these three or four rights with each other we find that property bears no resemblance whatever to the others that for the majority of citizens it exists only potentially and as a dormant faculty without exercise that for the others who do enjoy it it is susceptible of certain transactions and modifications which do not harmonize with the idea of a natural right that in practice governments tribunals and laws do not respect it and finally that everybody spontaneously and with one voice regards it as chimerical Liberty is inviolable I can neither sell nor alienate my liberty every contract every condition of a contract which has in view the alienation or suspension of liberty is null the slave when he plants his foot upon the soil of liberty at that moment becomes a free man When society seizes a malefactor and deprives him of his liberty it is a case of legitimate defence whoever violates the social compact by the commission of a crime declares himself a public enemy in attacking the liberty of others he compels them to take away his own Liberty is the original condition of man to renounce liberty is to renounce the nature of man after that how could we perform the acts of man Likewise equality before the law suffers neither restriction nor exception All Frenchmen are equally eligible to office consequently in the presence of this equality condition and family have in many cases no influence upon choice The poorest citizen can obtain judgment in the courts against one occupying the most exalted station Let the millionaire Ahab build a chateau upon the vineyard of Naboth the court will have the power according to the circumstances to order the destruction of the chateau though it has cost millions and to force the trespasser to restore the vineyard to its original state and pay the damages The law wishes all property that has been legitimately acquired to be kept inviolate without regard to value and without respect for persons The charter demands it is true for the exercise of certain political rights certain conditions of fortune and capacity but all publicists know that the legislator s intention was not to establish a privilege but to take security Provided the conditions fixed by law are complied with every citizen may be an elector and every elector eligible The right once acquired is the same for all the law compares neither persons nor votes I do not ask now whether this system is the best it is enough that in the opinion of the charter and in the eyes of every one equality before the law is absolute and like liberty admits of no compromise It is the same with the right of security Society promises its members no half way protection no sham defence it binds itself to them as they bind themselves to it It does not say to them I will shield you provided it costs me nothing I will protect you if I run no risks thereby It says I will defend you against everybody I will save and avenge you or perish myself The whole strength of the State is at the service of each citizen the obligation which binds them together is absolute How different with property Worshipped by all it is acknowledged by none laws morals customs public and private conscience all plot its death and ruin To meet the expenses of government which has armies to support tasks to perform and officers to pay taxes are needed Let all contribute to these expenses nothing more just But why should the rich pay more than the poor That is just they say because they possess more I confess that such justice is beyond my comprehension Why are taxes paid To protect all in the exercise of their natural rights liberty equality security and property to maintain order in the State to furnish the public with useful and pleasant conveniences Now does it cost more to defend the rich man s life and liberty than the poor man s Who in time of invasion famine or plague causes more trouble the large proprietor who escapes the evil without the assistance of the State or the laborer who sits in his cottage unprotected from danger Is public order endangered more by the worthy citizen or by the artisan and journeyman Why the police have more to fear from a few hundred laborers out of work than from two hundred thousand electors Does the man of large income appreciate more keenly than the poor man national festivities clean streets and beautiful monuments Why he prefers his country seat to all the popular pleasures and when he wants to enjoy himself he does not wait for the greased pole One of two things is true either the proportional tax affords greater security to the larger tax payers or else it is a wrong Because if property is a natural right as the Declaration of ninety three declares all that belongs to me by virtue of this right is as sacred as my person it is my blood my life myself whoever touches it offends the apple of my eye My income of one hundred thousand francs is as inviolable as the grisette s daily wage of seventy five centimes her attic is no more sacred than my suite of apartments The tax is not levied in proportion to strength size or skill no more should it be levied in proportion to property If then the State takes more from me let it give me more in return or cease to talk of equality of rights for otherwise society is established not to defend property but to destroy it The State through the proportional tax becomes the chief of robbers the State sets the example of systematic pillage the State should be brought to the bar of justice at the head of those hideous brigands that execrable mob which it now kills from motives of professional jealousy But they say the courts and the police force are established to restrain this mob government is a company not exactly for insurance for it does not insure but for vengeance and repression The premium which this company exacts the tax is divided in proportion to property that is in proportion to the trouble which each piece of property occasions the avengers and repressers paid by the government This is any thing but the absolute and inalienable right of property Under this system the poor and the rich distrust and make war upon each other But what is the object of the war Property So that property is necessarily accompanied by war upon property The liberty and security of the rich do not suffer from the liberty and security of the poor far from that they mutually strengthen and sustain each other The rich man s right of property on the contrary has to be continually defended against the poor man s desire for property What a contradiction In England they have a poor rate they wish me to pay this tax But what relation exists between my natural and inalienable right of property and the hunger from which ten million wretched people are suffering When religion commands us to assist our fellows it speaks in the name of charity not in the name of law The obligation of benevolence imposed upon me by Christian morality cannot be imposed upon me as a political tax for the benefit of any person or poor house I will give alms when I see fit to do so when the sufferings of others excite in me that sympathy of which philosophers talk and in which I do not believe I will not be forced to bestow them No one is obliged to do more than comply with this injunction IN THE EXERCISE OF YOUR OWN RIGHTS DO NOT ENCROACH UPON THE RIGHTS OF ANOTHER an injunction which is the exact definition of liberty Now my possessions are my own no one has a claim upon them I object to the placing of the third theological virtue in the order of the day Everybody in France demands the conversion of the five per cent bonds they demand thereby the complete sacrifice of one species of property They have the right to do it if public necessity requires it but where is the just indemnity promised by the charter Not only does none exist but this indemnity is not even possible for if the indemnity were equal to the property sacrificed the conversion would be useless The State occupies the same position to day toward the bondholders that the city of Calais did when besieged by Edward III toward its notables The English conqueror consented to spare its inhabitants provided it would surrender to him its most distinguished citizens to do with as he pleased Eustache and several others offered themselves it was noble in them and our ministers should recommend their example to the bondholders But had the city the right to surrender them Assuredly not The right to security is absolute the country can require no one to sacrifice himself The soldier standing guard within the enemy s range is no exception to this rule Wherever a citizen stands guard the country stands guard with him to day it is the turn of the one to morrow of the other When danger and devotion are common flight is parricide No one has the right to flee from danger no one can serve as a scapegoat The maxim of Caiaphas IT IS RIGHT THAT A MAN SHOULD DIE FOR HIS NATION is that of the populace and of tyrants the two extremes of social degradation It is said that all perpetual annuities are essentially redeemable This maxim of civil law applied to the State is good for those who wish to return to the natural equality of labor and wealth but from the point of view of the proprietor and in the mouth of conversionists it is the language of bankrupts The State is not only a borrower it is an insurer and guardian of property granting the best of security it assures the most inviolable possession How then can it force open the hands of its creditors who have confidence in it and then talk to them of public order and security of property The State in such an operation is not a debtor who discharges his debt it is a stock company which allures its stockholders into a trap and there contrary to its authentic promise exacts from them twenty thirty or forty per cent of the interest on their capital That is not all The State is a university of citizens joined together under a common law by an act of society This act secures all in the possession of their property guarantees to one his field to another his vineyard to a third his rents and to the bondholder who might have bought real estate but who preferred to come to the assistance of the treasury his bonds The State cannot demand without offering an equivalent the sacrifice of an acre of the field or a corner of the vineyard still less can it lower rents why should it have the right to diminish the interest on bonds This right could not justly exist unless the bondholder could invest his funds elsewhere to equal advantage but being confined to the State where can he find a place to invest them since the cause of conversion that is the power to borrow to better advantage lies in the State That is why a government based on the principle of property cannot redeem its annuities without the consent of their holders The money deposited with the republic is property which it has no right to touch while other kinds of property are respected to force their redemption is to violate the social contract and outlaw the bondholders The whole controversy as to the conversion of bonds finally reduces itself to this QUESTION Is it just to reduce to misery forty five thousand families who derive an income from their bonds of one hundred francs or less ANSWER Is it just to compel seven or eight millions of tax payers to pay a tax of five francs when they should pay only three It is clear in the first place that the reply is in reality no reply but to make the wrong more apparent let us change it thus Is it just to endanger the lives of one hundred thousand men when we can save them by surrendering one hundred heads to the enemy Reader decide All this is clearly understood by the defenders of the present system Yet nevertheless sooner or later the conversion will be effected and property be violated because no other course is possible because property regarded as a right and not being a right must of right perish because the force of events the laws of conscience and physical and mathematical necessity must in the end destroy this illusion of our minds To sum up liberty is an absolute right because it is to man what impenetrability is to matter a sine qua non of existence equality is an absolute right because without equality there is no society security is an absolute right because in the eyes of every man his own liberty and life are as precious as another s These three rights are absolute that is susceptible of neither increase nor diminution because in society each associate receives as much as he gives liberty for liberty equality for equality security for security body for body soul for soul in life and in death But property in its derivative sense and by the definitions of law is a right outside of society for it is clear that if the wealth of each was social wealth the conditions would be equal for all and it would be a contradiction to say PROPERTY IS A MAN S RIGHT TO DISPOSE AT WILL OF SOCIAL PROPERTY Then if we are associated for the sake of liberty equality and security we are not associated for the sake of property then if property is a NATURAL right this natural right is not SOCIAL but ANTI SOCIAL Property and society are utterly irreconcilable institutions It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to join two magnets by their opposite poles Either society must perish or it must destroy property If property is a natural absolute imprescriptible and inalienable right why in all ages has there been so much speculation as to its origin for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics The origin of a natural right Good God who ever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty security or equality They exist by the same right that we exist they are born with us they live and die with us With property it is very different indeed By law property can exist without a proprietor like a quality without a subject It exists for the human being who as yet is not and for the octogenarian who is no more And yet in spite of these wonderful prerogatives which savor of the eternal and the infinite they have never found the origin of property the doctors still disagree On one point only are they in harmony namely that the validity of the right of property depends upon the authenticity of its origin But this harmony is their condemnation Why have they acknowledged the right before settling the question of origin Certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to property and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history They wish to hold to this proposition that property is a fact that it always has been and always will be With that proposition the savant Proudhon eleven commenced his Treatise on the Right of Usufruct regarding the origin of property as a useless question Perhaps I would subscribe to this doctrine believing it inspired by a commendable love of peace were all my fellow citizens in comfortable circumstances but no I will not subscribe to it The titles on which they pretend to base the right of property are two in number OCCUPATION and LABOR I shall examine them successively under all their aspects and in detail and I remind the reader that to whatever authority we appeal I shall prove beyond a doubt that property to be just and possible must necessarily have equality for its condition two Occupation as the Title to Property It is remarkable that at those meetings of the State Council at which the Code was discussed no controversy arose as to the origin and principle of property All the articles of Vol II Book two concerning property and the right of accession were passed without opposition or amendment Bonaparte who on other questions had given his legists so much trouble had nothing to say about property Be not surprised at it in the eyes of that man the most selfish and wilful person that ever lived property was the first of rights just as submission to authority was the most holy of duties The right of OCCUPATION or of the FIRST OCCUPANT is that which results from the actual physical real possession of a thing I occupy a piece of land the presumption is that I am the proprietor until the contrary is proved We know that originally such a right cannot be legitimate unless it is reciprocal the jurists say as much Cicero compares the earth to a vast theatre Quemadmodum theatrum cum commune sit recte tamen dici potest ejus esse eum locum quem quisque occuparit This passage is all that ancient philosophy has to say about the origin of property The theatre says Cicero is common to all nevertheless the place that each one occupies is called HIS OWN that is it is a place POSSESSED not a place APPROPRIATED This comparison annihilates property moreover it implies equality Can I in a theatre occupy at the same time one place in the pit another in the boxes and a third in the gallery Not unless I have three bodies like Geryon or can exist in different places at the same time as is related of the magician Apollonius According to Cicero no one has a right to more than he needs such is the true interpretation of his famous axiom suum quidque cujusque sit to each one that which belongs to him an axiom that has been strangely applied That which belongs to each is not that which each MAY possess but that which each HAS A RIGHT to possess Now what have we a right to possess That which is required for our labor and consumption Cicero s comparison of the earth to a theatre proves it According to that each one may take what place he will may beautify and adorn it if he can it is allowable but he must never allow himself to overstep the limit which separates him from another The doctrine of Cicero leads directly to equality for occupation being pure toleration if the toleration is mutual and it cannot be otherwise the possessions are equal Grotius rushes into history but what kind of reasoning is that which seeks the origin of a right said to be natural elsewhere than in Nature This is the method of the ancients the fact exists then it is necessary then it is just then its antecedents are just also Nevertheless let us look into it Originally all things were common and undivided they were the property of all Let us go no farther Grotius tells us how this original communism came to an end through ambition and cupidity how the age of gold was followed by the age of iron c So that property rested first on war and conquest then on treaties and agreements But either these treaties and agreements distributed wealth equally as did the original communism the only method of distribution with which the barbarians were acquainted and the only form of justice of which they could conceive and then the question of origin assumes this form how did equality afterwards disappear or else these treaties and agreements were forced by the strong upon the weak and in that case they are null the tacit consent of posterity does not make them valid and we live in a permanent condition of iniquity and fraud We never can conceive how the equality of conditions having once existed could afterwards have passed away What was the cause of such degeneration The instincts of the animals are unchangeable as well as the differences of species to suppose original equality in human society is to admit by implication that the present inequality is a degeneration from the nature of this society a thing which the defenders of property cannot explain But I infer therefrom that if Providence placed the first human beings in a condition of equality it was an indication of its desires a model that it wished them to realize in other forms just as the religious sentiment which it planted in their hearts has developed and manifested itself in various ways Man has but one nature constant and unalterable he pursues it through instinct he wanders from it through reflection he returns to it through judgment who shall say that we are not returning now According to Grotius man has abandoned equality according to me he will yet return to it How came he to abandon it Why will he return to it These are questions for future consideration Reid writes as follows The right of property is not innate but acquired It is not grounded upon the constitution of man but upon his actions Writers on jurisprudence have explained its origin in a manner that may satisfy every man of common understanding The earth is given to men in common for the purposes of life by the bounty of Heaven But to divide it and appropriate one part of its produce to one another part to another must be the work of men who have power and understanding given them by which every man may accommodate himself WITHOUT HURT TO ANY OTHER This common right of every man to what the earth produces before it be occupied and appropriated by others was by ancient moralists very properly compared to the right which every citizen had to the public theatre where every man that came might occupy an empty seat and thereby acquire a right to it while the entertainment lasted but no man had a right to dispossess another The earth is a great theatre furnished by the Almighty with perfect wisdom and goodness for the entertainment and employment of all mankind Here every man has a right to accommodate himself as a spectator and to perform his part as an actor but without hurt to others Consequences of Reid s doctrine one That the portion which each one appropriates may wrong no one it must be equal to the quotient of the total amount of property to be shared divided by the number of those who are to share it two The number of places being of necessity equal at all times to that of the spectators no spectator can occupy two places nor can any actor play several parts three Whenever a spectator comes in or goes out the places of all contract or enlarge correspondingly for says Reid THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IS NOT INNATE BUT ACQUIRED consequently it is not absolute consequently the occupancy on which it is based being a conditional fact cannot endow this right with a stability which it does not possess itself This seems to have been the thought of the Edinburgh professor when he added A right to life implies a right to the necessary means of life and that justice which forbids the taking away the life of an innocent man forbids no less the taking from him the necessary means of life He has the same right to defend the one as the other To hinder another man s innocent labor or to deprive him of the fruit of it is an injustice of the same kind and has the same effect as to put him in fetters or in prison and is equally a just object of resentment Thus the chief of the Scotch school without considering at all the inequality of skill or labor posits a priori the equality of the means of labor abandoning thereafter to each laborer the care of his own person after the eternal axiom WHOSO DOES WELL SHALL FARE WELL The philosopher Reid is lacking not in knowledge of the principle but in courage to pursue it to its ultimate If the right of life is equal the right of labor is equal and so is the right of occupancy Would it not be criminal were some islanders to repulse in the name of property the unfortunate victims of a shipwreck struggling to reach the shore The very idea of such cruelty sickens the imagination The proprietor like Robinson Crusoe on his island wards off with pike and musket the proletaire washed overboard by the wave of civilization and seeking to gain a foothold upon the rocks of property Give me work cries he with all his might to the proprietor don t drive me away I will work for you at any price I do not need your services replies the proprietor showing the end of his pike or the barrel of his gun Lower my rent at least I need my income to live upon How can I pay you when I can get no work That is your business Then the unfortunate proletaire abandons himself to the waves or if he attempts to land upon the shore of property the proprietor takes aim and kills him We have just listened to a spiritualist we will now question a materialist then an eclectic and having completed the circle of philosophy we will turn next to law According to Destutt de Tracy property is a necessity of our nature That this necessity involves unpleasant consequences it would be folly to deny But these consequences are necessary evils which do not invalidate the principle so that it as unreasonable to rebel against property on account of the abuses which it generates as to complain of life because it is sure to end in death This brutal and pitiless philosophy promises at least frank and close reasoning Let us see if it keeps its promise We talk very gravely about the conditions of property as if it was our province to decide what constitutes property It would seem to hear certain philosophers and legislators that at a certain moment spontaneously and without cause people began to use the words THINE and MINE and that they might have or ought to have dispensed with them But THINE and MINE were never invented A philosopher yourself you are too realistic THINE and MINE do not necessarily refer to self as they do when I say your philosophy and my equality for your philosophy is you philosophizing and my equality is I professing equality THINE and MINE oftener indicate a relation YOUR country YOUR parish YOUR tailor YOUR milkmaid MY chamber MY seat at the theatre MY company and MY battalion in the National Guard In the former sense we may sometimes say MY labor MY skill MY virtue never MY grandeur nor MY majesty in the latter sense only MY field MY house MY vineyard MY capital precisely as the banker s clerk says MY cash box In short THINE and MINE are signs and expressions of personal but equal rights applied to things outside of us they indicate possession function use not property It does not seem possible but nevertheless I shall prove by quotations that the whole theory of our author is based upon this paltry equivocation Prior to all covenants men are not exactly as Hobbes says in a state of HOSTILITY but of ESTRANGEMENT In this state justice and injustice are unknown the rights of one bear no relation to the rights of another All have as many rights as needs and all feel it their duty to satisfy those needs by any means at their command Grant it whether true or false it matters not Destutt de Tracy cannot escape equality On this theory men while in a state of ESTRANGEMENT are under no obligations to each other they all have the right to satisfy their needs without regard to the needs of others and consequently the right to exercise their power over Nature each according to his strength and ability That involves the greatest inequality of wealth Inequality of conditions then is the characteristic feature of estrangement or barbarism the exact opposite of Rousseau s idea But let us look farther Restrictions of these rights and this duty commence at the time when covenants either implied or expressed are agreed upon Then appears for the first time justice and injustice that is the balance between the rights of one and the rights of another which up to that time were necessarily equal Listen RIGHTS WERE EQUAL that means that each individual had the right to SATISFY HIS NEEDS WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE NEEDS OF OTHERS In other words that all had the right to injure each other that there was no right save force and cunning They injured each other not only by war and pillage but also by usurpation and appropriation Now in order to abolish this equal right to use force and stratagem this equal right to do evil the sole source of the inequality of benefits and injuries they commenced to make COVENANTS EITHER IMPLIED OR EXPRESSED and established a balance Then these agreements and this balance were intended to secure to all equal comfort then by the law of contradictions if isolation is the principle of inequality society must produce equality The social balance is the equalization of the strong and the weak for while they are not equals they are strangers they can form no associations they live as enemies Then if inequality of conditions is a necessary evil so is isolation for society and inequality are incompatible with each other Then if society is the true condition of man s existence so is equality also This conclusion cannot be avoided This being so how is it that ever since the establishment of this balance inequality has been on the increase How is it that justice and isolation always accompany each other Destutt de Tracy shall reply NEEDS and MEANS RIGHTS and DUTIES are products of the will If man willed nothing these would not exist But to have needs and means rights and duties is to HAVE to POSSESS something They are so many kinds of property using the word in its most general sense they are things which belong to us Shameful equivocation not justified by the necessity for generalization The word PROPERTY has two meanings one It designates the quality which makes a thing what it is the attribute which is peculiar to it and especially distinguishes it We use it in this sense when we say THE PROPERTIES OF THE TRIANGLE or of NUMBERS THE PROPERTY OF THE MAGNET c two It expresses the right of absolute control over a thing by a free and intelligent being It is used in this sense by writers on jurisprudence Thus in the phrase IRON ACQUIRES THE PROPERTY OF A MAGNET the word PROPERTY does not convey the same idea that it does in this one I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS MAGNET AS MY PROPERTY To tell a poor man that he HAS property because he HAS arms and legs that the hunger from which he suffers and his power to sleep in the open air are his property is to play upon words and to add insult to injury The sole basis of the idea of property is the idea of personality As soon as property is born at all it is born of necessity in all its fulness As soon as an individual knows HIMSELF his moral personality his capacities of enjoyment suffering and action he necessarily sees also that this SELF is exclusive proprietor of the body in which it dwells its organs their powers faculties c Inasmuch as artificial and conventional property exists there must be natural property also for nothing can exist in art without its counterpart in Nature We ought to admire the honesty and judgment of philosophers Man has properties that is in the first acceptation of the term faculties He has property that is in its second acceptation the right of domain He has then the property of the property of being proprietor How ashamed I should be to notice such foolishness were I here considering only the authority of Destutt de Tracy But the entire human race since the origination of society and language when metaphysics and dialectics were first born has been guilty of this puerile confusion of thought All which man could call his own was identified in his mind with his person He considered it as his property his wealth a part of himself a member of his body a faculty of his mind The possession of things was likened to property in the powers of the body and mind and on this false analogy was based the right of property THE IMITATION OF NATURE BY ART as Destutt de Tracy so elegantly puts it But why did not this ideologist perceive that man is not proprietor even of his own faculties Man has powers attributes capacities they are given him by Nature that he may live learn and love he does not own them but has only the use of them and he can make no use of them that does not harmonize with Nature s laws If he had absolute mastery over his faculties he could avoid hunger and cold he could eat unstintedly and walk through fire he could move mountains walk a hundred leagues in a minute cure without medicines and by the sole force of his will and could make himself immortal He could say I wish to produce and his tasks would be finished with the words he could say I wish to know and he would know I love and he would enjoy What then Man is not master of himself but may be of his surroundings Let him use the wealth of Nature since he can live only by its use but let him abandon his pretensions to the title of proprietor and remember that he is called so only metaphorically To sum up Destutt de Tracy classes together the external PRODUCTIONS of nature and art and the POWERS or FACULTIES of man making both of them species of property and upon this equivocation he hopes to establish so firmly that it can never be disturbed the right of property But of these different kinds of property some are INNATE as memory imagination strength and beauty while others are ACQUIRED as land water and forests In the state of Nature or isolation the strongest and most skilful that is those best provided with innate property stand the best chance of obtaining acquired property Now it is to prevent this encroachment and the war which results therefrom that a balance justice has been employed and covenants implied or expressed agreed upon it is to correct as far as possible inequality of innate property by equality of acquired property As long as the division remains unequal so long the partners remain enemies and it is the purpose of the covenants to reform this state of things Thus we have on the one hand isolation inequality enmity war robbery murder on the other society equality fraternity peace and love Choose between them M Joseph Dutens a physician engineer and geometrician but a very poor legist and no philosopher at all is the author of a Philosophy of Political Economy in which he felt it his duty to break lances in behalf of property His reasoning seems to be borrowed from Destutt de Tracy He commences with this definition of property worthy of Sganarelle Property is the right by which a thing is one s own Literally translated Property is the right of property After getting entangled a few times on the subjects of will liberty and personality after having distinguished between IMMATERIAL NATURAL property and MATERIAL NATURAL property a distinction similar to Destutt de Tracy s of innate and acquired property M Joseph Dutens concludes with these two general propositions one Property is a natural and inalienable right of every man two Inequality of property is a necessary result of Nature which propositions are convertible into a simpler one All men have an equal right of unequal property He rebukes M de Sismondi for having taught that landed property has no other basis than law and conventionality and he says himself speaking of the respect which people feel for property that their good sense reveals to them the nature of the ORIGINAL CONTRACT made between society and proprietors He confounds property with possession communism with equality the just with the natural and the natural with the possible Now he takes these different ideas to be equivalents now he seems to distinguish between them so much so that it would be infinitely easier to refute him than to understand him Attracted first by the title of the work Philosophy of Political Economy I have found among the author s obscurities only the most ordinary ideas For that reason I will not speak of him M Cousin in his Moral Philosophy page fifteen teaches that all morality all laws all rights are given to man with this injunction FREE BEING REMAIN FREE Bravo master I wish to remain free if I can He continues Our principle is true it is good it is social Do not fear to push it to its ultimate one If the human person is sacred its whole nature is sacred and particularly its interior actions its feelings its thoughts its voluntary decisions This accounts for the respect due to philosophy religion the arts industry commerce and to all the results of liberty I say respect not simply toleration for we do not tolerate a right we respect it I bow my head before this philosophy two My liberty which is sacred needs for its objective action an instrument which we call the body the body participates then in the sacredness of liberty it is then inviolable This is the basis of the principle of individual liberty three My liberty needs for its objective action material to work upon in other words property or a thing This thing or property naturally participates then in the inviolability of my person For instance I take possession of an object which has become necessary and useful in the outward manifestation of my liberty I say This object is mine since it belongs to no one else consequently I possess it legitimately So the legitimacy of possession rests on two conditions First I possess only as a free being Suppress free activity you destroy my power to labor Now it is only by labor that I can use this property or thing and it is only by using it that I possess it Free activity is then the principle of the right of property But that alone does not legitimate possession All men are free all can use property by labor Does that mean that all men have a right to all property Not at all To possess legitimately I must not only labor and produce in my capacity of a free being but I must also be the first to occupy the property In short if labor and production are the principle of the right of property the fact of first occupancy is its indispensable condition four I possess legitimately then I have the right to use my property as I see fit I have also the right to give it away I have also the right to bequeath it for if I decide to make a donation my decision is as valid after my death as during my life In fact to become a proprietor in M Cousin s opinion one must take possession by occupation and labor I maintain that the element of time must be considered also for if the first occupants have occupied every thing what are the new comers to do What will become of them having an instrument with which to work but no material to work upon Must they devour each other A terrible extremity unforeseen by philosophical prudence for the reason that great geniuses neglect little things Notice also that M Cousin says that neither occupation nor labor taken separately can legitimate the right of property and that it is born only from the union of the two This is one of M Cousin s eclectic turns which he more than any one else should take pains to avoid Instead of proceeding by the method of analysis comparison elimination and reduction the only means of discovering the truth amid the various forms of thought and whimsical opinions he jumbles all systems together and then declaring each both right and wrong exclaims There you have the truth But adhering to my promise I will not refute him I will only prove by all the arguments with which he justifies the right of property the principle of equality which kills it As I have already said my sole intent is this to show at the bottom of all these positions that inevitable major EQUALITY hoping hereafter to show that the principle of property vitiates the very elements of economical moral and governmental science thus leading it in the wrong direction Well is it not true from M Cousin s point of view that if the liberty of man is sacred it is equally sacred in all individuals that if it needs property for its objective action that is for its life the appropriation of material is equally necessary for all that if I wish to be respected in my right of appropriation I must respect others in theirs and consequently that though in the sphere of the infinite a person s power of appropriation is limited only by himself in the sphere of the finite this same power is limited by the mathematical relation between the number of persons and the space which they occupy Does it not follow that if one individual cannot prevent another his fellow man from appropriating an amount of material equal to his own no more can he prevent individuals yet to come because while individuality passes away universality persists and eternal laws cannot be determined by a partial view of their manifestations Must we not conclude therefore that whenever a person is born the others must crowd closer together and by reciprocity of obligation that if the new comer is afterwards to become an heir the right of succession does not give him the right of accumulation but only the right of choice I have followed M Cousin so far as to imitate his style and I am ashamed of it Do we need such high sounding terms such sonorous phrases to say such simple things Man needs to labor in order to live consequently he needs tools to work with and materials to work upon His need to produce constitutes his right to produce Now this right is guaranteed him by his fellows with whom he makes an agreement to that effect One hundred thousand men settle in a large country like France with no inhabitants each man has a right to one one hundred thousand of the land If the number of possessors increases each one s portion diminishes in consequence so that if the number of inhabitants rises to thirty four millions each one will have a right only to one thirty four million Now so regulate the police system and the government labor exchange inheritance c that the means of labor shall be shared by all equally and that each individual shall be free and then society will be perfect Of all the defenders of property M Cousin has gone the farthest He has maintained against the economists that labor does not establish the right of property unless preceded by occupation and against the jurists that the civil law can determine and apply a natural right but cannot create it In fact it is not sufficient to say The right of property is demonstrated by the existence of property the function of the civil law is purely declaratory To say that is to confess that there is no reply to those who question the legitimacy of the fact itself Every right must be justifiable in itself or by some antecedent right property is no exception For this reason M Cousin has sought to base it upon the SANCTITY of the human personality and the act by which the will assimilates a thing Once touched by man says one of M Cousin s disciples things receive from him a character which transforms and humanizes them I confess for my part that I have no faith in this magic and that I know of nothing less holy than the will of man But this theory fragile as it seems to psychology as well as jurisprudence is nevertheless more philosophical and profound than those theories which are based upon labor or the authority of the law Now we have just seen to what this theory of which we are speaking leads to the equality implied in the terms of its statement But perhaps philosophy views things from too lofty a standpoint and is not sufficiently practical perhaps from the exalted summit of speculation men seem so small to the metaphysician that he cannot distinguish between them perhaps indeed the equality of conditions is one of those principles which are very true and sublime as generalities but which it would be ridiculous and even dangerous to attempt to rigorously apply to the customs of life and to social transactions Undoubtedly this is a case which calls for imitation of the wise reserve of moralists and jurists who warn us against carrying things to extremes and who advise us to suspect every definition because there is not one they say which cannot be utterly destroyed by developing its disastrous results Omnis definitio in jure civili periculosa est parum est enim ut non subverti possit Equality of conditions a terrible dogma in the ears of the proprietor a consoling truth at the poor man s sick bed a frightful reality under the knife of the anatomist equality of conditions established in the political civil and industrial spheres is only an alluring impossibility an inviting bait a satanic delusion It is never my intention to surprise my reader I detest as I do death the man who employs subterfuge in his words and conduct From the first page of this book I have expressed myself so plainly and decidedly that all can see the tendency of my thought and hopes and they will do me the justice to say that it would be difficult to exhibit more frankness and more boldness at the same time I do not hesitate to declare that the time is not far distant when this reserve now so much admired in philosophers this happy medium so strongly recommended by professors of moral and political science will be regarded as the disgraceful feature of a science without principle and as the seal of its reprobation In legislation and morals as well as in geometry axioms are absolute definitions are certain and all the results of a principle are to be accepted provided they are logically deduced Deplorable pride We know nothing of our nature and we charge our blunders to it and in a fit of unaffected ignorance cry out The truth is in doubt the best definition defines nothing We shall know some time whether this distressing uncertainty of jurisprudence arises from the nature of its investigations or from our prejudices whether to explain social phenomena it is not enough to change our hypothesis as did Copernicus when he reversed the system of Ptolemy But what will be said when I show as I soon shall that this same jurisprudence continually tries to base property upon equality What reply can be made three Civil Law as the Foundation and Sanction of Property 
6181_216552_000002_000000	train-clean-100	Pothier seems to think that property like royalty exists by divine right 
none	none	He traces back its origin to God himself ab Jove principium 
6181_216552_000002_000002	train-clean-100	He begins in this way 
none	none	God is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it contains Domini est terra et plenitudo ejus orbis et universi qui habitant in eo 
6181_216552_000003_000001	train-clean-100	For the human race he has created the earth and all its creatures and has given it a control over them subordinate only to his own 
none	none	Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet says the Psalmist God accompanied this gift with these words addressed to our first parents after the creation Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth c 
6181_216552_000004_000000	train-clean-100	After this magnificent introduction who would refuse to believe the human race to be an immense family living in brotherly union and under the protection of a venerable father 
none	none	But heavens are brothers enemies 
6181_216552_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Are fathers unnatural and children prodigal 
none	none	GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE why then have I received none 
6181_216552_000005_000001	train-clean-100	HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET and I have not where to lay my head MULTIPLY he tells us through his interpreter Pothier 
none	none	Ah learned Pothier that is as easy to do as to say but you must give moss to the bird for its nest
6181_216552_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 The human race having multiplied men divided among themselves the earth and most of the things upon it that which fell to each from that time exclusively belonged to him 
none	none	That was the origin of the right of property Say rather the right of possession 
6181_216552_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Men lived in a state of communism whether positive or negative it matters little 
6181_216552_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Then there was no property not even private possession 
6181_216552_000007_000003	train-clean-100	The genesis and growth of possession gradually forcing people to labor for their support they agreed either formally or tacitly it makes no difference which that the laborer should be sole proprietor of the fruit of his labor that is they simply declared the fact that thereafter none could live without working 
6181_216552_000007_000004	train-clean-100	It necessarily followed that to obtain equality of products there must be equality of labor and that to obtain equality of labor there must be equality of facilities for labor 
6181_216552_000007_000005	train-clean-100	Whoever without labor got possession by force or by strategy of another s means of subsistence destroyed equality and placed himself above or outside of the law 
6181_216552_000007_000006	train-clean-100	Whoever monopolized the means of production on the ground of greater industry also destroyed equality 
none	none	Equality being then the expression of right whoever violated it was UNJUST Thus labor gives birth to private possession the right in a thing jus in re 
6181_216552_000008_000001	train-clean-100	But in what thing 
6181_216552_000008_000002	train-clean-100	Evidently IN THE PRODUCT not IN THE SOIL So the Arabs have always understood it and so according to Caesar and Tacitus the Germans formerly held 
none	none	The Arabs says M de Sismondi who admit a man s property in the flocks which he has raised do not refuse the crop to him who planted the seed but they do not see why another his equal should not have a right to plant in his turn The inequality which results from the pretended right of the first occupant seems to them to be based on no principle of justice and when all the land falls into the hands of a certain number of inhabitants there results a monopoly in their favor against the rest of the nation to which they do not wish to submit Well they have shared the land I admit that therefrom results a more powerful organization of labor and that this method of distribution fixed and durable is advantageous to production but how could this division give to each a transferable right of property in a thing to which all had an inalienable right of possession In the terms of jurisprudence this metamorphosis from possessor to proprietor is legally impossible it implies in the jurisdiction of the courts the union of possessoire and petitoire and the mutual concessions of those who share the land are nothing less than traffic in natural rights 
6181_216552_000009_000003	train-clean-100	The original cultivators of the land who were also the original makers of the law were not as learned as our legislators I admit and had they been they could not have done worse they did not foresee the consequences of the transformation of the right of private possession into the right of absolute property 
6181_216552_000047_000000	train-clean-100	they did not foresee 
none	none	the consequences of the transformation of the right of private possession into the right of absolute property But why have not those who in later times have established the distinction between jus in re and jus ad rem applied it to the principle of property itself 
6181_216552_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Let me call the attention of the writers on jurisprudence to their own maxims 
none	none	The right of property provided it can have a cause can have but one Dominium non potest nisi ex una causa contingere I can possess by several titles I can become proprietor by only one Non ut ex pluribus causis idem nobis deberi potest ita ex pluribus causis idem potest nostrum esse 
6181_216552_000011_000002	train-clean-100	The field which I have cleared which I cultivate on which I have built my house which supports myself my family and my livestock I can possess first 
none	none	As the original occupant twod As a laborer threed 
6181_216552_000011_000005	train-clean-100	By virtue of the social contract which assigns it to me as my share 
6181_216552_000012_000000	train-clean-100	But none of these titles confer upon me the right of property 
6181_216552_000012_000001	train-clean-100	For if I attempt to base it upon occupancy society can reply I am the original occupant If I appeal to my labor it will say It is only on that condition that you possess If I speak of agreements it will respond These agreements establish only your right of use Such however are the only titles which proprietors advance 
none	none	They never have been able to discover any others Indeed every right it is Pothier who says it supposes a producing cause in the person who enjoys it but in man who lives and dies in this son of earth who passes away like a shadow there exists with respect to external things only titles of possession not one title of property 
6181_216552_000012_000004	train-clean-100	Why then has society recognized a right injurious to itself where there is no producing cause 
6181_216552_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Why in according possession has it also conceded property 
6181_216552_000012_000006	train-clean-100	Why has the law sanctioned this abuse of power 
6181_216552_000013_000000	train-clean-100	The German Ancillon replies thus 
6181_216552_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Some philosophers pretend that man in employing his forces upon a natural object say a field or a tree acquires a right only to the improvements which he makes to the form which he gives to the object not to the object itself 
6181_216552_000014_000001	train-clean-100	Useless distinction 
6181_216552_000014_000002	train-clean-100	If the form could be separated from the object perhaps there would be room for question but as this is almost always impossible the application of man s strength to the different parts of the visible world is the foundation of the right of property the primary origin of riches 
6181_216552_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Vain pretext 
6181_216552_000015_000001	train-clean-100	If the form cannot be separated from the object nor property from possession possession must be shared in any case society reserves the right to fix the conditions of property 
none	none	Let us suppose that an appropriated farm yields a gross income of ten thousand francs and as very seldom happens that this farm cannot be divided Let us suppose farther that by economical calculation the annual expenses of a family are three thousand francs the possessor of this farm should be obliged to guard his reputation as a good father of a family by paying to society ten thousand francs less the total costs of cultivation and the three thousand francs required for the maintenance of his family 
6181_216552_000015_000003	train-clean-100	This payment is not rent it is an indemnity 
6181_216552_000016_000000	train-clean-100	What sort of justice is it then which makes such laws as this 
6181_216552_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Whereas since labor so changes the form of a thing that the form and substance cannot be separated without destroying the thing itself either society must be disinherited or the laborer must lose the fruit of his labor and
none	none	 Whereas in every other case property in raw material would give a title to added improvements minus their cost and whereas in this instance property in improvements ought to give a title to the principal
6181_216552_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Therefore the right of appropriation by labor shall never be admitted against individuals but only against society 
none	none	In such a way do legislators always reason in regard to property 
6181_216552_000021_000000	train-clean-100	The law is intended to protect men s mutual rights that is the rights of each against each and each against all and as if a proportion could exist with less than four terms the law makers always disregard the latter 
6181_216552_000021_000001	train-clean-100	As long as man is opposed to man property offsets property and the two forces balance each other as soon as man is isolated that is opposed to the society which he himself represents jurisprudence is at fault Themis has lost one scale of her balance 
none	none	Listen to the professor of Rennes the learned Toullier
6181_216552_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 How could this claim made valid by occupation become stable and permanent property which might continue to stand and which might be reclaimed after the first occupant had relinquished possession 
6181_216552_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Agriculture was a natural consequence of the multiplication of the human race and agriculture in its turn favors population and necessitates the establishment of permanent property for who would take the trouble to plough and sow if he were not certain that he would reap 
6181_216552_000025_000000	train-clean-100	To satisfy the husbandman it was sufficient to guarantee him possession of his crop admit even that he should have been protected in his right of occupation of land as long as he remained its cultivator 
6181_216552_000025_000001	train-clean-100	That was all that he had a right to expect that was all that the advance of civilization demanded 
none	none	But property property the right of escheat over lands which one neither occupies nor cultivates who had authority to grant it 
6181_216552_000025_000003	train-clean-100	who pretended to have it 
6181_216552_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Agriculture alone was not sufficient to establish permanent property positive laws were needed and magistrates to execute them in a word the civil State was needed 
6181_216552_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 The multiplication of the human race had rendered agriculture necessary the need of securing to the cultivator the fruit of his labor made permanent property necessary and also laws for its protection 
6181_216552_000027_000001	train-clean-100	So we are indebted to property for the creation of the civil State 
6181_216552_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Yes of our civil State as you have made it a State which at first was despotism then monarchy then aristocracy today democracy and always tyranny 
6181_216552_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Without the ties of property it never would have been possible to subordinate men to the wholesome yoke of the law and without permanent property the earth would have remained a vast forest 
none	none	Let us admit then with the most careful writers that if transient property or the right of preference resulting from occupation existed prior to the establishment of civil society permanent property as we know it to day is the work of civil law It is the civil law which holds that when once acquired property can be lost only by the action of the proprietor and that it exists even after the proprietor has relinquished possession of the thing and it has fallen into the hands of a third party Thus property and possession which originally were confounded became through the civil law two distinct and independent things two things which in the language of the law have nothing whatever in common 
6181_216552_000030_000001	train-clean-100	In this we see what a wonderful change has been effected in property and to what an extent Nature has been altered by the civil laws 
none	none	Thus the law in establishing property has not been the expression of a psychological fact the development of a natural law the application of a moral principle 
6181_216552_000031_000001	train-clean-100	It has literally CREATED a right outside of its own province 
none	none	It has realized an abstraction a metaphor a fiction and that without deigning to look at the consequences without considering the disadvantages without inquiring whether it was right or wrong 
6181_216552_000032_000000	train-clean-100	It has sanctioned selfishness it has indorsed monstrous pretensions it has received with favor impious vows as if it were able to fill up a bottomless pit and to satiate hell 
6181_216552_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Blind law the law of the ignorant man a law which is not a law the voice of discord deceit and blood 
6181_216552_000032_000002	train-clean-100	This it is which continually revived reinstated rejuvenated restored re enforced as the palladium of society has troubled the consciences of the people has obscured the minds of the masters and has induced all the catastrophes which have befallen nations 
6181_216552_000033_000000	train-clean-100	This it is which Christianity has condemned but which its ignorant ministers deify who have as little desire to study Nature and man as ability to read their Scriptures 
6181_216552_000034_000000	train-clean-100	But indeed what guide did the law follow in creating the domain of property 
6181_216552_000034_000001	train-clean-100	What principle directed it 
6181_216552_000034_000002	train-clean-100	What was its standard 
6181_216552_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Would you believe it 
6181_216552_000035_000001	train-clean-100	It was equality 
6181_216552_000036_000000	train-clean-100	Agriculture was the foundation of territorial possession and the original cause of property 
none	none	It was of no use to secure to the farmer the fruit of his labor unless the means of production were at the same time secured to him To fortify the weak against the invasion of the strong to suppress spoliation and fraud the necessity was felt of establishing between possessors permanent lines of division insuperable obstacles Every year saw the people multiply and the cupidity of the husbandman increase it was thought best to put a bridle on ambition by setting boundaries which ambition would in vain attempt to overstep 
6181_216552_000036_000003	train-clean-100	Thus the soil came to be appropriated through need of the equality which is essential to public security and peaceable possession 
6181_216552_000036_000004	train-clean-100	Undoubtedly the division was never geographically equal a multitude of rights some founded in Nature but wrongly interpreted and still more wrongly applied inheritance gift and exchange others like the privileges of birth and position the illegitimate creations of ignorance and brute force all operated to prevent absolute equality 
6181_216552_000036_000005	train-clean-100	But nevertheless the principle remained the same equality had sanctioned possession equality sanctioned property 
none	none	The husbandman needed each year a field to sow what more convenient and simple arrangement for the barbarians instead of indulging in annual quarrels and fights instead of continually moving their houses furniture and families from spot to spot than to assign to each individual a fixed and inalienable estate 
6181_216552_000038_000000	train-clean-100	It was not right that the soldier on returning from an expedition should find himself dispossessed on account of the services which he had just rendered to his country his estate ought to be restored to him 
none	none	It became therefore customary to retain property by intent alone nudo animo it could be sacrificed only with the consent and by the action of the proprietor It was necessary that the equality in the division should be kept up from one generation to another without a new distribution of the land upon the death of each family it appeared therefore natural and just that children and parents according to the degree of relationship which they bore to the deceased should be the heirs of their ancestors Thence came in the first place the feudal and patriarchal custom of recognizing only one heir then by a quite contrary application of the principle of equality the admission of all the children to a share in their father s estate and very recently also among us the definitive abolition of the right of primogeniture 
6181_216552_000040_000000	train-clean-100	But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive organization and the true social science 
6181_216552_000040_000001	train-clean-100	How could these men who never had the faintest idea of statistics valuation or political economy furnish us with principles of legislation 
none	none	The law says a modern writer on jurisprudence is the expression of a social want the declaration of a fact the legislator does not make it he declares it
6181_216552_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 This definition is not exact 
none	none	The law is a method by which social wants must be satisfied the people do not vote it the legislator does not express it the savant discovers and formulates it But in fact the law according to M Ch 
6181_216552_000041_000003	train-clean-100	Comte who has devoted half a volume to its definition was in the beginning only the EXPRESSION OF A WANT and the indication of the means of supplying it and up to this time it has been nothing else 
none	none	The legists with mechanical fidelity full of obstinacy enemies of philosophy buried in literalities have always mistaken for the last word of science that which was only the inconsiderate aspiration of men who to be sure were well meaning but wanting in foresight They did not foresee these old founders of the domain of property that the perpetual and absolute right to retain one s estate a right which seemed to them equitable because it was common involves the right to transfer sell give gain and lose it that it tends consequently to nothing less than the destruction of that equality which they established it to maintain And though they should have foreseen it they disregarded it the present want occupied their whole attention and as ordinarily happens in such cases the disadvantages were at first scarcely perceptible and they passed unnoticed They did not foresee these ingenuous legislators that if property is retainable by intent alone nudo animo it carries with it the right to let to lease to loan at interest to profit by exchange to settle annuities and to levy a tax on a field which intent reserves while the body is busy elsewhere They did not foresee these fathers of our jurisprudence that if the right of inheritance is any thing other than Nature s method of preserving equality of wealth families will soon become victims of the most disastrous exclusions and society pierced to the heart by one of its most sacred principles will come to its death through opulence and misery twelve Under whatever form of government we live it can always be said that le mort saisit le vif that is that inheritance and succession will last for ever whoever may be the recognized heir But the saint Simonians wish the heir to be designated by the magistrate others wish him to be chosen by the deceased or assumed by the law to be so chosen the essential point is that Nature s wish be satisfied so far as the law of equality allows To day the real controller of inheritance is chance or caprice now in matters of legislation chance and caprice cannot be accepted as guides It is for the purpose of avoiding the manifold disturbances which follow in the wake of chance that Nature after having created us equal suggests to us the principle of heredity which serves as a voice by which society asks us to choose from among all our brothers him whom we judge best fitted to complete our unfinished work They did not foresee 
6181_216552_000047_000001	train-clean-100	But why need I go farther 
6181_216552_000048_000000	train-clean-100	The consequences are plain enough and this is not the time to criticise the whole Code 
6181_216552_000049_000000	train-clean-100	The history of property among the ancient nations is then simply a matter of research and curiosity 
none	none	It is a rule of jurisprudence that the fact does not substantiate the right 
6181_216552_000049_000002	train-clean-100	Now property is no exception to this rule then the universal recognition of the right of property does not legitimate the right of property 
6181_216552_000049_000003	train-clean-100	Man is mistaken as to the constitution of society the nature of right and the application of justice just as he was mistaken regarding the cause of meteors and the movement of the heavenly bodies 
6181_216552_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 the application of justice 
none	none	just as he was mistaken regarding the cause of meteors and the movement of the heavenly bodies 
6181_216552_000049_000004	train-clean-100	His old opinions cannot be taken for articles of faith 
6181_216552_000049_000005	train-clean-100	Of what consequence is it to us that the Indian race was divided into four classes that on the banks of the Nile and the Ganges blood and position formerly determined the distribution of the land that the Greeks and Romans placed property under the protection of the gods that they accompanied with religious ceremonies the work of partitioning the land and appraising their goods 
none	none	The variety of the forms of privilege does not sanction injustice The faith of Jupiter the proprietor thirteen proves no more against the equality of citizens than do the mysteries of Venus the wanton against conjugal chastity The authority of the human race is of no effect as evidence in favor of the right of property because this right resting of necessity upon equality contradicts its principle the decision of the religions which have sanctioned it is of no effect because in all ages the priest has submitted to the prince and the gods have always spoken as the politicians desired the social advantages attributed to property cannot be cited in its behalf because they all spring from the principle of equality of possession What means then this dithyramb upon property
6181_216552_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 The right of property is the most important of human institutions 
none	none	Yes as monarchy is the most glorious
6181_216552_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 The original cause of man s prosperity upon earth 
6181_216552_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Because justice was supposed to be its principle 
6181_216552_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Property became the legitimate end of his ambition the hope of his existence the shelter of his family in a word the corner stone of the domestic dwelling of communities and of the political State 
6181_216552_000057_000000	train-clean-100	Possession alone produced all that 
6181_216552_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 Eternal principle 
6181_216552_000059_000000	train-clean-100	Property is eternal like every negation 
none	none	Of all social and civil institutions 
6181_216552_000061_000000	train-clean-100	For that reason every institution and every law based on property will perish 
6181_216552_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 It is a boon as precious as liberty 
6181_216552_000063_000000	train-clean-100	For the rich proprietor 
6181_216552_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 In fact the cause of the cultivation of the habitable earth 
6181_216552_000065_000000	train-clean-100	If the cultivator ceased to be a tenant would the land be worse cared for 
6181_216552_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 The guarantee and the morality of labor 
6181_216552_000067_000000	train-clean-100	Under the regime of property labor is not a condition but a privilege 
none	none	The application of justice 
6181_216552_000069_000000	train-clean-100	What is justice without equality of fortunes 
6181_216552_000069_000001	train-clean-100	A balance with false weights 
none	none	All morality 
6181_216552_000071_000000	train-clean-100	A famished stomach knows no morality 
6181_216552_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 All public order 
6181_216552_000073_000000	train-clean-100	Certainly the preservation of property 
none	none	Rest on the right of property fourteen 
6181_216552_000075_000000	train-clean-100	Corner stone of all which is stumbling block of all which ought to be such is property 
6181_216552_000076_000000	train-clean-100	To sum up and conclude 
6181_216552_000077_000000	train-clean-100	Not only does occupation lead to equality it PREVENTS property 
none	none	For since every man from the fact of his existence has the right of occupation and in order to live must have material for cultivation on which he may labor and since on the other hand the number of occupants varies continually with the births and deaths it follows that the quantity of material which each laborer may claim varies with the number of occupants consequently that occupation is always subordinate to population 
6181_216552_000077_000002	train-clean-100	Finally that inasmuch as possession in right can never remain fixed it is impossible in fact that it can ever become property

none	none	CHAPTER III LABOR AS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY Nearly all the modern writers on jurisprudence taking their cue from the economists have abandoned the theory of first occupancy as a too dangerous one and have adopted that which regards property as born of labor In this they are deluded they reason in a circle To labor it is necessary to occupy says M Cousin Consequently I have added in my turn all having an equal right of occupancy to labor it is necessary to submit to equality The rich exclaims Jean Jacques have the arrogance to say I built this wall I earned this land by my labor Who set you the tasks we may reply and by what right do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose upon you All sophistry falls to the ground in the presence of this argument But the partisans of labor do not see that their system is an absolute contradiction of the Code all the articles and provisions of which suppose property to be based upon the fact of first occupancy If labor through the appropriation which results from it alone gives birth to property the Civil Code lies the charter is a falsehood our whole social system is a violation of right To this conclusion shall we come at the end of the discussion which is to occupy our attention in this chapter and the following one both as to the right of labor and the fact of property We shall see on the one hand our legislation in opposition to itself and on the other hand our new jurisprudence in opposition both to its own principle and to our legislation I have asserted that the system which bases property upon labor implies no less than that which bases it upon occupation the equality of fortunes and the reader must be impatient to learn how I propose to deduce this law of equality from the inequality of skill and faculties directly his curiosity shall be satisfied But it is proper that I should call his attention for a moment to this remarkable feature of the process to wit the substitution of labor for occupation as the principle of property and that I should pass rapidly in review some of the prejudices to which proprietors are accustomed to appeal which legislation has sanctioned and which the system of labor completely overthrows Reader were you ever present at the examination of a criminal Have you watched his tricks his turns his evasions his distinctions his equivocations Beaten all his assertions overthrown pursued like a fallow deer by the in exorable judge tracked from hypothesis to hypothesis he makes a statement he corrects it retracts it contradicts it he exhausts all the tricks of dialectics more subtle more ingenious a thousand times than he who invented the seventy two forms of the syllogism So acts the proprietor when called upon to defend his right At first he refuses to reply he exclaims he threatens he defies then forced to accept the discussion he arms himself with chicanery he surrounds himself with formidable artillery crossing his fire opposing one by one and all together occupation possession limitation covenants immemorial custom and universal consent Conquered on this ground the proprietor like a wounded boar turns on his pursuers I have done more than occupy he cries with terrible emotion I have labored produced improved transformed CREATED This house these fields these trees are the work of my hands I changed these brambles into a vineyard and this bush into a fig tree and to day I reap the harvest of my labors I have enriched the soil with my sweat I have paid those men who had they not had the work which I gave them would have died of hunger No one shared with me the trouble and expense no one shall share with me the benefits You have labored proprietor why then do you speak of original occupancy What were you not sure of your right or did you hope to deceive men and make justice an illusion Make haste then to acquaint us with your mode of defence for the judgment will be final and you know it to be a question of restitution You have labored but what is there in common between the labor which duty compels you to perform and the appropriation of things in which there is a common interest Do you not know that domain over the soil like that over air and light cannot be lost by prescription You have labored have you never made others labor Why then have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring for them You have labored very well but let us see the results of your labor We will count weigh and measure them It will be the judgment of Balthasar for I swear by balance level and square that if you have appropriated another s labor in any way whatsoever you shall restore it every stroke Thus the principle of occupation is abandoned no longer is it said The land belongs to him who first gets possession of it Property forced into its first intrenchment repudiates its old adage justice ashamed retracts her maxims and sorrow lowers her bandage over her blushing cheeks And it was but yesterday that this progress in social philosophy began fifty centuries required for the extirpation of a lie During this lamentable period how many usurpations have been sanctioned how many invasions glorified how many conquests celebrated The absent dispossessed the poor banished the hungry excluded by wealth which is so ready and bold in action Jealousies and wars incendiarism and bloodshed among the nations But henceforth thanks to the age and its spirit it is to be admitted that the earth is not a prize to be won in a race in the absence of any other obstacle there is a place for everybody under the sun Each one may harness his goat to the bearn drive his cattle to pasture sow a corner of a field and bake his bread by his own fireside But no each one cannot do these things I hear it proclaimed on all sides Glory to labor and industry to each according to his capacity to each capacity according to its results And I see three fourths of the human race again despoiled the labor of a few being a scourge to the labor of the rest The problem is solved exclaims M Hennequin Property the daughter of labor can be enjoyed at present and in the future only under the protection of the laws It has its origin in natural law it derives its power from civil law and from the union of these two ideas LABOR and PROTECTION positive legislation results Ah THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED PROPERTY IS THE DAUGHTER OF LABOR What then is the right of accession and the right of succession and the right of donation c if not the right to become a proprietor by simple occupancy What are your laws concerning the age of majority emancipation guardianship and interdiction if not the various conditions by which he who is already a laborer gains or loses the right of occupancy that is property Being unable at this time to enter upon a detailed discussion of the Code I shall content myself with examining the three arguments oftenest resorted to in support of property one APPROPRIATION or the formation of property by possession two THE CONSENT OF MANKIND three PRESCRIPTION I shall then inquire into the effects of labor upon the relative condition of the laborers and upon property one The Land cannot be Appropriated It would seem that lands capable of cultivation ought to be regarded as natural wealth since they are not of human creation but Nature s gratuitous gift to man but inasmuch as this wealth is not fugitive like the air and water inasmuch as a field is a fixed and limited space which certain men have been able to appropriate to the exclusion of all others who in their turn have consented to this appropriation the land which was a natural and gratuitous gift has become social wealth for the use of which we ought to pay SAY POLITICAL ECONOMY Was I wrong in saying at the beginning of this chapter that the economists are the very worst authorities in matters of legislation and philosophy It is the FATHER of this class of men who clearly states the question How can the supplies of Nature the wealth created by Providence become private property and who replies by so gross an equivocation that we scarcely know which the author lacks sense or honesty What I ask has the fixed and solid nature of the earth to do with the right of appropriation I can understand that a thing LIMITED and STATIONARY like the land offers greater chances for appropriation than the water or the sunshine that it is easier to exercise the right of domain over the soil than over the atmosphere but we are not dealing with the difficulty of the thing and Say confounds the right with the possibility We do not ask why the earth has been appropriated to a greater extent than the sea and the air we want to know by what right man has appropriated wealth WHICH HE DID NOT CREATE AND WHICH NATURE GAVE TO HIM GRATUITOUSLY Say then did not solve the question which he asked But if he had solved it if the explanation which he has given us were as satisfactory as it is illogical we should know no better than before who has a right to exact payment for the use of the soil of this wealth which is not man s handiwork Who is entitled to the rent of the land The producer of the land without doubt Who made the land God Then proprietor retire But the creator of the land does not sell it he gives it and in giving it he is no respecter of persons Why then are some of his children regarded as legitimate while others are treated as bastards If the equality of shares was an original right why is the inequality of conditions a posthumous right Say gives us to understand that if the air and the water were not of a FUGITIVE nature they would have been appropriated Let me observe in passing that this is more than an hypothesis it is a reality Men have appropriated the air and the water I will not say as often as they could but as often as they have been allowed to The Portuguese having discovered the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope pretended to have the sole right to that route and Grotius consulted in regard to this matter by the Dutch who refused to recognize this right wrote expressly for this occasion his treatise on the Freedom of the Seas to prove that the sea is not liable to appropriation The right to hunt and fish used always to be confined to lords and proprietors to day it is leased by the government and communes to whoever can pay the license fee and the rent To regulate hunting and fishing is an excellent idea but to make it a subject of sale is to create a monopoly of air and water What is a passport A universal recommendation of the traveller s person a certificate of security for himself and his property The treasury whose nature it is to spoil the best things has made the passport a means of espionage and a tax Is not this a sale of the right to travel Finally it is permissible neither to draw water from a spring situated in another s grounds without the permission of the proprietor because by the right of accession the spring belongs to the possessor of the soil if there is no other claim nor to pass a day on his premises without paying a tax nor to look at a court a garden or an orchard without the consent of the proprietor nor to stroll in a park or an enclosure against the owner s will every one is allowed to shut himself up and to fence himself in All these prohibitions are so many positive interdictions not only of the land but of the air and water We who belong to the proletaire class property excommunicates us Terra et aqua et aere et igne interdicti sumus Men could not appropriate the most fixed of all the elements without appropriating the three others since by French and Roman law property in the surface carries with it property from zenith to nadir Cujus est solum ejus est usque ad caelum Now if the use of water air and fire excludes property so does the use of the soil This chain of reasoning seems to have been presented by M Ch Comte in his Treatise on Property chap five If a man should be deprived of air for a few moments only he would cease to exist and a partial deprivation would cause him severe suffering a partial or complete deprivation of food would produce like effects upon him though less suddenly it would be the same at least in certain climates were he deprived of all clothing and shelter To sustain life then man needs continually to appropriate many different things But these things do not exist in like proportions Some such as the light of the stars the atmosphere of the earth the water composing the seas and oceans exist in such large quantities that men cannot perceive any sensible increase or diminution each one can appropriate as much as his needs require without detracting from the enjoyment of others without causing them the least harm Things of this sort are so to speak the common property of the human race the only duty imposed upon each individual in this regard is that of infringing not at all upon the rights of others Let us complete the argument of M Ch Comte A man who should be prohibited from walking in the highways from resting in the fields from taking shelter in caves from lighting fires from picking berries from gathering herbs and boiling them in a bit of baked clay such a man could not live Consequently the earth like water air and light is a primary object of necessity which each has a right to use freely without infringing another s right Why then is the earth appropriated M Ch Comte s reply is a curious one Say pretends that it is because it is not FUGITIVE M Ch Comte assures us that it is because it is not INFINITE The land is limited in amount Then according to M Ch Comte it ought to be appropriated It would seem on the contrary that he ought to say Then it ought not to be appropriated Because no matter how large a quantity of air or light any one appropriates no one is damaged thereby there always remains enough for all With the soil it is very different Lay hold who will or who can of the sun s rays the passing breeze or the sea s billows he has my consent and my pardon for his bad intentions But let any living man dare to change his right of territorial possession into the right of property and I will declare war upon him and wage it to the death M Ch Comte s argument disproves his position Among the things necessary to the preservation of life he says there are some which exist in such large quantities that they are inexhaustible others which exist in lesser quantities and can satisfy the wants of only a certain number of persons The former are called COMMON the latter PRIVATE This reasoning is not strictly logical Water air and light are COMMON things not because they are INEXHAUSTIBLE but because they are INDISPENSABLE and so indispensable that for that very reason Nature has created them in quantities almost infinite in order that their plentifulness might prevent their appropriation Likewise the land is indispensable to our existence consequently a common thing consequently insusceptible of appropriation but land is much scarcer than the other elements therefore its use must be regulated not for the profit of a few but in the interest and for the security of all In a word equality of rights is proved by equality of needs Now equality of rights in the case of a commodity which is limited in amount can be realized only by equality of possession An agrarian law underlies M Ch Comte s arguments From whatever point we view this question of property provided we go to the bottom of it we reach equality I will not insist farther on the distinction between things which can and things which cannot be appropriated On this point economists and legists talk worse than nonsense The Civil Code after having defined property says nothing about susceptibility of appropriation and if it speaks of things which are in THE MARKET it always does so without enumerating or describing them However light is not wanting There are some few maxims such as these Ad reges potestas omnium pertinet ad singulos proprietas Omnia rex imperio possidet singula dominio Social sovereignty opposed to private property might not that be called a prophecy of equality a republican oracle Examples crowd upon us once the possessions of the church the estates of the crown the fiefs of the nobility were inalienable and imprescriptible If instead of abolishing this privilege the Constituent had extended it to every individual if it had declared that the right of labor like liberty can never be forfeited at that moment the revolution would have been consummated and we could now devote ourselves to improvement in other directions two Universal Consent no Justification of Property In the extract from Say quoted above it is not clear whether the author means to base the right of property on the stationary character of the soil or on the consent which he thinks all men have granted to this appropriation His language is such that it may mean either of these things or both at once which entitles us to assume that the author intended to say The right of property resulting originally from the exercise of the will the stability of the soil permitted it to be applied to the land and universal consent has since sanctioned this application However that may be can men legitimate property by mutual consent I say no Such a contract though drafted by Grotius Montesquieu and J J Rousseau though signed by the whole human race would be null in the eyes of justice and an act to enforce it would be illegal Man can no more give up labor than liberty Now to recognize the right of territorial property is to give up labor since it is to relinquish the means of labor it is to traffic in a natural right and divest ourselves of manhood But I wish that this consent of which so much is made had been given either tacitly or formally What would have been the result Evidently the surrenders would have been reciprocal no right would have been abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange We thus come back to equality again the sine qua non of appropriation so that after having justified property by universal consent that is by equality we are obliged to justify the inequality of conditions by property Never shall we extricate ourselves from this dilemma Indeed if in the terms of the social compact property has equality for its condition at the moment when equality ceases to exist the compact is broken and all property becomes usurpation We gain nothing then by this pretended consent of mankind three Prescription Gives No Title to Property The right of property was the origin of evil on the earth the first link in the long chain of crimes and misfortunes which the human race has endured since its birth The delusion of prescription is the fatal charm thrown over the intellect the death sentence breathed into the conscience to arrest man s progress towards truth and bolster up the worship of error The Code defines prescription thus The process of gaining and losing through the lapse of time In applying this definition to ideas and beliefs we may use the word PRESCRIPTION to denote the everlasting prejudice in favor of old superstitions whatever be their object the opposition often furious and bloody with which new light has always been received and which makes the sage a martyr Not a principle not a discovery not a generous thought but has met at its entrance into the world with a formidable barrier of preconceived opinions seeming like a conspiracy of all old prejudices Prescriptions against reason prescriptions against facts prescriptions against every truth hitherto unknown that is the sum and substance of the statu quo philosophy the watchword of conservatives throughout the centuries When the evangelical reform was broached to the world there was prescription in favor of violence debauchery and selfishness when Galileo Descartes Pascal and their disciples reconstructed philosophy and the sciences there was prescription in favor of the Aristotelian philosophy when our fathers of eighty nine demanded liberty and equality there was prescription in favor of tyranny and privilege There always have been proprietors and there always will be it is with this profound utterance the final effort of selfishness dying in its last ditch that the friends of social inequality hope to repel the attacks of their adversaries thinking undoubtedly that ideas like property can be lost by prescription Enlightened to day by the triumphal march of science taught by the most glorious successes to question our own opinions we receive with favor and applause the observer of Nature who by a thousand experiments based upon the most profound analysis pursues a new principle a law hitherto undiscovered We take care to repel no idea no fact under the pretext that abler men than ourselves lived in former days who did not notice the same phenomena nor grasp the same analogies Why do we not preserve a like attitude towards political and philosophical questions Why this ridiculous mania for affirming that every thing has been said which means that we know all about mental and moral science Why is the proverb THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN applied exclusively to metaphysical investigations Because we still study philosophy with the imagination instead of by observation and method because fancy and will are universally regarded as judges in the place of arguments and facts it has been impossible to this day to distinguish the charlatan from the philosopher the savant from the impostor Since the days of Solomon and Pythagoras imagination has been exhausted in guessing out social and psychological laws all systems have been proposed Looked at in this light it is probably true that EVERY THING HAS BEEN SAID but it is no less true that EVERY THING REMAINS TO BE PROVED In politics to take only this branch of philosophy in politics every one is governed in his choice of party by his passion and his interests the mind is submitted to the impositions of the will there is no knowledge there is not even a shadow of certainty In this way general ignorance produces general tyranny and while liberty of thought is written in the charter slavery of thought under the name of MAJORITY RULE is decreed by the charter In order to confine myself to the civil prescription of which the Code speaks I shall refrain from beginning a discussion upon this worn out objection brought forward by proprietors it would be too tiresome and declamatory Everybody knows that there are rights which cannot be prescribed and as for those things which can be gained through the lapse of time no one is ignorant of the fact that prescription requires certain conditions the omission of one of which renders it null If it is true for example that the proprietor s possession has been CIVIL PUBLIC PEACEABLE and UNINTERRUPTED it is none the less true that it is not based on a just title since the only titles which it can show occupation and labor prove as much for the proletaire who demands as for the proprietor who defends Further this possession is DISHONEST since it is founded on a violation of right which prevents prescription according to the saying of saint Paul Nunquam in usucapionibus juris error possessori prodest The violation of right lies either in the fact that the holder possesses as proprietor while he should possess only as usufructuary or in the fact that he has purchased a thing which no one had a right to transfer or sell Another reason why prescription cannot be adduced in favor of property a reason borrowed from jurisprudence is that the right to possess real estate is a part of a universal right which has never been totally destroyed even at the most critical periods and the proletaire in order to regain the power to exercise it fully has only to prove that he has always exercised it in part He for example who has the universal right to possess give exchange loan let sell transform or destroy a thing preserves the integrity of this right by the sole act of loaning though he has never shown his authority in any other manner Likewise we shall see that EQUALITY OF POSSESSIONS EQUALITY OF RIGHTS LIBERTY WILL PERSONALITY are so many identical expressions of one and the same idea the RIGHT OF PRESERVATION and DEVELOPMENT in a word the right of life against which there can be no prescription until the human race has vanished from the face of the earth Finally as to the time required for prescription it would be superfluous to show that the right of property in general cannot be acquired by simple possession for ten twenty a hundred a thousand or one hundred thousand years and that so long as there exists a human head capable of understanding and combating the right of property this right will never be prescribed For principles of jurisprudence and axioms of reason are different from accidental and contingent facts One man s possession can prescribe against another man s possession but just as the possessor cannot prescribe against himself so reason has always the faculty of change and reformation Past error is not binding on the future Reason is always the same eternal force The institution of property the work of ignorant reason may be abrogated by a more enlightened reason Consequently property cannot be established by prescription This is so certain and so true that on it rests the maxim that in the matter of prescription a violation of right goes for nothing But I should be recreant to my method and the reader would have the right to accuse me of charlatanism and bad faith if I had nothing further to advance concerning prescription I showed in the first place that appropriation of land is illegal and that supposing it to be legal it must be accompanied by equality of property I have shown in the second place that universal consent proves nothing in favor of property and that if it proves any thing it proves equality of property I have yet to show that prescription if admissible at all presupposes equality of property This demonstration will be neither long nor difficult I need only to call attention to the reasons why prescription was introduced Prescription says Dunod seems repugnant to natural equity which permits no one either to deprive another of his possessions without his knowledge and consent or to enrich himself at another s expense But as it might often happen in the absence of prescription that one who had honestly earned would be ousted after long possession and even that he who had received a thing from its rightful owner or who had been legitimately relieved from all obligations would on losing his title be liable to be dispossessed or subjected again the public welfare demanded that a term should be fixed after the expiration of which no one should be allowed to disturb actual possessors or reassert rights too long neglected The civil law in regulating prescription has aimed then only to perfect natural law and to supplement the law of nations and as it is founded on the public good which should always be considered before individual welfare bono publico usucapio introducta est it should be regarded with favor provided the conditions required by the law are fulfilled Toullier in his Civil Law says In order that the question of proprietorship may not remain too long unsettled and thereby injure the public welfare disturbing the peace of families and the stability of social transactions the law has fixed a time when all claims shall be cancelled and possession shall regain its ancient prerogative through its transformation into property Cassiodorus said of property that it was the only safe harbor in which to seek shelter from the tempests of chicanery and the gales of avarice Hic unus inter humanas pro cellas portus quem si homines fervida voluntate praeterierint in undosis semper jurgiis errabunt Thus in the opinion of the authors prescription is a means of preserving public order a restoration in certain cases of the original mode of acquiring property a fiction of the civil law which derives all its force from the necessity of settling differences which otherwise would never end For as Grotius says time has no power to produce effects all things happen in time but nothing is done by time Prescription or the right of acquisition through the lapse of time is therefore a fiction of the law conventionally adopted But all property necessarily originated in prescription or as the Latins say in usucapion that is in continued possession I ask then in the first place how possession can become property by the lapse of time Continue possession as long as you wish continue it for years and for centuries you never can give duration which of itself creates nothing changes nothing modifies nothing the power to change the usufructuary into a proprietor Let the civil law secure against chance comers the honest possessor who has held his position for many years that only confirms a right already respected and prescription applied in this way simply means that possession which has continued for twenty thirty or a hundred years shall be retained by the occupant But when the law declares that the lapse of time changes possessor into proprietor it supposes that a right can be created without a producing cause it unwarrantably alters the character of the subject it legislates on a matter not open to legislation it exceeds its own powers Public order and private security ask only that possession shall be protected Why has the law created property Prescription was simply security for the future why has the law made it a matter of privilege Thus the origin of prescription is identical with that of property itself and since the latter can legitimate itself only when accompanied by equality prescription is but another of the thousand forms which the necessity of maintaining this precious equality has taken And this is no vain induction no far fetched inference The proof is written in all the codes And indeed if all nations through their instinct of justice and their conservative nature have recognized the utility and the necessity of prescription and if their design has been to guard thereby the interests of the possessor could they not do something for the absent citizen separated from his family and his country by commerce war or captivity and in no position to exercise his right of possession No Also at the same time that prescription was introduced into the laws it was admitted that property is preserved by intent alone nudo animo Now if property is preserved by intent alone if it can be lost only by the action of the proprietor what can be the use of prescription How does the law dare to presume that the proprietor who preserves by intent alone intended to abandon that which he has allowed to be prescribed What lapse of time can warrant such a conjecture and by what right does the law punish the absence of the proprietor by depriving him of his goods What then we found but a moment since that prescription and property were identical and now we find that they are mutually destructive Grotius who perceived this difficulty replied so singularly that his words deserve to be quoted Bene sperandum de hominibus ac propterea non putandum eos hoc esse animo ut rei caducae causa hominem alterum velint in perpetuo peccato versari quo d evitari saepe non poterit sine tali derelictione Where is the man he says with so unchristian a soul that for a trifle he would perpetuate the trespass of a possessor which would inevitably be the result if he did not consent to abandon his right By the Eternal I am that man Though a million proprietors should burn for it in hell I lay the blame on them for depriving me of my portion of this world s goods To this powerful consideration Grotius rejoins that it is better to abandon a disputed right than to go to law disturb the peace of nations and stir up the flames of civil war I accept if you wish it this argument provided you indemnify me But if this indemnity is refused me what do I a proletaire care for the tranquillity and security of the rich I care as little for PUBLIC ORDER as for the proprietor s safety I ask to live a laborer otherwise I will die a warrior Whichever way we turn we shall come to the conclusion that prescription is a contradiction of property or rather that prescription and property are two forms of the same principle but two forms which serve to correct each other and ancient and modern jurisprudence did not make the least of its blunders in pretending to reconcile them Indeed if we see in the institution of property only a desire to secure to each individual his share of the soil and his right to labor in the distinction between naked property and possession only an asylum for absentees orphans and all who do not know or cannot maintain their rights in prescription only a means either of defence against unjust pretensions and encroachments or of settlement of the differences caused by the removal of possessors we shall recognize in these various forms of human justice the spontaneous efforts of the mind to come to the aid of the social instinct we shall see in this protection of all rights the sentiment of equality a constant levelling tendency And looking deeper we shall find in the very exaggeration of these principles the confirmation of our doctrine because if equality of conditions and universal association are not soon realized it will be owing to the obstacle thrown for the time in the way of the common sense of the people by the stupidity of legislators and judges and also to the fact that while society in its original state was illuminated with a flash of truth the early speculations of its leaders could bring forth nothing but darkness After the first covenants after the first draughts of laws and constitutions which were the expression of man s primary needs the legislator s duty was to reform the errors of legislation to complete that which was defective to harmonize by superior definitions those things which seemed to conflict Instead of that they halted at the literal meaning of the laws content to play the subordinate part of commentators and scholiasts Taking the inspirations of the human mind at that time necessarily weak and faulty for axioms of eternal and unquestionable truth influenced by public opinion enslaved by the popular religion they have invariably started with the principle following in this respect the example of the theologians that that is infallibly true which has been admitted by all persons in all places and at all times quod ab omnibus quod ubique quod semper as if a general but spontaneous opinion was any thing more than an indication of the truth Let us not be deceived the opinion of all nations may serve to authenticate the perception of a fact the vague sentiment of a law it can teach us nothing about either fact or law The consent of mankind is an indication of Nature not as Cicero says a law of Nature Under the indication is hidden the truth which faith can believe but only thought can know Such has been the constant progress of the human mind in regard to physical phenomena and the creations of genius how can it be otherwise with the facts of conscience and the rules of human conduct four Labor That Labor Has No Inherent Power to Appropriate Natural Wealth We shall show by the maxims of political economy and law that is by the authorities recognized by property one That labor has no inherent power to appropriate natural wealth two That if we admit that labor has this power we are led directly to equality of property whatever the kind of labor however scarce the product or unequal the ability of the laborers three That in the order of justice labor DESTROYS property Following the example of our opponents and that we may leave no obstacles in the path let us examine the question in the strongest possible light M Ch Comte says in his Treatise on Property France considered as a nation has a territory which is her own France as an individuality possesses a territory which she cultivates it is not her property Nations are related to each other as individuals are they are commoners and workers it is an abuse of language to call them proprietors The right of use and abuse belongs no more to nations than to men and the time will come when a war waged for the purpose of checking a nation in its abuse of the soil will be regarded as a holy war Thus M Ch Comte who undertakes to explain how property comes into existence and who starts with the supposition that a nation is a proprietor falls into that error known as BEGGING THE QUESTION a mistake which vitiates his whole argument If the reader thinks it is pushing logic too far to question a nation s right of property in the territory which it possesses I will simply remind him of the fact that at all ages the results of the fictitious right of national property have been pretensions to suzerainty tributes monarchical privileges statute labor quotas of men and money supplies of merchandise c ending finally in refusals to pay taxes insurrections wars and depopulations Scattered through this territory are extended tracts of land which have not been converted into individual property These lands which consist mainly of forests belong to the whole population and the government which receives the revenues uses or ought to use them in the interest of all OUGHT TO USE is well said a lie is avoided thereby Let them be offered for sale Why offered for sale Who has a right to sell them Even were the nation proprietor can the generation of to day dispossess the generation of to morrow The nation in its function of usufructuary possesses them the government rules superintends and protects them If it also granted lands it could grant only their use it has no right to sell them or transfer them in any way whatever Not being a proprietor how can it transmit property Suppose some industrious man buys a portion a large swamp for example This would be no usurpation since the public would receive the exact value through the hands of the government and would be as rich after the sale as before How ridiculous What because a prodigal imprudent incompetent official sells the State s possessions while I a ward of the State I who have neither an advisory nor a deliberative voice in the State councils while I am allowed to make no opposition to the sale this sale is right and legal The guardians of the nation waste its substance and it has no redress I have received you tell me through the hands of the government my share of the proceeds of the sale but in the first place I did not wish to sell and had I wished to I could not have sold I had not the right And then I do not see that I am benefited by the sale My guardians have dressed up some soldiers repaired an old fortress erected in their pride some costly but worthless monument then they have exploded some fireworks and set up a greased pole What does all that amount to in comparison with my loss The purchaser draws boundaries fences himself in and says This is mine each one by himself each one for himself Here then is a piece of land upon which henceforth no one has a right to step save the proprietor and his friends which can benefit nobody save the proprietor and his servants Let these sales multiply and soon the people who have been neither able nor willing to sell and who have received none of the proceeds of the sale will have nowhere to rest no place of shelter no ground to till They will die of hunger at the proprietor s door on the edge of that property which was their birthright and the proprietor watching them die will exclaim So perish idlers and vagrants To reconcile us to the proprietor s usurpation M Ch Comte assumes the lands to be of little value at the time of sale The importance of these usurpations should not be exaggerated they should be measured by the number of men which the occupied land would support and by the means which it would furnish them It is evident for instance that if a piece of land which is worth to day one thousand francs was worth only five centimes when it was usurped we really lose only the value of five centimes A square league of earth would be hardly sufficient to support a savage in distress to day it supplies one thousand persons with the means of existence Nine hundred and ninety nine parts of this land is the legitimate property of the possessors only one thousandth of the value has been usurped A peasant admitted one day at confession that he had destroyed a document which declared him a debtor to the amount of three hundred francs Said the father confessor You must return these three hundred francs No replied the peasant I will return a penny to pay for the paper M Ch Comte s logic resembles this peasant s honesty The soil has not only an integrant and actual value it has also a potential value a value of the future which depends on our ability to make it valuable and to employ it in our work Destroy a bill of exchange a promissory note an annuity deed as a paper you destroy almost no value at all but with this paper you destroy your title and in losing your title you deprive yourself of your goods Destroy the land or what is the same thing sell it you not only transfer one two or several crops but you annihilate all the products that you could derive from it you and your children and your children s children When M Ch Comte the apostle of property and the eulogist of labor supposes an alienation of the soil on the part of the government we must not think that he does so without reason and for no purpose it is a necessary part of his position As he rejected the theory of occupancy and as he knew moreover that labor could not constitute the right in the absence of a previous permission to occupy he was obliged to connect this permission with the authority of the government which means that property is based upon the sovereignty of the people in other words upon universal consent This theory we have already considered To say that property is the daughter of labor and then to give labor material on which to exercise itself is if I am not mistaken to reason in a circle Contradictions will result from it A piece of land of a certain size produces food enough to supply a man for one day If the possessor through his labor discovers some method of making it produce enough for two days he doubles its value This new value is his work his creation it is taken from nobody it is his property I maintain that the possessor is paid for his trouble and industry in his doubled crop but that he acquires no right to the land Let the laborer have the fruits of his labor Very good but I do not understand that property in products carries with it property in raw material Does the skill of the fisherman who on the same coast can catch more fish than his fellows make him proprietor of the fishing grounds Can the expertness of a hunter ever be regarded as a property title to a game forest The analogy is perfect the industrious cultivator finds the reward of his industry in the abundancy and superiority of his crop If he has made improvements in the soil he has the possessor s right of preference Never under any circumstances can he be allowed to claim a property title to the soil which he cultivates on the ground of his skill as a cultivator To change possession into property something is needed besides labor without which a man would cease to be proprietor as soon as he ceased to be a laborer Now the law bases property upon immemorial unquestionable possession that is prescription Labor is only the sensible sign the physical act by which occupation is manifested If then the cultivator remains proprietor after he has ceased to labor and produce if his possession first conceded then tolerated finally becomes inalienable it happens by permission of the civil law and by virtue of the principle of occupancy So true is this that there is not a bill of sale not a farm lease not an annuity but implies it I will quote only one example How do we measure the value of land By its product If a piece of land yields one thousand francs we say that at five per cent it is worth twenty thousand francs at four per cent twenty five thousand francs c which means in other words that in twenty or twenty five years time the purchaser would recover in full the amount originally paid for the land If then after a certain length of time the price of a piece of land has been wholly recovered why does the purchaser continue to be proprietor Because of the right of occupancy in the absence of which every sale would be a redemption The theory of appropriation by labor is then a contradiction of the Code and when the partisans of this theory pretend to explain the laws thereby they contradict themselves If men succeed in fertilizing land hitherto unproductive or even death producing like certain swamps they create thereby property in all its completeness What good does it do to magnify an expression and play with equivocations as if we expected to change the reality thereby THEY CREATE PROPERTY IN ALL ITS COMPLETENESS You mean that they create a productive capacity which formerly did not exist but this capacity cannot be created without material to support it The substance of the soil remains the same only its qualities and modifications are changed Man has created every thing every thing save the material itself Now I maintain that this material he can only possess and use on condition of permanent labor granting for the time being his right of property in things which he has produced This then is the first point settled property in product if we grant so much does not carry with it property in the means of production that seems to me to need no further demonstration There is no difference between the soldier who possesses his arms the mason who possesses the materials committed to his care the fisherman who possesses the water the hunter who possesses the fields and forests and the cultivator who possesses the lands all if you say so are proprietors of their products not one is proprietor of the means of production The right to product is exclusive jus in re the right to means is common jus ad rem five That Labor leads to Equality of Property Admit however that labor gives a right of property in material Why is not this principle universal Why is the benefit of this pretended law confined to a few and denied to the mass of laborers A philosopher arguing that all animals sprang up formerly out of the earth warmed by the rays of the sun almost like mushrooms on being asked why the earth no longer yielded crops of that nature replied Because it is old and has lost its fertility Has labor once so fecund likewise become sterile Why does the tenant no longer acquire through his labor the land which was formerly acquired by the labor of the proprietor Because they say it is already appropriated That is no answer A farm yields fifty bushels per hectare the skill and labor of the tenant double this product the increase is created by the tenant Suppose the owner in a spirit of moderation rarely met with does not go to the extent of absorbing this product by raising the rent but allows the cultivator to enjoy the results of his labor even then justice is not satisfied The tenant by improving the land has imparted a new value to the property he therefore has a right to a part of the property If the farm was originally worth one hundred thousand francs and if by the labor of the tenant its value has risen to one hundred and fifty thousand francs the tenant who produced this extra value is the legitimate proprietor of one third of the farm M Ch Comte could not have pronounced this doctrine false for it was he who said Men who increase the fertility of the earth are no less useful to their fellow men than if they should create new land Why then is not this rule applicable to the man who improves the land as well as to him who clears it The labor of the former makes the land worth one that of the latter makes it worth two both create equal values Why not accord to both equal property I defy any one to refute this argument without again falling back on the right of first occupancy But it will be said even if your wish should be granted property would not be distributed much more evenly than now Land does not go on increasing in value for ever after two or three seasons it attains its maximum fertility That which is added by the agricultural art results rather from the progress of science and the diffusion of knowledge than from the skill of the cultivator Consequently the addition of a few laborers to the mass of proprietors would be no argument against property This discussion would indeed prove a well nigh useless one if our labors culminated in simply extending land privilege and industrial monopoly in emancipating only a few hundred laborers out of the millions of proletaires But this also is a misconception of our real thought and does but prove the general lack of intelligence and logic If the laborer who adds to the value of a thing has a right of property in it he who maintains this value acquires the same right For what is maintenance It is incessant addition continuous creation What is it to cultivate It is to give the soil its value every year it is by annually renewed creation to prevent the diminution or destruction of the value of a piece of land Admitting then that property is rational and legitimate admitting that rent is equitable and just I say that he who cultivates acquires property by as good a title as he who clears or he who improves and that every time a tenant pays his rent he obtains a fraction of property in the land entrusted to his care the denominator of which is equal to the proportion of rent paid Unless you admit this you fall into absolutism and tyranny you recognize class privileges you sanction slavery Whoever labors becomes a proprietor this is an inevitable deduction from the acknowledged principles of political economy and jurisprudence And when I say proprietor I do not mean simply as do our hypocritical economists proprietor of his allowance his salary his wages I mean proprietor of the value which he creates and by which the master alone profits As all this relates to the theory of wages and of the distribution of products and as this matter never has been even partially cleared up I ask permission to insist on it this discussion will not be useless to the work in hand Many persons talk of admitting working people to a share in the products and profits but in their minds this participation is pure benevolence they have never shown perhaps never suspected that it was a natural necessary right inherent in labor and inseparable from the function of producer even in the lowest forms of his work This is my proposition THE LABORER RETAINS EVEN AFTER HE HAS RECEIVED HIS WAGES A NATURAL RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN THE THING WHICH HE HAS PRODUCED I again quote M Ch Comte Some laborers are employed in draining marshes in cutting down trees and brushwood in a word in cleaning up the soil They increase the value they make the amount of property larger they are paid for the value which they add in the form of food and daily wages it then becomes the property of the capitalist The price is not sufficient the labor of the workers has created a value now this value is their property But they have neither sold nor exchanged it and you capitalist you have not earned it That you should have a partial right to the whole in return for the materials that you have furnished and the provisions that you have supplied is perfectly just You contributed to the production you ought to share in the enjoyment But your right does not annihilate that of the laborers who in spite of you have been your colleagues in the work of production Why do you talk of wages The money with which you pay the wages of the laborers remunerates them for only a few years of the perpetual possession which they have abandoned to you Wages is the cost of the daily maintenance and refreshment of the laborer You are wrong in calling it the price of a sale The workingman has sold nothing he knows neither his right nor the extent of the concession which he has made to you nor the meaning of the contract which you pretend to have made with him On his side utter ignorance on yours error and surprise not to say deceit and fraud Let us make this clearer by another and more striking example No one is ignorant of the difficulties that are met with in the conversion of untilled land into arable and productive land These difficulties are so great that usually an isolated man would perish before he could put the soil in a condition to yield him even the most meagre living To that end are needed the united and combined efforts of society and all the resources of industry M Ch Comte quotes on this subject numerous and well authenticated facts little thinking that he is amassing testimony against his own system Let us suppose that a colony of twenty or thirty families establishes itself in a wild district covered with underbrush and forests and from which by agreement the natives consent to withdraw Each one of these families possesses a moderate but sufficient amount of capital of such a nature as a colonist would be apt to choose animals seeds tools and a little money and food The land having been divided each one settles himself as comfortably as possible and begins to clear away the portion allotted to him But after a few weeks of fatigue such as they never before have known of inconceivable suffering of ruinous and almost useless labor our colonists begin to complain of their trade their condition seems hard to them they curse their sad existence Suddenly one of the shrewdest among them kills a pig cures a part of the meat and resolved to sacrifice the rest of his provisions goes to find his companions in misery Friends he begins in a very benevolent tone how much trouble it costs you to do a little work and live uncomfortably A fortnight of labor has reduced you to your last extremity Let us make an arrangement by which you shall all profit I offer you provisions and wine you shall get so much every day we will work together and zounds my friends we will be happy and contented Would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an invitation The hungriest of them follow the treacherous tempter They go to work the charm of society emulation joy and mutual assistance double their strength the work can be seen to advance Singing and laughing they subdue Nature In a short time the soil is thoroughly changed the mellowed earth waits only for the seed That done the proprietor pays his laborers who on going away return him their thanks and grieve that the happy days which they have spent with him are over Others follow this example always with the same success Then these installed the rest disperse each one returns to his grubbing But while grubbing it is necessary to live While they have been clearing away for their neighbor they have done no clearing for themselves One year s seed time and harvest is already gone They had calculated that in lending their labor they could not but gain since they would save their own provisions and while living better would get still more money False calculation they have created for another the means wherewith to produce and have created nothing for themselves The difficulties of clearing remain the same their clothing wears out their provisions give out soon their purse becomes empty for the profit of the individual for whom they have worked and who alone can furnish the provisions which they need since he alone is in a position to produce them Then when the poor grubber has exhausted his resources the man with the provisions like the wolf in the fable who scents his victim from afar again comes forward One he offers to employ again by the day from another he offers to buy at a favorable price a piece of his bad land which is not and never can be of any use to him that is he uses the labor of one man to cultivate the field of another for his own benefit So that at the end of twenty years of thirty individuals originally equal in point of wealth five or six have become proprietors of the whole district while the rest have been philanthropically dispossessed In this century of bourgeoisie morality in which I have had the honor to be born the moral sense is so debased that I should not be at all surprised if I were asked by many a worthy proprietor what I see in this that is unjust and illegitimate Debased creature galvanized corpse how can I expect to convince you if you cannot tell robbery when I show it to you A man by soft and insinuating words discovers the secret of taxing others that he may establish himself then once enriched by their united efforts he refuses on the very conditions which he himself dictated to advance the well being of those who made his fortune for him and you ask how such conduct is fraudulent Under the pretext that he has paid his laborers that he owes them nothing more that he has nothing to gain by putting himself at the service of others while his own occupations claim his attention he refuses I say to aid others in getting a foothold as he was aided in getting his own and when in the impotence of their isolation these poor laborers are compelled to sell their birthright he this ungrateful proprietor this knavish upstart stands ready to put the finishing touch to their deprivation and their ruin And you think that just Take care I read in your startled countenance the reproach of a guilty conscience much more clearly than the innocent astonishment of involuntary ignorance The capitalist they say has paid the laborers their DAILY WAGES To be accurate it must be said that the capitalist has paid as many times one day s wage as he has employed laborers each day which is not at all the same thing For he has paid nothing for that immense power which results from the union and harmony of laborers and the convergence and simultaneousness of their efforts Two hundred grenadiers stood the obelisk of Luxor upon its base in a few hours do you suppose that one man could have accomplished the same task in two hundred days Nevertheless on the books of the capitalist the amount of wages paid would have been the same Well a desert to prepare for cultivation a house to build a factory to run all these are obelisks to erect mountains to move The smallest fortune the most insignificant establishment the setting in motion of the lowest industry demand the concurrence of so many different kinds of labor and skill that one man could not possibly execute the whole of them It is astonishing that the economists never have called attention to this fact Strike a balance then between the capitalist s receipts and his payments The laborer needs a salary which will enable him to live while he works for unless he consumes he cannot produce Whoever employs a man owes him maintenance and support or wages enough to procure the same That is the first thing to be done in all production I admit for the moment that in this respect the capitalist has discharged his duty It is necessary that the laborer should find in his production in addition to his present support a guarantee of his future support otherwise the source of production would dry up and his productive capacity would become exhausted in other words the labor accomplished must give birth perpetually to new labor such is the universal law of reproduction In this way the proprietor of a farm finds one In his crops means not only of supporting himself and his family but of maintaining and improving his capital of feeding his live stock in a word means of new labor and continual reproduction two In his ownership of a productive agency a permanent basis of cultivation and labor But he who lends his services what is his basis of cultivation The proprietor s presumed need of him and the unwarranted supposition that he wishes to employ him Just as the commoner once held his land by the munificence and condescension of the lord so to day the working man holds his labor by the condescension and necessities of the master and proprietor that is what is called possession by a precarious fifteen title But this precarious condition is an injustice for it implies an inequality in the bargain The laborer s wages exceed but little his running expenses and do not assure him wages for to morrow while the capitalist finds in the instrument produced by the laborer a pledge of independence and security for the future Now this reproductive leaven this eternal germ of life this preparation of the land and manufacture of implements for production constitutes the debt of the capitalist to the producer which he never pays and it is this fraudulent denial which causes the poverty of the laborer the luxury of idleness and the inequality of conditions This it is above all other things which has been so fitly named the exploitation of man by man One of three things must be done Either the laborer must be given a portion of the product in addition to his wages or the employer must render the laborer an equivalent in productive service or else he must pledge himself to employ him for ever Division of the product reciprocity of service or guarantee of perpetual labor from the adoption of one of these courses the capitalist cannot escape But it is evident that he cannot satisfy the second and third of these conditions he can neither put himself at the service of the thousands of working men who directly or indirectly have aided him in establishing himself nor employ them all for ever He has no other course left him then but a division of the property But if the property is divided all conditions will be equal there will be no more large capitalists or large proprietors Consequently when M Ch Comte following out his hypothesis shows us his capitalist acquiring one after another the products of his employees labor he sinks deeper and deeper into the mire and as his argument does not change our reply of course remains the same Other laborers are employed in building some quarry the stone others transport it others cut it and still others put it in place Each of them adds a certain value to the material which passes through his hands and this value the product of his labor is his property He sells it as fast as he creates it to the proprietor of the building who pays him for it in food and wages Divide et impera divide and you shall command divide and you shall grow rich divide and you shall deceive men you shall daze their minds you shall mock at justice Separate laborers from each other perhaps each one s daily wage exceeds the value of each individual s product but that is not the question under consideration A force of one thousand men working twenty days has been paid the same wages that one would be paid for working fifty five years but this force of one thousand has done in twenty days what a single man could not have accomplished though he had labored for a million centuries Is the exchange an equitable one Once more no when you have paid all the individual forces the collective force still remains to be paid Consequently there remains always a right of collective property which you have not acquired and which you enjoy unjustly Admit that twenty days wages suffice to feed lodge and clothe this multitude for twenty days thrown out of employment at the end of that time what will become of them if as fast as they create they abandon their creations to the proprietors who will soon discharge them While the proprietor firm in his position thanks to the aid of all the laborers dwells in security and fears no lack of labor or bread the laborer s only dependence is upon the benevolence of this same proprietor to whom he has sold and surrendered his liberty If then the proprietor shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights refuses to employ the laborer how can the laborer live He has ploughed an excellent field and cannot sow it he has built an elegant and commodious house and cannot live in it he has produced all and can enjoy nothing Labor leads us to equality Every step that we take brings us nearer to it and if laborers had equal strength diligence and industry clearly their fortunes would be equal also Indeed if as is pretended and as we have admitted the laborer is proprietor of the value which he creates it follows one That the laborer acquires at the expense of the idle proprietor two That all production being necessarily collective the laborer is entitled to a share of the products and profits commensurate with his labor three That all accumulated capital being social property no one can be its exclusive proprietor These inferences are unavoidable these alone would suffice to revolutionize our whole economical system and change our institutions and our laws Why do the very persons who laid down this principle now refuse to be guided by it Why do the Says the Comtes the Hennequins and others after having said that property is born of labor seek to fix it by occupation and prescription But let us leave these sophists to their contradictions and blindness The good sense of the people will do justice to their equivocations Let us make haste to enlighten it and show it the true path Equality approaches already between it and us but a short distance intervenes to morrow even this distance will have been traversed six That in Society all Wages are Equal When the saint Simonians the Fourierists and in general all who in our day are connected with social economy and reform inscribe upon their banner TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS CAPACITY TO EACH CAPACITY ACCORDING TO ITS RESULTS saint Simon TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS CAPITAL HIS LABOR AND HIS SKILL Fourier they mean although they do not say so in so many words that the products of Nature procured by labor and industry are a reward a palm a crown offered to all kinds of preeminence and superiority They regard the land as an immense arena in which prizes are contended for no longer it is true with lances and swords by force and by treachery but by acquired wealth by knowledge talent and by virtue itself In a word they mean and everybody agrees with them that the greatest capacity is entitled to the greatest reward and to use the mercantile phraseology which has at least the merit of being straightforward that salaries must be governed by capacity and its results The disciples of these two self styled reformers cannot deny that such is their thought for in doing so they would contradict their official interpretations and would destroy the unity of their systems Furthermore such a denial on their part is not to be feared The two sects glory in laying down as a principle inequality of conditions reasoning from Nature who they say intended the inequality of capacities They boast only of one thing namely that their political system is so perfect that the social inequalities always correspond with the natural inequalities They no more trouble themselves to inquire whether inequality of conditions I mean of salaries is possible than they do to fix a measure of capacity one one In saint Simon s system the saint Simonian priest determines the capacity of each by virtue of his pontifical infallibility in imitation of the Roman Church in Fourier s the ranks and merits are decided by vote in imitation of the constitutional regime Clearly the great man is an object of ridicule to the reader he did not mean to tell his secret To each according to his capacity to each capacity according to its results To each according to his capital his labor and his skill Since the death of saint Simon and Fourier not one among their numerous disciples has attempted to give to the public a scientific demonstration of this grand maxim and I would wager a hundred to one that no Fourierist even suspects that this biform aphorism is susceptible of two interpretations To each according to his capacity to each capacity according to its results To each according to his capital his labor and his skill This proposition taken as they say in sensu obvio in the sense usually attributed to it is false absurd unjust contradictory hostile to liberty friendly to tyranny anti social and was unluckily framed under the express influence of the property idea And first CAPITAL must be crossed off the list of elements which are entitled to a reward The Fourierists as far as I have been able to learn from a few of their pamphlets deny the right of occupancy and recognize no basis of property save labor Starting with a like premise they would have seen had they reasoned upon the matter that capital is a source of production to its proprietor only by virtue of the right of occupancy and that this production is therefore illegitimate Indeed if labor is the sole basis of property I cease to be proprietor of my field as soon as I receive rent for it from another This we have shown beyond all cavil It is the same with all capital so that to put capital in an enterprise is by the law s decision to exchange it for an equivalent sum in products I will not enter again upon this now useless discussion since I propose in the following chapter to exhaust the subject of PRODUCTION BY CAPITAL Thus capital can be exchanged but cannot be a source of income LABOR and SKILL remain or as saint Simon puts it RESULTS and CAPACITIES I will examine them successively Should wages be governed by labor In other words is it just that he who does the most should get the most I beg the reader to pay the closest attention to this point To solve the problem with one stroke we have only to ask ourselves the following question Is labor a CONDITION or a STRUGGLE The reply seems plain God said to man In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread that is thou shalt produce thy own bread with more or less ease according to thy skill in directing and combining thy efforts thou shalt labor God did not say Thou shalt quarrel with thy neighbor for thy bread but Thou shalt labor by the side of thy neighbor and ye shall dwell together in harmony Let us develop the meaning of this law the extreme simplicity of which renders it liable to misconstruction In labor two things must be noticed and distinguished ASSOCIATION and AVAILABLE MATERIAL In so far as laborers are associated they are equal and it involves a contradiction to say that one should be paid more than another For as the product of one laborer can be paid for only in the product of another laborer if the two products are unequal the remainder or the difference between the greater and the smaller will not be acquired by society and therefore not being exchanged will not affect the equality of wages There will result it is true in favor of the stronger laborer a natural inequality but not a social inequality no one having suffered by his strength and productive energy In a word society exchanges only equal products that is rewards no labor save that performed for her benefit consequently she pays all laborers equally with what they produce outside of her sphere she has no more to do than with the difference in their voices and their hair I seem to be positing the principle of inequality the reverse of this is the truth The total amount of labor which can be performed for society that is of labor susceptible of exchange being within a given space as much greater as the laborers are more numerous and as the task assigned to each is less in magnitude it follows that natural inequality neutralizes itself in proportion as association extends and as the quantity of consumable values produced thereby increases So that in society the only thing which could bring back the inequality of labor would be the right of occupancy the right of property Now suppose that this daily social task consists in the ploughing hoeing or reaping of two square decameters and that the average time required to accomplish it is seven hours one laborer will finish it in six hours another will require eight the majority however will work seven But provided each one furnishes the quantity of labor demanded of him whatever be the time he employs they are entitled to equal wages Shall the laborer who is capable of finishing his task in six hours have the right on the ground of superior strength and activity to usurp the task of the less skilful laborer and thus rob him of his labor and bread Who dares maintain such a proposition He who finishes before the others may rest if he chooses he may devote himself to useful exercise and labors for the maintenance of his strength and the culture of his mind and the pleasure of his life This he can do without injury to any one but let him confine himself to services which affect him solely Vigor genius diligence and all the personal advantages which result therefrom are the work of Nature and to a certain extent of the individual society awards them the esteem which they merit but the wages which it pays them is measured not by their power but by their production Now the product of each is limited by the right of all If the soil were infinite in extent and the amount of available material were exhaustless even then we could not accept this maxim TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS LABOR And why Because society I repeat whatever be the number of its subjects is forced to pay them all the same wages since she pays them only in their own products Only on the hypothesis just made inasmuch as the strong cannot be prevented from using all their advantages the inconveniences of natural inequality would reappear in the very bosom of social equality But the land considering the productive power of its inhabitants and their ability to multiply is very limited further by the immense variety of products and the extreme division of labor the social task is made easy of accomplishment Now through this limitation of things producible and through the ease of producing them the law of absolute equality takes effect Yes life is a struggle But this struggle is not between man and man it is between man and Nature and it is each one s duty to take his share in it If in the struggle the strong come to the aid of the weak their kindness deserves praise and love but their aid must be accepted as a free gift not imposed by force nor offered at a price All have the same career before them neither too long nor too difficult whoever finishes it finds his reward at the end it is not necessary to get there first In printing offices where the laborers usually work by the job the compositor receives so much per thousand letters set the pressman so much per thousand sheets printed There as elsewhere inequalities of talent and skill are to be found When there is no prospect of dull times for printing and typesetting like all other trades sometimes come to a stand still every one is free to work his hardest and exert his faculties to the utmost he who does more gets more he who does less gets less When business slackens compositors and pressmen divide up their labor all monopolists are detested as no better than robbers or traitors There is a philosophy in the action of these printers to which neither economists nor legists have ever risen If our legislators had introduced into their codes the principle of distributive justice which governs printing offices if they had observed the popular instincts not for the sake of servile imitation but in order to reform and generalize them long ere this liberty and equality would have been established on an immovable basis and we should not now be disputing about the right of property and the necessity of social distinctions It has been calculated that if labor were equally shared by the whole number of able bodied individuals the average working day of each individual in France would not exceed five hours This being so how can we presume to talk of the inequality of laborers It is the LABOR of Robert Macaire that causes inequality The principle TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS LABOR interpreted to mean WHO WORKS MOST SHOULD RECEIVE MOST is based therefore on two palpable errors one an error in economy that in the labor of society tasks must necessarily be unequal the other an error in physics that there is no limit to the amount of producible things But it will be said suppose there are some people who wish to perform only half of their task Is that very embarrassing Probably they are satisfied with half of their salary Paid according to the labor that they had performed of what could they complain and what injury would they do to others In this sense it is fair to apply the maxim TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS RESULTS It is the law of equality itself Further numerous difficulties relative to the police system and the organization of industry might be raised here I will reply to them all with this one sentence that they must all be solved by the principle of equality Thus some one might observe Here is a task which cannot be postponed without detriment to production Ought society to suffer from the negligence of a few and will she not venture out of respect for the right of labor to assure with her own hands the product which they refuse her In such a case to whom will the salary belong To society who will be allowed to perform the labor either herself or through her representatives but always in such a way that the general equality shall never be violated and that only the idler shall be punished for his idleness Further if society may not use excessive severity towards her lazy members she has a right in self defence to guard against abuses But every industry needs they will add leaders instructors superintendents c Will these be engaged in the general task No since their task is to lead instruct and superintend But they must be chosen from the laborers by the laborers themselves and must fulfil the conditions of eligibility It is the same with all public functions whether of administration or instruction Then article first of the universal constitution will be The limited quantity of available material proves the necessity of dividing the labor among the whole number of laborers The capacity given to all of accomplishing a social task that is an equal task and the impossibility of paying one laborer save in the products of another justify the equality of wages seven That Inequality of Powers is the Necessary Condition of Equality of Fortunes It is objected and this objection constitutes the second part of the saint Simonian and the third part of the Fourierstic maxims That all kinds of labor cannot be executed with equal ease Some require great superiority of skill and intelligence and on this superiority is based the price The artist the savant the poet the statesman are esteemed only because of their excellence and this excellence destroys all similitude between them and other men in the presence of these heights of science and genius the law of equality disappears Now if equality is not absolute there is no equality From the poet we descend to the novelist from the sculptor to the stonecutter from the architect to the mason from the chemist to the cook c Capacities are classified and subdivided into orders genera and species The extremes of talent are connected by intermediate talents Humanity is a vast hierarchy in which the individual estimates himself by comparison and fixes his price by the value placed upon his product by the public This objection always has seemed a formidable one It is the stumbling block of the economists as well as of the defenders of equality It has led the former into egregious blunders and has caused the latter to utter incredible platitudes Gracchus Babeuf wished all superiority to be STRINGENTLY REPRESSED and even PERSECUTED AS A SOCIAL CALAMITY To establish his communistic edifice he lowered all citizens to the stature of the smallest Ignorant eclectics have been known to object to the inequality of knowledge and I should not be surprised if some one should yet rebel against the inequality of virtue Aristotle was banished Socrates drank the hemlock Epaminondas was called to account for having proved superior in intelligence and virtue to some dissolute and foolish demagogues Such follies will be re enacted so long as the inequality of fortunes justifies a populace blinded and oppressed by the wealthy in fearing the elevation of new tyrants to power Nothing seems more unnatural than that which we examine too closely and often nothing seems less like the truth than the truth itself On the other hand according to J J Rousseau it takes a great deal of philosophy to enable us to observe once what we see every day and according to d Alembert the ordinary truths of life make but little impression on men unless their attention is especially called to them The father of the school of economists Say from whom I borrow these two quotations might have profited by them but he who laughs at the blind should wear spectacles and he who notices him is near sighted Strange that which has frightened so many minds is not after all an objection to equality it is the very condition on which equality exists Natural inequality the condition of equality of fortunes What a paradox I repeat my assertion that no one may think I have blundered inequality of powers is the sine qua non of equality of fortunes There are two things to be considered in society FUNCTIONS and RELATIONS I FUNCTIONS Every laborer is supposed to be capable of performing the task assigned to him or to use a common expression every workman must know his trade The workman equal to his work there is an equation between functionary and function In society functions are not alike there must be then different capacities Further certain functions demand greater intelligence and powers then there are people of superior mind and talent For the performance of work necessarily involves a workman from the need springs the idea and the idea makes the producer We only know what our senses long for and our intelligence demands we have no keen desire for things of which we cannot conceive and the greater our powers of conception the greater our capabilities of production Thus functions arising from needs needs from desires and desires from spontaneous perception and imagination the same intelligence which imagines can also produce consequently no labor is superior to the laborer In a word if the function calls out the functionary it is because the functionary exists before the function Let us admire Nature s economy With regard to these various needs which she has given us and which the isolated man cannot satisfy unaided Nature has granted to the race a power refused to the individual This gives rise to the principle of the DIVISION OF LABOR a principle founded on the SPECIALITY OF VOCATIONS The satisfaction of some needs demands of man continual creation while others can by the labor of a single individual be satisfied for millions of men through thousands of centuries For example the need of clothing and food requires perpetual reproduction while a knowledge of the system of the universe may be acquired for ever by two or three highly gifted men The perpetual current of rivers supports our commerce and runs our machinery but the sun alone in the midst of space gives light to the whole world Nature who might create Platos and Virgils Newtons and Cuviers as she creates husbandmen and shepherds does not see fit to do so choosing rather to proportion the rarity of genius to the duration of its products and to balance the number of capacities by the competency of each one of them I do not inquire here whether the distance which separates one man from another in point of talent and intelligence arises from the deplorable condition of civilization nor whether that which is now called the INEQUALITY OF POWERS would be in an ideal society any thing more than a DIVERSITY OF POWERS I take the worst view of the matter and that I may not be accused of tergiversation and evasion of difficulties I acknowledge all the inequalities that any one can desire sixteen Certain philosophers in love with the levelling idea maintain that all minds are equal and that all differences are the result of education I am no believer I confess in this doctrine which even if it were true would lead to a result directly opposite to that desired For if capacities are equal whatever be the degree of their power as no one can be coerced there are functions deemed coarse low and degrading which deserve higher pay a result no less repugnant to equality than to the principle TO EACH CAPACITY ACCORDING TO ITS RESULTS Give me on the contrary a society in which every kind of talent bears a proper numerical relation to the needs of the society and which demands from each producer only that which his special function requires him to produce and without impairing in the least the hierarchy of functions I will deduce the equality of fortunes This is my second point II RELATIONS In considering the element of labor I have shown that in the same class of productive services the capacity to perform a social task being possessed by all no inequality of reward can be based upon an inequality of individual powers However it is but fair to say that certain capacities seem quite incapable of certain services so that if human industry were entirely confined to one class of products numerous incapacities would arise and consequently the greatest social inequality But every body sees without any hint from me that the variety of industries avoids this difficulty so clear is this that I shall not stop to discuss it We have only to prove then that functions are equal to each other just as laborers who perform the same function are equal to each other Property makes man a eunuch and then reproaches him for being nothing but dry wood a decaying tree Are you astonished that I refuse to genius to knowledge to courage in a word to all the excellences admired by the world the homage of dignities the distinctions of power and wealth It is not I who refuse it it is economy it is justice it is liberty Liberty for the first time in this discussion I appeal to her Let her rise in her own defence and achieve her victory Every transaction ending in an exchange of products or services may be designated as a COMMERCIAL OPERATION Whoever says commerce says exchange of equal values for if the values are not equal and the injured party perceives it he will not consent to the exchange and there will be no commerce Commerce exists only among free men Transactions may be effected between other people by violence or fraud but there is no commerce A free man is one who enjoys the use of his reason and his faculties who is neither blinded by passion nor hindered or driven by oppression nor deceived by erroneous opinions So in every exchange there is a moral obligation that neither of the contracting parties shall gain at the expense of the other that is that to be legitimate and true commerce must be exempt from all inequality This is the first condition of commerce Its second condition is that it be voluntary that is that the parties act freely and openly I define then commerce or exchange as an act of society The negro who sells his wife for a knife his children for some bits of glass and finally himself for a bottle of brandy is not free The dealer in human flesh with whom he negotiates is not his associate he is his enemy The civilized laborer who bakes a loaf that he may eat a slice of bread who builds a palace that he may sleep in a stable who weaves rich fabrics that he may dress in rags who produces every thing that he may dispense with every thing is not free His employer not becoming his associate in the exchange of salaries or services which takes place between them is his enemy The soldier who serves his country through fear instead of through love is not free his comrades and his officers the ministers or organs of military justice are all his enemies The peasant who hires land the manufacturer who borrows capital the tax payer who pays tolls duties patent and license fees personal and property taxes c and the deputy who votes for them all act neither intelligently nor freely Their enemies are the proprietors the capitalists the government Give men liberty enlighten their minds that they may know the meaning of their contracts and you will see the most perfect equality in exchanges without regard to superiority of talent and knowledge and you will admit that in commercial affairs that is in the sphere of society the word superiority is void of sense Let Homer sing his verse I listen to this sublime genius in comparison with whom I a simple herdsman an humble farmer am as nothing What indeed if product is to be compared with product are my cheeses and my beans in the presence of his Iliad But if Homer wishes to take from me all that I possess and make me his slave in return for his inimitable poem I will give up the pleasure of his lays and dismiss him I can do without his Iliad and wait if necessary for the AEneid Homer cannot live twenty four hours without my products Let him accept then the little that I have to offer and then his muse may instruct encourage and console me What do you say that such should be the condition of one who sings of gods and men Alms with the humiliation and suffering which they bring with them what barbarous generosity Do not get excited I beg of you Property makes of a poet either a Croesus or a beggar only equality knows how to honor and to praise him What is its duty To regulate the right of the singer and the duty of the listener Now notice this point which is a very important one in the solution of this question both are free the one to sell the other to buy Henceforth their respective pretensions go for nothing and the estimate whether fair or unfair that they place the one upon his verse the other upon his liberality can have no influence upon the conditions of the contract We must no longer in making our bargains weigh talent we must consider products only In order that the bard of Achilles may get his due reward he must first make himself wanted that done the exchange of his verse for a fee of any kind being a free act must be at the same time a just act that is the poet s fee must be equal to his product Now what is the value of this product Let us suppose in the first place that this Iliad this chef d oeuvre that is to be equitably rewarded is really above price that we do not know how to appraise it If the public who are free to purchase it refuse to do so it is clear that the poem being unexchangeable its intrinsic value will not be diminished but that its exchangeable value or its productive utility will be reduced to zero will be nothing at all Then we must seek the amount of wages to be paid between infinity on the one hand and nothing on the other at an equal distance from each since all rights and liberties are entitled to equal respect in other words it is not the intrinsic value but the relative value of the thing sold that needs to be fixed The question grows simpler what is this relative value To what reward does a poem like the Iliad entitle its author The first business of political economy after fixing its definitions was the solution of this problem now not only has it not been solved but it has been declared insoluble According to the economists the relative or exchangeable value of things cannot be absolutely determined it necessarily varies The value of a thing says Say is a positive quantity but only for a given moment It is its nature to perpetually vary to change from one point to another Nothing can fix it absolutely because it is based on needs and means of production which vary with every moment These variations complicate economical phenomena and often render them very difficult of observation and solution I know no remedy for this it is not in our power to change the nature of things Elsewhere Say says and repeats that value being based on utility and utility depending entirely on our needs whims customs c value is as variable as opinion Now political economy being the science of values of their production distribution exchange and consumption if exchangeable value cannot be absolutely determined how is political economy possible How can it be a science How can two economists look each other in the face without laughing How dare they insult metaphysicians and psychologists What that fool of a Descartes imagined that philosophy needed an immovable base an aliquid inconcussum on which the edifice of science might be built and he was simple enough to search for it And the Hermes of economy Trismegistus Say devoting half a volume to the amplification of that solemn text political economy is a science has the courage to affirm immediately afterwards that this science cannot determine its object which is equivalent to saying that it is without a principle or foundation He does not know then the illustrious Say the nature of a science or rather he knows nothing of the subject which he discusses Say s example has borne its fruits Political economy as it exists at present resembles ontology discussing effects and causes it knows nothing explains nothing decides nothing The ideas honored with the name of economic laws are nothing more than a few trifling generalities to which the economists thought to give an appearance of depth by clothing them in high sounding words As for the attempts that have been made by the economists to solve social problems all that can be said of them is that if a glimmer of sense occasionally appears in their lucubrations they immediately fall back into absurdity For twenty five years political economy like a heavy fog has weighed upon France checking the efforts of the mind and setting limits to liberty Has every creation of industry a venal absolute unchangeable and consequently legitimate and true value Yes Can every product of man be exchanged for some other product of man Yes again How many nails is a pair of shoes worth If we can solve this appalling problem we shall have the key of the social system for which humanity has been searching for six thousand years In the presence of this problem the economist recoils confused the peasant who can neither read nor write replies without hesitation As many as can be made in the same time and with the same expense The absolute value of a thing then is its cost in time and expense How much is a diamond worth which costs only the labor of picking it up Nothing it is not a product of man How much will it be worth when cut and mounted The time and expense which it has cost the laborer Why then is it sold at so high a price Because men are not free Society must regulate the exchange and distribution of the rarest things as it does that of the most common ones in such a way that each may share in the enjoyment of them What then is that value which is based upon opinion Delusion injustice and robbery By this rule it is easy to reconcile every body If the mean term which we are searching for between an infinite value and no value at all is expressed in the case of every product by the amount of time and expense which the product cost a poem which has cost its author thirty years of labor and an outlay of ten thousand francs in journeys books c must be paid for by the ordinary wages received by a laborer during thirty years PLUS ten thousand francs indemnity for expense incurred Suppose the whole amount to be fifty thousand francs if the society which gets the benefit of the production include a million of men my share of the debt is five centimes This gives rise to a few observations one The same product at different times and in different places may cost more or less of time and outlay in this view it is true that value is a variable quantity But this variation is not that of the economists who place in their list of the causes of the variation of values not only the means of production but taste caprice fashion and opinion In short the true value of a thing is invariable in its algebraic expression although it may vary in its monetary expression two The price of every product in demand should be its cost in time and outlay neither more nor less every product not in demand is a loss to the producer a commercial non value three The ignorance of the principle of evaluation and the difficulty under many circumstances of applying it is the source of commercial fraud and one of the most potent causes of the inequality of fortunes four To reward certain industries and pay for certain products a society is needed which corresponds in size with the rarity of talents the costliness of the products and the variety of the arts and sciences If for example a society of fifty farmers can support a schoolmaster it requires one hundred for a shoemaker one hundred and fifty for a blacksmith two hundred for a tailor c If the number of farmers rises to one thousand ten thousand one hundred thousand c as fast as their number increases that of the functionaries which are earliest required must increase in the same proportion so that the highest functions become possible only in the most powerful societies seventeen That is the peculiar feature of capacities the character of genius the seal of its glory cannot arise and develop itself except in the bosom of a great nation But this physiological condition necessary to the existence of genius adds nothing to its social rights far from that the delay in its appearance proves that in economical and civil affairs the loftiest intelligence must submit to the equality of possessions an equality which is anterior to it and of which it constitutes the crown This is severe on our pride but it is an inexorable truth And here psychology comes to the aid of social economy giving us to understand that talent and material recompense have no common measure that in this respect the condition of all producers is equal consequently that all comparison between them and all distinction in fortunes is impossible In fact every work coming from the hands of man compared with the raw material of which it is composed is beyond price In this respect the distance is as great between a pair of wooden shoes and the trunk of a walnut tree as between a statue by Scopas and a block of marble The genius of the simplest mechanic exerts as much influence over the materials which he uses as does the mind of a Newton over the inert spheres whose distances volumes and revolutions he calculates You ask for talent and genius a corresponding degree of honor and reward Fix for me the value of a wood cutter s talent and I will fix that of Homer If any thing can reward intelligence it is intelligence itself That is what happens when various classes of producers pay to each other a reciprocal tribute of admiration and praise But if they contemplate an exchange of products with a view to satisfying mutual needs this exchange must be effected in accordance with a system of economy which is indifferent to considerations of talent and genius and whose laws are deduced not from vague and meaningless admiration but from a just balance between DEBIT and CREDIT in short from commercial accounts Now that no one may imagine that the liberty of buying and selling is the sole basis of the equality of wages and that society s sole protection against superiority of talent lies in a certain force of inertia which has nothing in common with right I shall proceed to explain why all capacities are entitled to the same reward and why a corresponding difference in wages would be an injustice I shall prove that the obligation to stoop to the social level is inherent in talent and on this very superiority of genius I will found the equality of fortunes I have just given the negative argument in favor of rewarding all capacities alike I will now give the direct and positive argument Listen first to the economist it is always pleasant to see how he reasons and how he understands justice Without him moreover without his amusing blunders and his wonderful arguments we should learn nothing Equality so odious to the economist owes every thing to political economy When the parents of a physician the text says a lawyer which is not so good an example have expended on his education forty thousand francs this sum may be regarded as so much capital invested in his head It is therefore permissible to consider it as yielding an annual income of four thousand francs If the physician earns thirty thousand there remains an income of twenty six thousand francs due to the personal talents given him by Nature This natural capital then if we assume ten per cent as the rate of interest amounts to two hundred and sixty thousand francs and the capital given him by his parents in defraying the expenses of his education to forty thousand francs The union of these two kinds of capital constitutes his fortune Say Complete Course c Say divides the fortune of the physician into two parts one is composed of the capital which went to pay for his education the other represents his personal talents This division is just it is in conformity with the nature of things it is universally admitted it serves as the major premise of that grand argument which establishes the inequality of capacities I accept this premise without qualification let us look at the consequences one Say CREDITS the physician with forty thousand francs the cost of his education This amount should be entered upon the DEBIT side of the account For although this expense was incurred for him it was not incurred by him Then instead of appropriating these forty thousand francs the physician should add them to the price of his product and repay them to those who are entitled to them Notice further that Say speaks of INCOME instead of REIMBURSEMENT reasoning on the false principle of the productivity of capital The expense of educating a talent is a debt contracted by this talent From the very fact of its existence it becomes a debtor to an amount equal to the cost of its production This is so true and simple that if the education of some one child in a family has cost double or triple that of its brothers the latter are entitled to a proportional amount of the property previous to its division There is no difficulty about this in the case of guardianship when the estate is administered in the name of the minors two That which I have just said of the obligation incurred by talent of repaying the cost of its education does not embarrass the economist The man of talent he says inheriting from his family inherits among other things a claim to the forty thousand francs which his education costs and he becomes in consequence its proprietor But this is to abandon the right of talent and to fall back upon the right of occupancy which again calls up all the questions asked in Chapter II What is the right of occupancy what is inheritance Is the right of succession a right of accumulation or only a right of choice how did the physician s father get his fortune was he a proprietor or only a usufructuary If he was rich let him account for his wealth if he was poor how could he incur so large an expense If he received aid what right had he to use that aid to the disadvantage of his benefactors c three There remains an income of twenty six thousand francs due to the personal talents given him by Nature Say as above quoted Reasoning from this premise Say concludes that our physician s talent is equivalent to a capital of two hundred and sixty thousand francs This skilful calculator mistakes a consequence for a principle The talent must not be measured by the gain but rather the gain by the talent for it may happen that notwithstanding his merit the physician in question will gain nothing at all in which case will it be necessary to conclude that his talent or fortune is equivalent to zero To such a result however would Say s reasoning lead a result which is clearly absurd Now it is impossible to place a money value on any talent whatsoever since talent and money have no common measure On what plausible ground can it be maintained that a physician should be paid two three or a hundred times as much as a peasant An unavoidable difficulty which has never been solved save by avarice necessity and oppression It is not thus that the right of talent should be determined But how is it to be determined four I say first that the physician must be treated with as much favor as any other producer that he must not be placed below the level of others This I will not stop to prove But I add that neither must he be lifted above that level because his talent is collective property for which he did not pay and for which he is ever in debt Just as the creation of every instrument of production is the result of collective force so also are a man s talent and knowledge the product of universal intelligence and of general knowledge slowly accumulated by a number of masters and through the aid of many inferior industries When the physician has paid for his teachers his books his diplomas and all the other items of his educational expenses he has no more paid for his talent than the capitalist pays for his house and land when he gives his employees their wages The man of talent has contributed to the production in himself of a useful instrument He has then a share in its possession he is not its proprietor There exist side by side in him a free laborer and an accumulated social capital As a laborer he is charged with the use of an instrument with the superintendence of a machine namely his capacity As capital he is not his own master he uses himself not for his own benefit but for that of others Even if talent did not find in its own excellence a reward for the sacrifices which it costs still would it be easier to find reasons for lowering its reward than for raising it above the common level Every producer receives an education every laborer is a talent a capacity that is a piece of collective property But all talents are not equally costly It takes but few teachers but few years and but little study to make a farmer or a mechanic the generative effort and if I may venture to use such language the period of social gestation are proportional to the loftiness of the capacity But while the physician the poet the artist and the savant produce but little and that slowly the productions of the farmer are much less uncertain and do not require so long a time Whatever be then the capacity of a man when this capacity is once created it does not belong to him Like the material fashioned by an industrious hand it had the power of BECOMING and society has given it BEING Shall the vase say to the potter I am that I am and I owe you nothing The artist the savant and the poet find their just recompense in the permission that society gives them to devote themselves exclusively to science and to art so that in reality they do not labor for themselves but for society which creates them and requires of them no other duty Society can if need be do without prose and verse music and painting and the knowledge of the movements of the moon and stars but it cannot live a single day without food and shelter Undoubtedly man does not live by bread alone he must also according to the Gospel LIVE BY THE WORD OF GOD that is he must love the good and do it know and admire the beautiful and study the marvels of Nature But in order to cultivate his mind he must first take care of his body the latter duty is as necessary as the former is noble If it is glorious to charm and instruct men it is honorable as well to feed them When then society faithful to the principle of the division of labor intrusts a work of art or of science to one of its members allowing him to abandon ordinary labor it owes him an indemnity for all which it prevents him from producing industrially but it owes him nothing more If he should demand more society should by refusing his services annihilate his pretensions Forced then in order to live to devote himself to labor repugnant to his nature the man of genius would feel his weakness and would live the most distasteful of lives They tell of a celebrated singer who demanded of the Empress of Russia Catherine II twenty thousand roubles for his services That is more than I give my field marshals said Catherine Your majesty replied the other has only to make singers of her field marshals If France more powerful than Catherine II should say to Mademoiselle Rachel You must act for one hundred louis or else spin cotton to M Duprez You must sing for two thousand four hundred francs or else work in the vineyard do you think that the actress Rachel and the singer Duprez would abandon the stage If they did they would be the first to repent it Mademoiselle Rachel receives they say sixty thousand francs annually from the Comedie Francaise For a talent like hers it is a slight fee Why not one hundred thousand francs two hundred thousand francs Why not a civil list What meanness Are we really guilty of chaffering with an artist like Mademoiselle Rachel It is said in reply that the managers of the theatre cannot give more without incurring a loss that they admit the superior talent of their young associate but that in fixing her salary they have been compelled to take the account of the company s receipts and expenses into consideration also That is just but it only confirms what I have said namely that an artist s talent may be infinite but that its mercenary claims are necessarily limited on the one hand by its usefulness to the society which rewards it on the other by the resources of this society in other words that the demand of the seller is balanced by the right of the buyer Mademoiselle Rachel they say brings to the treasury of the Theatre Francais more than sixty thousand francs I admit it but then I blame the theatre From whom does the Theatre Francais take this money From some curious people who are perfectly free Yes but the workingmen the lessees the tenants those who borrow by pawning their possessions from whom these curious people recover all that they pay to the theatre are they free And when the better part of their products are consumed by others at the play do you assure me that their families are not in want Until the French people reflecting on the salaries paid to all artists savants and public functionaries have plainly expressed their wish and judgment as to the matter the salaries of Mademoiselle Rachel and all her fellow artists will be a compulsory tax extorted by violence to reward pride and support libertinism It is because we are neither free nor sufficiently enlightened that we submit to be cheated in our bargains that the laborer pays the duties levied by the prestige of power and the selfishness of talent upon the curiosity of the idle and that we are perpetually scandalized by these monstrous inequalities which are encouraged and applauded by public opinion The whole nation and the nation only pays its authors its savants its artists its officials whatever be the hands through which their salaries pass On what basis should it pay them On the basis of equality I have proved it by estimating the value of talent I shall confirm it in the following chapter by proving the impossibility of all social inequality What have we shown so far Things so simple that really they seem silly That as the traveller does not appropriate the route which he traverses so the farmer does not appropriate the field which he sows That if nevertheless by reason of his industry a laborer may appropriate the material which he employs every employer of material becomes by the same title a proprietor That all capital whether material or mental being the result of collective labor is in consequence collective property That the strong have no right to encroach upon the labor of the weak nor the shrewd to take advantage of the credulity of the simple Finally that no one can be forced to buy that which he does not want still less to pay for that which he has not bought and consequently that the exchangeable value of a product being measured neither by the opinion of the buyer nor that of the seller but by the amount of time and outlay which it has cost the property of each always remains the same Are not these very simple truths Well as simple as they seem to you reader you shall yet see others which surpass them in dullness and simplicity For our course is the reverse of that of the geometricians with them the farther they advance the more difficult their problems become we on the contrary after having commenced with the most abstruse propositions shall end with the axioms But I must close this chapter with an exposition of one of those startling truths which never have been dreamed of by legists or economists eight That from the Stand point of Justice Labor destroys Property This proposition is the logical result of the two preceding sections which we have just summed up The isolated man can supply but a very small portion of his wants all his power lies in association and in the intelligent combination of universal effort The division and company operation of labor multiply the quantity and the variety of products the individuality of functions improves their quality There is not a man then but lives upon the products of several thousand different industries not a laborer but receives from society at large the things which he consumes and with these the power to reproduce Who indeed would venture the assertion I produce by my own effort all that I consume I need the aid of no one else The farmer whom the early economists regarded as the only real producer the farmer housed furnished clothed fed and assisted by the mason the carpenter the tailor the miller the baker the butcher the grocer the blacksmith c the farmer I say can he boast that he produces by his own unaided effort The various articles of consumption are given to each by all consequently the production of each involves the production of all One product cannot exist without another an isolated industry is an impossible thing What would be the harvest of the farmer if others did not manufacture for him barns wagons ploughs clothes c Where would be the savant without the publisher the printer without the typecaster and the machinist and these in their turn without a multitude of other industries Let us not prolong this catalogue so easy to extend lest we be accused of uttering commonplaces All industries are united by mutual relations in a single group all productions do reciprocal service as means and end all varieties of talent are but a series of changes from the inferior to the superior Now this undisputed and indisputable fact of the general participation in every species of product makes all individual productions common so that every product coming from the hands of the producer is mortgaged in advance by society The producer himself is entitled to only that portion of his product which is expressed by a fraction whose denominator is equal to the number of individuals of which society is composed It is true that in return this same producer has a share in all the products of others so that he has a claim upon all just as all have a claim upon him but is it not clear that this reciprocity of mortgages far from authorizing property destroys even possession The laborer is not even possessor of his product scarcely has he finished it when society claims it But it will be answered even if that is so even if the product does not belong to the producer still society gives each laborer an equivalent for his product and this equivalent this salary this reward this allowance becomes his property Do you deny that this property is legitimate And if the laborer instead of consuming his entire wages chooses to economize who dare question his right to do so The laborer is not even proprietor of the price of his labor and cannot absolutely control its disposition Let us not be blinded by a spurious justice That which is given the laborer in exchange for his product is not given him as a reward for past labor but to provide for and secure future labor We consume before we produce The laborer may say at the end of the day I have paid yesterday s expenses to morrow I shall pay those of today At every moment of his life the member of society is in debt he dies with the debt unpaid how is it possible for him to accumulate They talk of economy it is the proprietor s hobby Under a system of equality all economy which does not aim at subsequent reproduction or enjoyment is impossible why Because the thing saved since it cannot be converted into capital has no object and is without a FINAL CAUSE This will be explained more fully in the next chapter To conclude The laborer in his relation to society is a debtor who of necessity dies insolvent The proprietor is an unfaithful guardian who denies the receipt of the deposit committed to his care and wishes to be paid for his guardianship down to the last day Lest the principles just set forth may appear to certain readers too metaphysical I shall reproduce them in a more concrete form intelligible to the dullest brains and pregnant with the most important consequences Hitherto I have considered property as a power of EXCLUSION hereafter I shall examine it as a power of INVASION CHAPTER IV THAT PROPERTY IS IMPOSSIBLE The last resort of proprietors the overwhelming argument whose invincible potency reassures them is that in their opinion equality of conditions is impossible Equality of conditions is a chimera they cry with a knowing air distribute wealth equally to day to morrow this equality will have vanished To this hackneyed objection which they repeat everywhere with the most marvellous assurance they never fail to add the following comment as a sort of GLORY BE TO THE FATHER If all men were equal nobody would work This anthem is sung with variations If all were masters nobody would obey If nobody were rich who would employ the poor And If nobody were poor who would labor for the rich But let us have done with invective we have better arguments at our command If I show that property itself is impossible that it is property which is a contradiction a chimera a utopia and if I show it no longer by metaphysics and jurisprudence but by figures equations and calculations imagine the fright of the astounded proprietor And you reader what do you think of the retort Numbers govern the world mundum regunt numeri This proverb applies as aptly to the moral and political as to the sidereal and molecular world The elements of justice are identical with those of algebra legislation and government are simply the arts of classifying and balancing powers all jurisprudence falls within the rules of arithmetic This chapter and the next will serve to lay the foundations of this extraordinary doctrine Then will be unfolded to the reader s vision an immense and novel career then shall we commence to see in numerical relations the synthetic unity of philosophy and the sciences and filled with admiration and enthusiasm for this profound and majestic simplicity of Nature we shall shout with the apostle Yes the Eternal has made all things by number weight and measure We shall understand not only that equality of conditions is possible but that all else is impossible that this seeming impossibility which we charge upon it arises from the fact that we always think of it in connection either with the proprietary or the communistic regime political systems equally irreconcilable with human nature We shall see finally that equality is constantly being realized without our knowledge even at the very moment when we are pronouncing it incapable of realization that the time draws near when without any effort or even wish of ours we shall have it universally established that with it in it and by it the natural and true political order must make itself manifest It has been said in speaking of the blindness and obstinacy of the passions that if man had any thing to gain by denying the truths of arithmetic he would find some means of unsettling their certainty here is an opportunity to try this curious experiment I attack property no longer with its own maxims but with arithmetic Let the proprietors prepare to verify my figures for if unfortunately for them the figures prove accurate the proprietors are lost In proving the impossibility of property I complete the proof of its injustice In fact That which is JUST must be USEFUL That which is useful must be TRUE That which is true must be POSSIBLE Therefore every thing which is impossible is untrue useless unjust Then a priori we may judge of the justice of any thing by its possibility so that if the thing were absolutely impossible it would be absolutely unjust PROPERTY IS PHYSICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE DEMONSTRATION AXIOM Property is the Right of Increase claimed by the Proprietor over any thing which he has stamped as his own This proposition is purely an axiom because one It is not a definition since it does not express all that is included in the right of property the right of sale of exchange of gift the right to transform to alter to consume to destroy to use and abuse c All these rights are so many different powers of property which we may consider separately but which we disregard here that we may devote all our attention to this single one the right of increase two It is universally admitted No one can deny it without denying the facts without being instantly belied by universal custom three It is self evident since property is always accompanied either actually or potentially by the fact which this axiom expresses and through this fact mainly property manifests establishes and asserts itself four Finally its negation involves a contradiction The right of increase is really an inherent right so essential a part of property that in its absence property is null and void OBSERVATIONS Increase receives different names according to the thing by which it is yielded if by land FARM RENT if by houses and furniture RENT if by life investments REVENUE if by money INTEREST if by exchange ADVANTAGE GAIN PROFIT three things which must not be confounded with the wages or legitimate price of labor Increase a sort of royal prerogative of tangible and consumable homage is due to the proprietor on account of his nominal and metaphysical occupancy His seal is set upon the thing that is enough to prevent any one else from occupying it without HIS permission This permission to use his things the proprietor may if he chooses freely grant Commonly he sells it This sale is really a stellionate and an extortion but by the legal fiction of the right of property this same sale severely punished we know not why in other cases is a source of profit and value to the proprietor The amount demanded by the proprietor in payment for this permission is expressed in monetary terms by the dividend which the supposed product yields in nature So that by the right of increase the proprietor reaps and does not plough gleans and does not till consumes and does not produce enjoys and does not labor Very different from the idols of the Psalmist are the gods of property the former had hands and felt not the latter on the contrary manus habent et palpabunt The right of increase is conferred in a very mysterious and supernatural manner The inauguration of a proprietor is accompanied by the awful ceremonies of an ancient initiation First comes the CONSECRATION of the article a consecration which makes known to all that they must offer up a suitable sacrifice to the proprietor whenever they wish by his permission obtained and signed to use his article Second comes the ANATHEMA which prohibits except on the conditions aforesaid all persons from touching the article even in the proprietor s absence and pronounces every violator of property sacrilegious infamous amenable to the secular power and deserving of being handed over to it Finally the DEDICATION which enables the proprietor or patron saint the god chosen to watch over the article to inhabit it mentally like a divinity in his sanctuary By means of this dedication the substance of the article so to speak becomes converted into the person of the proprietor who is regarded as ever present in its form This is exactly the doctrine of the writers on jurisprudence Property says Toullier is a MORAL QUALITY inherent in a thing AN ACTUAL BOND which fastens it to the proprietor and which cannot be broken save by his act Locke humbly doubted whether God could make matter INTELLIGENT Toullier asserts that the proprietor renders it MORAL How much does he lack of being a God These are by no means exaggerations PROPERTY IS THE RIGHT OF INCREASE that is the power to produce without labor Now to produce without labor is to make something from nothing in short to create Surely it is no more difficult to do this than to moralize matter The jurists are right then in applying to proprietors this passage from the Scriptures Ego dixi Dii estis et filii Excelsi omnes I have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the Most High PROPERTY IS THE RIGHT OF INCREASE To us this axiom shall be like the name of the beast in the Apocalypse a name in which is hidden the complete explanation of the whole mystery of this beast It was known that he who should solve the mystery of this name would obtain a knowledge of the whole prophecy and would succeed in mastering the beast Well by the most careful interpretation of our axiom we shall kill the sphinx of property Starting from this eminently characteristic fact the RIGHT OF INCREASE we shall pursue the old serpent through his coils we shall count the murderous entwinings of this frightful taenia whose head with its thousand suckers is always hidden from the sword of its most violent enemies though abandoning to them immense fragments of its body It requires something more than courage to subdue this monster It was written that it should not die until a proletaire armed with a magic wand had fought with it COROLLARIES one THE AMOUNT OF INCREASE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE THING INCREASED Whatever be the rate of interest whether it rise to three five or ten per cent or fall to one half one fourth one tenth it does not matter the law of increase remains the same The law is as follows All capital the cash value of which can be estimated may be considered as a term in an arithmetical series which progresses in the ratio of one hundred and the revenue yielded by this capital as the corresponding term of another arithmetical series which progresses in a ratio equal to the rate of interest Thus a capital of five hundred francs being the fifth term of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is one hundred its revenue at three per cent will be indicated by the fifth term of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is three one hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred five hundred three six nine twelve fifteen An acquaintance with this sort of LOGARITHMS tables of which calculated to a very high degree are possessed by proprietors will give us the key to the most puzzling problems and cause us to experience a series of surprises By this LOGARITHMIC theory of the right of increase a piece of property together with its income may be defined as A NUMBER WHOSE LOGARITHM IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ITS UNITS DIVIDED BY ONE HUNDRED AND MULTIPLIED BY THE RATE OF INTEREST For instance a house valued at one hundred thousand francs and leased at five per cent yields a revenue of five thousand francs according to the formula one hundred thousand x five one hundred five thousand Vice versa a piece of land which yields at two and a half per cent a revenue of three thousand francs is worth one hundred and twenty thousand francs according to this other formula three thousand x one hundred two one two one hundred and twenty thousand In the first case the ratio of the progression which marks the increase of interest is five in the second it is two and a half OBSERVATION The forms of increase known as farm rent income and interest are paid annually rent is paid by the week the month or the year profits and gains are paid at the time of exchange Thus the amount of increase is proportional both to the thing increased and the time during which it increases in other words usury grows like a cancer foenus serpit sicut cancer two THE INCREASE PAID TO THE PROPRIETOR BY THE OCCUPANT IS A DEAD LOSS TO THE LATTER For if the proprietor owed in exchange for the increase which he receives some thing more than the permission which he grants his right of property would not be perfect he would not possess jure optimo jure perfecto that is he would not be in reality a proprietor Then all which passes from the hands of the occupant into those of the proprietor in the name of increase and as the price of the permission to occupy is a permanent gain for the latter and a dead loss and annihilation for the former to whom none of it will return save in the forms of gift alms wages paid for his services or the price of merchandise which he has delivered In a word increase perishes so far as the borrower is concerned or to use the more energetic Latin phrase res perit solventi three THE RIGHT OF INCREASE OPPRESSES THE PROPRIETOR AS WELL AS THE STRANGER The master of a thing as its proprietor levies a tax for the use of his property upon himself as its possessor equal to that which he would receive from a third party so that capital bears interest in the hands of the capitalist as well as in those of the borrower and the commandite If indeed rather than accept a rent of five hundred francs for my apartment I prefer to occupy and enjoy it it is clear that I shall become my own debtor for a rent equal to that which I deny myself This principle is universally practised in business and is regarded as an axiom by the economists Manufacturers also who have the advantage of being proprietors of their floating capital although they owe no interest to any one in calculating their profits subtract from them not only their running expenses and the wages of their employees but also the interest on their capital For the same reason money lenders retain in their own possession as little money as possible for since all capital necessarily bears interest if this interest is supplied by no one it comes out of the capital which is to that extent diminished Thus by the right of increase capital eats itself up This is doubtless the idea that Papinius intended to convey in the phrase as elegant as it is forcible Foenus mordet solidam I beg pardon for using Latin so frequently in discussing this subject it is an homage which I pay to the most usurious nation that ever existed FIRST PROPOSITION Property is impossible because it demands Something for Nothing The discussion of this proposition covers the same ground as that of the origin of farm rent which is so much debated by the economists When I read the writings of the greater part of these men I cannot avoid a feeling of contempt mingled with anger in view of this mass of nonsense in which the detestable vies with the absurd It would be a repetition of the story of the elephant in the moon were it not for the atrocity of the consequences To seek a rational and legitimate origin of that which is and ever must be only robbery extortion and plunder that must be the height of the proprietor s folly the last degree of bedevilment into which minds otherwise judicious can be thrown by the perversity of selfishness A farmer says Say is a wheat manufacturer who among other tools which serve him in modifying the material from which he makes the wheat employs one large tool which we call a field If he is not the proprietor of the field if he is only a tenant he pays the proprietor for the productive service of this tool The tenant is reimbursed by the purchaser the latter by another until the product reaches the consumer who redeems the first payment PLUS all the others by means of which the product has at last come into his hands Let us lay aside the subsequent payments by which the product reaches the consumer and for the present pay attention only to the first one of all the rent paid to the proprietor by the tenant On what ground we ask is the proprietor entitled to this rent According to Ricardo MacCulloch and Mill farm rent properly speaking is simply the EXCESS OF THE PRODUCT OF THE MOST FERTILE LAND OVER THAT OF LANDS OF AN INFERIOR QUALITY so that farm rent is not demanded for the former until the increase of population renders necessary the cultivation of the latter It is difficult to see any sense in this How can a right to the land be based upon a difference in the quality of the land How can varieties of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics This reasoning is either so subtle or so stupid that the more I think of it the more bewildered I become Suppose two pieces of land of equal area the one A capable of supporting ten thousand inhabitants the other B capable of supporting nine thousand only when owing to an increase in their number the inhabitants of A shall be forced to cultivate B the landed proprietors of A will exact from their tenants in A a rent proportional to the difference between ten and nine So say I think Ricardo MacCulloch and Mill But if A supports as many inhabitants as it can contain that is if the inhabitants of A by our hypothesis have only just enough land to keep them alive how can they pay farm rent If they had gone no farther than to say that the difference in land has OCCASIONED farm rent instead of CAUSED it this observation would have taught us a valuable lesson namely that farm rent grew out of a desire for equality Indeed if all men have an equal right to the possession of good land no one can be forced to cultivate bad land without indemnification Farm rent according to Ricardo MacCulloch and Mill would then have been a compensation for loss and hardship This system of practical equality is a bad one no doubt but it sprang from good intentions What argument can Ricardo MacCulloch and Mill develop therefrom in favor of property Their theory turns against themselves and strangles them Malthus thinks that farm rent has its source in the power possessed by land of producing more than is necessary to supply the wants of the men who cultivate it I would ask Malthus why successful labor should entitle the idle to a portion of the products But the worthy Malthus is mistaken in regard to the fact Yes land has the power of producing more than is needed by those who cultivate it if by CULTIVATORS is meant tenants only The tailor also makes more clothes than he wears and the cabinet maker more furniture than he uses But since the various professions imply and sustain one another not only the farmer but the followers of all arts and trades even to the doctor and the school teacher are and ought to be regarded as CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND Malthus bases farm rent upon the principle of commerce Now the fundamental law of commerce being equivalence of the products exchanged any thing which destroys this equivalence violates the law There is an error in the estimate which needs to be corrected Buchanan a commentator on Smith regarded farm rent as the result of a monopoly and maintained that labor alone is productive Consequently he thought that without this monopoly products would rise in price and he found no basis for farm rent save in the civil law This opinion is a corollary of that which makes the civil law the basis of property But why has the civil law which ought to be the written expression of justice authorized this monopoly Whoever says monopoly necessarily excludes justice Now to say that farm rent is a monopoly sanctioned by the law is to say that injustice is based on justice a contradiction in terms Say answers Buchanan that the proprietor is not a monopolist because a monopolist is one who does not increase the utility of the merchandise which passes through his hands How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant s products Has he ploughed sowed reaped mowed winnowed weeded These are the processes by which the tenant and his employees increase the utility of the material which they consume for the purpose of reproduction The landed proprietor increases the utility of products by means of his implement the land This implement receives in one state and returns in another the materials of which wheat is composed The action of the land is a chemical process which so modifies the material that it multiplies it by destroying it The soil is then a producer of utility and when it the soil asks its pay in the form of profit or farm rent for its proprietor it at the same time gives something to the consumer in exchange for the amount which the consumer pays it It gives him a produced utility and it is the production of this utility which warrants us in calling land productive as well as labor Let us clear up this matter The blacksmith who manufactures for the farmer implements of husbandry the wheelwright who makes him a cart the mason who builds his barn the carpenter the basket maker c all of whom contribute to agricultural production by the tools which they provide are producers of utility consequently they are entitled to a part of the products Undoubtedly says Say but the land also is an implement whose service must be paid for then I admit that the land is an implement but who made it Did the proprietor Did he by the efficacious virtue of the right of property by this MORAL QUALITY infused into the soil endow it with vigor and fertility Exactly there lies the monopoly of the proprietor in the fact that though he did not make the implement he asks pay for its use When the Creator shall present himself and claim farm rent we will consider the matter with him or even when the proprietor his pretended representative shall exhibit his power of attorney The proprietor s service adds Say is easy I admit It is a frank confession But we cannot disregard it Without property one farmer would contend with another for the possession of a field without a proprietor and the field would remain uncultivated Then the proprietor s business is to reconcile farmers by robbing them O logic O justice O the marvellous wisdom of economists The proprietor if they are right is like Perrin Dandin who when summoned by two travellers to settle a dispute about an oyster opened it gobbled it and said to them The Court awards you each a shell Could any thing worse be said of property Will Say tell us why the same farmers who if there were no proprietors would contend with each other for possession of the soil do not contend to day with the proprietors for this possession Obviously because they think them legitimate possessors and because their respect for even an imaginary right exceeds their avarice I proved in Chapter II that possession is sufficient without property to maintain social order Would it be more difficult then to reconcile possessors without masters than tenants controlled by proprietors Would laboring men who respect much to their own detriment the pretended rights of the idler violate the natural rights of the producer and the manufacturer What if the husbandman forfeited his right to the land as soon as he ceased to occupy it would he become more covetous And would the impossibility of demanding increase of taxing another s labor be a source of quarrels and law suits The economists use singular logic But we are not yet through Admit that the proprietor is the legitimate master of the land The land is an instrument of production they say That is true But when changing the noun into an adjective they alter the phrase thus The land is a productive instrument they make a wicked blunder According to Quesnay and the early economists all production comes from the land Smith Ricardo and de Tracy on the contrary say that labor is the sole agent of production Say and most of his successors teach that BOTH land AND labor AND capital are productive The latter constitute the eclectic school of political economy The truth is that NEITHER land NOR labor NOR capital is productive Production results from the company operation of these three equally necessary elements which taken separately are equally sterile Political economy indeed treats of the production distribution and consumption of wealth or values But of what values Of the values produced by human industry that is of the changes made in matter by man that he may appropriate it to his own use and not at all of Nature s spontaneous productions Man s labor consists in a simple laying on of hands When he has taken that trouble he has produced a value Until then the salt of the sea the water of the springs the grass of the fields and the trees of the forests are to him as if they were not The sea without the fisherman and his line supplies no fish The forest without the wood cutter and his axe furnishes neither fuel nor timber The meadow without the mower yields neither hay nor aftermath Nature is a vast mass of material to be cultivated and converted into products but Nature produces nothing for herself in the economical sense her products in their relation to man are not yet products Capital tools and machinery are likewise unproductive The hammer and the anvil without the blacksmith and the iron do not forge The mill without the miller and the grain does not grind c Bring tools and raw material together place a plough and some seed on fertile soil enter a smithy light the fire and shut up the shop you will produce nothing The following remark was made by an economist who possessed more good sense than most of his fellows Say credits capital with an active part unwarranted by its nature left to itself it is an idle tool J Droz Political Economy Finally labor and capital together when unfortunately combined produce nothing Plough a sandy desert beat the water of the rivers pass type through a sieve you will get neither wheat nor fish nor books Your trouble will be as fruitless as was the immense labor of the army of Xerxes who as Herodotus says with his three million soldiers scourged the Hellespont for twenty four hours as a punishment for having broken and scattered the pontoon bridge which the great king had thrown across it Tools and capital land and labor considered individually and abstractly are not literally speaking productive The proprietor who asks to be rewarded for the use of a tool or the productive power of his land takes for granted then that which is radically false namely that capital produces by its own effort and in taking pay for this imaginary product he literally receives something for nothing OBJECTION But if the blacksmith the wheelwright all manufacturers in short have a right to the products in return for the implements which they furnish and if land is an implement of production why does not this implement entitle its proprietor be his claim real or imaginary to a portion of the products as in the case of the manufacturers of ploughs and wagons REPLY Here we touch the heart of the question the mystery of property which we must clear up if we would understand any thing of the strange effects of the right of increase He who manufactures or repairs the farmer s tools receives the price ONCE either at the time of delivery or in several payments and when this price is once paid to the manufacturer the tools which he has delivered belong to him no more Never does he claim double payment for the same tool or the same job of repairs If he annually shares in the products of the farmer it is owing to the fact that he annually makes something for the farmer The proprietor on the contrary does not yield his implement eternally he is paid for it eternally he keeps it In fact the rent received by the proprietor is not intended to defray the expense of maintaining and repairing the implement this expense is charged to the borrower and does not concern the proprietor except as he is interested in the preservation of the article If he takes it upon himself to attend to the repairs he takes care that the money which he expends for this purpose is repaid This rent does not represent the product of the implement since of itself the implement produces nothing we have just proved this and we shall prove it more clearly still by its consequences Finally this rent does not represent the participation of the proprietor in the production since this participation could consist like that of the blacksmith and the wheelwright only in the surrender of the whole or a part of his implement in which case he would cease to be its proprietor which would involve a contradiction of the idea of property Then between the proprietor and his tenant there is no exchange either of values or services then as our axiom says farm rent is real increase an extortion based solely upon fraud and violence on the one hand and weakness and ignorance upon the other PRODUCTS say the economists ARE BOUGHT ONLY BY PRODUCTS This maxim is property s condemnation The proprietor producing neither by his own labor nor by his implement and receiving products in exchange for nothing is either a parasite or a thief Then if property can exist only as a right property is impossible COROLLARIES one The republican constitution of seventeen ninety three which defined property as the right to enjoy the fruit of one s labor was grossly mistaken It should have said Property is the right to enjoy and dispose at will of another s goods the fruit of another s industry and labor two Every possessor of lands houses furniture machinery tools money c who lends a thing for a price exceeding the cost of repairs the repairs being charged to the lender and representing products which he exchanges for other products is guilty of swindling and extortion In short all rent received nominally as damages but really as payment for a loan is an act of property a robbery HISTORICAL COMMENT The tax which a victorious nation levies upon a conquered nation is genuine farm rent The seigniorial rights abolished by the Revolution of seventeen eighty nine tithes mortmain statute labor c were different forms of the rights of property and they who under the titles of nobles seigneurs prebendaries c enjoyed these rights were neither more nor less than proprietors To defend property to day is to condemn the Revolution SECOND PROPOSITION Property is impossible because wherever it exists Production costs more than it is worth The preceding proposition was legislative in its nature this one is economical It serves to prove that property which originates in violence results in waste Production says Say is exchange on a large scale To render the exchange productive the value of the whole amount of service must be balanced by the value of the product If this condition is not complied with the exchange is unequal the producer gives more than he receives Now value being necessarily based upon utility it follows that every useless product is necessarily valueless that it cannot be exchanged and consequently that it cannot be given in payment for productive services Then though production may equal consumption it never can exceed it for there is no real production save where there is a production of utility and there is no utility save where there is a possibility of consumption Thus so much of every product as is rendered by excessive abundance inconsumable becomes useless valueless unexchangeable consequently unfit to be given in payment for any thing whatever and is no longer a product Consumption on the other hand to be legitimate to be true consumption must be reproductive of utility for if it is unproductive the products which it destroys are cancelled values things produced at a pure loss a state of things which causes products to depreciate in value Man has the power to destroy but he consumes only that which he reproduces Under a right system of economy there is then an equation between production and consumption These points established let us suppose a community of one thousand families enclosed in a territory of a given circumference and deprived of foreign intercourse Let this community represent the human race which scattered over the face of the earth is really isolated In fact the difference between a community and the human race being only a numerical one the economical results will be absolutely the same in each case Suppose then that these thousand families devoting themselves exclusively to wheat culture are obliged to pay to one hundred individuals chosen from the mass an annual revenue of ten per cent on their product It is clear that in such a case the right of increase is equivalent to a tax levied in advance upon social production Of what use is this tax It cannot be levied to supply the community with provisions for between that and farm rent there is nothing in common nor to pay for services and products for the proprietors laboring like the others have labored only for themselves Finally this tax is of no use to its recipients who having harvested wheat enough for their own consumption and not being able in a society without commerce and manufactures to procure any thing else in exchange for it thereby lose the advantage of their income In such a society one tenth of the product being inconsumable one tenth of the labor goes unpaid production costs more than it is worth Now change three hundred of our wheat producers into artisans of all kinds one hundred gardeners and wine growers sixty shoemakers and tailors fifty carpenters and blacksmiths eighty of various professions and that nothing may be lacking seven school masters one mayor one judge and one priest each industry furnishes the whole community with its special product Now the total production being one thousand each laborer s consumption is one namely wheat meat and grain zero point seven wine and vegetables zero point one shoes and clothing zero point six iron work and furniture zero point five sundries zero point eight instruction zero point seven administration zero point two mass zero point one Total one But the community owes a revenue of ten per cent and it matters little whether the farmers alone pay it or all the laborers are responsible for it the result is the same The farmer raises the price of his products in proportion to his share of the debt the other laborers follow his example Then after some fluctuations equilibrium is established and all pay nearly the same amount of the revenue It would be a grave error to assume that in a nation none but farmers pay farm rent the whole nation pays it I say then that by this tax of ten per cent each laborer s consumption is reduced as follows wheat zero point sixty three wine and vegetables zero point nine clothing and shoes zero point fifty four furniture and iron work zero point forty five other products zero point seventy two schooling zero point sixty three administration zero point eighteen mass zero point nine Total zero point nine The laborer has produced one he consumes only zero point nine He loses then one tenth of the price of his labor his production still costs more than it is worth On the other hand the tenth received by the proprietors is no less a waste for being laborers themselves they like the others possess in the nine tenths of their product the wherewithal to live they want for nothing Why should they wish their proportion of bread wine meat clothes shelter c to be doubled if they can neither consume nor exchange them Then farm rent with them as with the rest of the laborers is a waste and perishes in their hands Extend the hypothesis increase the number and variety of the products you still have the same result Hitherto we have considered the proprietor as taking part in the production not only as Say says by the use of his instrument but in an effective manner and by the labor of his hands Now it is easy to see that under such circumstances property will never exist What happens The proprietor an essentially libidinous animal without virtue or shame is not satisfied with an orderly and disciplined life He loves property because it enables him to do at leisure what he pleases and when he pleases Having obtained the means of life he gives himself up to trivialities and indolence he enjoys he fritters away his time he goes in quest of curiosities and novel sensations Property to enjoy itself has to abandon ordinary life and busy itself in luxurious occupations and unclean enjoyments Instead of giving up a farm rent which is perishing in their hands and thus lightening the labor of the community our hundred proprietors prefer to rest In consequence of this withdrawal the absolute production being diminished by one hundred while the consumption remains the same production and consumption seem to balance But in the first place since the proprietors no longer labor their consumption is according to economical principles unproductive consequently the previous condition of the community when the labor of one hundred was rewarded by no products is superseded by one in which the products of one hundred are consumed without labor The deficit is always the same whichever the column of the account in which it is expressed Either the maxims of political economy are false or else property which contradicts them is impossible The economists regarding all unproductive consumption as an evil as a robbery of the human race never fail to exhort proprietors to moderation labor and economy they preach to them the necessity of making themselves useful of remunerating production for that which they receive from it they launch the most terrible curses against luxury and laziness Very beautiful morality surely it is a pity that it lacks common sense The proprietor who labors or as the economists say WHO MAKES HIMSELF USEFUL is paid for this labor and utility is he therefore any the less idle as concerns the property which he does not use and from which he receives an income His condition whatever he may do is an unproductive and FELONIOUS one he cannot cease to waste and destroy without ceasing to be a proprietor But this is only the least of the evils which property engenders Society has to maintain some idle people whether or no It will always have the blind the maimed the insane and the idiotic It can easily support a few sluggards At this point the impossibilities thicken and become complicated THIRD PROPOSITION Property is impossible because with a given capital Production is proportional to labor not to property To pay a farm rent of one hundred at the rate of ten per cent of the product the product must be one thousand that the product may be one thousand a force of one thousand laborers is needed It follows that in granting a furlough as we have just done to our one hundred laborer proprietors all of whom had an equal right to lead the life of men of income we have placed ourselves in a position where we are unable to pay their revenues In fact the productive power which at first was one thousand being now but nine hundred the production is also reduced to nine hundred one tenth of which is ninety Either then ten proprietors out of the one hundred cannot be paid provided the remaining ninety are to get the whole amount of their farm rent or else all must consent to a decrease of ten per cent For it is not for the laborer who has been wanting in no particular who has produced as in the past to suffer by the withdrawal of the proprietor The latter must take the consequences of his own idleness But then the proprietor becomes poorer for the very reason that he wishes to enjoy by exercising his right he loses it so that property seems to decrease and vanish in proportion as we try to lay hold of it the more we pursue it the more it eludes our grasp What sort of a right is that which is governed by numerical relations and which an arithmetical calculation can destroy The laborer proprietor received first as laborer zero point nine in wages second as proprietor one in farm rent He said to himself My farm rent is sufficient I have enough and to spare without my labor And thus it is that the income upon which he calculated gets diminished by one tenth he at the same time not even suspecting the cause of this diminution By taking part in the production he was himself the creator of this tenth which has vanished and while he thought to labor only for himself he unwittingly suffered a loss in exchanging his products by which he was made to pay to himself one tenth of his own farm rent Like every one else he produced one and received but zero point nine If instead of nine hundred laborers there had been but five hundred the whole amount of farm rent would have been reduced to fifty if there had been but one hundred it would have fallen to ten We may posit then the following axiom as a law of proprietary economy INCREASE MUST DIMINISH AS THE NUMBER OF IDLERS AUGMENTS This first result will lead us to another more surprising still Its effect is to deliver us at one blow from all the evils of property without abolishing it without wronging proprietors and by a highly conservative process We have just proved that if the farm rent in a community of one thousand laborers is one hundred that of nine hundred would be ninety that of eight hundred eighty that of one hundred ten c So that in a community where there was but one laborer the farm rent would be but zero point one no matter how great the extent and value of the land appropriated Therefore WITH A GIVEN LANDED CAPITAL PRODUCTION IS PROPORTIONAL TO LABOR NOT TO PROPERTY Guided by this principle let us try to ascertain the maximum increase of all property whatever What is essentially a farm lease It is a contract by which the proprietor yields to a tenant possession of his land in consideration of a portion of that which it yields him the proprietor If in consequence of an increase in his household the tenant becomes ten times as strong as the proprietor he will produce ten times as much Would the proprietor in such a case be justified in raising the farm rent tenfold His right is not The more you produce the more I demand It is The more I sacrifice the more I demand The increase in the tenant s household the number of hands at his disposal the resources of his industry all these serve to increase production but bear no relation to the proprietor His claims are to be measured by his own productive capacity not that of others Property is the right of increase not a poll tax How could a man hardly capable of cultivating even a few acres by himself demand of a community on the ground of its use of ten thousand acres of his property ten thousand times as much as he is incapable of producing from one acre Why should the price of a loan be governed by the skill and strength of the borrower rather than by the utility sacrificed by the proprietor We must recognize then this second economical law INCREASE IS MEASURED BY A FRACTION OF THE PROPRIETORS PRODUCTION Now this production what is it In other words What can the lord and master of a piece of land justly claim to have sacrificed in lending it to a tenant The productive capacity of a proprietor like that of any laborer being one the product which he sacrifices in surrendering his land is also one If then the rate of increase is ten per cent the maximum increase is zero point one But we have seen that whenever a proprietor withdraws from production the amount of products is lessened by one Then the increase which accrues to him being equal to zero point one while he remains among the laborers will be equal after his withdrawal by the law of the decrease of farm rent to zero point nine Thus we are led to this final formula THE MAXIMUM INCOME OF A PROPRIETOR IS EQUAL TO THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE PRODUCT OF ONE LABORER some number being agreed upon to express this product THE DIMINUTION WHICH THIS INCOME SUFFERS IF THE PROPRIETOR IS IDLE IS EQUAL TO A FRACTION WHOSE NUMERATOR IS one AND WHOSE DENOMINATOR IS THE NUMBER WHICH EXPRESSES THE PRODUCT Thus the maximum income of an idle proprietor or of one who labors in his own behalf outside of the community figured at ten per cent on an average production of one thousand francs per laborer would be ninety francs If then there are in France one million proprietors with an income of one thousand francs each which they consume unproductively instead of the one thousand millions which are paid them annually they are entitled in strict justice and by the most accurate calculation to ninety millions only It is something of a reduction to take nine hundred and ten millions from the burdens which weigh so heavily upon the laboring class Nevertheless the account is not finished and the laborer is still ignorant of the full extent of his rights What is the right of increase when confined within just limits A recognition of the right of occupancy But since all have an equal right of occupancy every man is by the same title a proprietor Every man has a right to an income equal to a fraction of his product If then the laborer is obliged by the right of property to pay a rent to the proprietor the proprietor is obliged by the same right to pay the same amount of rent to the laborer and since their rights balance each other the difference between them is zero Scholium If farm rent is only a fraction of the supposed product of the proprietor whatever the amount and value of the property the same is true in the case of a large number of small and distinct proprietors For although one man may use the property of each separately he cannot use the property of all at the same time To sum up The right of increase which can exist only within very narrow limits defined by the laws of production is annihilated by the right of occupancy Now without the right of increase there is no property Then property is impossible FOURTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because it is Homicide If the right of increase could be subjected to the laws of reason and justice it would be reduced to an indemnity or reward whose MAXIMUM never could exceed for a single laborer a certain fraction of that which he is capable of producing This we have just shown But why should the right of increase let us not fear to call it by its right name the right of robbery be governed by reason with which it has nothing in common The proprietor is not content with the increase allotted him by good sense and the nature of things he demands ten times a hundred times a thousand times a million times as much By his own labor his property would yield him a product equal only to one and he demands of society no longer a right proportional to his productive capacity but a per capita tax He taxes his fellows in proportion to their strength their number and their industry A son is born to a farmer Good says the proprietor one more chance for increase By what process has farm rent been thus changed into a poll tax Why have our jurists and our theologians failed with all their shrewdness to check the extension of the right of increase The proprietor having estimated from his own productive capacity the number of laborers which his property will accommodate divides it into as many portions and says Each one shall yield me revenue To increase his income he has only to divide his property Instead of reckoning the interest due him on his labor he reckons it on his capital and by this substitution the same property which in the hands of its owner is capable of yielding only one is worth to him ten a hundred a thousand a million Consequently he has only to hold himself in readiness to register the names of the laborers who apply to him his task consists in drafting leases and receipts Not satisfied with the lightness of his duties the proprietor does not intend to bear even the deficit resulting from his idleness he throws it upon the shoulders of the producer of whom he always demands the same reward When the farm rent of a piece of land is once raised to its highest point the proprietor never lowers it high prices the scarcity of labor the disadvantages of the season even pestilence itself have no effect upon him why should he suffer from hard times when he does not labor Here commences a new series of phenomena Say who reasons with marvellous clearness whenever he assails taxation but who is blind to the fact that the proprietor as well as the tax gatherer steals from the tenant and in the same manner says in his second letter to Malthus If the collector of taxes and those who employ him consume one sixth of the products they thereby compel the producers to feed clothe and support themselves on five sixths of what they produce They admit this but say at the same time that it is possible for each one to live on five sixths of what he produces I admit that if they insist upon it but I ask if they believe that the producer would live as well in case they demanded of him instead of one sixth two sixths or one third of their products No but he would still live Then I ask whether he would still live in case they should rob him of two thirds then three quarters But I hear no reply If the master of the French economists had been less blinded by his proprietary prejudices he would have seen that farm rent has precisely the same effect Take a family of peasants composed of six persons father mother and four children living in the country and cultivating a small piece of ground Let us suppose that by hard labor they manage as the saying is to make both ends meet that having lodged warmed clothed and fed themselves they are clear of debt but have laid up nothing Taking the years together they contrive to live If the year is prosperous the father drinks a little more wine the daughters buy themselves a dress the sons a hat they eat a little cheese and occasionally some meat I say that these people are on the road to wreck and ruin For by the third corollary of our axiom they owe to themselves the interest on their own capital Estimating this capital at only eight thousand francs at two and a half per cent there is an annual interest of two hundred francs to be paid If then these two hundred francs instead of being subtracted from the gross product to be saved and capitalized are consumed there is an annual deficit of two hundred francs in the family assets so that at the end of forty years these good people without suspecting it will have eaten up their property and become bankrupt This result seems ridiculous it is a sad reality The conscription comes What is the conscription An act of property exercised over families by the government without warning a robbery of men and money The peasants do not like to part with their sons in that I do not think them wrong It is hard for a young man of twenty to gain any thing by life in the barracks unless he is depraved he detests it You can generally judge of a soldier s morality by his hatred of his uniform Unfortunate wretches or worthless scamps such is the make up of the French army This ought not to be the case but so it is Question a hundred thousand men and not one will contradict my assertion Our peasant in redeeming his two conscripted sons expends four thousand francs which he borrows for that purpose the interest on this at five per cent is two hundred francs a sum equal to that referred to above If up to this time the production of the family constantly balanced by its consumption has been one thousand two hundred francs or two hundred francs per persons in order to pay this interest either the six laborers must produce as much as seven or must consume as little as five Curtail consumption they cannot how can they curtail necessity To produce more is impossible they can work neither harder nor longer Shall they take a middle course and consume five and a half while producing six and a half They would soon find that with the stomach there is no compromise that beyond a certain degree of abstinence it is impossible to go that strict necessity can be curtailed but little without injury to the health and as for increasing the product there comes a storm a drought an epizootic and all the hopes of the farmer are dashed In short the rent will not be paid the interest will accumulate the farm will be seized and the possessor ejected Thus a family which lived in prosperity while it abstained from exercising the right of property falls into misery as soon as the exercise of this right becomes a necessity Property requires of the husbandman the double power of enlarging his land and fertilizing it by a simple command While a man is simply possessor of the land he finds in it means of subsistence as soon as he pretends to proprietorship it suffices him no longer Being able to produce only that which he consumes the fruit of his labor is his recompense for his trouble nothing is left for the instrument Required to pay what he cannot produce such is the condition of the tenant after the proprietor has retired from social production in order to speculate upon the labor of others by new methods Let us now return to our first hypothesis The nine hundred laborers sure that their future production will equal that of the past are quite surprised after paying their farm rent to find themselves poorer by one tenth than they were the previous year In fact this tenth which was formerly produced and paid by the proprietor laborer who then took part in the production and paid part of the public expenses now has not been produced and has been paid It must then have been taken from the producer s consumption To choke this inexplicable deficit the laborer borrows confident of his intention and ability to return a confidence which is shaken the following year by a new loan PLUS the interest on the first From whom does he borrow From the proprietor The proprietor lends his surplus to the laborer and this surplus which he ought to return becomes being lent at interest a new source of profit to him Then debts increase indefinitely the proprietor makes advances to the producer who never returns them and the latter constantly robbed and constantly borrowing from the robbers ends in bankruptcy defrauded of all that he had Suppose that the proprietor who needs his tenant to furnish him with an income then releases him from his debts He will thus do a very benevolent deed which will procure for him a recommendation in the curate s prayers while the poor tenant overwhelmed by this unstinted charity and taught by his catechism to pray for his benefactors will promise to redouble his energy and suffer new hardships that he may discharge his debt to so kind a master This time he takes precautionary measures he raises the price of grains The manufacturer does the same with his products The reaction comes and after some fluctuation the farm rent which the tenant thought to put upon the manufacturer s shoulders becomes nearly balanced So that while he is congratulating himself upon his success he finds himself again impoverished but to an extent somewhat smaller than before For the rise having been general the proprietor suffers with the rest so that the laborers instead of being poorer by one tenth lose only nine hundredths But always it is a debt which necessitates a loan the payment of interest economy and fasting Fasting for the nine hundredths which ought not to be paid and are paid fasting for the redemption of debts fasting to pay the interest on them Let the crop fail and the fasting becomes starvation They say IT IS NECESSARY TO WORK MORE That means obviously that IT IS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE MORE By what conditions is production effected By the combined action of labor capital and land As for the labor the tenant undertakes to furnish it but capital is formed only by economy Now if the tenant could accumulate any thing he would pay his debts But granting that he has plenty of capital of what use would it be to him if the extent of the land which he cultivates always remained the same He needs to enlarge his farm Will it be said finally that he must work harder and to better advantage But in our estimation of farm rent we have assumed the highest possible average of production Were it not the highest the proprietor would increase the farm rent Is not this the way in which the large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents as fast as they have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of industry how much society can produce from their property The proprietor is a foreigner to society but like the vulture his eyes fixed upon his prey he holds himself ready to pounce upon and devour it The facts to which we have called attention in a community of one thousand persons are reproduced on a large scale in every nation and wherever human beings live but with infinite variations and in innumerable forms which it is no part of my intention to describe In fine property after having robbed the laborer by usury murders him slowly by starvation Now without robbery and murder property cannot exist with robbery and murder it soon dies for want of support Therefore it is impossible FIFTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because if it exists Society devours itself When the ass is too heavily loaded he lies down man always moves on Upon this indomitable courage the proprietor well knowing that it exists bases his hopes of speculation The free laborer produces ten for me thinks the proprietor he will produce twelve Indeed before consenting to the confiscation of his fields before bidding farewell to the paternal roof the peasant whose story we have just told makes a desperate effort he leases new land he will sow one third more and taking half of this new product for himself he will harvest an additional sixth and thereby pay his rent What an evil To add one sixth to his production the farmer must add not one sixth but two sixths to his labor At such a price he pays a farm rent which in God s eyes he does not owe The tenant s example is followed by the manufacturer The former tills more land and dispossesses his neighbors the latter lowers the price of his merchandise and endeavors to monopolize its manufacture and sale and to crush out his competitors To satisfy property the laborer must first produce beyond his needs Then he must produce beyond his strength for by the withdrawal of laborers who become proprietors the one always follows from the other But to produce beyond his strength and needs he must invade the production of another and consequently diminish the number of producers Thus the proprietor after having lessened production by stepping outside lessens it still further by encouraging the monopoly of labor Let us calculate it The laborer s deficit after paying his rent being as we have seen one tenth he tries to increase his production by this amount He sees no way of accomplishing this save by increasing his labor this also he does The discontent of the proprietors who have not received the full amount of their rent the advantageous offers and promises made them by other farmers whom they suppose more diligent more industrious and more reliable the secret plots and intrigues all these give rise to a movement for the re division of labor and the elimination of a certain number of producers Out of nine hundred ninety will be ejected that the production of the others may be increased one tenth But will the total product be increased Not in the least there will be eight hundred and ten laborers producing as nine hundred while to accomplish their purpose they would have to produce as one thousand Now it having been proved that farm rent is proportional to the landed capital instead of to labor and that it never diminishes the debts must continue as in the past while the labor has increased Here then we have a society which is continually decimating itself and which would destroy itself did not the periodical occurrence of failures bankruptcies and political and economical catastrophes re establish equilibrium and distract attention from the real causes of the universal distress The monopoly of land and capital is followed by economical processes which also result in throwing laborers out of employment Interest being a constant burden upon the shoulders of the farmer and the manufacturer they exclaim each speaking for himself I should have the means wherewith to pay my rent and interest had I not to pay so many hands Then those admirable inventions intended to assure the easy and speedy performance of labor become so many infernal machines which kill laborers by thousands A few years ago the Countess of Strafford ejected fifteen thousand persons from her estate who as tenants added to its value This act of private administration was repeated in eighteen twenty by another large Scotch proprietor towards six hundred tenants and their families Tissot on Suicide and Revolt The author whom I quote and who has written eloquent words concerning the revolutionary spirit which prevails in modern society does not say whether he would have disapproved of a revolt on the part of these exiles For myself I avow boldly that in my eyes it would have been the first of rights and the holiest of duties and all that I desire to day is that my profession of faith be understood Society devours itself one By the violent and periodical sacrifice of laborers this we have just seen and shall see again two By the stoppage of the producer s consumption caused by property These two modes of suicide are at first simultaneous but soon the first is given additional force by the second famine uniting with usury to render labor at once more necessary and more scarce By the principles of commerce and political economy that an industrial enterprise may be successful its product must furnish one The interest on the capital employed two Means for the preservation of this capital three The wages of all the employees and contractors Further as large a profit as possible must be realized The financial shrewdness and rapacity of property is worthy of admiration Each different name which increase takes affords the proprietor an opportunity to receive it one In the form of interest two In the form of profit For it says a part of the income derived from manufactures consists of interest on the capital employed If one hundred thousand francs have been invested in a manufacturing enterprise and in a year s time five thousand francs have been received therefrom in addition to the expenses there has been no profit but only interest on the capital Now the proprietor is not a man to labor for nothing Like the lion in the fable he gets paid in each of his capacities so that after he has been served nothing is left for his associates Ego primam tollo nominor quia leo Secundam quia sum fortis tribuctis mihi Tum quia plus valeo me sequetur tertia Malo adficietur si quis quartam tetigerit I know nothing prettier than this fable I am the contractor I take the first share I am the laborer I take the second I am the capitalist I take the third I am the proprietor I take the whole In four lines Phaedrus has summed up all the forms of property I say that this interest all the more then this profit is impossible What are laborers in relation to each other So many members of a large industrial society to each of whom is assigned a certain portion of the general production by the principle of the division of labor and functions Suppose first that this society is composed of but three individuals a cattle raiser a tanner and a shoemaker The social industry then is that of shoemaking If I should ask what ought to be each producer s share of the social product the first schoolboy whom I should meet would answer by a rule of commerce and association that it should be one third But it is not our duty here to balance the rights of laborers conventionally associated we have to prove that whether associated or not our three workers are obliged to act as if they were that whether they will or no they are associated by the force of things by mathematical necessity Three processes are required in the manufacture of shoes the rearing of cattle the preparation of their hides and the cutting and sewing If the hide on leaving the farmer s stable is worth one it is worth two on leaving the tanner s pit and three on leaving the shoemaker s shop Each laborer has produced a portion of the utility so that by adding all these portions together we get the value of the article To obtain any quantity whatever of this article each producer must pay then first for his own labor and second for the labor of the other producers Thus to obtain as many shoes as can be made from ten hides the farmer will give thirty raw hides and the tanner twenty tanned hides For the shoes that are made from ten hides are worth thirty raw hides in consequence of the extra labor bestowed upon them just as twenty tanned hides are worth thirty raw hides on account of the tanner s labor But if the shoemaker demands thirty three in the farmer s product or twenty two in the tanner s for ten in his own there will be no exchange for if there were the farmer and the tanner after having paid the shoemaker ten for his labor would have to pay eleven for that which they had themselves sold for ten which of course would be impossible eighteen Well this is precisely what happens whenever an emolument of any kind is received be it called revenue farm rent interest or profit In the little community of which we are speaking if the shoemaker in order to procure tools buy a stock of leather and support himself until he receives something from his investment borrows money at interest it is clear that to pay this interest he will have to make a profit off the tanner and the farmer But as this profit is impossible unless fraud is used the interest will fall back upon the shoulders of the unfortunate shoemaker and ruin him I have imagined a case of unnatural simplicity There is no human society but sustains more than three vocations The most uncivilized society supports numerous industries to day the number of industrial functions I mean by industrial functions all useful functions exceeds perhaps a thousand However numerous the occupations the economic law remains the same THAT THE PRODUCER MAY LIVE HIS WAGES MUST REPURCHASE HIS PRODUCT The economists cannot be ignorant of this rudimentary principle of their pretended science why then do they so obstinately defend property and inequality of wages and the legitimacy of usury and the honesty of profit all of which contradict the economic law and make exchange impossible A contractor pays one hundred thousand francs for raw material fifty thousand francs in wages and then expects to receive a product of two hundred thousand francs that is expects to make a profit on the material and on the labor of his employees but if the laborers and the purveyor of the material cannot with their combined wages repurchase that which they have produced for the contractor how can they live I will develop my question Here details become necessary If the workingman receives for his labor an average of three francs per day his employer in order to gain any thing beyond his own salary if only interest on his capital must sell the day s labor of his employee in the form of merchandise for more than three francs The workingman cannot then repurchase that which he has produced for his master It is thus with all trades whatsoever The tailor the hatter the cabinet maker the blacksmith the tanner the mason the jeweller the printer the clerk c even to the farmer and wine grower cannot repurchase their products since producing for a master who in one form or another makes a profit they are obliged to pay more for their own labor than they get for it In France twenty millions of laborers engaged in all the branches of science art and industry produce every thing which is useful to man Their annual wages amount it is estimated to twenty thousand millions but in consequence of the right of property and the multifarious forms of increase premiums tithes interests fines profits farm rents house rents revenues emoluments of every nature and description their products are estimated by the proprietors and employers at twenty five thousand millions What does that signify That the laborers who are obliged to repurchase these products in order to live must either pay five for that which they produced for four or fast one day in five If there is an economist in France able to show that this calculation is false I summon him to appear and I promise to retract all that I have wrongfully and wickedly uttered in my attacks upon property Let us now look at the results of this profit If the wages of the workingmen were the same in all pursuits the deficit caused by the proprietor s tax would be felt equally everywhere but also the cause of the evil would be so apparent that it would soon be discovered and suppressed But as there is the same inequality of wages from that of the scavenger up to that of the minister of state as of property robbery continually rebounds from the stronger to the weaker so that since the laborer finds his hardships increase as he descends in the social scale the lowest class of people are literally stripped naked and eaten alive by the others The laboring people can buy neither the cloth which they weave nor the furniture which they manufacture nor the metal which they forge nor the jewels which they cut nor the prints which they engrave They can procure neither the wheat which they plant nor the wine which they grow nor the flesh of the animals which they raise They are allowed neither to dwell in the houses which they build nor to attend the plays which their labor supports nor to enjoy the rest which their body requires And why Because the right of increase does not permit these things to be sold at the cost price which is all that laborers can afford to pay On the signs of those magnificent warehouses which he in his poverty admires the laborer reads in large letters This is thy work and thou shalt not have it Sic vos non vobis Every manufacturer who employs one thousand laborers and gains from them daily one sou each is slowly pushing them into a state of misery Every man who makes a profit has entered into a conspiracy with famine But the whole nation has not even this labor by means of which property starves it And why Because the workers are forced by the insufficiency of their wages to monopolize labor and because before being destroyed by dearth they destroy each other by competition Let us pursue this truth no further If the laborer s wages will not purchase his product it follows that the product is not made for the producer For whom then is it intended For the richer consumer that is for only a fraction of society But when the whole society labors it produces for the whole society If then only a part of society consumes sooner or later a part of society will be idle Now idleness is death as well for the laborer as for the proprietor This conclusion is inevitable The most distressing spectacle imaginable is the sight of producers resisting and struggling against this mathematical necessity this power of figures to which their prejudices blind them If one hundred thousand printers can furnish reading matter enough for thirty four millions of men and if the price of books is so high that only one third of that number can afford to buy them it is clear that these one hundred thousand printers will produce three times as much as the booksellers can sell That the products of the laborers may never exceed the demands of the consumers the laborers must either rest two days out of three or separating into three groups relieve each other three times a week month or quarter that is during two thirds of their life they must not live But industry under the influence of property does not proceed with such regularity It endeavors to produce a great deal in a short time because the greater the amount of products and the shorter the time of production the less each product costs As soon as a demand begins to be felt the factories fill up and everybody goes to work Then business is lively and both governors and governed rejoice But the more they work to day the more idle will they be hereafter the more they laugh the more they shall weep Under the rule of property the flowers of industry are woven into none but funeral wreaths The laborer digs his own grave If the factory stops running the manufacturer has to pay interest on his capital the same as before He naturally tries then to continue production by lessening expenses Then comes the lowering of wages the introduction of machinery the employment of women and children to do the work of men bad workmen and wretched work They still produce because the decreased cost creates a larger market but they do not produce long because the cheapness being due to the quantity and rapidity of production the productive power tends more than ever to outstrip consumption It is when laborers whose wages are scarcely sufficient to support them from one day to another are thrown out of work that the consequences of the principle of property become most frightful They have not been able to economize they have made no savings they have accumulated no capital whatever to support them even one day more Today the factory is closed To morrow the people starve in the streets Day after tomorrow they will either die in the hospital or eat in the jail And still new misfortunes come to complicate this terrible situation In consequence of the cessation of business and the extreme cheapness of merchandise the manufacturer finds it impossible to pay the interest on his borrowed capital whereupon his frightened creditors hasten to withdraw their funds Production is suspended and labor comes to a standstill Then people are astonished to see capital desert commerce and throw itself upon the Stock Exchange and I once heard M Blanqui bitterly lamenting the blind ignorance of capitalists The cause of this movement of capital is very simple but for that very reason an economist could not understand it or rather must not explain it The cause lies solely in COMPETITION I mean by competition not only the rivalry between two parties engaged in the same business but the general and simultaneous effort of all kinds of business to get ahead of each other This effort is to day so strong that the price of merchandise scarcely covers the cost of production and distribution so that the wages of all laborers being lessened nothing remains not even interest for the capitalists The primary cause of commercial and industrial stagnations is then interest on capital that interest which the ancients with one accord branded with the name of usury whenever it was paid for the use of money but which they did not dare to condemn in the forms of house rent farm rent or profit as if the nature of the thing lent could ever warrant a charge for the lending that is robbery In proportion to the increase received by the capitalist will be the frequency and intensity of commercial crises the first being given we always can determine the two others and vice versa Do you wish to know the regulator of a society Ascertain the amount of active capital that is the capital bearing interest and the legal rate of this interest The course of events will be a series of overturns whose number and violence will be proportional to the activity of capital In eighteen thirty nine the number of failures in Paris alone was one thousand and sixty four This proportion was kept up in the early months of eighteen forty and as I write these lines the crisis is not yet ended It is said further that the number of houses which have wound up their business is greater than the number of declared failures By this flood we may judge of the waterspout s power of suction The decimation of society is now imperceptible and permanent now periodical and violent it depends upon the course which property takes In a country where the property is pretty evenly distributed and where little business is done the rights and claims of each being balanced by those of others the power of invasion is destroyed There it may be truly said property does not exist since the right of increase is scarcely exercised at all The condition of the laborers as regards security of life is almost the same as if absolute equality prevailed among them They are deprived of all the advantages of full and free association but their existence is not endangered in the least With the exception of a few isolated victims of the right of property of this misfortune whose primary cause no one perceives the society appears to rest calmly in the bosom of this sort of equality But have a care it is balanced on the edge of a sword at the slightest shock it will fall and meet with death Ordinarily the whirlpool of property localizes itself On the one hand farm rent stops at a certain point on the other in consequence of competition and over production the price of manufactured goods does not rise so that the condition of the peasant varies but little and depends mainly on the seasons The devouring action of property bears then principally upon business We commonly say COMMERCIAL CRISES not AGRICULTURAL CRISES because while the farmer is eaten up slowly by the right of increase the manufacturer is swallowed at a single mouthful This leads to the cessation of business the destruction of fortunes and the inactivity of the working people who die one after another on the highways and in the hospitals prisons and galleys To sum up this proposition Property sells products to the laborer for more than it pays him for them therefore it is impossible APPENDIX TO THE FIFTH PROPOSITION I Certain reformers and even the most of the publicists who though belonging to no particular school busy themselves in devising means for the amelioration of the lot of the poorer and more numerous class lay much stress now a days on a better organization of labor The disciples of Fourier especially never stop shouting ON TO THE PHALANX declaiming in the same breath against the foolishness and absurdity of other sects They consist of half a dozen incomparable geniuses who have discovered that FIVE AND FOUR MAKE NINE TAKE TWO AWAY AND NINE REMAIN and who weep over the blindness of France who refuses to believe in this astonishing arithmetic one one Fourier having to multiply a whole number by a fraction never failed they say to obtain a product much greater than the multiplicand He affirmed that under his system of harmony the mercury would solidify when the temperature was above zero He might as well have said that the Harmonians would make burning ice I once asked an intelligent phalansterian what he thought of such physics I do not know he answered but I believe And yet the same man disbelieved in the doctrine of the Real Presence In fact the Fourierists proclaim themselves on the one hand defenders of property of the right of increase which they have thus formulated TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS CAPITAL HIS LABOR AND HIS SKILL On the other hand they wish the workingman to come into the enjoyment of all the wealth of society that is abridging the expression into the undivided enjoyment of his own product Is not this like saying to the workingman Labor you shall have three francs per day you shall live on fifty five sous you shall give the rest to the proprietor and thus you will consume three francs If the above speech is not an exact epitome of Charles Fourier s system I will subscribe to the whole phalansterian folly with a pen dipped in my own blood Of what use is it to reform industry and agriculture of what use indeed to labor at all if property is maintained and labor can never meet its expenses Without the abolition of property the organization of labor is neither more nor less than a delusion If production should be quadrupled a thing which does not seem to me at all impossible it would be labor lost if the additional product was not consumed it would be of no value and the proprietor would decline to receive it as interest if it was consumed all the disadvantages of property would reappear It must be confessed that the theory of passional attraction is gravely at fault in this particular and that Fourier when he tried to harmonize the PASSION for property a bad passion whatever he may say to the contrary blocked his own chariot wheels The absurdity of the phalansterian economy is so gross that many people suspect Fourier in spite of all the homage paid by him to proprietors of having been a secret enemy of property This opinion might be supported by plausible arguments still it is not mine Charlatanism was too important a part for such a man to play and sincerity too insignificant a one I would rather think Fourier ignorant which is generally admitted than disingenuous As for his disciples before they can formulate any opinion of their own they must declare once for all unequivocally and with no mental reservation whether they mean to maintain property or not and what they mean by their famous motto To each according to his capital his labor and his skill II But some half converted proprietor will observe Would it not be possible by suppressing the bank incomes farm rent house rent usury of all kinds and finally property itself to proportion products to capacities That was saint Simon s idea it was also Fourier s it is the desire of the human conscience and no decent person would dare maintain that a minister of state should live no better than a peasant O Midas your ears are long What will you never understand that disparity of wages and the right of increase are one and the same Certainly saint Simon Fourier and their respective flocks committed a serious blunder in attempting to unite the one inequality and communism the other inequality and property but you a man of figures a man of economy you who know by heart your LOGARITHMIC tables how can you make so stupid a mistake Does not political economy itself teach you that the product of a man whatever be his individual capacity is never worth more than his labor and that a man s labor is worth no more than his consumption You remind me of that great constitution framer poor Pinheiro Ferreira the Sieyes of the nineteenth century who dividing the citizens of a nation into twelve classes or if you prefer into twelve grades assigned to some a salary of one hundred thousand francs each to others eighty thousand then twenty five thousand fifteen thousand ten thousand c down to one thousand five hundred and one thousand francs the minimum allowance of a citizen Pinheiro loved distinctions and could no more conceive of a State without great dignitaries than of an army without drum majors and as he also loved or thought he loved liberty equality and fraternity he combined the good and the evil of our old society in an eclectic philosophy which he embodied in a constitution Excellent Pinheiro Liberty even to passive submission fraternity even to identity of language equality even in the jury box and at the guillotine such was his ideal republic Unappreciated genius of whom the present century was unworthy but whom the future will avenge Listen proprietor Inequality of talent exists in fact in right it is not admissible it goes for nothing it is not thought of One Newton in a century is equal to thirty millions of men the psychologist admires the rarity of so fine a genius the legislator sees only the rarity of the function Now rarity of function bestows no privilege upon the functionary and that for several reasons all equally forcible one Rarity of genius was not in the Creator s design a motive to compel society to go down on its knees before the man of superior talents but a providential means for the performance of all functions to the greatest advantage of all two Talent is a creation of society rather than a gift of Nature it is an accumulated capital of which the receiver is only the guardian Without society without the education and powerful assistance which it furnishes the finest nature would be inferior to the most ordinary capacities in the very respect in which it ought to shine The more extensive a man s knowledge the more luxuriant his imagination the more versatile his talent the more costly has his education been the more remarkable and numerous were his teachers and his models and the greater is his debt The farmer produces from the time that he leaves his cradle until he enters his grave the fruits of art and science are late and scarce frequently the tree dies before the fruit ripens Society in cultivating talent makes a sacrifice to hope three Capacities have no common standard of comparison the conditions of development being equal inequality of talent is simply speciality of talent four Inequality of wages like the right of increase is economically impossible Take the most favorable case that where each laborer has furnished his maximum production that there may be an equitable distribution of products the share of each must be equal to the quotient of the total production divided by the number of laborers This done what remains wherewith to pay the higher wages Nothing whatever Will it be said that all laborers should be taxed But then their consumption will not be equal to their production their wages will not pay for their productive service they will not be able to repurchase their product and we shall once more be afflicted with all the calamities of property I do not speak of the injustice done to the defrauded laborer of rivalry of excited ambition and burning hatred these may all be important considerations but they do not hit the point On the one hand each laborer s task being short and easy and the means for its successful accomplishment being equal in all cases how could there be large and small producers On the other hand all functions being equal either on account of the actual equivalence of talents and capacities or on account of social company operation how could a functionary claim a salary proportional to the worth of his genius But what do I say In equality wages are always proportional to talents What is the economical meaning of wages The reproductive consumption of the laborer The very act by which the laborer produces constitutes then this consumption exactly equal to his production of which we are speaking When the astronomer produces observations the poet verses or the savant experiments they consume instruments books travels c c now if society supplies this consumption what more can the astronomer the savant or the poet demand We must conclude then that in equality and only in equality saint Simon s adage TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS CAPACITY TO EACH CAPACITY ACCORDING TO ITS RESULTS finds its full and complete application III The great evil the horrible and ever present evil arising from property is that while property exists population however reduced is and always must be over abundant Complaints have been made in all ages of the excess of population in all ages property has been embarrassed by the presence of pauperism not perceiving that it caused it Further nothing is more curious than the diversity of the plans proposed for its extermination Their atrocity is equalled only by their absurdity The ancients made a practice of abandoning their children The wholesale and retail slaughter of slaves civil and foreign wars also lent their aid In Rome where property held full sway these three means were employed so effectively and for so long a time that finally the empire found itself without inhabitants When the barbarians arrived nobody was to be found the fields were no longer cultivated grass grew in the streets of the Italian cities In China from time immemorial upon famine alone has devolved the task of sweeping away the poor The people living almost exclusively upon rice if an accident causes the crop to fail in a few days hunger kills the inhabitants by myriads and the Chinese historian records in the annals of the empire that in such a year of such an emperor twenty thirty fifty one hundred thousand inhabitants died of starvation Then they bury the dead and recommence the production of children until another famine leads to the same result Such appears to have been in all ages the Confucian economy I borrow the following facts from a modern economist Since the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries England has been preyed upon by pauperism At that time beggars were punished by law Nevertheless she had not one fourth as large a population as she has to day Edward prohibits alms giving on pain of imprisonment The laws of fifteen forty seven and sixteen fifty six prescribe a like punishment in case of a second offence Elizabeth orders that each parish shall support its own paupers But what is a pauper Charles II decides that an UNDISPUTED residence of forty days constitutes a settlement in a parish but if disputed the new comer is forced to pack off James II modifies this decision which is again modified by William In the midst of trials reports and modifications pauperism increases and the workingman languishes and dies The poor tax in seventeen seventy four exceeded forty millions of francs in seventeen eighty three four five it averaged fifty three millions eighteen thirteen more than a hundred and eighty seven millions five hundred thousand francs eighteen sixteen two hundred and fifty millions in eighteen seventeen it is estimated at three hundred and seventeen millions In eighteen twenty one the number of paupers enrolled upon the parish lists was estimated at four millions nearly one third of the population FRANCE In fifteen forty four Francis I establishes a compulsory tax in behalf of the poor In fifteen sixty six and fifteen eighty six the same principle is applied to the whole kingdom Under Louis XIV forty thousand paupers infested the capital as many in proportion as to day Mendicity was punished severely In seventeen forty the Parliament of Paris re establishes within its own jurisdiction the compulsory assessment The Constituent Assembly frightened at the extent of the evil and the difficulty of curing it ordains the statu quo The Convention proclaims assistance of the poor to be a NATIONAL DEBT Its law remains unexecuted Napoleon also wishes to remedy the evil his idea is imprisonment In that way said he I shall protect the rich from the importunity of beggars and shall relieve them of the disgusting sight of abject poverty O wonderful man From these facts which I might multiply still farther two things are to be inferred the one that pauperism is independent of population the other that all attempts hitherto made at its extermination have proved abortive Catholicism founds hospitals and convents and commands charity that is she encourages mendicity That is the extent of her insight as voiced by her priests The secular power of Christian nations now orders taxes on the rich now banishment and imprisonment for the poor that is on the one hand violation of the right of property and on the other civil death and murder The modern economists thinking that pauperism is caused by the excess of population exclusively have devoted themselves to devising checks Some wish to prohibit the poor from marrying thus having denounced religious celibacy they propose compulsory celibacy which will inevitably become licentious celibacy Others do not approve this method which they deem too violent and which they say deprives the poor man of THE ONLY PLEASURE WHICH HE KNOWS IN THIS WORLD They would simply recommend him to be PRUDENT This opinion is held by Malthus Sismondi Say Droz Duchatel c But if the poor are to be PRUDENT the rich must set the example Why should the marriageable age of the latter be fixed at eighteen years while that of the former is postponed until thirty Again they would do well to explain clearly what they mean by this matrimonial prudence which they so urgently recommend to the laborer for here equivocation is especially dangerous and I suspect that the economists are not thoroughly understood Some half enlightened ecclesiastics are alarmed when they hear prudence in marriage advised they fear that the divine injunction INCREASE AND MULTIPLY is to be set aside To be logical they must anathematize bachelors J Droz Political Economy M Droz is too honest a man and too little of a theologian to see why these casuists are so alarmed and this chaste ignorance is the very best evidence of the purity of his heart Religion never has encouraged early marriages and the kind of PRUDENCE which it condemns is that described in this Latin sentence from Sanchez An licet ob metum liberorum semen extra vas ejicere Destutt de Tracy seems to dislike prudence in either form He says I confess that I no more share the desire of the moralists to diminish and restrain our pleasures than that of the politicians to increase our procreative powers and accelerate reproduction He believes then that we should love and marry when and as we please Widespread misery results from love and marriage but this our philosopher does not heed True to the dogma of the necessity of evil to evil he looks for the solution of all problems He adds The multiplication of men continuing in all classes of society the surplus members of the upper classes are supported by the lower classes and those of the latter are destroyed by poverty This philosophy has few avowed partisans but it has over every other the indisputable advantage of demonstration in practice Not long since France heard it advocated in the Chamber of Deputies in the course of the discussion on the electoral reform POVERTY WILL ALWAYS EXIST That is the political aphorism with which the minister of state ground to powder the arguments of M Arago POVERTY WILL ALWAYS EXIST Yes so long as property does The Fourierists INVENTORS of so many marvellous contrivances could not in this field belie their character They invented four methods of checking increase of population at will one THE VIGOR OF WOMEN On this point they are contradicted by experience for although vigorous women may be less likely to conceive nevertheless they give birth to the healthiest children so that the advantage of maternity is on their side two INTEGRAL EXERCISE or the equal development of all the physical powers If this development is equal how is the power of reproduction lessened three THE GASTRONOMIC REGIME or in plain English the philosophy of the belly The Fourierists say that abundance of rich food renders women sterile just as too much sap while enhancing the beauty of flowers destroys their reproductive capacity But the analogy is a false one Flowers become sterile when the stamens or male organs are changed into petals as may be seen by inspecting a rose and when through excessive dampness the pollen loses its fertilizing power Then in order that the gastronomic regime may produce the results claimed for it not only must the females be fattened but the males must be rendered impotent four PHANEROGAMIC MORALITY or public concubinage I know not why the phalansterians use Greek words to convey ideas which can be expressed so clearly in French This method like the preceding one is copied from civilized customs Fourier himself cites the example of prostitutes as a proof Now we have no certain knowledge yet of the facts which he quotes So states Parent Duchatelet in his work on Prostitution From all the information which I have been able to gather I find that all the remedies for pauperism and fecundity sanctioned by universal practice philosophy political economy and the latest reformers may be summed up in the following list masturbation onanism nineteen sodomy tribadie polyandry twenty prostitution castration continence abortion and infanticide twenty one All these methods being proved inadequate there remains proscription Unfortunately proscription while decreasing the number of the poor increases their proportion If the interest charged by the proprietor upon the product is equal only to one twentieth of the product by law it is equal to one twentieth of the capital it follows that twenty laborers produce for nineteen only because there is one among them called proprietor who eats the share of two Suppose that the twentieth laborer the poor one is killed the production of the following year will be diminished one twentieth consequently the nineteenth will have to yield his portion and perish For since it is not one twentieth of the product of nineteen which must be paid to the proprietor but one twentieth of the product of twenty see third proposition each surviving laborer must sacrifice one twentieth PLUS one four hundredth of his product in other words one man out of nineteen must be killed Therefore while property exists the more poor people we kill the more there are born in proportion Malthus who proved so clearly that population increases in geometrical progression while production increases only in arithmetical progression did not notice this PAUPERIZING power of property Had he observed this he would have understood that before trying to check reproduction the right of increase should be abolished because wherever that right is tolerated there are always too many inhabitants whatever the extent or fertility of the soil It will be asked perhaps how I would maintain a balance between population and production for sooner or later this problem must be solved The reader will pardon me if I do not give my method here For in my opinion it is useless to say a thing unless we prove it Now to explain my method fully would require no less than a formal treatise It is a thing so simple and so vast so common and so extraordinary so true and so misunderstood so sacred and so profane that to name it without developing and proving it would serve only to excite contempt and incredulity One thing at a time Let us establish equality and this remedy will soon appear for truths follow each other just as crimes and errors do SIXTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because it is the Mother of Tyranny What is government Government is public economy the supreme administrative power over public works and national possessions Now the nation is like a vast society in which all the citizens are stockholders Each one has a deliberative voice in the assembly and if the shares are equal has one vote at his disposal But under the regime of property there is great inequality between the shares of the stockholders therefore one may have several hundred votes while another has only one If for example I enjoy an income of one million that is if I am the proprietor of a fortune of thirty or forty millions well invested and if this fortune constitutes one thirty thousand of the national capital it is clear that the public administration of my property would form one thirty thousand of the duties of the government and if the nation had a population of thirty four millions that I should have as many votes as one thousand one hundred and thirty three simple stockholders Thus when M Arago demands the right of suffrage for all members of the National Guard he is perfectly right since every citizen is enrolled for at least one national share which entitles him to one vote But the illustrious orator ought at the same time to demand that each elector shall have as many votes as he has shares as is the case in commercial associations For to do otherwise is to pretend that the nation has a right to dispose of the property of individuals without consulting them which is contrary to the right of property In a country where property exists equality of electoral rights is a violation of property Now if each citizen s sovereignty must and ought to be proportional to his property it follows that the small stock holders are at the mercy of the larger ones who will as soon as they choose make slaves of the former marry them at pleasure take from them their wives castrate their sons prostitute their daughters throw the aged to the sharks and finally will be forced to serve themselves in the same way unless they prefer to tax themselves for the support of their servants In such a condition is Great Britain to day John Bull caring little for liberty equality or dignity prefers to serve and beg But you bonhomme Jacques Property is incompatible with political and civil equality then property is impossible HISTORICAL COMMENTS one When the vote of the third estate was doubled by the States General of seventeen eighty nine property was grossly violated The nobility and the clergy possessed three fourths of the soil of France they should have controlled three fourths of the votes in the national representation To double the vote of the third estate was just it is said since the people paid nearly all the taxes This argument would be sound if there were nothing to be voted upon but taxes But it was a question at that time of reforming the government and the constitution consequently the doubling of the vote of the third estate was a usurpation and an attack on property two If the present representatives of the radical opposition should come into power they would work a reform by which every National Guard should be an elector and every elector eligible for office an attack on property They would lower the rate of interest on public funds an attack on property They would in the interest of the public pass laws to regulate the exportation of cattle and wheat an attack on property They would alter the assessment of taxes an attack on property They would educate the people gratuitously a conspiracy against property They would organize labor that is they would guarantee labor to the workingman and give him a share in the profits the abolition of property Now these same radicals are zealous defenders of property a radical proof that they know not what they do nor what they wish three Since property is the grand cause of privilege and despotism the form of the republican oath should be changed Instead of I swear hatred to royalty henceforth the new member of a secret society should say I swear hatred to property SEVENTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because in consuming its Receipts it loses them in hoarding them it nullifies them and in using them as Capital it turns them against Production I If with the economists we consider the laborer as a living machine we must regard the wages paid to him as the amount necessary to support this machine and keep it in repair The head of a manufacturing establishment who employs laborers at three five ten and fifteen francs per day and who charges twenty francs for his superintendence does not regard his disbursements as losses because he knows they will return to him in the form of products Consequently LABOR and REPRODUCTIVE CONSUMPTION are identical What is the proprietor He is a machine which does not work or which working for its own pleasure and only when it sees fit produces nothing What is it to consume as a proprietor It is to consume without working to consume without reproducing For once more that which the proprietor consumes as a laborer comes back to him he does not give his labor in exchange for his property since if he did he would thereby cease to be a proprietor In consuming as a laborer the proprietor gains or at least does not lose since he recovers that which he consumes in consuming as a proprietor he impoverishes himself To enjoy property then it is necessary to destroy it to be a real proprietor one must cease to be a proprietor The laborer who consumes his wages is a machine which destroys and reproduces the proprietor who consumes his income is a bottomless gulf sand which we water a stone which we sow So true is this that the proprietor neither wishing nor knowing how to produce and perceiving that as fast as he uses his property he destroys it for ever has taken the precaution to make some one produce in his place That is what political economy speaking in the name of eternal justice calls PRODUCING BY HIS CAPITAL PRODUCING BY HIS TOOLS And that is what ought to be called PRODUCING BY A SLAVE PRODUCING AS A THIEF AND AS A TYRANT He the proprietor produce The robber might say as well I produce The consumption of the proprietor has been styled luxury in opposition to USEFUL consumption From what has just been said we see that great luxury can prevail in a nation which is not rich that poverty even increases with luxury and vice versa The economists so much credit must be given them at least have caused such a horror of luxury that to day a very large number of proprietors not to say almost all ashamed of their idleness labor economize and capitalize They have jumped from the frying pan into the fire I cannot repeat it too often the proprietor who thinks to deserve his income by working and who receives wages for his labor is a functionary who gets paid twice that is the only difference between an idle proprietor and a laboring proprietor By his labor the proprietor produces his wages only not his income And since his condition enables him to engage in the most lucrative pursuits it may be said that the proprietor s labor harms society more than it helps it Whatever the proprietor does the consumption of his income is an actual loss which his salaried functions neither repair nor justify and which would annihilate property were it not continually replenished by outside production II Then the proprietor who consumes annihilates the product he does much worse if he lays it up The things which he lays by pass into another world nothing more is seen of them not even the caput mortuum the smoke If we had some means of transportation by which to travel to the moon and if the proprietors should be seized with a sudden fancy to carry their savings thither at the end of a certain time our terraqueous planet would be transported by them to its satellite The proprietor who lays up products will neither allow others to enjoy them nor enjoy them himself for him there is neither possession nor property Like the miser he broods over his treasures he does not use them He may feast his eyes upon them he may lie down with them he may sleep with them in his arms all very fine but coins do not breed coins No real property without enjoyment no enjoyment without consumption no consumption without loss of property such is the inflexible necessity to which God s judgment compels the proprietor to bend A curse upon property III The proprietor who instead of consuming his income uses it as capital turns it against production and thereby makes it impossible for him to exercise his right For the more he increases the amount of interest to be paid upon it the more he is compelled to diminish wages Now the more he diminishes wages that is the less he devotes to the maintenance and repair of the machines the more he diminishes the quantity of labor and with the quantity of labor the quantity of product and with the quantity of product the very source of his income This is clearly shown by the following example Take an estate consisting of arable land meadows and vineyards containing the dwellings of the owner and the tenant and worth together with the farming implements one hundred thousand francs the rate of increase being three per cent If instead of consuming his revenue the proprietor uses it not in enlarging but in beautifying his estate can he annually demand of his tenant an additional ninety francs on account of the three thousand francs which he has thus added to his capital Certainly not for on such conditions the tenant though producing no more than before would soon be obliged to labor for nothing what do I say to actually suffer loss in order to hold his lease In fact revenue can increase only as productive soil increases it is useless to build walls of marble and work with plows of gold But since it is impossible to go on acquiring for ever to add estate to estate to CONTINUE ONE S POSSESSIONS as the Latins said and since moreover the proprietor always has means wherewith to capitalize it follows that the exercise of his right finally becomes impossible Well in spite of this impossibility property capitalizes and in capitalizing increases its revenue and without stopping to look at the particular cases which occur in commerce manufacturing operations and banking I will cite a graver fact one which directly affects all citizens I mean the indefinite increase of the budget The taxes increase every year It would be difficult to tell in which department of the government the expenses increase for who can boast of any knowledge as to the budget On this point the ablest financiers continually disagree What is to be thought I ask of the science of government when its professors cannot understand one another s figures Whatever be the immediate causes of this growth of the budget it is certain that taxation increases at a rate which causes everybody to despair Everybody sees it everybody acknowledges it but nobody seems to understand the primary cause one Now I say that it cannot be otherwise that it is necessary and inevitable one The financial situation of the English government was shown up in the House of Lords during the session of January twenty three It is not an encouraging one For several years the expenses have exceeded the receipts and the Minister has been able to re establish the balance only by loans renewed annually The combined deficits of the years eighteen thirty eight and eighteen thirty nine amount to forty seven million five hundred thousand francs In eighteen forty the excess of expenses over receipts is expected to be twenty two million five hundred thousand francs Attention was called to these figures by Lord Ripon Lord Melbourne replied The noble earl unhappily was right in declaring that the public expenses continually increase and with him I must say that there is no room for hope that they can be diminished or met in any way National January twenty six eighteen forty A nation is the tenant of a rich proprietor called the GOVERNMENT to whom it pays for the use of the soil a farm rent called a tax Whenever the government makes war loses or gains a battle changes the outfit of its army erects a monu ment digs a canal opens a road or builds a railway it borrows money on which the tax payers pay interest that is the government without adding to its productive capacity increases its active capital in a word capitalizes after the manner of the proprietor of whom I have just spoken Now when a governmental loan is once contracted and the interest is once stipulated the budget cannot be reduced For to accomplish that either the capitalists must relinquish their interest which would involve an abandonment of property or the government must go into bankruptcy which would be a fraudulent denial of the political principle or it must pay the debt which would require another loan or it must reduce expenses which is impossible since the loan was contracted for the sole reason that the ordinary receipts were insufficient or the money expended by the government must be reproductive which requires an increase of productive capacity a condition excluded by our hypothesis or finally the tax payers must submit to a new tax in order to pay the debt an impossible thing For if this new tax were levied upon all citizens alike half or even more of the citizens would be unable to pay it if the rich had to bear the whole it would be a forced contribution an invasion of property Long financial experience has shown that the method of loans though exceedingly dangerous is much surer more convenient and less costly than any other method consequently the government borrows that is goes on capitalizing and increases the budget Then a budget instead of ever diminishing must necessarily and continually increase It is astonishing that the economists with all their learning have failed to perceive a fact so simple and so evident If they have perceived it why have they neglected to condemn it HISTORICAL COMMENT Much interest is felt at present in a financial operation which is expected to result in a reduction of the budget It is proposed to change the present rate of increase five per cent Laying aside the politico legal question to deal only with the financial question is it not true that when five per cent is changed to four per cent it will then be necessary for the same reasons to change four to three then three to two then two to one and finally to sweep away increase altogether But that would be the advent of equality of conditions and the abolition of property Now it seems to me that an intelligent nation should voluntarily meet an inevitable revolution half way instead of suffering itself to be dragged after the car of inflexible necessity EIGHTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because its power of Accumulation is infinite and is exercised only over finite quantities If men living in equality should grant to one of their number the exclusive right of property and this sole proprietor should lend one hundred francs to the human race at compound interest payable to his descendants twenty four generations hence at the end of six hundred years this sum of one hundred francs at five per cent would amount to one hundred seven trillion eight hundred fifty four billion ten million seven hundred seventy seven thousand six hundred francs two thousand six hundred and ninety six and one third times the capital of France supposing her capital to be forty billion or more than twenty times the value of the terrestrial globe Suppose that a man in the reign of saint Louis had borrowed one hundred francs and had refused he and his heirs after him to return it Even though it were known that the said heirs were not the rightful possessors and that prescription had been interrupted always at the right moment nevertheless by our laws the last heir would be obliged to return the one hundred francs with interest and interest on the interest which in all would amount as we have seen to nearly one hundred and eight thousand billions Every day fortunes are growing in our midst much more rapidly than this The preceding example supposed the interest equal to one twentieth of the capital it often equals one tenth one fifth one half of the capital and sometimes the capital itself The Fourierists irreconcilable enemies of equality whose partisans they regard as SHARKS intend by quadrupling production to satisfy all the demands of capital labor and skill But should production be multiplied by four ten or even one hundred property would soon absorb by its power of accumulation and the effects of its capitalization both products and capital and the land and even the laborers Is the phalanstery to be prohibited from capitalizing and lending at interest Let it explain then what it means by property I will carry these calculations no farther They are capable of infinite variation upon which it would be puerile for me to insist I only ask by what standard judges called upon to decide a suit for possession fix the interest And developing the question I ask Did the legislator in introducing into the Republic the principle of property weigh all the consequences Did he know the law of the possible If he knew it why is it not in the Code Why is so much latitude allowed to the proprietor in accumulating property and charging interest to the judge in recognizing and fixing the domain of property to the State in its power to levy new taxes continually At what point is the nation justified in repudiating the budget the tenant his farm rent and the manufacturer the interest on his capital How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer Where does the right of spoliation begin and where does it end When may the producer say to the proprietor I owe you nothing more When is property satisfied When must it cease to steal If the legislator did know the law of the possible and disregarded it what must be thought of his justice If he did not know it what must be thought of his wisdom Either wicked or foolish how can we recognize his authority If our charters and our codes are based upon an absurd hypothesis what is taught in the law schools What does a judgment of the Court of Appeal amount to About what do our Chambers deliberate What is POLITICS What is our definition of a STATESMAN What is the meaning of JURISPRUDENCE Should we not rather say JURISIGNORANCE If all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation does it not follow that these institutions are so many shams And if the entire social structure is built upon this absolute impossibility of property is it not true that the government under which we live is a chimera and our present society a utopia NINTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because it is powerless against Property I By the third corollary of our axiom interest tells against the proprietor as well as the stranger This economical principle is universally admitted Nothing simpler at first blush yet nothing more absurd more contradictory in terms or more absolutely impossible The manufacturer it is said pays himself the rent on his house and capital HE PAYS HIMSELF that is he gets paid by the public who buy his products For suppose the manufacturer who seems to make this profit on his property wishes also to make it on his merchandise can he then pay himself one franc for that which cost him ninety centimes and make money by the operation No such a transaction would transfer the merchant s money from his right hand to his left but without any profit whatever Now that which is true of a single individual trading with himself is true also of the whole business world Form a chain of ten fifteen twenty producers as many as you wish If the producer A makes a profit out of the producer B B s loss must according to economical principles be made up by C C s by D and so on through to Z But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit charged by A in the beginning BY THE CONSUMER replies Say Contemptible equivocation Is this consumer any other then than A B C D c or Z By whom will Z be paid If he is paid by A no one makes a profit consequently there is no property If on the contrary Z bears the burden himself he ceases to be a member of society since it refuses him the right of property and profit which it grants to the other associates Since then a nation like universal humanity is a vast industrial association which cannot act outside of itself it is clear that no man can enrich himself without impoverishing another For in order that the right of property the right of increase may be respected in the case of A it must be denied to Z thus we see how equality of rights separated from equality of conditions may be a truth The iniquity of political economy in this respect is flagrant When I a manufacturer purchase the labor of a workingman I do not include his wages in the net product of my business on the contrary I deduct them But the workingman includes them in his net product Say Political Economy That means that all which the workingman gains is NET PRODUCT but that only that part of the manufacturer s gains is NET PRODUCT which remains after deducting his wages But why is the right of profit confined to the manufacturer Why is this right which is at bottom the right of property itself denied to the workingman In the terms of economical science the workingman is capital Now all capital beyond the cost of its maintenance and repair must bear interest This the proprietor takes care to get both for his capital and for himself Why is the workingman prohibited from charging a like interest for his capital which is himself Property then is inequality of rights for if it were not inequality of rights it would be equality of goods in other words it would not exist Now the charter guarantees to all equality of rights Then by the charter property is impossible II Is A the proprietor of an estate entitled by the fact of his proprietorship to take possession of the field belonging to B his neighbor No reply the proprietors but what has that to do with the right of property That I shall show you by a series of similar propositions Has C a hatter the right to force D his neighbor and also a hatter to close his shop and cease his business Not the least in the world But C wishes to make a profit of one franc on every hat while D is content with fifty centimes It is evident that D s moderation is injurious to C s extravagant claims Has the latter a right to prevent D from selling Certainly not Since D is at liberty to sell his hats fifty centimes cheaper than C if he chooses C in his turn is free to reduce his price one franc Now D is poor while C is rich so that at the end of two or three years D is ruined by this intolerable competition and C has complete control of the market Can the proprietor D get any redress from the proprietor C Can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and property No for D could have done the same thing had he been the richer of the two On the same ground the large proprietor A may say to the small proprietor B Sell me your field otherwise you shall not sell your wheat and that without doing him the least wrong or giving him ground for complaint So that A can devour B if he likes for the very reason that A is stronger than B Consequently it is not the right of property which enables A and C to rob B and D but the right of might By the right of property neither the two neighbors A and B nor the two merchants C and D could harm each other They could neither dispossess nor destroy one another nor gain at one another s expense The power of invasion lies in superior strength But it is superior strength also which enables the manufacturer to reduce the wages of his employees and the rich merchant and well stocked proprietor to sell their products for what they please The manufacturer says to the laborer You are as free to go elsewhere with your services as I am to receive them I offer you so much The merchant says to the customer Take it or leave it you are master of your money as I am of my goods I want so much Who will yield The weaker Therefore without force property is powerless against property since without force it has no power to increase therefore without force property is null and void HISTORICAL COMMENT The struggle between colonial and native sugars furnishes us a striking example of this impossibility of property Leave these two industries to themselves and the native manufacturer will be ruined by the colonist To maintain the beet root the cane must be taxed to protect the property of the one it is necessary to injure the property of the other The most remarkable feature of this business is precisely that to which the least attention is paid namely that in one way or another property has to be violated Impose on each industry a proportional tax so as to preserve a balance in the market and you create a MAXIMUM PRICE you attack property in two ways On the one hand your tax interferes with the liberty of trade on the other it does not recognize equality of proprietors Indemnify the beet root you violate the property of the tax payer Cultivate the two varieties of sugar at the nation s expense just as different varieties of tobacco are cultivated you abolish one species of property This last course would be the simpler and better one but to induce the nations to adopt it requires such a company operation of able minds and generous hearts as is at present out of the question Competition sometimes called liberty of trade in a word property in exchange will be for a long time the basis of our commercial legislation which from the economical point of view embraces all civil laws and all government Now what is competition A duel in a closed field where arms are the test of right Who is the liar the accused or the accuser said our barbarous ancestors Let them fight it out replied the still more barbarous judge the stronger is right Which of us two shall sell spices to our neighbor Let each offer them for sale cries the economist the sharper or the more cunning is the more honest man and the better merchant Such is the exact spirit of the Code Napoleon TENTH PROPOSITION Property is impossible because it is the Negation of equality The development of this proposition will be the resume of the preceding ones one It is a principle of economical justice that PRODUCTS ARE BOUGHT ONLY BY PRODUCTS Property being capable of defence only on the ground that it produces utility is since it produces nothing for ever condemned two It is an economical law that LABOR MUST BE BALANCED BY PRODUCT It is a fact that with property production costs more than it is worth three Another economical law THE CAPITAL BEING GIVEN PRODUCTION IS MEASURED NOT BY THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL BUT BY PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY Property requiring income to be always proportional to capital without regard to labor does not recognize this relation of equality between effect and cause four and five Like the insect which spins its silk the laborer never produces for himself alone Property demanding a double product and unable to obtain it robs the laborer and kills him six Nature has given to every man but one mind one heart one will Property granting to one individual a plurality of votes supposes him to have a plurality of minds seven All consumption which is not reproductive of utility is destruction Property whether it consumes or hoards or capitalizes is productive of INUTILITY the cause of sterility and death eight The satisfaction of a natural right always gives rise to an equation in other words the right to a thing is necessarily balanced by the possession of the thing Thus between the right to liberty and the condition of a free man there is a balance an equation between the right to be a father and paternity an equation between the right to security and the social guarantee an equation But between the right of increase and the receipt of this increase there is never an equation for every new increase carries with it the right to another the latter to a third and so on for ever Property never being able to accomplish its object is a right against Nature and against reason nine Finally property is not self existent An extraneous cause either FORCE or FRAUD is necessary to its life and action In other words property is not equal to property it is a negation a delusion NOTHING CHAPTER V PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPOSITION OF THE IDEA OF JUSTICE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPOSITION OF THE IDEA OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE AND A DETERMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT AND OF RIGHT Property is impossible equality does not exist We hate the former and yet wish to possess it the latter rules all our thoughts yet we know not how to reach it Who will explain this profound antagonism between our conscience and our will Who will point out the causes of this pernicious error which has become the most sacred principle of justice and society I am bold enough to undertake the task and I hope to succeed But before explaining why man has violated justice it is necessary to determine what justice is PART FIRST one Of the Moral Sense in Man and the Animals The philosophers have endeavored often to locate the line which separates man s intelligence from that of the brutes and according to their general custom they gave utterance to much foolishness before resolving upon the only course possible for them to take observation It was reserved for an unpretending savant who perhaps did not pride himself on his philosophy to put an end to the interminable controversy by a simple distinction but one of those luminous distinctions which are worth more than systems Frederic Cuvier separated INSTINCT from INTELLIGENCE But as yet no one has proposed this question IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAN S MORAL SENSE AND THAT OF THE BRUTE A DIFFERENCE IN KIND OR ONLY IN DEGREE If hitherto any one had dared to maintain the latter alternative his arguments would have seemed scandalous blasphemous and offensive to morality and religion The ecclesiastical and secular tribunals would have condemned him with one voice And mark the style in which they would have branded the immoral paradox Conscience they would have cried conscience man s chief glory was given to him exclusively the notion of justice and injustice of merit and demerit is his noble privilege to man alone the lord of creation belongs the sublime power to resist his worldly propensities to choose between good and evil and to bring himself more and more into the resemblance of God through liberty and justice No the holy image of virtue was never graven save on the heart of man Words full of feeling but void of sense Man is a rational and social animal said Aristotle This definition is worth more than all which have been given since I do not except even M de Bonald s celebrated definition MAN IS AN INTELLECT SERVED BY ORGANS a definition which has the double fault of explaining the known by the unknown that is the living being by the intellect and of neglecting man s essential quality animality Man then is an animal living in society Society means the sum total of relationships in short system Now all systems exist only on certain conditions What then are the conditions the LAWS of human society What are the RIGHTS of men with respect to each other what is JUSTICE It amounts to nothing to say with the philosophers of various schools It is a divine instinct an immortal and heavenly voice a guide given us by Nature a light revealed unto every man on coming into the world a law engraved upon our hearts it is the voice of conscience the dictum of reason the inspiration of sentiment the penchant of feeling it is the love of self in others it is enlightened self interest or else it is an innate idea the imperative command of applied reason which has its source in the concepts of pure reason it is a passional attraction c c This may be as true as it seems beautiful but it is utterly meaningless Though we should prolong this litany through ten pages it has been filtered through a thousand volumes we should be no nearer to the solution of the question Justice is public utility says Aristotle That is true but it is a tautology The principle that the public welfare ought to be the object of the legislator says M Ch Comte in his Treatise on Legislation cannot be overthrown But legislation is advanced no farther by its announcement and demonstration than is medicine when it is said that it is the business of physicians to cure the sick Let us take another course RUGHT is the sum total of the principles which govern society Justice in man is the respect and observation of those principles To practise justice is to obey the social instinct to do an act of justice is to do a social act If then we watch the conduct of men towards each other under different circumstances it will be easy for us to distinguish between the presence and absence of society from the result we may inductively infer the law Let us commence with the simplest and least doubtful cases The mother who protects her son at the peril of her life and sacrifices every thing to his support is in society with him she is a good mother She on the contrary who abandons her child is unfaithful to the social instinct maternal love being one of its many features she is an unnatural mother If I plunge into the water to rescue a drowning man I am his brother his associate if instead of aiding him I sink him I am his enemy his murderer Whoever bestows alms treats the poor man as his associate not thoroughly it is true but only in respect to the amount which he shares with him Whoever takes by force or stratagem that which is not the product of his labor destroys his social character he is a brigand The Samaritan who relieves the traveller lying by the wayside dresses his wounds comforts him and supplies him with money thereby declares himself his associate his neighbor the priest who passes by on the other side remains unassociated and is his enemy In all these cases man is moved by an internal attraction towards his fellow by a secret sympathy which causes him to love congratulate and condole so that to resist this attraction his will must struggle against his nature But in these respects there is no decided difference between man and the animals With them as long as the weakness of their young endears them to their mothers in a word associates them with their mothers the latter protect the former at the peril of their lives with a courage which reminds us of our heroes dying for their country Certain species unite for hunting purposes seek each other call each other a poet would say invite each other to share their prey in danger they aid protect and warn each other The elephant knows how to help his companion out of the ditch into which the latter has fallen Cows form a circle with their horns outward and their calves in the centre in order to repel the attacks of wolves Horses and pigs on hearing a cry of distress from one of their number rush to the spot whence it comes What descriptions I might give of their marriages the tenderness of the males towards the females and the fidelity of their loves Let us add however to be entirely just that these touching demonstrations of society fraternity and love of neighbor do not prevent the animals from quarrelling fighting and outrageously abusing one another while gaining their livelihood and showing their gallantry the resemblance between them and ourselves is perfect The social instinct in man and beast exists to a greater or less degree its nature is the same Man has the greater need of association and employs it more the animal seems better able to endure isolation In man social needs are more imperative and complex in the beast they seem less intense less diversified less regretted Society in a word aims in the case of man at the preservation of the race and the individual with the animals its object is more exclusively the preservation of the race As yet we have met with no claim which man can make for himself alone The social instinct and the moral sense he shares with the brutes and when he thinks to become god like by a few acts of charity justice and devotion he does not perceive that in so acting he simply obeys an instinct wholly animal in its nature As we are good loving tender just so we are passionate greedy lewd and vindictive that is we are like the beasts Our highest virtues appear in the last analysis as blind impulsive instincts What subjects for canonization and apotheosis There is however a difference between us two handed bipeds and other living creatures what is it A student of philosophy would hasten to reply This difference lies in the fact that we are conscious of our social faculty while the animals are unconscious of theirs in the fact that while we reflect and reason upon the operation of our social instinct the animals do nothing of the kind I will go farther It is by our reflective and reasoning powers with which we seem to be exclusively endowed that we know that it is injurious first to others and then to ourselves to resist the social instinct which governs us and which we call JUSTICE It is our reason which teaches us that the selfish man the robber the murderer in a word the traitor to society sins against Nature and is guilty with respect to others and himself when he does wrong wilfully Finally it is our social sentiment on the one hand and our reason on the other which cause us to think that beings such as we should take the responsibility of their acts Such is the principle of remorse revenge and penal justice But this proves only an intellectual diversity between the animals and man not at all an affectional one for although we reason upon our relations with our fellows we likewise reason upon our most trivial actions such as drinking eating choosing a wife or selecting a dwelling place We reason upon things earthly and things heavenly there is nothing to which our reasoning powers are not applicable Now just as the knowledge of external phenomena which we acquire has no influence upon their causes and laws so reflection by illuminating our instinct enlightens us as to our sentient nature but does not alter its character it tells us what our morality is but neither changes nor modifies it Our dissatisfaction with ourselves after doing wrong the indignation which we feel at the sight of injustice the idea of deserved punishment and due remuneration are effects of reflection and not immediate effects of instinct and emotion Our appreciation I do not say exclusive appreciation for the animals also realize that they have done wrong and are indignant when one of their number is attacked but our infinitely superior appreciation of our social duties our knowledge of good and evil does not establish as regards morality any vital difference between man and the beasts two Of the first and second degrees of Sociability I insist upon the fact which I have just pointed out as one of the most important facts of anthropology The sympathetic attraction which causes us to associate is by reason of its blind unruly nature always governed by temporary impulse without regard to higher rights and without distinction of merit or priority The bastard dog follows indifferently all who call it the suckling child regards every man as its father and every woman as its nurse every living creature when deprived of the society of animals of its species seeks companionship in its solitude This fundamental characteristic of the social instinct renders intolerable and even hateful the friendship of frivolous persons liable to be infatuated with every new face accommodating to all whether good or bad and ready to sacrifice for a passing liaison the oldest and most honorable affections The fault of such beings is not in the heart it is in the judgment Sociability in this degree is a sort of magnetism awakened in us by the contemplation of a being similar to ourselves but which never goes beyond the person who feels it it may be reciprocated but not communicated Love benevolence pity sympathy call it what you will there is nothing in it which deserves esteem nothing which lifts man above the beast The second degree of sociability is justice which may be defined as the RECOGNITION OF THE EQUALITY BETWEEN ANOTHER S PERSONALITY AND OUR OWN The sentiment of justice we share with the animals we alone can form an exact idea of it but our idea as has been said already does not change its nature We shall soon see how man rises to a third degree of sociability which the animals are incapable of reaching But I must first prove by metaphysics that SOCIETY JUSTICE and EQUALITY are three equivalent terms three expressions meaning the same thing whose mutual conversion is always allowable If amid the confusion of a shipwreck having escaped in a boat with some provisions I see a man struggling with the waves am I bound to go to his assistance Yes I am bound under penalty of being adjudged guilty of murder and treason against society But am I also bound to share with him my provisions To settle this question we must change the phraseology If society is binding on the boat is it also binding on the provisions Undoubtedly The duty of an associate is absolute Man s occupancy succeeds his social nature and is subordinate to it possession can become exclusive only when permission to occupy is granted to all alike That which in this instance obscures our duty is our power of foresight which causing us to fear an eventual danger impels us to usurpation and makes us robbers and murderers Animals do not calculate the duty of instinct any more than the disadvantages resulting to those who exercise it it would be strange if the intellect of man the most sociable of animals should lead him to disobey the law He betrays society who attempts to use it only for his own advantage better that God should deprive us of prudence if it is to serve as the tool of our selfishness What you will say must I share my bread the bread which I have earned and which belongs to me with the stranger whom I do not know whom I may never see again and who perhaps will reward me with ingratitude If we had earned this bread together if this man had done something to obtain it he might demand his share since his company operation would entitle him to it but as it is what claim has he on me We have not produced together we shall not eat together The fallacy in this argument lies in the false supposition that each producer is not necessarily associated with every other producer When two or more individuals have regularly organized a society when the contracts have been agreed upon drafted and signed there is no difficulty about the future Everybody knows that when two men associate for instance in order to fish if one of them catches no fish he is none the less entitled to those caught by his associate If two merchants form a partnership while the partnership lasts the profits and losses are divided between them since each produces not for himself but for the society when the time of distribution arrives it is not the producer who is considered but the associate That is why the slave to whom the planter gives straw and rice and the civilized laborer to whom the capitalist pays a salary which is always too small not being associated with their employers although producing with them are disregarded when the product is divided Thus the horse who draws our coaches and the ox who draws our carts produce with us but are not associated with us we take their product but do not share it with them The animals and laborers whom we employ hold the same relation to us Whatever we do for them we do not from a sense of justice but out of pure benevolence twenty two But is it possible that we are not all associated Let us call to mind what was said in the last two chapters That even though we do not want to be associated the force of things the necessity of consumption the laws of production and the mathematical principle of exchange combine to associate us There is but a single exception to this rule that of the proprietor who producing by his right of increase is not associated with any one and consequently is not obliged to share his product with any one just as no one else is bound to share with him With the exception of the proprietor we labor for each other we can do nothing by ourselves unaided by others and we continually exchange products and services with each other If these are not social acts what are they Now neither a commercial nor an industrial nor an agricultural association can be conceived of in the absence of equality equality is its sine qua non So that in all matters which concern this association to violate society is to violate justice and equality Apply this principle to humanity at large After what has been said I assume that the reader has sufficient insight to enable him to dispense with any aid of mine By this principle the man who takes possession of a field and says This field is mine will not be unjust so long as every one else has an equal right of possession nor will he be unjust if wishing to change his location he exchanges this field for an equivalent But if putting another in his place he says to him Work for me while I rest he then becomes unjust unassociated UNEQUAL He is a proprietor Reciprocally the sluggard or the rake who without performing any social task enjoys like others and often more than others the products of society should be proceeded against as a thief and a parasite We owe it to ourselves to give him nothing but since he must live to put him under supervision and compel him to labor Sociability is the attraction felt by sentient beings for each other Justice is this same attraction accompanied by thought and knowledge But under what general concept in what category of the understanding is justice placed In the category of equal quantities Hence the ancient definition of justice Justum aequale est injustum inaequale What is it then to practise justice It is to give equal wealth to each on condition of equal labor It is to act socially Our selfishness may complain there is no escape from evidence and necessity What is the right of occupancy It is a natural method of dividing the earth by reducing each laborer s share as fast as new laborers present themselves This right disappears if the public interest requires it which being the social interest is also that of the occupant What is the right of labor It is the right to obtain one s share of wealth by fulfilling the required conditions It is the right of society the right of equality Justice which is the product of the combination of an idea and an instinct manifests itself in man as soon as he is capable of feeling and of forming ideas Consequently it has been regarded as an innate and original sentiment but this opinion is logically and chronologically false But justice by its composition hybrid if I may use the term justice born of emotion and intellect combined seems to me one of the strongest proofs of the unity and simplicity of the ego the organism being no more capable of producing such a mixture by itself than are the combined senses of hearing and sight of forming a binary sense half auditory and half visual This double nature of justice gives us the definitive basis of all the demonstrations in Chapters II III and IV On the one hand the idea of JUSTICE being identical with that of society and society necessarily implying equality equality must underlie all the sophisms invented in defence of property for since property can be defended only as a just and social institution and property being inequality in order to prove that property is in harmony with society it must be shown that injustice is justice and that inequality is equality a contradiction in terms On the other hand since the idea of equality the second element of justice has its source in the mathematical proportions of things and since property or the unequal distribution of wealth among laborers destroys the necessary balance between labor production and consumption property must be impossible All men then are associated all are entitled to the same justice all are equal Does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship are unjust This requires explanation I have already supposed the case of a man in peril I being in a position to help him Now I suppose myself appealed to at the same time by two men exposed to danger Am I not allowed am I not commanded even to rush first to the aid of him who is endeared to me by ties of blood friendship acquaintance or esteem at the risk of leaving the other to perish Yes And why Because within universal society there exist for each of us as many special societies as there are individuals and we are bound by the principle of sociability itself to fulfil the obligations which these impose upon us according to the intimacy of our relations with them Therefore we must give our father mother children friends relatives c the preference over all others But in what consists this preference A judge has a case to decide in which one of the parties is his friend and the other his enemy Should he in this instance prefer his INTIMATE ASSOCIATE to his DISTANT ASSOCIATE and decide the case in favor of his friend in spite of evidence to the contrary No for if he should favor his friend s injustice he would become his accomplice in his violation of the social compact he would form with him a sort of conspiracy against the social body Preference should be shown only in personal matters such as love esteem confidence or intimacy when all cannot be considered at once Thus in case of fire a father would save his own child before thinking of his neighbor s but the recognition of a right not being an optional matter with a judge he is not at liberty to favor one person to the detriment of another The theory of these special societies which are formed concentrically so to speak by each of us inside of the main body gives the key to all the problems which arise from the opposition and conflict of the different varieties of social duty problems upon which the ancient tragedies are based The justice practised among animals is in a certain degree negative With the exception of protecting their young hunting and plundering in troops uniting for common defence and sometimes for individual assistance it consists more in prevention than in action A sick animal who cannot arise from the ground or an imprudent one who has fallen over a precipice receives neither medicine nor nourishment If he cannot cure himself nor relieve himself of his trouble his life is in danger he will neither be cared for in bed nor fed in a prison Their neglect of their fellows arises as much from the weakness of their intellect as from their lack of resources Still the degrees of intimacy common among men are not unknown to the animals They have friendships of habit and of choice friendships neighborly and friendships parental In comparison with us they have feeble memories sluggish feelings and are almost destitute of intelligence but the identity of these faculties is preserved to some extent and our superiority in this respect arises entirely from our understanding It is our strength of memory and penetration of judgment which enable us to multiply and combine the acts which our social instinct impels us to perform and which teaches us how to render them more effective and how to distribute them justly The beasts who live in society practise justice but are ignorant of its nature and do not reason upon it they obey their instinct without thought or philosophy They know not how to unite the social sentiment with the idea of equality which they do not possess this idea being an abstract one We on the contrary starting with the principle that society implies equality can by our reasoning faculty understand and agree with each other in settling our rights we have even used our judgment to a great extent But in all this our conscience plays a small part as is proved by the fact that the idea of RIGHT of which we catch a glimpse in certain animals who approach nearer than any others to our standard of intelligence seems to grow from the low level at which it stands in savages to the lofty height which it reaches in a Plato or a Franklin If we trace the development of the moral sense in individuals and the progress of laws in nations we shall be convinced that the ideas of justice and legislative perfection are always proportional to intelligence The notion of justice which has been regarded by some philosophers as simple is then in reality complex It springs from the social instinct on the one hand and the idea of equality on the other just as the notion of guilt arises from the feeling that justice has been violated and from the idea of free will In conclusion instinct is not modified by acquaintance with its nature and the facts of society which we have thus far observed occur among beasts as well as men We know the meaning of justice in other words of sociability viewed from the standpoint of equality We have met with nothing which separates us from the animals three Of the third degree of Sociability The reader perhaps has not forgotten what was said in the third chapter concerning the division of labor and the speciality of talents The sum total of the talents and capacities of the race is always the same and their nature is always similar 
6686_216563_000002_000001	train-clean-360	We are all born poets mathematicians philosophers artists artisans or farmers but we are not born equally endowed and between one man and another in society or between one faculty and another in the same individual there is an infinite difference 
6686_216563_000002_000002	train-clean-360	This difference of degree in the same faculties this predominance of talent in certain directions is we have said the very foundation of our society 
none	none	Intelligence and natural genius have been distributed by Nature so economically and yet so liberally that in society there is no danger of either a surplus or a scarcity of special talents and that each laborer by devoting himself to his function may always attain to the degree of proficiency necessary to enable him to benefit by the labors and discoveries of his fellows Owing to this simple and wise precaution of Nature the laborer is not isolated by his task He communicates with his fellows through the mind before he is united with them in heart so that with him love is born of intelligence 
6686_216563_000003_000000	train-clean-360	It is not so with societies of animals 
none	none	In every species the aptitudes of all the individuals though very limited are equal in number and when they are not the result of instinct in intensity Each one does as well as all the others what all the others do provides his food avoids the enemy burrows in the earth builds a nest c

6686_216563_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Associated animals live side by side without any intellectual intercourse or intimate communication all doing the same things having nothing to learn or to remember they see feel and come in contact with each other but never penetrate each other 
6686_216563_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Man continually exchanges with man ideas and feelings products and services 
6686_216563_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Every discovery and act in society is necessary to him 
6686_216563_000004_000003	train-clean-360	But of this immense quantity of products and ideas that which each one has to produce and acquire for himself is but an atom in the sun 
none	none	Man would not be man were it not for society and society is supported by the balance and harmony of the powers which compose it 
6686_216563_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Society among the animals is SIMPLE with man it is COMPLEX 
6686_216563_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Man is associated with man by the same instinct which associates animal with animal but man is associated differently from the animal and it is this difference in association which constitutes the difference in morality 
none	none	I have proved at too great length perhaps both by the spirit of the laws which regard property as the basis of society and by political economy that inequality of conditions is justified neither by priority of occupation nor superiority of talent service industry and capacity But although equality of conditions is a necessary consequence of natural right of liberty of the laws of production of the capacity of physical nature and of the principle of society itself it does not prevent the social sentiment from stepping over the boundaries of DEBT and CREDIT 
6686_216563_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The fields of benevolence and love extend far beyond and when economy has adjusted its balance the mind begins to benefit by its own justice and the heart expands in the boundlessness of its affection 
6686_216563_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The social sentiment then takes on a new character which varies with different persons 
6686_216563_000007_000001	train-clean-360	In the strong it becomes the pleasure of generosity among equals frank and cordial friendship in the weak the pleasure of admiration and gratitude 
none	none	The man who is superior in strength skill or courage knows that he owes all that he is to society without which he could not exist He knows that in treating him precisely as it does the lowest of its members society discharges its whole duty towards him But he does not underrate his faculties he is no less conscious of his power and greatness and it is this voluntary reverence which he pays to humanity this avowal that he is but an instrument of Nature who is alone worthy of glory and worship it is I say this simultaneous confession of the heart and the mind this genuine adoration of the Great Being that distinguishes and elevates man and lifts him to a degree of social morality to which the beast is powerless to attain 
6686_216563_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Hercules destroying the monsters and punishing brigands for the safety of Greece Orpheus teaching the rough and wild Pelasgians neither of them putting a price upon their services there we see the noblest creations of poetry the loftiest expression of justice and virtue 
6686_216563_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The joys of self sacrifice are ineffable 
none	none	If I were to compare human society to the old Greek tragedies I should say that the phalanx of noble minds and lofty souls dances the strophe and the humble multitude the antistrophe Burdened with painful and disagreeable tasks but rendered omnipotent by their number and the harmonic arrangement of their functions the latter execute what the others plan 
6686_216563_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Guided by them they owe them nothing they honor them however and lavish upon them praise and approbation 
6686_216563_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Gratitude fills people with adoration and enthusiasm 
6686_216563_000012_000000	train-clean-360	But equality delights my heart 
6686_216563_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Benevolence degenerates into tyranny and admiration into servility 
6686_216563_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Friendship is the daughter of equality O my friends may I live in your midst without emulation and without glory let equality bring us together and fate assign us our places May I die without knowing to whom among you I owe the most esteem 
6686_216563_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Friendship is precious to the hearts of the children of men 
none	none	Generosity gratitude I mean here only that gratitude which is born of admiration of a superior power and friendship are three distinct shades of a single sentiment which I will call equite or SOCIAL PROPORTIONALITY twenty three Equite does not change justice but always taking equite for the base it superadds esteem and thereby forms in man a third degree of sociability Equite makes it at once our duty and our pleasure to aid the weak who have need of us and to make them our equals to pay to the strong a just tribute of gratitude and honor without enslaving ourselves to them to cherish our neighbors friends and equals for that which we receive from them even by right of exchange Equite is sociability raised to its ideal by reason and justice its commonest manifestation is URBANITY or POLITENESS which among certain nations sums up in a single word nearly all the social duties 
6686_216563_000015_000000	train-clean-360	It is the just distribution of social sympathy and universal love 
6686_216563_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Now this feeling is unknown among the beasts who love and cling to each other and show their preferences but who cannot conceive of esteem and who are incapable of generosity admiration or politeness 
6686_216563_000017_000000	train-clean-360	This feeling does not spring from intelligence which calculates computes and balances but does not love which sees but does not feel 
none	none	As justice is the product of social instinct and reflection combined so equite is a product of justice and taste combined that is of our powers of judging and of idealizing 
6686_216563_000018_000000	train-clean-360	This product the third and last degree of human sociability is determined by our complex mode of association in which inequality or rather the divergence of faculties and the speciality of functions tending of themselves to isolate laborers demand a more active sociability 
6686_216563_000019_000000	train-clean-360	That is why the force which oppresses while protecting is execrable why the silly ignorance which views with the same eye the marvels of art and the products of the rudest industry excites unutterable contempt why proud mediocrity which glories in saying I have paid you I owe you nothing is especially odious 
none	none	SOCIABILITY JUSTICE EQUITE such in its triplicity is the exact definition of the instinctive faculty which leads us into communication with our fellows and whose physical manifestation is expressed by the formula EQUALITY IN NATURAL WEALTH AND THE PRODUCTS OF LABOR 
6686_216563_000021_000000	train-clean-360	These three degrees of sociability support and imply each other 
none	none	Equite cannot exist without justice society without justice is a solecism 
6686_216563_000022_000001	train-clean-360	If in order to reward talent I take from one to give to another in unjustly stripping the first I do not esteem his talent as I ought if in society I award more to myself than to my associate we are not really associated 
6686_216563_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Justice is sociability as manifested in the division of material things susceptible of weight and measure equite is justice accompanied by admiration and esteem things which cannot be measured 
6686_216563_000023_000000	train-clean-360	From this several inferences may be drawn 
none	none	one Though we are free to grant our esteem to one more than to another and in all possible degrees yet we should give no one more than his proportion of the common wealth because the duty of justice being imposed upon us before that of equite must always take precedence of it The woman honored by the ancients who when forced by a tyrant to choose between the death of her brother and that of her husband sacrificed the latter on the ground that she could find another husband but not another brother that woman I say in obeying her sense of equite failed in point of justice and did a bad deed because conjugal association is a closer relation than fraternal association and because the life of our neighbor is not our property 
6686_216563_000025_000000	train-clean-360	By the same principle inequality of wages cannot be admitted by law on the ground of inequality of talents because the just distribution of wealth is the function of economy not of enthusiasm 
6686_216563_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Finally as regards donations wills and inheritance society careful both of the personal affections and its own rights must never permit love and partiality to destroy justice 
none	none	And though it is pleasant to think that the son who has been long associated with his father in business is more capable than any one else of carrying it on and that the citizen who is surprised in the midst of his task by death is best fitted in consequence of his natural taste for his occupation to designate his successor and though the heir should be allowed the right of choice in case of more than one inheritance nevertheless society can tolerate no concentration of capital and industry for the benefit of a single man no monopoly of labor no encroachment twenty four Suppose that some spoils taken from the enemy and equal to twelve are to be divided between Achilles and Ajax 
6686_216563_000027_000001	train-clean-360	If the two persons were equal their respective shares would be arithmetically equal Achilles would have six Ajax six 
none	none	And if we should carry out this arithmetical equality Thersites would be entitled to as much as Achilles which would be unjust in the extreme 
6686_216563_000027_000003	train-clean-360	To avoid this injustice the worth of the persons should be estimated and the spoils divided accordingly Suppose that the worth of Achilles is double that of Ajax the former s share is eight the latter four 
6686_216563_000027_000004	train-clean-360	There is no arithmetical equality but a proportional equality 
none	none	It is this comparison of merits rationum that Aristotle calls distributive justice It is a geometrical proportion Toullier French Law according to the Code Are Achilles and Ajax associated or are they not 
6686_216563_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Settle that and you settle the whole question 
6686_216563_000028_000002	train-clean-360	If Achilles and Ajax instead of being associated are themselves in the service of Agamemnon who pays them there is no objection to Aristotle s method

6686_216563_000028_000004	train-clean-360	That is the law of despotism the right of slavery 
none	none	But if Achilles and Ajax are associated they are equals 
6686_216563_000029_000001	train-clean-360	What matters it that Achilles has a strength of four while that of Ajax is only two The latter may always answer that he is free that if Achilles has a strength of four five could kill him finally that in doing personal service he incurs as great a risk as Achilles 
none	none	The same argument applies to Thersites 
6686_216563_000029_000003	train-clean-360	If he is unable to fight let him be cook purveyor or butler

6686_216563_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Man must live in one of two states either in society or out of it In society conditions are necessarily equal except in the degree of esteem and consideration which each one may receive 
none	none	Out of society man is so much raw material a capitalized tool and often an incommodious and useless piece of furniture two Equite justice and society can exist only between individuals of the same species They form no part of the relations of different races to each other for instance of the wolf to the goat of the goat to man of man to God much less of God to man The attribution of justice equity and love to the Supreme Being is pure anthropomorphism and the adjectives just merciful pitiful and the like should be stricken from our litanies 
6686_216563_000031_000004	train-clean-360	God can be regarded as just equitable and good only to another God

none	none	Philosophy after having eliminated from the idea of God the passions ascribed to him by superstition will then be obliged to eliminate also the virtues which our liberal piety awards to him twenty five The rights of woman and her relations with man are yet to be determined Matrimonial legislation like civil legislation is a matter for the future to settle 
6686_216563_000033_000000	train-clean-360	If God should come down to earth and dwell among us we could not love him unless he became like us nor give him any thing unless he produced something nor listen to him unless he proved us mistaken nor worship him unless he manifested his power 
none	none	All the laws of our nature affectional economical and intellectual would prevent us from treating him as we treat our fellow men that is according to reason justice and equite I infer from this that if God should wish ever to put himself into immediate communication with man he would have to become a man 
6686_216563_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Now if kings are images of God and executors of his will they cannot receive love wealth obedience and glory from us unless they consent to labor and associate with us produce as much as they consume reason with their subjects and do wonderful things 
6686_216563_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Still more if as some pretend kings are public functionaries the love which is due them is measured by their personal amiability our obligation to obey them by the wisdom of their commands and their civil list by the total social production divided by the number of citizens

8534_216564_000002_000000	train-clean-360	PART SECOND 
none	none	one Of the Causes of our Mistakes The Origin of Property 
8534_216564_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The true form of human society cannot be determined until the following question has been solved 
8534_216564_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Property not being our natural condition how did it gain a foothold Why has the social instinct so trustworthy among the animals erred in the case of man 
none	none	Why is man who was born for society not yet associated 
8534_216564_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I have said that human society is COMPLEX in its nature 
8534_216564_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Though this expression is inaccurate the fact to which it refers is none the less true namely the classification of talents and capacities 
none	none	But who does not see that these talents and capacities owing to their infinite variety give rise to an infinite variety of wills and that the character the inclinations and if I may venture to use the expression the form of the ego are necessarily changed so that in the order of liberty as in the order of intelligence there are as many types as individuals as many characters as heads whose tastes fancies and propensities being modified by dissimilar ideas must necessarily conflict 
8534_216564_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Man by his nature and his instinct is predestined to society but his personality ever varying is adverse to it 
none	none	In societies of animals all the members do exactly the same things The same genius directs them the same will animates them 
8534_216564_000007_000001	train-clean-360	A society of beasts is a collection of atoms round hooked cubical or triangular but always perfectly identical 
none	none	These personalities do not vary and we might say that a single ego governs them all 
8534_216564_000007_000003	train-clean-360	The labors which animals perform whether alone or in society are exact reproductions of their character 
8534_216564_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Just as the swarm of bees is composed of individual bees alike in nature and equal in value so the honeycomb is formed of individual cells constantly and invariably repeated 
none	none	But man s intelligence fitted for his social destiny and his personal needs is of a very different composition and therefore gives rise to a wonderful variety of human wills 
8534_216564_000008_000001	train-clean-360	In the bee the will is constant and uniform because the instinct which guides it is invariable and constitutes the animal s whole life and nature 
8534_216564_000008_000002	train-clean-360	In man talent varies and the mind wavers consequently his will is multiform and vague 
8534_216564_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He seeks society but dislikes constraint and monotony he is an imitator but fond of his own ideas and passionately in love with his works 
8534_216564_000009_000000	train-clean-360	If like the bees every man were born possessed of talent perfect knowledge of certain kinds and in a word an innate acquaintance with the functions he has to perform but destitute of reflective and reasoning faculties society would organize itself 
8534_216564_000009_000001	train-clean-360	We should see one man plowing a field another building houses this one forging metals that one cutting clothes and still others storing the products and superintending their distribution 
8534_216564_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Each one without inquiring as to the object of his labor and without troubling himself about the extent of his task would obey orders bring his product receive his salary and would then rest for a time keeping meanwhile no accounts envious of nobody and satisfied with the distributor who never would be unjust to any one 
none	none	Kings would govern but would not reign for to reign is to be a proprietor a l engrais as Bonaparte said and having no commands to give since all would be at their posts they would serve rather as rallying centres than as authorities or counsellors It would be a state of ordered communism but not a society entered into deliberately and freely 
8534_216564_000010_000000	train-clean-360	But man acquires skill only by observation and experiment 
8534_216564_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He reflects then since to observe and experiment is to reflect he reasons since he cannot help reasoning 
8534_216564_000010_000002	train-clean-360	In reflecting he becomes deluded in reasoning he makes mistakes and thinking himself right persists in them 
8534_216564_000010_000003	train-clean-360	He is wedded to his opinions he esteems himself and despises others 
8534_216564_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Consequently he isolates himself for he could not submit to the majority without renouncing his will and his reason that is without disowning himself which is impossible 
none	none	And this isolation this intellectual egotism this individuality of opinion lasts until the truth is demonstrated to him by observation and experience 
8534_216564_000010_000006	train-clean-360	A final illustration will make these facts still clearer 
8534_216564_000011_000000	train-clean-360	If to the blind but convergent and harmonious instincts of a swarm of bees should be suddenly added reflection and judgment the little society could not long exist 
8534_216564_000011_000001	train-clean-360	In the first place the bees would not fail to try some new industrial process for instance that of making their cells round or square 
none	none	All sorts of systems and inventions would be tried until long experience aided by geometry should show them that the hexagonal shape is the best Then insurrections would occur The drones would be told to provide for themselves and the queens to labor jealousy would spread among the laborers discords would burst forth soon each one would want to produce on his own account and finally the hive would be abandoned and the bees would perish 
8534_216564_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Evil would be introduced into the honey producing republic by the power of reflection the very faculty which ought to constitute its glory 
8534_216564_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Thus moral evil or in this case disorder in society is naturally explained by our power of reflection 
none	none	The mother of poverty crime insurrection and war was inequality of conditions which was the daughter of property which was born of selfishness which was engendered by private opinion which descended in a direct line from the autocracy of reason 
8534_216564_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Man in his infancy is neither criminal nor barbarous but ignorant and inexperienced 
none	none	Endowed with imperious instincts which are under the control of his reasoning faculty at first he reflects but little and reasons inaccurately then benefiting by his mistakes he rectifies his ideas and perfects his reason In the first place it is the savage sacrificing all his possessions for a trinket and then repenting and weeping it is Esau selling his birthright for a mess of pottage and afterwards wishing to cancel the bargain it is the civilized workman laboring in insecurity and continually demanding that his wages be increased neither he nor his employer understanding that in the absence of equality any salary however large is always insufficient Then it is Naboth dying to defend his inheritance Cato tearing out his entrails that he might not be enslaved Socrates drinking the fatal cup in defence of liberty of thought it is the third estate of eighty nine reclaiming its liberty soon it will be the people demanding equality of wages and an equal division of the means of production Man is born a social being that is he seeks equality and justice in all his relations but he loves independence and praise 
8534_216564_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The difficulty of satisfying these various desires at the same time is the primary cause of the despotism of the will and the appropriation which results from it 
8534_216564_000013_000002	train-clean-360	On the other hand man always needs a market for his products unable to compare values of different kinds he is satisfied to judge approximately according to his passion and caprice and he engages in dishonest commerce which always results in wealth and poverty 
none	none	Thus the greatest evils which man suffers arise from the misuse of his social nature of this same justice of which he is so proud and which he applies with such deplorable ignorance 
8534_216564_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The practice of justice is a science which when once discovered and diffused will sooner or later put an end to social disorder by teaching us our rights and duties 
8534_216564_000015_000000	train-clean-360	This progressive and painful education of our instinct this slow and imperceptible transformation of our spontaneous perceptions into deliberate knowledge does not take place among the animals whose instincts remain fixed and never become enlightened 
none	none	According to Frederic Cuvier who has so clearly distinguished between instinct and intelligence in animals instinct is a natural and inherent faculty like feeling irritability or intelligence The wolf and the fox who recognize the traps in which they have been caught and who avoid them the dog and the horse who understand the meaning of several of our words and who obey us thereby show intelligence The dog who hides the remains of his dinner the bee who constructs his cell the bird who builds his nest act only from instinct Even man has instincts it is a special instinct which leads the new born child to suck 
8534_216564_000016_000003	train-clean-360	But in man almost every thing is accomplished by intelligence and intelligence supplements instinct 
none	none	The opposite is true of animals their instinct is given them as a supplement to their intelligence Flourens Analytical Summary of the Observations of F Cuvier We can form a clear idea of instinct only by admitting that animals have in their sensorium images or innate and constant sensations which influence their actions in the same manner that ordinary and accidental sensations commonly do It is a sort of dream or vision which always follows them and in all which relates to instinct they may be regarded as somnambulists F 
8534_216564_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Cuvier Introduction to the Animal Kingdom 
8534_216564_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Intelligence and instinct being common then though in different degrees to animals and man what is the distinguishing characteristic of the latter 
none	none	According to F Cuvier it is REFLECTION OR THE POWER OF INTELLECTUALLY CONSIDERING OUR OWN MODIFICATIONS BY A SURVEY OF OURSELVES 
8534_216564_000018_000002	train-clean-360	This lacks clearness and requires an explanation 
8534_216564_000019_000000	train-clean-360	If we grant intelligence to animals we must also grant them in some degree reflection for the first cannot exist without the second as F Cuvier himself has proved by numerous examples 
8534_216564_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But notice that the learned observer defines the kind of reflection which distinguishes us from the animals as the POWER OF CONSIDERING OUR OWN MODIFICATIONS 
8534_216564_000019_000002	train-clean-360	This I shall endeavour to interpret by developing to the best of my ability the laconism of the philosophical naturalist 
8534_216564_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The intelligence acquired by animals never modifies the operations which they perform by instinct it is given them only as a provision against unexpected accidents which might disturb these operations 
none	none	In man on the contrary instinctive action is constantly changing into deliberate action Thus man is social by instinct and is every day becoming social by reflection and choice At first he formed his words by instinct one he was a poet by inspiration to day he makes grammar a science and poetry an art His conception of God and a future life is spontaneous and instinctive and his expressions of this conception have been by turns monstrous eccentric beautiful comforting and terrible All these different creeds at which the frivolous irreligion of the eighteenth century mocked are modes of expression of the religious sentiment Some day man will explain to himself the character of the God whom he believes in and the nature of that other world to which his soul aspires one The problem of the origin of language is solved by the distinction made by Frederic Cuvier between instinct and intelligence Language is not a premeditated arbitrary or conventional device nor is it communicated or revealed to us by God Language is an instinctive and unpremeditated creation of man as the hive is of the bee In this sense it may be said that language is not the work of man since it is not the work of his mind Further the mechanism of language seems more wonderful and ingenious when it is not regarded as the result of reflection 
8534_216564_000021_000005	train-clean-360	This fact is one of the most curious and indisputable which philology has observed 
none	none	See among other works a Latin essay by F G Bergmann Strasbourg eighteen thirty nine in which the learned author explains how the phonetic germ is born of sensation how language passes through three successive stages of development why man endowed at birth with the instinctive faculty of creating a language loses this faculty as fast as his mind develops and that the study of languages is real natural history in fact a science France possesses to day several philologists of the first rank endowed with rare talents and deep philosophic insight modest savants developing a science almost without the knowledge of the public devoting themselves to studies which are scornfully looked down upon and seeming to shun applause as much as others seek it All that he does from instinct man despises or if he admires it it is as Nature s work not as his own This explains the obscurity which surrounds the names of early inventors it explains also our indifference to religious matters and the ridicule heaped upon religious customs 
8534_216564_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Man esteems only the products of reflection and of reason 
8534_216564_000022_000003	train-clean-360	The most wonderful works of instinct are in his eyes only lucky GOD SENDS he reserves the name DISCOVERY I had almost said creation for the works of intelligence 
8534_216564_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Instinct is the source of passion and enthusiasm it is intelligence which causes crime and virtue 
none	none	In developing his intelligence man makes use of not only his own observations but also those of others 
8534_216564_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He keeps an account of his experience and preserves the record so that the race as well as the individual becomes more and more intelligent 
8534_216564_000023_000002	train-clean-360	The animals do not transmit their knowledge that which each individual accumulates dies with him 
none	none	It is not enough then to say that we are distinguished from the animals by reflection unless we mean thereby the CONSTANT TENDENCY OF OUR INSTINCT TO BECOME INTELLIGENCE While man is governed by instinct he is unconscious of his acts He never would deceive himself and never would be troubled by errors evils and disorder if like the animals instinct were his only guide But the Creator has endowed us with reflection to the end that our instinct might become intelligence and since this reflection and resulting knowledge pass through various stages it happens that in the beginning our instinct is opposed rather than guided by reflection consequently that our power of thought leads us to act in opposition to our nature and our end that deceiving ourselves we do and suffer evil until instinct which points us towards good and reflection which makes us stumble into evil are replaced by the science of good and evil which invariably causes us to seek the one and avoid the other 
8534_216564_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Thus evil or error and its consequences is the firstborn son of the union of two opposing faculties instinct and reflection good or truth must inevitably be the second child 
none	none	Or to again employ the figure evil is the product of incest between adverse powers good will sooner or later be the legitimate child of their holy and mysterious union 
8534_216564_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Property born of the reasoning faculty intrenches itself behind comparisons 
8534_216564_000026_000001	train-clean-360	But just as reflection and reason are subsequent to spontaneity observation to sensation and experience to instinct so property is subsequent to communism 
8534_216564_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Communism or association in a simple form is the necessary object and original aspiration of the social nature the spontaneous movement by which it manifests and establishes itself 
8534_216564_000026_000003	train-clean-360	It is the first phase of human civilization 
8534_216564_000026_000004	train-clean-360	In this state of society which the jurists have called NEGATIVE COMMUNISM man draws near to man and shares with him the fruits of the field and the milk and flesh of animals 
none	none	Little by little this communism negative as long as man does not produce tends to become positive and organic through the development of labor and industry But it is then that the sovereignty of thought and the terrible faculty of reasoning logically or illogically teach man that if equality is the sine qua non of society communism is the first species of slavery

none	none	two Characteristics of Communism and of Property I I ought not to conceal the fact that property and communism have been considered always the only possible forms of society This deplorable error has been the life of property The disadvantages of communism are so obvious that its critics never have needed to employ much eloquence to thoroughly disgust men with it The irreparability of the injustice which it causes the violence which it does to attractions and repulsions the yoke of iron which it fastens upon the will the moral torture to which it subjects the conscience the debilitating effect which it has upon society and to sum it all up the pious and stupid uniformity which it enforces upon the free active reasoning unsubmissive personality of man have shocked common sense and condemned communism by an irrevocable decree The authorities and examples cited in its favor disprove it The communistic republic of Plato involved slavery that of Lycurgus employed Helots whose duty it was to produce for their masters thus enabling the latter to devote themselves exclusively to athletic sports and to war Even J J Rousseau confounding communism and equality has said somewhere that without slavery he did not think equality of conditions possible The communities of the early Church did not last the first century out and soon degenerated into monasteries In those of the Jesuits of Paraguay the condition of the blacks is said by all travellers to be as miserable as that of slaves and it is a fact that the good Fathers were obliged to surround themselves with ditches and walls to prevent their new converts from escaping The followers of Baboeuf guided by a lofty horror of property rather than by any definite belief were ruined by exaggeration of their principles the saint Simonians lumping communism and inequality passed away like a masquerade The greatest danger to which society is exposed to day is that of another shipwreck on this rock Singularly enough systematic communism the deliberate negation of property is conceived under the direct influence of the proprietary prejudice and property is the basis of all communistic theories The members of a community it is true have no private property but the community is proprietor and proprietor not only of the goods but of the persons and wills In consequence of this principle of absolute property labor which should be only a condition imposed upon man by Nature becomes in all communities a human commandment and therefore odious Passive obedience irreconcilable with a reflecting will is strictly enforced Fidelity to regulations which are always defective however wise they may be thought allows of no complaint Life talent and all the human faculties are the property of the State which has the right to use them as it pleases for the common good Private associations are sternly prohibited in spite of the likes and dislikes of different natures because to tolerate them would be to introduce small communities within the large one and consequently private property the strong work for the weak although this ought to be left to benevolence and not enforced advised or enjoined the industrious work for the lazy although this is unjust the clever work for the foolish although this is absurd and finally man casting aside his personality his spontaneity his genius and his affections humbly annihilates himself at the feet of the majestic and inflexible Commune Communism is inequality but not as property is Property is the exploitation of the weak by the strong Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak In property inequality of conditions is the result of force under whatever name it be disguised physical and mental force force of events chance FORTUNE force of accumulated property c In communism inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence This damaging equation is repellent to the conscience and causes merit to complain for although it may be the duty of the strong to aid the weak they prefer to do it out of generosity they never will endure a comparison Give them equal opportunities of labor and equal wages but never allow their jealousy to be awakened by mutual suspicion of unfaithfulness in the performance of the common task Communism is oppression and slavery Man is very willing to obey the law of duty serve his country and oblige his friends but he wishes to labor when he pleases where he pleases and as much as he pleases He wishes to dispose of his own time to be governed only by necessity to choose his friendships his recreation and his discipline to act from judgment not by command to sacrifice himself through selfishness not through servile obligation Communism is essentially opposed to the free exercise of our faculties to our noblest desires to our deepest feelings Any plan which could be devised for reconciling it with the demands of the individual reason and will would end only in changing the thing while preserving the name Now if we are honest truth seekers we shall avoid disputes about words Thus communism violates the sovereignty of the conscience and equality the first by restricting spontaneity of mind and heart and freedom of thought and action the second by placing labor and laziness skill and stupidity and even vice and virtue on an equality in point of comfort For the rest if property is impossible on account of the desire to accumulate communism would soon become so through the desire to shirk II Property in its turn violates equality by the rights of exclusion and increase and freedom by despotism The former effect of property having been sufficiently developed in the last three chapters I will content myself here with establishing by a final comparison its perfect identity with robbery The Latin words for robber are fur and latro the former taken from the Greek from Latin fero I carry away the latter from I play the part of a brigand which is derived from Latin lateo I conceal myself The Greeks have also from I filch whose radical consonants are the same as those of I cover I conceal Thus in these languages the idea of a robber is that of a man who conceals carries away or diverts in any manner whatever a thing which does not belong to him The Hebrews expressed the same idea by the word gannab robber from the verb ganab which means to put away to turn aside lo thi gnob Decalogue Eighth Commandment thou shalt not steal that is thou shalt not hold back thou shalt not put away any thing for thyself That is the act of a man who on entering into a society into which he agrees to bring all that he has secretly reserves a portion as did the celebrated disciple Ananias The etymology of the French verb voler is still more significant Voler or faire la vole from the Latin vola palm of the hand means to take all the tricks in a game of ombre so that le voleur the robber is the capitalist who takes all who gets the lion s share Probably this verb voler had its origin in the professional slang of thieves whence it has passed into common use and consequently into the phraseology of the law Robbery is committed in a variety of ways which have been very cleverly distinguished and classified by legislators according to their heinousness or merit to the end that some robbers may be honored while others are punished We rob one By murder on the highway two Alone or in a band three By breaking into buildings or scaling walls four By abstraction five By fraudulent bankruptcy six By forgery of the handwriting of public officials or private individuals seven By manufacture of counterfeit money This species includes all robbers who practise their profession with no other aid than force and open fraud Bandits brigands pirates rovers by land and sea these names were gloried in by the ancient heroes who thought their profession as noble as it was lucrative Nimrod Theseus Jason and his Argonauts Jephthah David Cacus Romulus Clovis and all his Merovingian descendants Robert Guiscard Tancred de Hauteville Bohemond and most of the Norman heroes were brigands and robbers The heroic character of the robber is expressed in this line from Horace in reference to Achilles Jura neget sibi nata nihil non arroget armis twenty seven and by this sentence from the dying words of Jacob general xlviii which the Jews apply to David and the Christians to their Christ Manus ejus contra omnes In our day the robber the warrior of the ancients is pursued with the utmost vigor His profession in the language of the code entails ignominious and corporal penalties from imprisonment to the scaffold A sad change in opinions here below We rob eight By cheating nine By swindling ten By abuse of trust eleven By games and lotteries This second species was encouraged by the laws of Lycurgus in order to sharpen the wits of the young It is the kind practised by Ulysses Solon and Sinon by the ancient and modern Jews from Jacob down to Deutz and by the Bohemians the Arabs and all savage tribes Under Louis XIII and Louis XIV it was not considered dishonorable to cheat at play To do so was a part of the game and many worthy people did not scruple to correct the caprice of Fortune by dexterous jugglery To day even and in all countries it is thought a mark of merit among peasants merchants and shopkeepers to KNOW HOW TO MAKE A BARGAIN that is to deceive one s man This is so universally accepted that the cheated party takes no offence It is known with what reluctance our government resolved upon the abolition of lotteries It felt that it was dealing a stab thereby at property The pickpocket the blackleg and the charlatan make especial use of their dexterity of hand their subtlety of mind the magic power of their eloquence and their great fertility of invention Sometimes they offer bait to cupidity Therefore the penal code which much prefers intelligence to muscular vigor has made of the four varieties mentioned above a second category liable only to correctional not to Ignominious punishments Let them now accuse the law of being materialistic and atheistic We rob twelve By usury This species of robbery so odious and so severely punished since the publication of the Gospel is the connecting link between forbidden and authorized robbery Owing to its ambiguous nature it has given rise to a multitude of contradictions in the laws and in morals contradictions which have been very cleverly turned to account by lawyers financiers and merchants Thus the usurer who lends on mortgage at ten twelve and fifteen per cent is heavily fined when detected while the banker who receives the same interest not it is true upon a loan but in the way of exchange or discount that is of sale is protected by royal privilege But the distinction between the banker and the usurer is a purely nominal one Like the usurer who lends on property real or personal the banker lends on business paper like the usurer he takes his interest in advance like the usurer he can recover from the borrower if the property is destroyed that is if the note is not redeemed a circumstance which makes him a money lender not a money seller But the banker lends for a short time only while the usurer s loan may be for one two three or more years Now a difference in the duration of the loan or the form of the act does not alter the nature of the transaction As for the capitalists who invest their money either with the State or in commercial operations at three four and five per cent that is who lend on usury at a little lower rate than the bankers and usurers they are the flower of society the cream of honesty Moderation in robbery is the height of virtue twenty eight But what then is usury Nothing is more amusing than to see these INSTRUCTORS OF NATIONS hesitate between the authority of the Gospel which they say NEVER CAN HAVE SPOKEN IN VAIN and the authority of economical demonstrations Nothing to my mind is more creditable to the Gospel than this old infidelity of its pretended teachers Salmasius having assimilated interest to rent was REFUTED by Grotius Pufendorf Burlamaqui Wolf and Heineccius and what is more curious still Salmasius ADMITTED HIS ERROR Instead of inferring from this doctrine of Salmasius that all increase is illegitimate and proceeding straight on to the demonstration of Gospel equality they arrived at just the opposite conclusion namely that since everybody acknowledges that rent is permissible if we allow that interest does not differ from rent there is nothing left which can be called usury and consequently that the commandment of Jesus Christ is an ILLUSION and amounts to NOTHING which is an impious conclusion If this memoir had appeared in the time of Bossuet that great theologian would have PROVED by scripture the fathers traditions councils and popes that property exists by Divine right while usury is an invention of the devil and the heretical work would have been burned and the author imprisoned We rob thirteen By farm rent house rent and leases of all kinds The author of the Provincial Letters entertained the honest Christians of the seventeenth century at the expense of Escobar the Jesuit and the contract Mohatra The contract Mohatra said Escobar is a contract by which goods are bought at a high price and on credit to be again sold at the same moment to the same person cash down and at a lower price Escobar found a way to justify this kind of usury Pascal and all the Jansenists laughed at him But what would the satirical Pascal the learned Nicole and the invincible Arnaud have said if Father Antoine Escobar de Valladolid had answered them thus A lease is a contract by which real estate is bought at a high price and on credit to be again sold at the expiration of a certain time to the same person at a lower price only to simplify the transaction the buyer is content to pay the difference between the first sale and the second Either deny the identity of the lease and the contract Mohatra and then I will annihilate you in a moment or if you admit the similarity admit also the soundness of my doctrine otherwise you proscribe both interest and rent at one blow In reply to this overwhelming argument of the Jesuit the sire of Montalte would have sounded the tocsin and would have shouted that society was in peril that the Jesuits were sapping its very foundations We rob fourteen By commerce when the profit of the merchant exceeds his legitimate salary Everybody knows the definition of commerce THE ART OF BUYING FOR THREE FRANCS THAT WHICH IS WORTH SIX AND OF SELLING FOR SIX THAT WHICH IS WORTH THREE Between commerce thus defined and vol a l americaine the only difference is in the relative proportion of the values exchanged in short in the amount of the profit We rob fifteen By making profit on our product by accepting sinecures and by exacting exorbitant wages The farmer who sells a certain amount of corn to the consumer and who during the measurement thrusts his hand into the bushel and takes out a handful of grains robs the professor whose lectures are paid for by the State and who through the intervention of a bookseller sells them to the public a second time robs the sinecurist who receives an enormous product in exchange for his vanity robs the functionary the laborer whatever he may be who produces only one and gets paid four one hundred or one thousand robs the publisher of this book and I its author we rob by charging for it twice as much as it is worth In recapitulation Justice after passing through the state of negative communism called by the ancient poets the AGE OF GOLD commences as the right of the strongest In a society which is trying to organize itself inequality of faculties calls up the idea of merit equite suggests the plan of proportioning not only esteem but also material comforts to personal merit and since the highest and almost the only merit then recognized is physical strength the strongest and consequently the best is entitled to the largest share and if it is refused him he very naturally takes it by force From this to the assumption of the right of property in all things it is but one step Such was justice in the heroic age preserved at least by tradition among the Greeks and Romans down to the last days of their republics Plato in the Gorgias introduces a character named Callicles who spiritedly defends the right of the strongest which Socrates the advocate of equality seriously refutes It is related of the great Pompey that he blushed easily and nevertheless these words once escaped his lips Why should I respect the laws when I have arms in my hand This shows him to have been a man in whom the moral sense and ambition were struggling for the mastery and who sought to justify his violence by the motto of the hero and the brigand From the right of the strongest springs the exploitation of man by man or bondage usury or the tribute levied upon the conquered by the conqueror and the whole numerous family of taxes duties monarchical prerogatives house rents farm rents c in one word property Force was followed by artifice the second manifestation of justice which was detested by the ancient heroes who not excelling in that direction were heavy losers by it Force was still employed but mental force instead of physical Skill in deceiving an enemy by treacherous propositions seemed deserving of reward nevertheless the strong always prided themselves upon their honesty In those days oaths were observed and promises kept according to the letter rather than the spirit Uti lingua nuncupassit ita jus esto As the tongue has spoken so must the right be says the law of the Twelve Tables Artifice or rather perfidy was the main element in the politics of ancient Rome Among other examples Vico cites the following also quoted by Montesquieu The Romans had guaranteed to the Carthaginians the preservation of their goods and their CITY intentionally using the word civitas that is the society the State the Carthaginians on the contrary understood them to mean the material city urbs and accordingly began to rebuild their walls They were immediately attacked on account of their violation of the treaty by the Romans who acting upon the old heroic idea of right did not imagine that in taking advantage of an equivocation to surprise their enemies they were waging unjust war From artifice sprang the profits of manufactures commerce and banking mercantile frauds and pretensions which are honored with the beautiful names of TALENT and GENIUS but which ought to be regarded as the last degree of knavery and deception and finally all sorts of social inequalities In those forms of robbery which are prohibited by law force and artifice are employed alone and undisguised in the authorized forms they conceal themselves within a useful product which they use as a tool to plunder their victim The direct use of violence and stratagem was early and universally condemned but no nation has yet got rid of that kind of robbery which acts through talent labor and possession and which is the source of all the dilemmas of casuistry and the innumerable contradictions of jurisprudence The right of force and the right of artifice glorified by the rhapsodists in the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey inspired the legislation of the Greeks and Romans from which they passed into our morals and codes Christianity has not changed at all The Gospel should not be blamed because the priests as stupid as the legists have been unable either to expound or to understand it The ignorance of councils and popes upon all questions of morality is equal to that of the market place and the money changers and it is this utter ignorance of right justice and society which is killing the Church and discrediting its teachings for ever The infidelity of the Roman church and other Christian churches is flagrant all have disregarded the precept of Jesus all have erred in moral and doctrinal points all are guilty of teaching false and absurd dogmas which lead straight to wickedness and murder Let it ask pardon of God and men this church which called itself infallible and which has grown so corrupt in morals let its reformed sisters humble themselves and the people undeceived but still religious and merciful will begin to think twenty nine One of the main causes of Ireland s poverty to day is the immense revenues of the English clergy So heretics and orthodox Protestants and Papists cannot reproach each other All have strayed from the path of justice all have disobeyed the eighth commandment of the Decalogue Thou shalt not steal The development of right has followed the same order in its various expressions that property has in its forms Every where we see justice driving robbery before it and confining it within narrower and narrower limits Hitherto the victories of justice over injustice and of equality over inequality have been won by instinct and the simple force of things but the final triumph of our social nature will be due to our reason or else we shall fall back into feudal chaos Either this glorious height is reserved for our intelligence or this miserable depth for our baseness The second effect of property is despotism Now since despotism is inseparably connected with the idea of legitimate authority in explaining the natural causes of the first the principle of the second will appear What is to be the form of government in the future hear some of my younger readers reply Why how can you ask such a question You are a republican A republican Yes but that word specifies nothing Res publica that is the public thing Now whoever is interested in public affairs no matter under what form of government may call himself a republican Even kings are republicans Well you are a democrat No What you would have a monarchy No A constitutionalist God forbid You are then an aristocrat Not at all You want a mixed government Still less What are you then I am an anarchist Oh I understand you you speak satirically This is a hit at the government By no means I have just given you my serious and well considered profession of faith Although a firm friend of order I am in the full force of the term an anarchist Listen to me In all species of sociable animals the weakness of the young is the principle of their obedience to the old who are strong and from habit which is a kind of conscience with them the power remains with the oldest although he finally becomes the weakest Whenever the society is under the control of a chief this chief is almost always the oldest of the troop I say almost always because the established order may be disturbed by violent outbreaks Then the authority passes to another and having been re established by force it is again maintained by habit Wild horses go in herds they have a chief who marches at their head whom they confidently follow and who gives the signal for flight or battle The sheep which we have raised follows us but it follows in company with the flock in the midst of which it was born It regards man AS THE CHIEF OF ITS FLOCK Man is regarded by domestic animals as a member of their society All that he has to do is to get himself accepted by them as an associate he soon becomes their chief in consequence of his superior intelligence He does not then change the NATURAL CONDITION of these animals as Buffon has said On the contrary he uses this natural condition to his own advantage in other words he finds SOCIABLE animals and renders them DOMESTIC by becoming their associate and chief Thus the DOMESTICITY of animals is only a special condition a simple modification a definitive consequence of their SOCIABILITY All domestic animals are by nature sociable animals Flourens Summary of the Observations of F Cuvier Sociable animals follow their chief by INSTINCT but take notice of the fact which F Cuvier omitted to state that the function of the chief is altogether one of INTELLIGENCE The chief does not teach the others to associate to unite under his lead to reproduce their kind to take to flight or to defend themselves Concerning each of these particulars his subordinates are as well informed as he But it is the chief who by his accumulated experience provides against accidents he it is whose private intelligence supplements in difficult situations the general instinct he it is who deliberates decides and leads he it is in short whose enlightened prudence regulates the public routine for the greatest good of all Man naturally a sociable being naturally follows a chief Originally the chief is the father the patriarch the elder in other words the good and wise man whose functions consequently are exclusively of a reflective and intellectual nature The human race like all other races of sociable animals has its instincts its innate faculties its general ideas and its categories of sentiment and reason Its chiefs legislators or kings have devised nothing supposed nothing imagined nothing They have only guided society by their accumulated experience always however in conformity with opinions and beliefs Those philosophers who carrying into morals and into history their gloomy and factious whims affirm that the human race had originally neither chiefs nor kings know nothing of the nature of man Royalty and absolute royalty is as truly and more truly than democracy a primitive form of government Perceiving that in the remotest ages crowns and kingships were worn by heroes brigands and knight errants they confound the two things royalty and despotism But royalty dates from the creation of man it existed in the age of negative communism Ancient heroism and the despotism which it engendered commenced only with the first manifestation of the idea of justice that is with the reign of force As soon as the strongest in the comparison of merits was decided to be the best the oldest had to abandon his position and royalty became despotic The spontaneous instinctive and so to speak physiological origin of royalty gives it in the beginning a superhuman character The nations connected it with the gods from whom they said the first kings descended This notion was the origin of the divine genealogies of royal families the incarnations of gods and the messianic fables From it sprang the doctrine of divine right which is still championed by a few singular characters Royalty was at first elective because at a time when man produced but little and possessed nothing property was too weak to establish the principle of heredity and secure to the son the throne of his father but as soon as fields were cleared and cities built each function was like every thing else appropriated and hereditary kingships and priesthoods were the result The principle of heredity was carried into even the most ordinary professions a circumstance which led to class distinctions pride of station and abjection of the common people and which confirms my assertion concerning the principle of patrimonial succession that it is a method suggested by Nature of filling vacancies in business and completing unfinished tasks From time to time ambition caused usurpers or SUPPLANTERS of kings to start up and in consequence some were called kings by right or legitimate kings and others TYRANTS But we must not let these names deceive us There have been execrable kings and very tolerable tyrants Royalty may always be good when it is the only possible form of government legitimate it is never Neither heredity nor election nor universal suffrage nor the excellence of the sovereign nor the consecration of religion and of time can make royalty legitimate Whatever form it takes monarchic oligarchic or democratic royalty or the government of man by man is illegitimate and absurd Man in order to procure as speedily as possible the most thorough satisfaction of his wants seeks RULE In the beginning this rule is to him living visible and tangible It is his father his master his king The more ignorant man is the more obedient he is and the more absolute is his confidence in his guide But it being a law of man s nature to conform to rule that is to discover it by his powers of reflection and reason man reasons upon the commands of his chiefs Now such reasoning as that is a protest against authority a beginning of disobedience At the moment that man inquires into the motives which govern the will of his sovereign at that moment man revolts If he obeys no longer because the king commands but because the king demonstrates the wisdom of his commands it may be said that henceforth he will recognize no authority and that he has become his own king Unhappy he who shall dare to command him and shall offer as his authority only the vote of the majority for sooner or later the minority will become the majority and this imprudent despot will be overthrown and all his laws annihilated In proportion as society becomes enlightened royal authority diminishes That is a fact to which all history bears witness At the birth of nations men reflect and reason in vain Without methods without principles not knowing how to use their reason they cannot judge of the justice of their conclusions Then the authority of kings is immense no knowledge having been acquired with which to contradict it But little by little experience produces habits which develop into customs then the customs are formulated in maxims laid down as principles in short transformed into laws to which the king the living law has to bow There comes a time when customs and laws are so numerous that the will of the prince is so to speak entwined by the public will and that on taking the crown he is obliged to swear that he will govern in conformity with established customs and usages and that he is but the executive power of a society whose laws are made independently of him Up to this point all is done instinctively and as it were unconsciously but see where this movement must end By means of self instruction and the acquisition of ideas man finally acquires the idea of SCIENCE that is of a system of knowledge in harmony with the reality of things and inferred from observation He searches for the science or the system of inanimate bodies the system of organic bodies the system of the human mind and the system of the universe why should he not also search for the system of society But having reached this height he comprehends that political truth or the science of politics exists quite independently of the will of sovereigns the opinion of majorities and popular beliefs that kings ministers magistrates and nations as wills have no connection with the science and are worthy of no consideration He comprehends at the same time that if man is born a sociable being the authority of his father over him ceases on the day when his mind being formed and his education finished he becomes the associate of his father that his true chief and his king is the demonstrated truth that politics is a science not a stratagem and that the function of the legislator is reduced in the last analysis to the methodical search for truth Thus in a given society the authority of man over man is inversely proportional to the stage of intellectual development which that society has reached and the probable duration of that authority can be calculated from the more or less general desire for a true government that is for a scientific government And just as the right of force and the right of artifice retreat before the steady advance of justice and must finally be extinguished in equality so the sovereignty of the will yields to the sovereignty of the reason and must at last be lost in scientific socialism Property and royalty have been crumbling to pieces ever since the world began As man seeks justice in equality so society seeks order in anarchy ANARCHY the absence of a master of a sovereign thirty such is the form of government to which we are every day approximating and which our accustomed habit of taking man for our rule and his will for law leads us to regard as the height of disorder and the expression of chaos The story is told that a citizen of Paris in the seventeenth century having heard it said that in Venice there was no king the good man could not recover from his astonishment and nearly died from laughter at the mere mention of so ridiculous a thing So strong is our prejudice As long as we live we want a chief or chiefs and at this very moment I hold in my hand a brochure whose author a zealous communist dreams like a second Marat of the dictatorship The most advanced among us are those who wish the greatest possible number of sovereigns their most ardent wish is for the royalty of the National Guard Soon undoubtedly some one jealous of the citizen militia will say Everybody is king But when he has spoken I will say in my turn Nobody is king we are whether we will or no associated Every question of domestic politics must be decided by departmental statistics every question of foreign politics is an affair of international statistics The science of government rightly belongs to one of the sections of the Academy of Sciences whose permanent secretary is necessarily prime minister and since every citizen may address a memoir to the Academy every citizen is a legislator But as the opinion of no one is of any value until its truth has been proven no one can substitute his will for reason nobody is king All questions of legislation and politics are matters of science not of opinion The legislative power belongs only to the reason methodically recognized and demonstrated To attribute to any power whatever the right of veto or of sanction is the last degree of tyranny Justice and legality are two things as independent of our approval as is mathematical truth To compel they need only to be known to be known they need only to be considered and studied What then is the nation if it is not the sovereign if it is not the source of the legislative power The nation is the guardian of the law the nation is the EXECUTIVE POWER Every citizen may assert This is true that is just but his opinion controls no one but himself That the truth which he proclaims may become a law it must be recognized Now what is it to recognize a law It is to verify a mathematical or a metaphysical calculation it is to repeat an experiment to observe a phenomenon to establish a fact Only the nation has the right to say Be it known and decreed I confess that this is an overturning of received ideas and that I seem to be attempting to revolutionize our political system but I beg the reader to consider that having begun with a paradox I must if I reason correctly meet with paradoxes at every step and must end with paradoxes For the rest I do not see how the liberty of citizens would be endangered by entrusting to their hands instead of the pen of the legislator the sword of the law The executive power belonging properly to the will cannot be confided to too many proxies That is the true sovereignty of the nation thirty one The proprietor the robber the hero the sovereign for all these titles are synonymous imposes his will as law and suffers neither contradiction nor control that is he pretends to be the legislative and the executive power at once Accordingly the substitution of the scientific and true law for the royal will is accomplished only by a terrible struggle and this constant substitution is after property the most potent element in history the most prolific source of political disturbances Examples are too numerous and too striking to require enumeration Now property necessarily engenders despotism the government of caprice the reign of libidinous pleasure That is so clearly the essence of property that to be convinced of it one need but remember what it is and observe what happens around him Property is the right to USE and ABUSE If then government is economy if its object is production and consumption and the distribution of labor and products how is government possible while property exists And if goods are property why should not the proprietors be kings and despotic kings kings in proportion to their facultes bonitaires And if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property absolute king throughout his own domain how could a government of proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion three Determination of the third form of Society Conclusion Then no government no public economy no administration is possible which is based upon property Communism seeks EQUALITY and LAW Property born of the sovereignty of the reason and the sense of personal merit wishes above all things INDEPENDENCE and PROPORTIONALITY But communism mistaking uniformity for law and levelism for equality becomes tyrannical and unjust Property by its despotism and encroachments soon proves itself oppressive and anti social The objects of communism and property are good their results are bad And why Because both are exclusive and each disregards two elements of society Communism rejects independence and proportionality property does not satisfy equality and law Now if we imagine a society based upon these four principles equality law independence and proportionality we find one That EQUALITY consisting only in EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS that is OF MEANS and not in EQUALITY OF COMFORT which it is the business of the laborers to achieve for themselves when provided with equal means in no way violates justice and equite two That LAW resulting from the knowledge of facts and consequently based upon necessity itself never clashes with independence three That individual INDEPENDENCE or the autonomy of the private reason originating in the difference in talents and capacities can exist without danger within the limits of the law four That PROPORTIONALITY being admitted only in the sphere of intelligence and sentiment and not as regards material objects may be observed without violating justice or social equality This third form of society the synthesis of communism and property we will call LIBERTY thirty two In determining the nature of liberty we do not unite communism and property indiscriminately such a process would be absurd eclecticism We search by analysis for those elements in each which are true and in harmony with the laws of Nature and society disregarding the rest altogether and the result gives us an adequate expression of the natural form of human society in one word liberty Liberty is equality because liberty exists only in society and in the absence of equality there is no society Liberty is anarchy because it does not admit the government of the will but only the authority of the law that is of necessity Liberty is infinite variety because it respects all wills within the limits of the law Liberty is proportionality because it allows the utmost latitude to the ambition for merit and the emulation of glory We can now say in the words of M Cousin Our principle is true it is good it is social let us not fear to push it to its ultimate Man s social nature becoming JUSTICE through reflection EQUITE through the classification of capacities and having LIBERTY for its formula is the true basis of morality the principle and regulator of all our actions This is the universal motor which philosophy is searching for which religion strengthens which egotism supplants and whose place pure reason never can fill DUTY and RIGHT are born of NEED which when considered in connection with others is a RIGHT and when considered in connection with ourselves a DUTY We need to eat and sleep It is our right to procure those things which are necessary to rest and nourishment It is our duty to use them when Nature requires it We need to labor in order to live To do so is both our right and our duty We need to love our wives and children It is our duty to protect and support them It is our right to be loved in preference to all others Conjugal fidelity is justice Adultery is high treason against society We need to exchange our products for other products It is our right that this exchange should be one of equivalents and since we consume before we produce it would be our duty if we could control the matter to see to it that our last product shall follow our last consumption Suicide is fraudulent bankruptcy We need to live our lives according to the dictates of our reason It is our right to maintain our freedom It is our duty to respect that of others We need to be appreciated by our fellows It is our duty to deserve their praise It is our right to be judged by our works Liberty is not opposed to the rights of succession and bequest It contents itself with preventing violations of equality Choose it tells us between two legacies but do not take them both All our legislation concerning transmissions entailments adoptions and if I may venture to use such a word COADJUTORERIES requires remodelling Liberty favors emulation instead of destroying it In social equality emulation consists in accomplishing under like conditions it is its own reward No one suffers by the victory Liberty applauds self sacrifice and honors it with its votes but it can dispense with it Justice alone suffices to maintain the social equilibrium Self sacrifice is an act of supererogation Happy however the man who can say I sacrifice myself thirty three Liberty is essentially an organizing force To insure equality between men and peace among nations agriculture and industry and the centres of education business and storage must be distributed according to the climate and the geographical position of the country the nature of the products the character and natural talents of the inhabitants c in proportions so just so wise so harmonious that in no place shall there ever be either an excess or a lack of population consumption and products There commences the science of public and private right the true political economy It is for the writers on jurisprudence henceforth unembarrassed by the false principle of property to describe the new laws and bring peace upon earth Knowledge and genius they do not lack the foundation is now laid for them thirty four I have accomplished my task property is conquered never again to arise Wherever this work is read and discussed there will be deposited the germ of death to property there sooner or later privilege and servitude will disappear and the despotism of will will give place to the reign of reason What sophisms indeed what prejudices however obstinate can stand before the simplicity of the following propositions I Individual POSSESSION thirty five is the condition of social life five thousand years of property demonstrate it PROPERTY is the suicide of society Possession is a right property is against right Suppress property while maintaining possession and by this simple modification of the principle you will revolutionize law government economy and institutions you will drive evil from the face of the earth II All having an equal right of occupancy possession varies with the number of possessors property cannot establish itself III The effect of labor being the same for all property is lost in the common prosperity IV All human labor being the result of collective force all property becomes in consequence collective and unitary To speak more exactly labor destroys property V Every capacity for labor being like every instrument of labor an accumulated capital and a collective property inequality of wages and fortunes on the ground of inequality of capacities is therefore injustice and robbery VI The necessary conditions of commerce are the liberty of the contracting parties and the equivalence of the products exchanged Now value being expressed by the amount of time and outlay which each product costs and liberty being inviolable the wages of laborers like their rights and duties should be equal VII Products are bought only by products Now the condition of all exchange being equivalence of products profit is impossible and unjust Observe this elementary principle of economy and pauperism luxury oppression vice crime and hunger will disappear from our midst VIII Men are associated by the physical and mathematical law of production before they are voluntarily associated by choice Therefore equality of conditions is demanded by justice that is by strict social law esteem friendship gratitude admiration all fall within the domain of EQUITABLE or PROPORTIONAL law only IX Free association liberty whose sole function is to maintain equality in the means of production and equivalence in exchanges is the only possible the only just the only true form of society X Politics is the science of liberty The government of man by man under whatever name it be disguised is oppression Society finds its highest perfection in the union of order with anarchy The old civilization has run its race a new sun is rising and will soon renew the face of the earth Let the present generation perish let the old prevaricators die in the desert the holy earth shall not cover their bones Young man exasperated by the corruption of the age and absorbed in your zeal for justice if your country is dear to you and if you have the interests of humanity at heart have the courage to espouse the cause of liberty Cast off your old selfishness and plunge into the rising flood of popular equality There your regenerate soul will acquire new life and vigor your enervated genius will recover unconquerable energy and your heart perhaps already withered will be rejuvenated Every thing will wear a different look to your illuminated vision new sentiments will engender new ideas within you religion morality poetry art language will appear before you in nobler and fairer forms and thenceforth sure of your faith and thoughtfully enthusiastic you will hail the dawn of universal regeneration And you sad victims of an odious law you whom a jesting world despoils and outrages you whose labor has always been fruitless and whose rest has been without hope take courage your tears are numbered The fathers have sown in affliction the children shall reap in rejoicings O God of liberty God of equality Thou who didst place in my heart the sentiment of justice before my reason could comprehend it hear my ardent prayer Thou hast dictated all that I have written Thou hast shaped my thought Thou hast directed my studies Thou hast weaned my mind from curiosity and my heart from attachment that I might publish Thy truth to the master and the slave I have spoken with what force and talent Thou hast given me it is Thine to finish the work Thou knowest whether I seek my welfare or Thy glory O God of liberty Ah perish my memory and let humanity be free Let me see from my obscurity the people at last instructed let noble teachers enlighten them let generous spirits guide them Abridge if possible the time of our trial stifle pride and avarice in equality annihilate this love of glory which enslaves us teach these poor children that in the bosom of liberty there are neither heroes nor great men Inspire the powerful man the rich man him whose name my lips shall never pronounce in Thy presence with a horror of his crimes let him be the first to apply for admission to the redeemed society let the promptness of his repentance be the ground of his forgiveness Then great and small wise and foolish rich and poor will unite in an ineffable fraternity and singing in unison a new hymn will rebuild Thy altar O God of liberty and equality END OF FIRST MEMOIR WHAT IS PROPERTY SECOND MEMOIR A LETTER TO M BLANQUI SECOND MEMOIR 
8534_216567_000005_000000	train-clean-360	PARIS April one eighteen forty one 
none	none	MONSIEUR Before resuming my Inquiries into Government and Property it is fitting for the satisfaction of some worthy people and also in the interest of order that I should make to you a plain straightforward explanation In a much governed State no one would be allowed to attack the external form of the society and the groundwork of its institutions until he had established his right to do so first by his morality second by his capacity and third by the purity of his intentions 
8534_216567_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Any one who wishing to publish a treatise upon the constitution of the country could not satisfy this threefold condition would be obliged to procure the endorsement of a responsible patron possessing the requisite qualifications 
8534_216567_000008_000000	train-clean-360	But we Frenchmen have the liberty of the press 
8534_216567_000008_000001	train-clean-360	This grand right the sword of thought which elevates the virtuous citizen to the rank of legislator and makes the malicious citizen an agent of discord frees us from all preliminary responsibility to the law but it does not release us from our internal obligation to render a public account of our sentiments and thoughts 
8534_216567_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I have used in all its fulness and concerning an important question the right which the charter grants us 
none	none	I come to day sir to submit my conscience to your judgment and my feeble insight to your discriminating reason 
8534_216567_000008_000004	train-clean-360	You have criticised in a kindly spirit I had almost said with partiality for the writer a work which teaches a doctrine that you thought it your duty to condemn 
none	none	The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences said you in your report can accept the conclusions of the author only as far as it likes I venture to hope sir that after you have read this letter if your prudence still restrains you your fairness will induce you to do me justice MEN EQUAL IN THE DIGNITY OF THEIR PERSONS AND EQUAL BEFORE THE LAW SHOULD BE EQUAL IN THEIR CONDITIONS such is the thesis which I maintained and developed in a memoir bearing the title What is Property or An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government The idea of social equality even in individual fortunes has in all ages besieged like a vague presentiment the human imagination 
8534_216567_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Poets have sung of it in their hymns philosophers have dreamed of it in their Utopias priests teach it but only for the spiritual world 
none	none	The people governed by it never have had faith in it and the civil power is never more disturbed than by the fables of the age of gold and the reign of Astrea A year ago however this idea received a scientific demonstration which has not yet been satisfactorily answered and permit me to add never will be This demonstration owing to its slightly impassioned style its method of reasoning which was so at variance with that employed by the generally recognized authorities and the importance and novelty of its conclusions was of a nature to cause some alarm and might have been dangerous had it not been as you sir so well said a sealed letter so far as the general public was concerned addressed only to men of intelligence I was glad to see that through its metaphysical dress you recognized the wise foresight of the author and I thank you for it May God grant that my intentions which are wholly peaceful may never be charged upon me as treasonable 
8534_216567_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Like a stone thrown into a mass of serpents the First Memoir on Property excited intense animosity and aroused the passions of many But while some wished the author and his work to be publicly denounced others found in them simply the solution of the fundamental problems of society a few even basing evil speculations upon the new light which they had obtained 
8534_216567_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It was not to be expected that a system of inductions abstractly gathered together and still more abstractly expressed would be understood with equal accuracy in its ensemble and in each of its parts 
none	none	To find the law of equality no longer in charity and self sacrifice which are not binding in their nature but in justice to base equality of functions upon equality of persons to determine the absolute principle of exchange to neutralize the inequality of individual faculties by collective force to establish an equation between property and robbery to change the law of succession without destroying the principle to maintain the human personality in a system of absolute association and to save liberty from the chains of communism to synthetize the monarchical and democratic forms of government to reverse the division of powers to give the executive power to the nation and to make legislation a positive fixed and absolute science what a series of paradoxes what a string of delusions if I may not say what a chain of truths 
8534_216567_000012_000001	train-clean-360	But it is not my purpose here to pass upon the theory of the right of possession 
none	none	I discuss no dogmas My only object is to justify my views and to show that in writing as I did I not only exercised a right but performed a duty Yes I have attacked property and shall attack it again but sir before demanding that I shall make the amende honorable for having obeyed my conscience and spoken the exact truth condescend I beg of you to cast a glance at the events which are happening around us look at our deputies our magistrates our philosophers our ministers our professors and our publicists examine their methods of dealing with the matter of property count up with me the restrictions placed upon it every day in the name of the public welfare measure the breaches already made estimate those which society thinks of making hereafter add the ideas concerning property held by all theories in common interrogate history and then tell me what will be left half a century hence of this old right of property and thus perceiving that I have so many accomplices you will immediately declare me innocent What is the law of expropriation on the ground of public utility which everybody favors and which is even thought too lenient thirty six 
8534_216567_000015_000000	train-clean-360	A flagrant violation of the right of property 
none	none	Society indemnifies it is said the dispossessed proprietor but does it return to him the traditional associations the poetic charm and the family pride which accompany property 
8534_216567_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Naboth and the miller of Sans Souci would have protested against French law as they protested against the caprice of their kings 
8534_216567_000015_000003	train-clean-360	 It is the field of our fathers they would have cried and we will not sell it Among the ancients the refusal of the individual limited the powers of the State 
none	none	The Roman law bowed to the will of the citizen and an emperor Commodus if I remember rightly abandoned the project of enlarging the forum out of respect for the rights of the occupants who refused to abdicate Property is a real right jus in re a right inherent in the thing and whose principle lies in the external manifestation of man s will 
8534_216567_000015_000006	train-clean-360	Man leaves his imprint stamps his character upon the objects of his handiwork This plastic force of man as the modern jurists say is the seal which set upon matter makes it holy 
none	none	Whoever lays hands upon it against the proprietor s will does violence to the latter s personality And yet when an administrative committee saw fit to declare that public utility required it property had to give way to the general will 
8534_216567_000015_000009	train-clean-360	Soon in the name of public utility methods of cultivation and conditions of enjoyment will be prescribed inspectors of agriculture and manufactures will be appointed property will be taken away from unskilful hands and entrusted to laborers who are more deserving of it and a general superintendence of production will be established 
8534_216567_000015_000010	train-clean-360	It is not two years since I saw a proprietor destroy a forest more than five hundred acres in extent 
8534_216567_000015_000011	train-clean-360	If public utility had interfered that forest the only one for miles around would still be standing 
8534_216567_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But it is said expropriation on the ground of public utility is only an exception which confirms the principle and bears testimony in favor of the right 
8534_216567_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Very well but from this exception we will pass to another from that to a third and so on from exceptions to exceptions until we have reduced the rule to a pure abstraction 
8534_216567_000017_000000	train-clean-360	How many supporters do you think sir can be claimed for the project of the conversion of the public funds 
none	none	I venture to say that everybody favors it except the fund holders 
8534_216567_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Now this so called conversion is an extensive expropriation and in this case with no indemnity whatever The public funds are so much real estate the income from which the proprietor counts upon with perfect safety and which owes its value to the tacit promise of the government to pay interest upon it at the established rate until the fund holder applies for redemption 
none	none	For if the income is liable to diminution it is less profitable than house rent or farm rent whose rates may rise or fall according to the fluctuations in the market and in that case what inducement has the capitalist to invest his money in the State When then you force the fund holder to submit to a diminution of interest you make him bankrupt to the extent of the diminution and since in consequence of the conversion an equally profitable investment becomes impossible you depreciate his property 
8534_216567_000018_000000	train-clean-360	That such a measure may be justly executed it must be generalized that is the law which provides for it must decree also that interest on sums lent on deposit or on mortgage throughout the realm as well as house and farm rents shall be reduced to three per cent 
none	none	This simultaneous reduction of all kinds of income would be not a whit more difficult to accomplish than the proposed conversion and further it would offer the advantage of forestalling at one blow all objections to it at the same time that it would insure a just assessment of the land tax 
8534_216567_000018_000002	train-clean-360	See If at the moment of conversion a piece of real estate yields an income of one thousand francs after the new law takes effect it will yield only six hundred francs 
none	none	Now allowing the tax to be an aliquot part one fourth for example of the income derived from each piece of property it is clear on the one hand that the proprietor would not in order to lighten his share of the tax underestimate the value of his property since house and farm rents being fixed by the value of the capital and the latter being measured by the tax to depreciate his real estate would be to reduce his revenue On the other hand it is equally evident that the same proprietors could not overestimate the value of their property in order to increase their incomes beyond the limits of the law since the tenants and farmers with their old leases in their hands would enter a protest Such sir must be the result sooner or later of the conversion which has been so long demanded otherwise the financial operation of which we are speaking would be a crying injustice unless intended as a stepping stone 
8534_216567_000019_000001	train-clean-360	This last motive seems the most plausible one for in spite of the clamors of interested parties and the flagrant violation of certain rights the public conscience is bound to fulfil its desire and is no more affected when charged with attacking property than when listening to the complaints of the bondholders 
8534_216567_000019_000002	train-clean-360	In this case instinctive justice belies legal justice 
none	none	Who has not heard of the inextricable confusion into which the Chamber of Deputies was thrown last year while discussing the question of colonial and native sugars 
8534_216567_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Did they leave these two industries to themselves 
8534_216567_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The native manufacturer was ruined by the colonist 
8534_216567_000020_000003	train-clean-360	To maintain the beet root the cane had to be taxed 
8534_216567_000020_000004	train-clean-360	To protect the property of the one it became necessary to violate the property of the other 
8534_216567_000020_000005	train-clean-360	The most remarkable feature of this business was precisely that to which the least attention was paid namely that in one way or another property had to be violated 
8534_216567_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax so as to preserve a balance in the market 
8534_216567_000020_000007	train-clean-360	They created a maximum PRICE for each variety of sugar and as this maximum PRICE was not the same they attacked property in two ways on the one hand interfering with the liberty of trade on the other disregarding the equality of proprietors 
8534_216567_000020_000008	train-clean-360	Did they suppress the beet root by granting an indemnity to the manufacturer 
8534_216567_000020_000009	train-clean-360	They sacrificed the property of the tax payer 
8534_216567_000020_000010	train-clean-360	Finally did they prefer to cultivate the two varieties of sugar at the nation s expense just as different varieties of tobacco are cultivated 
8534_216567_000020_000011	train-clean-360	They abolished so far as the sugar industry was concerned the right of property 
none	none	This last course being the most social would have been certainly the best but if property is the necessary basis of civilization how is this deep seated antagonism to be explained thirty seven Not satisfied with the power of dispossessing a citizen on the ground of public utility they want also to dispossess him on the ground of PRIVATE UTILITY 
8534_216567_000021_000001	train-clean-360	For a long time a revision of the law concerning mortgages was clamored for a process was demanded in behalf of all kinds of credit and in the interest of even the debtors themselves which would render the expropriation of real estate as prompt as easy and as effective as that which follows a commercial protest 
8534_216567_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The Chamber of Deputies in the early part of this year eighteen forty one discussed this project and the law was passed almost unanimously 
8534_216567_000021_000003	train-clean-360	There is nothing more just nothing more reasonable nothing more philosophical apparently than the motives which gave rise to this reform 
none	none	I Formerly the small proprietor whose obligation had arrived at maturity and who found himself unable to meet it had to employ all that he had left after being released from his debt in defraying the legal costs 
8534_216567_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Henceforth the promptness of expropriation will save him from total ruin 
none	none	two The difficulties in the way of payment arrested credit and prevented the employment of capital in agricultural enterprises This cause of distrust no longer existing capitalists will find new markets agriculture will rapidly develop and farmers will be the first to enjoy the benefit of the new law three Finally it was iniquitous and absurd that on account of a protested note a poor manufacturer should see in twenty four hours his business arrested his labor suspended his merchandise seized his machinery sold at auction and finally himself led off to prison while two years were sometimes necessary to expropriate the most miserable piece of real estate 
8534_216567_000023_000000	train-clean-360	These arguments and others besides you clearly stated sir in your first lectures of this academic year 
none	none	But when stating these excellent arguments did you ask yourself sir whither would tend such a transformation of our system of mortgages To monetize if I may say so landed property to accumulate it within portfolios to separate the laborer from the soil man from Nature to make him a wanderer over the face of the earth to eradicate from his heart every trace of family feeling national pride and love of country to isolate him more and more to render him indifferent to all around him to concentrate his love upon one object money and finally by the dishonest practices of usury to monopolize the land to the profit of a financial aristocracy a worthy auxiliary of that industrial feudality whose pernicious influence we begin to feel so bitterly Thus little by little the subordination of the laborer to the idler the restoration of abolished castes and the distinction between patrician and plebeian would be effected thus thanks to the new privileges granted to the property of the capitalists that of the small and intermediate proprietors would gradually disappear and with it the whole class of free and honest laborers 
8534_216567_000024_000002	train-clean-360	This certainly is not my plan for the abolition of property 
8534_216567_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Far from mobilizing the soil I would if possible immobilize even the functions of pure intelligence so that society might be the fulfilment of the intentions of Nature who gave us our first possession the land 
none	none	For if the instrument or capital of production is the mark of the laborer it is also his pedestal his support his country and as the Psalmist says THE PLACE OF HIS ACTIVITY AND HIS REST thirty eight Let us examine more closely still the inevitable and approaching result of the last law concerning judicial sales and mortgages 
8534_216567_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Under the system of competition which is killing us and whose necessary expression is a plundering and tyrannical government the farmer will need always capital in order to repair his losses and will be forced to contract loans 
8534_216567_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Always depending upon the future for the payment of his debts he will be deceived in his hope and surprised by maturity 
none	none	For what is there more prompt more unexpected more abbreviatory of space and time than the maturity of an obligation 
8534_216567_000025_000004	train-clean-360	I address this question to all whom this pitiless Nemesis pursues and even troubles in their dreams 
none	none	Now under the new law the expropriation of a debtor will be effected a hundred times more rapidly then also spoliation will be a hundred times surer and the free laborer will pass a hundred times sooner from his present condition to that of a serf attached to the soil Formerly the length of time required to effect the seizure curbed the usurer s avidity gave the borrower an opportunity to recover himself and gave rise to a transaction between him and his creditor which might result finally in a complete release 
8534_216567_000025_000007	train-clean-360	Now the debtor s sentence is irrevocable he has but a few days of grace 
none	none	And what advantages are promised by this law as an offset to this sword of Damocles suspended by a single hair over the head of the unfortunate husbandman The expenses of seizure will be much less it is said but will the interest on the borrowed capital be less exorbitant For after all it is interest which impoverishes the peasant and leads to his expropriation That the law may be in harmony with its principle that it may be truly inspired by that spirit of justice for which it is commended it must while facilitating expropriation lower the legal price of money Otherwise the reform concerning mortgages is but a trap set for small proprietors a legislative trick 
8534_216567_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Lower interest on money 
8534_216567_000027_000001	train-clean-360	But as we have just seen that is to limit property 
none	none	Here sir you shall make your own defence More than once in your learned lectures I have heard you deplore the precipitancy of the Chambers who without previous study and without profound knowledge of the subject voted almost unanimously to maintain the statutes and privileges of the Bank Now these privileges these statutes this vote of the Chambers mean simply this that the market price of specie at five or six per cent is not too high and that the conditions of exchange discount and circulation which generally double this interest are none too severe 
8534_216567_000027_000005	train-clean-360	So the government thinks 
none	none	M Blanqui a professor of political economy paid by the State maintains the contrary and pretends to demonstrate by decisive arguments the necessity of a reform Who then best understands the interests of property the State or M Blanqui If specie could be borrowed at half the present rate the revenues from all sorts of property would soon be reduced one half also For example when it costs less to build a house than to hire one when it is cheaper to clear a field than to procure one already cleared competition inevitably leads to a reduction of house and farm rents since the surest way to depreciate active capital is to increase its amount 
8534_216567_000028_000002	train-clean-360	But it is a law of political economy that an increase of production augments the mass of available capital consequently tends to raise wages and finally to annihilate interest 
none	none	Then proprietors are interested in maintaining the statutes and privileges of the Bank then a reform in this matter would compromise the right of increase then the peers and deputies are better informed than Professor Blanqui But these same deputies so jealous of their privileges whenever the equalizing effects of a reform are within their intellectual horizon what did they do a few days before they passed the law concerning judicial sales 
8534_216567_000029_000001	train-clean-360	They formed a conspiracy against property Their law to regulate the labor of children in factories will without doubt prevent the manufacturer from compelling a child to labor more than so many hours a day but it will not force him to increase the pay of the child nor that of its father 
none	none	To day in the interest of health we diminish the subsistence of the poor to morrow it will be necessary to protect them by fixing their MINIMUM wages 
8534_216567_000029_000003	train-clean-360	But to fix their minimum wages is to compel the proprietor is to force the master to accept his workman as an associate which interferes with freedom and makes mutual insurance obligatory 
none	none	Once entered upon this path we never shall stop 
8534_216567_000029_000005	train-clean-360	Little by little the government will become manufacturer commission merchant and retail dealer 
8534_216567_000030_000000	train-clean-360	It will be the sole proprietor 
none	none	Why at all epochs have the ministers of State been so reluctant to meddle with the question of wages Why have they always refused to interfere between the master and the workman Because they knew the touchy and jealous nature of property and regarding it as the principle of all civilization felt that to meddle with it would be to unsettle the very foundations of society Sad condition of the proprietary regime one of inability to exercise charity without violating justice thirty nine And sir this fatal consequence which necessity forces upon the State is no mere imagination 
8534_216567_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Even now the legislative power is asked no longer simply to regulate the government of factories but to create factories itself 
none	none	Listen to the millions of voices shouting on all hands for THE ORGANISATION OF LABOR THE CREATION OF NATIONAL WORKSHOPS The whole laboring class is agitated it has its journals organs and representatives To guarantee labor to the workingman to balance production with sale to harmonize industrial proprietors it advocates to day as a sovereign remedy one sole head one national wardenship one huge manufacturing company For sir all this is included in the idea of national workshops On this subject I wish to quote as proof the views of an illustrious economist a brilliant mind a progressive intellect an enthusiastic soul a true patriot and yet an official defender of the right of property forty The honorable professor of the Conservatory proposes then one 
8534_216567_000033_000001	train-clean-360	TO CHECK THE CONTINUAL EMIGRATION OF LABORERS FROM THE COUNTRY INTO THE CITIES 
8534_216567_000034_000000	train-clean-360	But to keep the peasant in his village his residence there must be made endurable to be just to all the proletaire of the country must be treated as well as the proletaire of the city 
none	none	Reform is needed then on farms as well as in factories and when the government enters the workshop the government must seize the plough 
8534_216567_000034_000002	train-clean-360	What becomes during this progressive invasion of independent cultivation exclusive domain property 
none	none	two TO FIX FOR EACH PROFESSION A MODERATE SALARY VARYING WITH TIME AND PLACE AND BASED UPON CERTAIN DATA The object of this measure would be to secure to laborers their subsistence and to proprietors their profits while obliging the latter to sacrifice from motives of prudence if for no other reason a portion of their income Now I say that this portion in the long run would swell until at last there would be an equality of enjoyment between the proletaire and the proprietor For as we have had occasion to remark several times already the interest of the capitalist in other words the increase of the idler tends on account of the power of labor the multiplication of products and exchanges to continually diminish and by constant reduction to disappear So that in the society proposed by M Blanqui equality would not be realized at first but would exist potentially since property though outwardly seeming to be industrial feudality being no longer a principle of exclusion and encroachment but only a privilege of division would not be slow thanks to the intellectual and political emancipation of the proletariat in passing into absolute equality as absolute at least as any thing can be on this earth

8534_216567_000039_000001	train-clean-360	If then production continues in the national workshops how will the crisis be terminated Undoubtedly by the general depreciation of merchandise and in the last analysis by the conversion of private workshops into national workshops

none	none	Thank Heaven equality of conditions is taught in the public schools let us fear revolutions no longer The most implacable enemy of property could not if he wished to destroy it go to work in a wiser and more effective way Courage then ministers deputies economists

8534_216567_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The tendency of society in favor of compelling proprietors to support national workshops and public manufactories is so strong that for several years under the name of ELECTORAL REFORM it has been exclusively the question of the day 
8534_216567_000041_000001	train-clean-360	What is after all this electoral reform which the people grasp at as if it were a bait and which so many ambitious persons either call for or denounce 
none	none	It is the acknowledgment of the right of the masses to a voice in the assessment of taxes and the making of the laws which laws aiming always at the protection of material interests affect in a greater or less degree all questions of taxation or wages Now the people instructed long since by their journals their dramas forty one and their songs forty two know to day that taxation to be equitably divided must be graduated and must be borne mainly by the rich that it must be levied upon luxuries c And be sure that the people once in the majority in the Chamber will not fail to apply these lessons

none	none	Do you not see that in this way property is gradually reduced as nobility was formerly to a nominal title to a distinction purely honorary in its nature Either the electoral reform will fail to accomplish that which is hoped from it and will disappoint its innumerable partisans or else it will inevitably result in a transformation of the absolute right under which we live into a right of possession that is that while at present property makes the elector after this reform is accomplished the citizen the producer will be the possessor forty three Consequently the radicals are right in saying that the electoral reform is in their eyes only a means but when they are silent as to the end they show either profound ignorance or useless dissimulation

8534_216567_000043_000004	train-clean-360	For the rest the present system is only a continuation of the municipal system which in the middle ages sprang up in connection with feudalism an oppressive mischief making system full of petty passions and base intrigues 
none	none	It would be an abuse of the reader s patience to insist further upon the tendency of our time towards equality There are moreover so many people who denounce the present age that nothing is gained by exposing to their view the popular scientific and representative tendencies of the nation Prompt to recognize the accuracy of the inferences drawn from observation they confine themselves to a general censure of the facts and an absolute denial of their legitimacy What wonder they say that this atmosphere of equality intoxicates us considering all that has been said and done during the past ten years Do you not see that society is dissolving that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away All these hopes of regeneration are but forebodings of death your songs of triumph are like the prayers of the departing your trumpet peals announce the baptism of a dying man Civilization is falling in ruin Imus imus praecipites Such people deny God I might content myself with the reply that the spirit of eighteen thirty was the result of the maintenance of the violated charter that this charter arose from the Revolution of eighty nine that eighty nine implies the States General s right of remonstrance and the enfranchisement of the communes that the communes suppose feudalism which in its turn supposes invasion Roman law Christianity c But it is necessary to look further We must penetrate to the very heart of ancient institutions plunge into the social depths and uncover this indestructible leaven of equality which the God of justice breathed into our souls and which manifests itself in all our works Labor is man s contemporary it is a duty since it is a condition of existence In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread It is more than a duty it is a mission God put the man into the garden to dress it I add that labor is the cause and means of equality Cast away upon a desert island two men one large strong and active the other weak timid and domestic The latter will die of hunger while the other a skilful hunter an expert fisherman and an indefatigable husbandman will overstock himself with provisions What greater inequality in this state of Nature so dear to the heart of Jean Jacques could be imagined But let these two men meet and associate themselves the second immediately attends to the cooking takes charge of the household affairs and sees to the provisions beds and clothes provided the stronger does not abuse his superiority by enslaving and ill treating his companion their social condition will be perfectly equal Thus through exchange of services the inequalities of Nature neutralize each other talents associate and forces balance Violence and inertia are found only among the poor and the aristocratic And in that lies the philosophy of political economy the mystery of human brotherhood Hic est sapientia Let us pass from the hypothetical state of pure Nature into civilization The proprietor of the soil who produces I will suppose with the economists by lending his instrument receives at the foundation of a society so many bushels of grain for each acre of arable land As long as labor is weak and the variety of its products small the proprietor is powerful in comparison with the laborers he has ten times one hundred times the portion of an honest man But let labor by multiplying its inventions multiply its enjoyments and wants and the proprietor if he wishes to enjoy the new products will be obliged to reduce his income every day and since the first products tend rather to depreciate than to rise in value in consequence of the continual addition of the new ones which may be regarded as supplements of the first ones it follows that the idle proprietor grows poor as fast as public prosperity increases Incomes I like to quote you sir because it is impossible to give too good an authority for these elementary principles of economy and because I cannot express them better myself incomes you have said tend to disappear as capital increases He who possesses to day an income of twenty thousand pounds is not nearly as rich as he who possessed the same amount fifty years ago The time is coming when all property will be a burden to the idle and will necessarily pass into the hands of the able and industrious forty four In order to live as a proprietor or to consume without producing it is necessary then to live upon the labor of another in other words it is necessary to kill the laborer It is upon this principle that proprietors of those varieties of capital which are of primary necessity increase their farm rents as fast as industry develops much more careful of their privileges in that respect than those economists who in order to strengthen property advocate a reduction of interest But the crime is unavailing labor and production increase soon the proprietor will be forced to labor and then property is lost The proprietor is a man who having absolute control of an instrument of production claims the right to enjoy the product of the instrument without using it himself To this end he lends it and we have just seen that from this loan the laborer derives a power of exchange which sooner or later will destroy the right of increase In the first place the proprietor is obliged to allow the laborer a portion of the product for without it the laborer could not live Soon the latter through the development of his industry finds a means of regaining the greater portion of that which he gives to the proprietor so that at last the objects of enjoyment increasing continually while the income of the idler remains the same the proprietor having exhausted his resources begins to think of going to work himself Then the victory of the producer is certain Labor commences to tip the balance towards its own side and commerce leads to equilibrium Man s instinct cannot err as in liberty exchange of functions leads inevitably to equality among men so commerce or exchange of products which is identical with exchange of functions is a new cause of equality As long as the proprietor does not labor however small his income he enjoys a privilege the laborer s welfare may be equal to his but equality of conditions does not exist But as soon as the proprietor becomes a producer since he can exchange his special product only with his tenant or his commandite sooner or later this tenant this exploited man if violence is not done him will make a profit out of the proprietor and will oblige him to restore in the exchange of their respective products the interest on his capital So that balancing one injustice by another the contracting parties will be equal Labor and exchange when liberty prevails lead then to equality of fortunes mutuality of services neutralizes privilege That is why despots in all ages and countries have assumed control of commerce they wished to prevent the labor of their subjects from becoming an obstacle to the rapacity of tyrants Up to this point all takes place in the natural order there is no premeditation no artifice The whole proceeding is governed by the laws of necessity alone Proprietors and laborers act only in obedience to their wants Thus the exercise of the right of increase the art of robbing the producer depends during this first period of civilization upon physical violence murder and war But at this point a gigantic and complicated conspiracy is hatched against the capitalists The weapon of the EXPLOITERS is met by the EXPLOITED with the instrument of commerce a marvellous invention denounced at its origin by the moralists who favored property but inspired without doubt by the genius of labor by the Minerva of the proletaires The principal cause of the evil lay in the accumulation and immobility of capital of all sorts an immobility which prevented labor enslaved and subalternized by haughty idleness from ever acquiring it The necessity was felt of dividing and mobilizing wealth of rendering it portable of making it pass from the hands of the possessor into those of the worker Labor invented MONEY Afterwards this invention was revived and developed by the BILL OF EXCHANGE and the BANK For all these things are substantially the same and proceed from the same mind The first man who conceived the idea of representing a value by a shell a precious stone or a certain weight of metal was the real inventor of the Bank What is a piece of money in fact It is a bill of exchange written upon solid and durable material and carrying with it its own redemption By this means oppressed equality was enabled to laugh at the efforts of the proprietors and the balance of justice was adjusted for the first time in the tradesman s shop The trap was cunningly set and accomplished its purpose so thoroughly that in idle hands money became only dissolving wealth a false symbol a shadow of riches An excellent economist and profound philosopher was that miser who took as his motto WHEN A GUINEA IS EXCHANGED IT EVAPORATES So it may be said When real estate is converted into money it is lost This explains the constant fact of history that the nobles the unproductive proprietors of the soil have every where been dispossessed by industrial and commercial plebeians Such was especially the case in the formation of the Italian republics born during the middle ages of the impoverishment of the seigniors I will not pursue the interesting considerations which this matter suggests I could only repeat the testimony of historians and present economical demonstrations in an altered form The greatest enemy of the landed and industrial aristocracy to day the incessant promoter of equality of fortunes is the BANKER Through him immense plains are divided mountains change their positions forests are grown upon the public squares one hemisphere produces for another and every corner of the globe has its usufructuaries By means of the Bank new wealth is continually created the use of which soon becoming indispensable to selfishness wrests the dormant capital from the hands of the jealous proprietor The banker is at once the most potent creator of wealth and the main distributor of the products of art and Nature And yet by the strangest antinomy this same banker is the most relentless collector of profits increase and usury ever inspired by the demon of property The importance of the services which he renders leads us to endure though not without complaint the taxes which he imposes Nevertheless since nothing can avoid its providential mission since nothing which exists can escape the end for which it exists the banker the modern Croesus must some day become the restorer of equality And following in your footsteps sir I have already given the reason namely that profit decreases as capital multiplies since an increase of capital calling for more laborers without whom it remains unproductive always causes an increase of wages Whence it follows that the Bank to day the suction pump of wealth is destined to become the steward of the human race The phrase EQUALITY OF FORTUNES chafes people as if it referred to a condition of the other world unknown here below There are some persons radicals as well as moderates whom the very mention of this idea fills with indignation Let then these silly aristocrats abolish mercantile societies and insurance companies which are founded by prudence for mutual assistance For all these social facts so spontaneous and free from all levelling intentions are the legitimate fruits of the instinct of equality When the legislator makes a law properly speaking he does not MAKE it he does not CREATE it he DESCRIBES it In legislating upon the moral civil and political relations of citizens he does not express an arbitrary notion he states the general idea the higher principle which governs the matter which he is considering in a word he is the proclaimer not the inventor of the law So when two or more men form among themselves by synallagmatic contract an industrial or an insurance association they recognize that their interests formerly isolated by a false spirit of selfishness and independence are firmly connected by their inner natures and by the mutuality of their relations They do not really bind themselves by an act of their private will they swear to conform henceforth to a previously existing social law hitherto disregarded by them And this is proved by the fact that these same men could they avoid association would not associate Before they can be induced to unite their interests they must acquire full knowledge of the dangers of competition and isolation hence the experience of evil is the only thing which leads them into society Now I say that to establish equality among men it is only necessary to generalize the principle upon which insurance agricultural and commercial associations are based I say that competition isolation of interests monopoly privilege accumulation of capital exclusive enjoyment subordination of functions individual production the right of profit or increase the exploitation of man by man and to sum up all these species under one head that PROPERTY is the principal cause of misery and crime And for having arrived at this offensive and anti proprietary conclusion I am an abhorred monster radicals and conservatives alike point me out as a fit subject for prosecution the academies shower their censures upon me the most worthy people regard me as mad and those are excessively tolerant who content themselves with the assertion that I am a fool Oh unhappy the writer who publishes the truth otherwise than as a performance of a duty If he has counted upon the applause of the crowd if he has supposed that avarice and self interest would forget themselves in admiration of him if he has neglected to encase himself within three thicknesses of brass he will fail as he ought in his selfish undertaking The unjust criticisms the sad disappointments the despair of his mistaken ambition will kill him But if I am no longer permitted to express my own personal opinion concerning this interesting question of social equilibrium let me at least make known the thought of my masters and develop the doctrines advocated in the name of the government It never has been my intention sir in spite of the vigorous censure which you in behalf of your academy have pronounced upon the doctrine of equality of fortunes to contradict and cope with you In listening to you I have felt my inferiority too keenly to permit me to enter upon such a discussion And then if it must be said however different your language is from mine we believe in the same principles you share all my opinions I do not mean to insinuate thereby sir that you have to use the phraseology of the schools an ESOTERIC and an EXOTERIC doctrine that secretly believing in equality you defend property only from motives of prudence and by command I am not rash enough to regard you as my colleague in my revolutionary projects and I esteem you too highly moreover to suspect you of dissimulation I only mean that the truths which methodical investigation and laborious metaphysical speculation have painfully demonstrated to me a profound acquaintance with political economy and a long experience reveal to you While I have reached my belief in equality by long reflection and almost in spite of my desires you hold yours sir with all the zeal of faith with all the spontaneity of genius That is why your course of lectures at the Conservatory is a perpetual war upon property and inequality of fortunes that is why your most learned investigations your most ingenious analyses and your innumerable observations always conclude in a formula of progress and equality that is why finally you are never more admired and applauded than at those moments of inspiration when borne upon the wings of science you ascend to those lofty truths which cause plebeian hearts to beat with enthusiasm and which chill with horror men whose intentions are evil How many times from the place where I eagerly drank in your eloquent words have I inwardly thanked Heaven for exempting you from the judgment passed by saint Paul upon the philosophers of his time They have known the truth and have not made it known How many times have I rejoiced at finding my own justification in each of your discourses No no I neither wish nor ask for any thing which you do not teach yourself I appeal to your numerous audience let it belie me if in commenting upon you I pervert your meaning A disciple of Say what in your eyes is more anti social than the custom houses or as you correctly call them the barriers erected by monopoly between nations What is more annoying more unjust or more absurd than this prohibitory system which compels us to pay forty sous in France for that which in England or Belgium would bring us but fifteen It is the custom house you once said forty five which arrests the development of civilization by preventing the specialization of industries it is the custom house which enriches a hundred monopolists by impoverishing millions of citizens it is the custom house which produces famine in the midst of abundance which makes labor sterile by prohibiting exchange and which stifles production in a mortal embrace It is the custom house which renders nations jealous of and hostile to each other four fifths of the wars of all ages were caused originally by the custom house And then at the highest pitch of your enthusiasm you shouted Yes if to put an end to this hateful system it should become necessary for me to shed the last drop of my blood I would joyfully spring into the gap asking only time enough to give thanks to God for having judged me worthy of martyrdom And at that solemn moment I said to myself Place in every department of France such a professor as that and the revolution is avoided But sir by this magnificent theory of liberty of commerce you render military glory impossible you leave nothing for diplomacy to do you even take away the desire for conquest while abolishing profit altogether What matters it indeed who restores Constantinople Alexandria and Saint Jean d Acre if the Syrians Egyptians and Turks are free to choose their masters free to exchange their products with whom they please Why should Europe get into such a turmoil over this petty Sultan and his old Pasha if it is only a question whether we or the English shall civilize the Orient shall instruct Egypt and Syria in the European arts and shall teach them to construct machines dig canals and build railroads For if to national independence free trade is added the foreign influence of these two countries is thereafter exerted only through a voluntary relationship of producer to producer or apprentice to journeyman Alone among European powers France cheerfully accepted the task of civilizing the Orient and began an invasion which was quite apostolic in its character so joyful and high minded do noble thoughts render our nation But diplomatic rivalry national selfishness English avarice and Russian ambition stood in her way To consummate a long meditated usurpation it was necessary to crush a too generous ally the robbers of the Holy Alliance formed a league against dauntless and blameless France Consequently at the news of this famous treaty there arose among us a chorus of curses upon the principle of property which at that time was acting under the hypocritical formulas of the old political system The last hour of property seemed to have struck by the side of Syria from the Alps to the ocean from the Rhine to the Pyrenees the popular conscience was aroused All France sang songs of war and the coalition turned pale at the sound of these shuddering cries War upon the autocrat who wishes to be proprietor of the old world War upon the English perjurer the devourer of India the poisoner of China the tyrant of Ireland and the eternal enemy of France War upon the allies who have conspired against liberty and equality War war war upon property By the counsel of Providence the emancipation of the nations is postponed France is to conquer not by arms but by example Universal reason does not yet understand this grand equation which commencing with the abolition of slavery and advancing over the ruins of aristocracies and thrones must end in equality of rights and fortunes but the day is not far off when the knowledge of this truth will be as common as that of equality of origin Already it seems to be understood that the Oriental question is only a question of custom houses Is it then so difficult for public opinion to generalize this idea and to comprehend finally that if the suppression of custom houses involves the abolition of national property it involves also as a consequence the abolition of individual property In fact if we suppress the custom houses the alliance of the nations is declared by that very act their solidarity is recognized and their equality proclaimed If we suppress the custom houses the principle of association will not be slow in reaching from the State to the province from the province to the city and from the city to the workshop But then what becomes of the privileges of authors and artists Of what use are the patents for invention imagination amelioration and improvement When our deputies write a law of literary property by the side of a law which opens a large breach in the custom house they contradict themselves indeed and pull down with one hand what they build up with the other Without the custom house literary property does not exist and the hopes of our starving authors are frustrated For certainly you do not expect with the good man Fourier that literary property will exercise itself in China to the profit of a French writer and that an ode of Lamartine sold by privilege all over the world will bring in millions to its author The poet s work is peculiar to the climate in which he lives every where else the reproduction of his works having no market value should be frank and free But what will it be necessary for nations to put themselves under mutual surveillance for the sake of verses statues and elixirs We shall always have then an excise a city toll rights of entrance and transit custom houses finally and then as a reaction against privilege smuggling Smuggling That word reminds me of one of the most horrible forms of property Smuggling you have said sir forty six is an offence of political creation it is the exercise of natural liberty defined as a crime in certain cases by the will of the sovereign The smuggler is a gallant man a man of spirit who gaily busies himself in procuring for his neighbor at a very low price a jewel a shawl or any other object of necessity or luxury which domestic monopoly renders excessively dear Then to a very poetical monograph of the smuggler you add this dismal conclusion that the smuggler belongs to the family of Mandrin and that the galleys should be his home But sir you have not called attention to the horrible exploitation which is carried on in this way in the name of property It is said and I give this report only as an hypothesis and an illustration for I do not believe it it is said that the present minister of finances owes his fortune to smuggling M Humann of Strasbourg sent out of France it is said enormous quantities of sugar for which he received the bounty on exportation promised by the State then smuggling this sugar back again he exported it anew receiving the bounty on exportation a second time and so on Notice sir that I do not state this as a fact I give it only as it is told not endorsing or even believing it My sole design is to fix the idea in the mind by an example If I believed that a minister had committed such a crime that is if I had personal and authentic knowledge that he had I would denounce M Humann the minister of finances to the Chamber of Deputies and would loudly demand his expulsion from the ministry But that which is undoubtedly false of M Humann is true of many others as rich and no less honorable than he Smuggling organized on a large scale by the eaters of human flesh is carried on to the profit of a few pashas at the risk and peril of their imprudent victims The inactive proprietor offers his merchandise for sale the actual smuggler risks his liberty his honor and his life If success crowns the enterprise the courageous servant gets paid for his journey the profit goes to the coward If fortune or treachery delivers the instrument of this execrable traffic into the hands of the custom house officer the master smuggler suffers a loss which a more fortunate voyage will soon repair The agent pronounced a scoundrel is thrown into prison in company with robbers while his glorious patron a juror elector deputy or minister makes laws concerning expropriation monopoly and custom houses I promised at the beginning of this letter that no attack on property should escape my pen my only object being to justify myself before the public by a general recrimination But I could not refrain from branding so odious a mode of exploitation and I trust that this short digression will be pardoned Property does not avenge I hope the injuries which smuggling suffers The conspiracy against property is general it is flagrant it takes possession of all minds and inspires all our laws it lies at the bottom of all theories Here the proletaire pursues property in the street there the legislator lays an interdict upon it now a professor of political economy or of industrial legislation forty seven paid to defend it undermines it with redoubled blows at another time an academy calls it in question forty eight or inquires as to the progress of its demolition forty nine To day there is not an idea not an opinion not a sect which does not dream of muzzling property None confess it because none are yet conscious of it there are too few minds capable of grasping spontaneously this ensemble of causes and effects of principles and consequences by which I try to demonstrate the approaching disappearance of property on the other hand the ideas that are generally formed of this right are too divergent and too loosely determined to allow an admission so soon of the contrary theory Thus in the middle and lower ranks of literature and philosophy no less than among the common people it is thought that when property is abolished no one will be able to enjoy the fruit of his labor that no one will have any thing peculiar to himself and that tyrannical communism will be established on the ruins of family and liberty chimeras which are to support for a little while longer the cause of privilege But before determining precisely the idea of property before seeking amid the contradictions of systems for the common element which must form the basis of the new right let us cast a rapid glance at the changes which at the various periods of history property has undergone The political forms of nations are the expression of their beliefs The mobility of these forms their modification and their destruction are solemn experiences which show us the value of ideas and gradually eliminate from the infinite variety of customs the absolute eternal and immutable truth Now we shall see that every political institution tends necessarily and on pain of death to equalize conditions that every where and always equality of fortunes like equality of rights has been the social aim whether the plebeian classes have endeavored to rise to political power by means of property or whether rulers already they have used political power to overthrow property We shall see in short by the progress of society that the consummation of justice lies in the extinction of individual domain For the sake of brevity I will disregard the testimony of ecclesiastical history and Christian theology this subject deserves a separate treatise and I propose hereafter to return to it Moses and Jesus Christ proscribed under the names of usury and inequality fifty all sorts of profit and increase The church itself in its purest teachings has always condemned property and when I attacked not only the authority of the church but also its infidelity to justice I did it to the glory of religion I wanted to provoke a peremptory reply and to pave the way for Christianity s triumph in spite of the innumerable attacks of which it is at present the object I hoped that an apologist would arise forthwith and taking his stand upon the Scriptures the Fathers the canons and the councils and constitutions of the Popes would demonstrate that the church always has maintained the doctrine of equality and would attribute to temporary necessity the contradictions of its discipline Such a labor would serve the cause of religion as well as that of equality We must know sooner or later whether Christianity is to be regenerated in the church or out of it and whether this church accepts the reproaches cast upon it of hatred to liberty and antipathy to progress Until then we will suspend judgment and content ourselves with placing before the clergy the teachings of history When Lycurgus undertook to make laws for Sparta in what condition did he find this republic On this point all historians agree The people and the nobles were at war The city was in a confused state and divided by two parties the party of the poor and the party of the rich Hardly escaped from the barbarism of the heroic ages society was rapidly declining The proletariat made war upon property which in its turn oppressed the proletariat What did Lycurgus do His first measure was one of general security at the very idea of which our legislators would tremble He abolished all debts then employing by turns persuasion and force he induced the nobles to renounce their privileges and re established equality Lycurgus in a word hunted property out of Lacedaemon seeing no other way to harmonize liberty equality and law I certainly should not wish France to follow the example of Sparta but it is remarkable that the most ancient of Greek legislators thoroughly acquainted with the nature and needs of the people more capable than any one else of appreciating the legitimacy of the obligations which he in the exercise of his absolute authority cancelled who had compared the legislative systems of his time and whose wisdom an oracle had proclaimed it is remarkable I say that Lycurgus should have judged the right of property incompatible with free institutions and should have thought it his duty to preface his legislation by a coup d etat which destroyed all distinctions of fortune Lycurgus understood perfectly that the luxury the love of enjoyments and the inequality of fortunes which property engenders are the bane of society unfortunately the means which he employed to preserve his republic were suggested to him by false notions of political economy and by a superficial knowledge of the human heart Accordingly property which this legislator wrongly confounded with wealth reentered the city together with the swarm of evils which he was endeavoring to banish and this time Sparta was hopelessly corrupted The introduction of wealth says M Pastoret was one of the principal causes of the misfortunes which they experienced Against these however the laws had taken extraordinary precautions the best among which was the inculcation of morals which tended to suppress desire The best of all precautions would have been the anticipation of desire by satisfaction Possession is the sovereign remedy for cupidity a remedy which would have been the less perilous to Sparta because fortunes there were almost equal and conditions were nearly alike As a general thing fasting and abstinence are bad teachers of moderation There was a law says M Pastoret again to prohibit the rich from wearing better clothing than the poor from eating more delicate food and from owning elegant furniture vases carpets fine houses c Lycurgus hoped then to maintain equality by rendering wealth useless How much wiser he would have been if in accordance with his military discipline he had organized industry and taught the people to procure by their own labor the things which he tried in vain to deprive them of In that case enjoying happy thoughts and pleasant feelings the citizen would have known no other desire than that with which the legislator endeavored to inspire him love of honor and glory the triumphs of talent and virtue Gold and all kinds of ornaments were forbidden the women Absurd After the death of Lycurgus his institutions became corrupted and four centuries before the Christian era not a vestige remained of the former simplicity Luxury and the thirst for gold were early developed among the Spartans in a degree as intense as might have been expected from their enforced poverty and their inexperience in the arts Historians have accused Pausanias Lysander Agesilaus and others of having corrupted the morals of their country by the introduction of wealth obtained in war It is a slander The morals of the Spartans necessarily grew corrupt as soon as the Lacedaemonian poverty came in contact with Persian luxury and Athenian elegance Lycurgus then made a fatal mistake in attempting to inspire generosity and modesty by enforcing vain and proud simplicity Lycurgus was not frightened at idleness A Lacedemonian happening to be in Athens where idleness was forbidden during the punishment of a citizen who had been found guilty asked to see the Athenian thus condemned for having exercised the rights of a free man It was one of the principles of Lycurguss acted upon for several centuries that free men should not follow lucrative professions The women disdained domestic labor they did not spin their wool themselves as did the other Greeks they did not then read Homer they left their slaves to make their clothing for them Pastoret History of Legislation Could any thing be more contradictory Lycurgus proscribed property among the citizens and founded the means of subsistence on the worst form of property on property obtained by force What wonder after that that a lazy city where no industry was carried on became a den of avarice The Spartans succumbed the more easily to the allurements of luxury and Asiatic voluptuousness being placed entirely at their mercy by their own coarseness The same thing happened to the Romans when military success took them out of Italy a thing which the author of the prosopopoeia of Fabricius could not explain It is not the cultivation of the arts which corrupts morals but their degradation induced by inactive and luxurious opulence The instinct of property is to make the industry of Daedalus as well as the talent of Phidias subservient to its own fantastic whims and disgraceful pleasures Property not wealth ruined the Spartans When Solon appeared the anarchy caused by property was at its height in the Athenian republic The inhabitants of Attica were divided among themselves as to the form of government Those who lived on the mountains the poor preferred the popular form those of the plain the middle class the oligarchs those by the sea coast a mixture of oligarchy and democracy Other dissensions were arising from the inequality of fortunes The mutual antagonism of the rich and poor had become so violent that the one man power seemed the only safe guard against the revolution with which the republic was threatened Pastoret History of Legislation Quarrels between the rich and the poor which seldom occur in monarchies because a well established power suppresses dissensions seem to be the life of popular governments Aristotle had noticed this The oppression of wealth submitted to agrarian laws or to excessive taxation the hatred of the lower classes for the upper class which is exposed always to libellous charges made in hopes of confiscation these were the features of the Athenian government which were especially revolting to Aristotle and which caused him to favor a limited monarchy Aristotle if he had lived in our day would have supported the constitutional government But with all deference to the Stagirite a government which sacrifices the life of the proletaire to that of the proprietor is quite as irrational as one which supports the former by robbing the latter neither of them deserve the support of a free man much less of a philosopher Solon followed the example of Lycurgus He celebrated his legislative inauguration by the abolition of debts that is by bankruptcy In other words Solon wound up the governmental machine for a longer or shorter time depending upon the rate of interest Consequently when the spring relaxed and the chain became unwound the republic had either to perish or to recover itself by a second bankruptcy This singular policy was pursued by all the ancients After the captivity of Babylon Nehemiah the chief of the Jewish nation abolished debts Lycurgus abolished debts Solon abolished debts the Roman people after the expulsion of the kings until the accession of the Caesars struggled with the Senate for the abolition of debts Afterwards towards the end of the republic and long after the establishment of the empire agriculture being abandoned and the provinces becoming depopulated in consequence of the excessive rates of interest the emperors freely granted the lands to whoever would cultivate them that is they abolished debts No one except Lycurgus who went to the other extreme ever perceived that the great point was not to release debtors by a coup d etat but to prevent the contraction of debts in future On the contrary the most democratic governments were always exclusively based upon individual property so that the social element of all these republics was war between the citizens Solon decreed that a census should be taken of all fortunes regulated political rights by the result granted to the larger proprietors more influence established the balance of powers in a word inserted in the constitution the most active leaven of discord as if instead of a legislator chosen by the people he had been their greatest enemy Is it not indeed the height of imprudence to grant equality of political rights to men of unequal conditions If a manufacturer uniting all his workmen in a joint stock company should give to each of them a consultative and deliberative voice that is should make all of them masters would this equality of mastership secure continued inequality of wages That is the whole political system of Solon reduced to its simplest expression In giving property a just preponderance says M Pastoret Solon repaired as far as he was able his first official act the abolition of debts He thought he owed it to public peace to make this great sacrifice of acquired rights and natural equity But the violation of individual property and written contracts is a bad preface to a public code In fact such violations are always cruelly punished In eighty nine and ninety three the possessions of the nobility and the clergy were confiscated the clever proletaires were enriched and to day the latter having become aristocrats are making us pay dearly for our fathers robbery What therefore is to be done now It is not for us to violate right but to restore it Now it would be a violation of justice to dispossess some and endow others and then stop there We must gradually lower the rate of interest organize industry associate laborers and their functions and take a census of the large fortunes not for the purpose of granting privileges but that we may effect their redemption by settling a life annuity upon their proprietors We must apply on a large scale the principle of collective production give the State eminent domain over all capital make each producer responsible abolish the custom house and transform every profession and trade into a public function Thereby large fortunes will vanish without confiscation or violence individual possession will establish itself without communism under the inspection of the republic and equality of conditions will no longer depend simply on the will of citizens Of the authors who have written upon the Romans Bossuet and Montesquieu occupy prominent positions in the first rank the first being generally regarded as the father of the philosophy of history and the second as the most profound writer upon law and politics Nevertheless it could be shown that these two great writers each of them imbued with the prejudices of their century and their cloth have left the question of the causes of the rise and fall of the Romans precisely where they found it Bossuet is admirable as long as he confines himself to description witness among other passages the picture which he has given us of Greece before the Persian War and which seems to have inspired Telemachus the parallel between Athens and Sparta drawn twenty times since Bossuet the description of the character and morals of the ancient Romans and finally the sublime peroration which ends the Discourse on Universal History But when the famous historian deals with causes his philosophy is at fault The tribunes always favored the division of captured lands or the proceeds of their sale among the citizens The Senate steadfastly opposed those laws which were damaging to the State and wanted the price of lands to be awarded to the public treasury Thus according to Bossuet the first and greatest wrong of civil wars was inflicted upon the people who dying of hunger demanded that the lands which they had shed their blood to conquer should be given to them for cultivation The patricians who bought them to deliver to their slaves had more regard for justice and the public interests How little affects the opinions of men If the roles of Cicero and the Gracchi had been inverted Bossuet whose sympathies were aroused by the eloquence of the great orator more than by the clamors of the tribunes would have viewed the agrarian laws in quite a different light He then would have understood that the interest of the treasury was only a pretext that when the captured lands were put up at auction the patricians hastened to buy them in order to profit by the revenues from them certain moreover that the price paid would come back to them sooner or later in exchange either for supplies furnished by them to the republic or for the subsistence of the multitude who could buy only of them and whose services at one time and poverty at another were rewarded by the State For a State does not hoard on the contrary the public funds always return to the people If then a certain number of men are the sole dealers in articles of primary necessity it follows that the public treasury in passing and repassing through their hands deposits and accumulates real property there When Menenius related to the people his fable of the limbs and the stomach if any one had remarked to this story teller that the stomach freely gives to the limbs the nourishment which it freely receives but that the patricians gave to the plebeians only for cash and lent to them only at usury he undoubtedly would have silenced the wily senator and saved the people from a great imposition The Conscript Fathers were fathers only of their own line As for the common people they were regarded as an impure race exploitable taxable and workable at the discretion and mercy of their masters As a general thing Bossuet shows little regard for the people His monarchical and theological instincts know nothing but authority obedience and alms giving under the name of charity This unfortunate disposition constantly leads him to mistake symptoms for causes and his depth which is so much admired is borrowed from his authors and amounts to very little after all When he says for instance that the dissensions in the republic and finally its fall were caused by the jealousies of its citizens and their love of liberty carried to an extreme and intolerable extent are we not tempted to ask him what caused those JEALOUSIES what inspired the people with that LOVE OF LIBERTY EXTREME AND INTOLERABLE It would be useless to reply The corruption of morals the disregard for the ancient poverty the debaucheries luxury and class jealousies the seditious character of the Gracchi c Why did the morals become corrupt and whence arose those eternal dissensions between the patricians and the plebeians In Rome as in all other places the dissension between the rich and the poor was not caused directly by the desire for wealth people as a general thing do not covet that which they deem it illegitimate to acquire but by a natural instinct of the plebeians which led them to seek the cause of their adversity in the constitution of the republic So we are doing to day instead of altering our public economy we demand an electoral reform The Roman people wished to return to the social compact they asked for reforms and demanded a revision of the laws and a creation of new magistracies The patricians who had nothing to complain of opposed every innovation Wealth always has been conservative Nevertheless the people overcame the resistance of the Senate the electoral right was greatly extended the privileges of the plebeians were increased they had their representatives their tribunes and their consuls but notwithstanding these reforms the republic could not be saved When all political expedients had been exhausted when civil war had depleted the population when the Caesars had thrown their bloody mantle over the cancer which was consuming the empire inasmuch as accumulated property always was respected and since the fire never stopped the nation had to perish in the flames The imperial power was a compromise which protected the property of the rich and nourished the proletaires with wheat from Africa and Sicily a double error which destroyed the aristocrats by plethora and the commoners by famine At last there was but one real proprietor left the emperor whose dependent flatterer parasite or slave each citizen became and when this proprietor was ruined those who gathered the crumbs from under his table and laughed when he cracked his jokes perished also Montesquieu succeeded no better than Bossuet in fathoming the causes of the Roman decline indeed it may be said that the president has only developed the ideas of the bishop If the Romans had been more moderate in their conquests more just to their allies more humane to the vanquished if the nobles had been less covetous the emperors less lawless the people less violent and all classes less corrupt if c perhaps the dignity of the empire might have been preserved and Rome might have retained the sceptre of the world That is all that can be gathered from the teachings of Montesquieu But the truth of history does not lie there the destinies of the world are not dependent upon such trivial causes The passions of men like the contingencies of time and the varieties of climate serve to maintain the forces which move humanity and produce all historical changes but they do not explain them The grain of sand of which Pascal speaks would have caused the death of one man only had not prior action ordered the events of which this death was the precursor Montesquieu has read extensively he knows Roman history thoroughly is perfectly well acquainted with the people of whom he speaks and sees very clearly why they were able to conquer their rivals and govern the world While reading him we admire the Romans but we do not like them we witness their triumphs without pleasure and we watch their fall without sorrow Montesquieu s work like the works of all French writers is skilfully composed spirited witty and filled with wise observations He pleases interests instructs but leads to little reflection he does not conquer by depth of thought he does not exalt the mind by elevated reason or earnest feeling In vain should we search his writings for knowledge of antiquity the character of primitive society or a description of the heroic ages whose morals and prejudices lived until the last days of the republic Vico painting the Romans with their horrible traits represents them as excusable because he shows that all their conduct was governed by preexisting ideas and customs and that they were informed so to speak by a superior genius of which they were unconscious in Montesquieu the Roman atrocity revolts but is not explained Therefore as a writer Montesquieu brings greater credit upon French literature as a philosopher Vico bears away the palm Originally property in Rome was national not private Numa was the first to establish individual property by distributing the lands captured by Romulus What was the dividend of this distribution effected by Numa What conditions were imposed upon individuals what powers reserved to the State None whatever Inequality of fortunes absolute abdication by the republic of its right of eminent domain over the property of citizens such were the first results of the division of Numa who justly may be regarded as the originator of Roman revolutions He it was who instituted the worship of the god Terminus the guardian of private possession and one of the most ancient gods of Italy It was Numa who placed property under the protection of Jupiter who in imitation of the Etrurians wished to make priests of the land surveyors who invented a liturgy for cadastral operations and ceremonies of consecration for the marking of boundaries who in short made a religion of property fifty one All these fancies would have been more beneficial than dangerous if the holy king had not forgotten one essential thing namely to fix the amount that each citizen could possess and on what conditions he could possess it For since it is the essence of property to continually increase by accession and profit and since the lender will take advantage of every opportunity to apply this principle inherent in property it follows that properties tend by means of their natural energy and the religious respect which protects them to absorb each other and fortunes to increase or diminish to an indefinite extent a process which necessarily results in the ruin of the people and the fall of the republic Roman history is but the development of this law Scarcely had the Tarquins been banished from Rome and the monarchy abolished when quarrels commenced between the orders In the year four hundred ninety four B C the secession of the commonalty to the Mons Sacer led to the establishment of the tribunate Of what did the plebeians complain That they were poor exhausted by the interest which they paid to the proprietors foeneratoribus that the republic administered for the benefit of the nobles did nothing for the people that delivered over to the mercy of their creditors who could sell them and their children and having neither hearth nor home they were refused the means of subsistence while the rate of interest was kept at its highest point c For five centuries the sole policy of the Senate was to evade these just complaints and notwithstanding the energy of the tribunes notwithstanding the eloquence of the Gracchi the violence of Marius and the triumph of Caesar this execrable policy succeeded only too well The Senate always temporized the measures proposed by the tribunes might be good but they were inopportune It admitted that something should be done but first it was necessary that the people should resume the performance of their duties because the Senate could not yield to violence and force must be employed only by the law If the people out of respect for legality took this beautiful advice the Senate conjured up a difficulty the reform was postponed and that was the end of it On the contrary if the demands of the proletaires became too pressing it declared a foreign war and neighboring nations were deprived of their liberty to maintain the Roman aristocracy But the toils of war were only a halt for the plebeians in their onward march towards pauperism The lands confiscated from the conquered nations were immediately added to the domain of the State to the ager publicus and as such cultivated for the benefit of the treasury or as was more often the case they were sold at auction None of them were granted to the proletaires who unlike the patricians and knights were not supplied by the victory with the means of buying them War never enriched the soldier the extensive plundering has been done always by the generals The vans of Augereau and of twenty others are famous in our armies but no one ever heard of a private getting rich Nothing was more common in Rome than charges of peculation extortion embezzlement and brigandage carried on in the provinces at the head of armies and in other public capacities All these charges were quieted by intrigue bribery of the judges or desistance of the accuser The culprit was allowed always in the end to enjoy his spoils in peace his son was only the more respected on account of his father s crimes And in fact it could not be otherwise What would become of us if every deputy peer or public functionary should be called upon to show his title to his fortune The patricians arrogated the exclusive enjoyment of the ager publicus and like the feudal seigniors granted some portions of their lands to their dependants a wholly precarious concession revocable at the will of the grantor The plebeians on the contrary were entitled to the enjoyment of only a little pasture land left to them in common an utterly unjust state of things since in consequence of it taxation census weighed more heavily upon the poor than upon the rich The patrician in fact always exempted himself from the tithe which he owed as the price and as the acknowledgment of the concession of domain and on the other hand paid no taxes on his POSSESSIONS if as there is good reason to believe only citizens property was taxed Laboulaye History of Property In order thoroughly to understand the preceding quotation we must know that the estates of CITIZENS that is estates independent of the public domain whether they were obtained in the division of Numa or had since been sold by the questors were alone regarded as PROPERTY upon these a tax or cense was imposed On the contrary the estates obtained by concessions of the public domain of the ager publicus for which a light rent was paid were called POSSESSIONS Thus among the Romans there was a RIGHT OF PROPERTY and a RIGHT OF POSSESSION regulating the administration of all estates Now what did the proletaires wish That the jus possessionis the simple right of possession should be extended to them at the expense as is evident not of private property but of the public domain agri publici The proletaires in short demanded that they should be tenants of the land which they had conquered This demand the patricians in their avarice never would accede to Buying as much of this land as they could they afterwards found means of obtaining the rest as POSSESSIONS Upon this land they employed their slaves The people who could not buy on account of the competition of the rich nor hire because cultivating with their own hands they could not promise a rent equal to the revenue which the land would yield when cultivated by slaves were always deprived of possession and property Civil wars relieved to some extent the sufferings of the multitude The people enrolled themselves under the banners of the ambitious in order to obtain by force that which the law refused them property A colony was the reward of a victorious legion But it was no longer the ager publicus only it was all Italy that lay at the mercy of the legions The ager publicus disappeared almost entirely but the cause of the evil accumulated property became more potent than ever Laboulaye History of Property The author whom I quote does not tell us why this division of territory which followed civil wars did not arrest the encroachments of accumulated property the omission is easily supplied Land is not the only requisite for cultivation a working stock is also necessary animals tools harnesses a house an advance c Where did the colonists discharged by the dictator who rewarded them obtain these things From the purse of the usurers that is of the patricians to whom all these lands finally returned in consequence of the rapid increase of usury and the seizure of estates Sallust in his account of the conspiracy of Catiline tells us of this fact The conspirators were old soldiers of Sylla who as a reward for their services had received from him lands in Cisalpine Gaul Tuscany and other parts of the peninsula Less than twenty years had elapsed since these colonists free of debt had left the service and commenced farming and already they were crippled by usury and almost ruined The poverty caused by the exactions of creditors was the life of this conspiracy which well nigh inflamed all Italy and which with a worthier chief and fairer means possibly would have succeeded In Rome the mass of the people were favorable to the conspirators cuncta plebes Catilinae incepta probabat the allies were weary of the patricians robberies deputies from the Allobroges the Savoyards had come to Rome to appeal to the Senate in behalf of their fellow citizens involved in debt in short the complaint against the large proprietors was universal We call men and gods to witness said the soldiers of Catiline who were Roman citizens with not a slave among them that we have taken arms neither against the country nor to attack any one but in defence of our lives and liberties Wretched poor most of us deprived of country all of us of fame and fortune by the violence and cruelty of usurers we have no rights no property no liberty fifty two The bad reputation of Catiline and his atrocious designs the imprudence of his accomplices the treason of several the strategy of Cicero the angry outbursts of Cato and the terror of the Senate baffled this enterprise which in furnishing a precedent for expeditions against the rich would perhaps have saved the republic and given peace to the world But Rome could not evade her destiny the end of her expiations had not come A nation never was known to anticipate its punishment by a sudden and unexpected conversion Now the long continued crimes of the Eternal City could not be atoned for by the massacre of a few hundred patricians Catiline came to stay divine vengeance therefore his conspiracy failed The encroachment of large proprietors upon small proprietors by the aid of usury farm rent and profits of all sorts was common throughout the empire The most honest citizens invested their money at high rates of interest fifty three Cato Cicero Brutus all the stoics so noted for their frugality viri frugi Seneca the teacher of virtue levied enormous taxes in the provinces under the name of usury and it is something remarkable that the last defenders of the republic the proud Pompeys were all usurious aristocrats and oppressors of the poor But the battle of Pharsalus having killed men only without touching institutions the encroachments of the large domains became every day more active Ever since the birth of Christianity the Fathers have opposed this invasion with all their might Their writings are filled with burning curses upon this crime of usury of which Christians are not always innocent saint Cyprian complains of certain bishops of his time who absorbed in disgraceful stock jobbing operations abandoned their churches and went about the provinces appropriating lands by artifice and fraud while lending money and piling up interests upon interests fifty four Why in the midst of this passion for accumulation did not the possession of the public land like private property become concentrated in a few hands By law the domain of the State was inalienable and consequently possession was always revocable but the edict of the praetor continued it indefinitely so that finally the possessions of the patricians were transformed into absolute property though the name possessions was still applied to them This conversion instigated by senatorial avarice owed its accomplishment to the most deplorable and indiscreet policy If in the time of Tiberius Gracchus who wished to limit each citizen s possession of the ager publicus to five hundred acres the amount of this possession had been fixed at as much as one family could cultivate and granted on the express condition that the possessor should cultivate it himself and should lease it to no one the empire never would have been desolated by large estates and possession instead of increasing property would have absorbed it On what then depended the establishment and maintenance of equality in conditions and fortunes On a more equitable division of the ager publicus a wiser distribution of the right of possession I insist upon this point which is of the utmost importance because it gives us an opportunity to examine the history of this individual possession of which I said so much in my first memoir and which so few of my readers seem to have understood The Roman republic having as it did the power to dispose absolutely of its territory and to impose conditions upon possessors was nearer to liberty and equality than any nation has been since If the Senate had been intelligent and just if at the time of the retreat to the Mons Sacer instead of the ridiculous farce enacted by Menenius Agrippa a solemn renunciation of the right to acquire had been made by each citizen on attaining his share of possessions the republic based upon equality of possessions and the duty of labor would not in attaining its wealth have degenerated in morals Fabricius would have enjoyed the arts without controlling artists and the conquests of the ancient Romans would have been the means of spreading civilization instead of the series of murders and robberies that they were But property having unlimited power to amass and to lease was daily increased by the addition of new possessions From the time of Nero six individuals were the sole proprietors of one half of Roman Africa In the fifth century the wealthy families had incomes of no less than two millions some possessed as many as twenty thousand slaves All the authors who have written upon the causes of the fall of the Roman republic concur M Giraud of Aix

8687_216570_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Let us now trace the revolutions in property among the Barbarians 
8687_216570_000014_000000	train-clean-360	As long as the German tribes dwelt in their forests it did not occur to them to divide and appropriate the soil

none	none	Hence says M Laboulaye the expressions sortes Burgundiorum Gothorum and hence the German words allod allodium and loos lot which are used in all modern languages to designate the gifts of chance Allodial property at least with the mass of coparceners was originally held then in equal shares for all of the prizes were equal or at least equivalent 
8687_216570_000015_000001	train-clean-360	This property like that of the Romans was wholly individual independent exclusive transferable and consequently susceptible of accumulation and invasion 
none	none	But instead of its being as was the case among the Romans the large estate which through increase and usury subordinated and absorbed the small one among the Barbarians fonder of war than of wealth more eager to dispose of persons than to appropriate things it was the warrior who through superiority of arms enslaved his adversary 
8687_216570_000015_000003	train-clean-360	The Roman wanted matter the Barbarian wanted man 
8687_216570_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Consequently in the feudal ages rents were almost nothing simply a hare a partridge a pie a few pints of wine brought by a little girl or a Maypole set up within the suzerain s reach

8687_216570_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The tenth century among others if my memory serves me rightly was called the CENTURY OF IRON 
8687_216570_000017_000003	train-clean-360	His property his life and the honor of his wife and children always in danger the small proprietor made haste to do homage to his seignior and to bestow something on the church of his freehold that he might receive protection and security 
none	none	Both facts and laws bear witness that from the sixth to the tenth century the proprietors of small freeholds were gradually plundered or reduced by the encroachments of large proprietors and counts to the condition of either vassals or tributaries 
8687_216570_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The Capitularies are full of repressive provisions but the incessant reiteration of these threats only shows the perseverance of the evil and the impotency of the government 
8687_216570_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Oppression moreover varies but little in its methods 
none	none	The complaints of the free proprietors and the groans of the plebeians at the time of the Gracchi were one and the same 
8687_216570_000018_000004	train-clean-360	It is said that whenever a poor man refused to give his estate to the bishop the curate the count the judge or the centurion these immediately sought an opportunity to ruin him 
8687_216570_000018_000005	train-clean-360	They made him serve in the army until completely ruined he was induced by fair means or foul to give up his freehold Laboulaye History of Property 
8687_216570_000019_000000	train-clean-360	How many small proprietors and manufacturers have not been ruined by large ones through chicanery law suits and competition 
none	none	Strategy violence and usury such are the proprietor s methods of plundering the laborer Thus we see property at all ages and in all its forms oscillating by virtue of its principle between two opposite terms extreme division and extreme accumulation Property at its first term is almost null 
8687_216570_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Reduced to personal exploitation it is property only potentially 
8687_216570_000021_000002	train-clean-360	At its second term it exists in its perfection then it is truly property 
none	none	When property is widely distributed society thrives progresses grows and rises quickly to the zenith of its power Thus the Jews after leaving Babylon with Esdras and Nehemiah soon became richer and more powerful than they had been under their kings Sparta was in a strong and prosperous condition during the two or three centuries which followed the death of Lycurgus The best days of Athens were those of the Persian war Rome whose inhabitants were divided from the beginning into two classes the exploiters and the exploited knew no such thing as peace 
8687_216570_000023_000000	train-clean-360	When property is concentrated society abusing itself polluted so to speak grows corrupt wears itself out how shall I express this horrible idea plunges into long continued and fatal luxury 
8687_216570_000024_000000	train-clean-360	When feudalism was established society had to die of the same disease which killed it under the Caesars I mean accumulated property 
8687_216570_000024_000001	train-clean-360	But humanity created for an immortal destiny is deathless the revolutions which disturb it are purifying crises invariably followed by more vigorous health 
8687_216570_000024_000002	train-clean-360	In the fifth century the invasion of the Barbarians partially restored the world to a state of natural equality 
8687_216570_000024_000003	train-clean-360	In the twelfth century a new spirit pervading all society gave the slave his rights and through justice breathed new life into the heart of nations It has been said and often repeated that Christianity regenerated the world 
8687_216570_000024_000004	train-clean-360	That is true but it seems to me that there is a mistake in the date 
none	none	Christianity had no influence upon Roman society when the Barbarians came that society had disappeared For such is God s curse upon property every political organization based upon the exploitation of man shall perish slave labor is death to the race of tyrants 
8687_216570_000024_000007	train-clean-360	The patrician families became extinct as the feudal families did and as all aristocracies must 
none	none	It was in the middle ages when a reactionary movement was beginning to secretly undermine accumulated property that the influence of Christianity was first exercised to its full extent 
8687_216570_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The destruction of feudalism the conversion of the serf into the commoner the emancipation of the communes and the admission of the Third Estate to political power were deeds accomplished by Christianity exclusively 
none	none	I say Christianity not ecclesiasticism for the priests and bishops were themselves large proprietors and as such often persecuted the villeins Without the Christianity of the middle ages the existence of modern society could not be explained and would not be possible The truth of this assertion is shown by the very facts which M Laboulaye quotes although this author inclines to the opposite opinion fifty seven Now we did not commence to love God and to think of our salvation until after the promulgation of the Gospel one 
8687_216570_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Slavery among the Romans The Roman slave was in the eyes of the law only a thing no more than an ox or a horse 
8687_216570_000029_000002	train-clean-360	He had neither property family nor personality he was defenceless against his master s cruelty folly or cupidity 
none	none	Sell your oxen that are past use said Cato sell your calves your lambs your wool your hides your old ploughs your old iron your old slave and your sick slave and all that is of no use to you When no market could be found for the slaves that were worn out by sickness or old age they were abandoned to starvation 
8687_216570_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Claudius was the first defender of this shameful practice 
8687_216570_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Discharge your old workman says the economist of the proprietary school turn off that sick domestic that toothless and worn out servant 
8687_216570_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Put away the unserviceable beauty to the hospital with the useless mouths 
none	none	The condition of these wretched beings improved but little under the emperors and the best that can be said of the goodness of Antoninus is that he prohibited intolerable cruelty as an ABUSE OF PROPERTY Expedit enim reipublicae ne quis re re sua male utatur says Gaius
8687_216570_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 As soon as the Church met in council it launched an anathema against the masters who had exercised over their slaves this terrible right of life and death 
none	none	Were not the slaves thanks to the right of sanctuary and to their poverty the dearest proteges of religion 
8687_216570_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Constantine who embodied in the laws the grand ideas of Christianity valued the life of a slave as highly as that of a freeman and declared the master who had intentionally brought death upon his slave guilty of murder 
none	none	Between this law and that of Antoninus there is a complete revolution in moral ideas the slave was a thing religion has made him a man Note the last words Between the law of the Gospel and that of Antoninus there is a complete revolution in moral ideas the slave was a thing religion has made him a man The moral revolution which transformed the slave into a citizen was effected then by Christianity before the Barbarians set foot upon the soil of the empire We have only to trace the progress of this MORAL revolution in the PERSONNEL of society But M Laboulaye rightly says it did not change the condition of men in a moment any more than that of things between slavery and liberty there was an abyss which could not be filled in a day the transitional step was servitude Now what was servitude 
8687_216570_000034_000001	train-clean-360	In what did it differ from Roman slavery and whence came this difference 
8687_216570_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Let the same author answer 
none	none	two Of servitude I see in the lord s manor slaves charged with domestic duties 
8687_216570_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Some are employed in the personal service of the master others are charged with household cares 
8687_216570_000035_000003	train-clean-360	The women spin the wool the men grind the grain make the bread or practise in the interest of the seignior what little they know of the industrial arts The master punishes them when he chooses kills them with impunity and sells them and theirs like so many cattle 
none	none	The slave has no personality and consequently no wehrgeld fifty nine peculiar to himself he is a thing The wehrgeld belongs to the master as a compensation for the loss of his property Whether the slave is killed or stolen the indemnity does not change for the injury is the same but the indemnity increases or diminishes according to the value of the serf 
8687_216570_000035_000006	train-clean-360	In all these particulars Germanic slavery and Roman servitude are alike 
8687_216570_000036_000000	train-clean-360	This similarity is worthy of notice 
8687_216570_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Slavery is always the same whether in a Roman villa or on a Barbarian farm 
none	none	The man like the ox and the ass is a part of the live stock a price is set upon his head he is a tool without a conscience a chattel without personality an impeccable irresponsible being who has neither rights nor duties 
8687_216570_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Why did his condition improve 
none	none	In good season when the serf began to be regarded as a man and as such the law of the Visigoths under the influence of Christian ideas punished with fine or banishment any one who maimed or killed him 
8687_216570_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Always Christianity always religion though we should like to speak of the laws only 
8687_216570_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Did the philanthropy of the Visigoths make its first appearance before or after the preaching of the Gospel 
8687_216570_000039_000002	train-clean-360	This point must be cleared up 
none	none	After the conquest the serfs were scattered over the large estates of the Barbarians each having his house his lot and his peculium in return for which he paid rent and performed service 
8687_216570_000040_000001	train-clean-360	They were rarely separated from their homes when their land was sold they and all that they had became the property of the purchaser 
8687_216570_000040_000002	train-clean-360	The law favored this realization of the serf in not allowing him to be sold out of the country 
none	none	What inspired this law destructive not only of slavery but of property itself For if the master cannot drive from his domain the slave whom he has once established there it follows that the slave is proprietor as well as the master
8687_216570_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 The Barbarians again says M Laboulaye were the first to recognize the slave s rights of family and property two rights which are incompatible with slavery 
none	none	But was this recognition the necessary result of the mode of servitude in vogue among the Germanic nations previous to their conversion to Christianity or was it the immediate effect of that spirit of justice infused with religion by which the seignior was forced to respect in the serf a soul equal to his own a brother in Jesus Christ purified by the same baptism and redeemed by the same sacrifice of the Son of God in the form of man For we must not close our eyes to the fact that though the Barbarian morals and the ignorance and carelessness of the seigniors who busied themselves mainly with wars and battles paying little or no attention to agriculture may have been great aids in the emancipation of the serfs still the vital principle of this emancipation was essentially Christian 
8687_216570_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Suppose that the Barbarians had remained Pagans in the midst of a Pagan world 
none	none	As they did not change the Gospel so they would not have changed the polytheistic customs slavery would have remained what it was they would have continued to kill the slaves who were desirous of liberty family and property whole nations would have been reduced to the condition of Helots nothing would have changed upon the terrestrial stage except the actors 
8687_216570_000043_000004	train-clean-360	The Barbarians were less selfish less imperious less dissolute and less cruel than the Romans 
none	none	Such was the nature upon which after the fall of the empire and the renovation of society Christianity was to act But this nature grounded as in former times upon slavery and war would by its own energy have produced nothing but war and slavery GRADUALLY the serfs obtained the privilege of being judged by the same standard as their masters 
8687_216570_000045_000000	train-clean-360	When how and by what title did they obtain this privilege 
8687_216570_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 GRADUALLY their duties were regulated 
8687_216570_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Whence came the regulations 
8687_216570_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Who had the authority to introduce them 
8687_216570_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 The master took a part of the labor of the serf three days for instance and left the rest to him 
8687_216570_000048_000001	train-clean-360	As for Sunday that belonged to God 
none	none	And what established Sunday if not religion Whence I infer that the same power which took it upon itself to suspend hostilities and to lighten the duties of the serf was also that which regulated the judiciary and created a sort of law for the slave 
8687_216570_000050_000000	train-clean-360	But this law itself on what did it bear what was its principle what was the philosophy of the councils and popes with reference to this matter 
8687_216570_000050_000001	train-clean-360	The reply to all these questions coming from me alone would be distrusted 
8687_216570_000050_000002	train-clean-360	The authority of M Laboulaye shall give credence to my words 
8687_216570_000050_000003	train-clean-360	This holy philosophy to which the slaves were indebted for every thing this invocation of the Gospel was an anathema against property 
8687_216570_000051_000000	train-clean-360	The proprietors of small freeholds that is the freemen of the middle class had fallen in consequence of the tyranny of the nobles into a worse condition than that of the tenants and serfs 
none	none	The expenses of war weighed less heavily upon the serf than upon the freeman and as for legal protection the seigniorial court where the serf was judged by his peers was far preferable to the cantonal assembly 
8687_216570_000051_000002	train-clean-360	It was better to have a noble for a seignior than for a judge 
none	none	So it is better to day to have a man of large capital for an associate than for a rival 
8687_216570_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The honest tenant the laborer who earns weekly a moderate but constant salary is more to be envied than the independent but small farmer or the poor licensed mechanic 
8687_216570_000053_000000	train-clean-360	At that time all were either seigniors or serfs oppressors or oppressed 
8687_216570_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Then under the protection of convents or of the seigniorial turret new societies were formed which silently spread over the soil made fertile by their hands and which derived their power from the annihilation of the free classes whom they enlisted in their behalf 
none	none	As tenants these men acquired from generation to generation sacred rights over the soil which they cultivated in the interest of lazy and pillaging masters 
8687_216570_000053_000003	train-clean-360	As fast as the social tempest abated it became necessary to respect the union and heritage of these villeins who by their labor had truly prescribed the soil for their own profit 
8687_216570_000054_000000	train-clean-360	I ask how prescription could take effect where a contrary title and possession already existed 
8687_216570_000054_000001	train-clean-360	M Laboulaye is a lawyer 
8687_216570_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Where then did he ever see the labor of the slave and the cultivation by the tenant prescribe the soil for their own profit to the detriment of a recognized master daily acting as a proprietor 
8687_216570_000054_000003	train-clean-360	Let us not disguise matters 
none	none	As fast as the tenants and the serfs grew rich they wished to be independent and free they commenced to associate unfurl their municipal banners raise belfries fortify their towns and refuse to pay their seigniorial dues 
8687_216570_000054_000005	train-clean-360	In doing these things they were perfectly right for in fact their condition was intolerable 
8687_216570_000054_000006	train-clean-360	But in law I mean in Roman and Napoleonic law their refusal to obey and pay tribute to their masters was illegitimate 
none	none	Now this imperceptible usurpation of property by the commonalty was inspired by religion 
8687_216570_000056_000000	train-clean-360	The seignior had attached the serf to the soil religion granted the serf rights over the soil 
8687_216570_000056_000001	train-clean-360	The seignior imposed duties upon the serf religion fixed their limits 
8687_216570_000056_000002	train-clean-360	The seignior could kill the serf with impunity could deprive him of his wife violate his daughter pillage his house and rob him of his savings religion checked his invasions it excommunicated the seignior 
8687_216570_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Religion was the real cause of the ruin of feudal property 
8687_216570_000056_000004	train-clean-360	Why should it not be bold enough to day to resolutely condemn capitalistic property 
8687_216570_000056_000005	train-clean-360	Since the middle ages there has been no change in social economy except in its forms its relations remain unaltered 
none	none	The only result of the emancipation of the serfs was that property changed hands or rather that new proprietors were created Sooner or later the extension of privilege far from curing the evil was to operate to the disadvantage of the plebeians Nevertheless the new social organization did not meet with the same end in all places In Lombardy for example where the people rapidly growing rich through commerce and industry soon conquered the authorities even to the exclusion of the nobles first the nobility became poor and degraded and were forced in order to live and maintain their credit to gain admission to the guilds then the ordinary subalternization of property leading to inequality of fortunes to wealth and poverty to jealousies and hatreds the cities passed rapidly from the rankest democracy under the yoke of a few ambitious leaders Such was the fate of most of the Lombardic cities Genoa Florence Bologna Milan Pisa c which afterwards changed rulers frequently but which have never since risen in favor of liberty The people can easily escape from the tyranny of despots but they do not know how to throw off the effects of their own despotism just as we avoid the assassin s steel while we succumb to a constitutional malady As soon as a nation becomes proprietor either it must perish or a foreign invasion must force it again to begin its evolutionary round fifty nine The communes once organized the kings treated them as superior vassals Now just as the under vassal had no communication with the king except through the direct vassal so also the commoners could enter no complaints except through the commune Like causes produce like effects Each commune became a small and separate State governed by a few citizens who sought to extend their authority over the others who in their turn revenged themselves upon the unfortunate inhabitants who had not the right of citizenship Feudalism in unemancipated countries and oligarchy in the communes made nearly the same ravages 
8687_216570_000059_000002	train-clean-360	There were sub associations fraternities tradesmen s associations in the communes and colleges in the universities 
none	none	The oppression was so great that it was no rare thing to see the inhabitants of a commune demanding its suppression Meyer Judicial Institutions of Europe 
8687_216570_000060_000000	train-clean-360	In France the Revolution was much more gradual 
8687_216570_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The communes in taking refuge under the protection of the kings had found them masters rather than protectors 
none	none	Their liberty had long since been lost or rather their emancipation had been suspended when feudalism received its death blow at the hand of Richelieu Then liberty halted the prince of the feudatories held sole and undivided sway 
8687_216570_000060_000004	train-clean-360	The nobles the clergy the commoners the parliaments every thing in short except a few seeming privileges were controlled by the king who like his early predecessors consumed regularly and nearly always in advance the revenues of his domain and that domain was France 
8687_216570_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Finally eighty nine arrived liberty resumed its march a century and a half had been required to wear out the last form of feudal property monarchy 
none	none	The French Revolution may be defined as the substitution of real right for personal right that is to say in the days of feudalism the value of property depended upon the standing of the proprietor while after the Revolution the regard for the man was proportional to his property Now we have seen from what has been said in the preceding pages that this recognition of the right of laborers had been the constant aim of the serfs and communes the secret motive of their efforts The movement of eighty nine was only the last stage of that long insurrection But it seems to me that we have not paid sufficient attention to the fact that the Revolution of seventeen eighty nine instigated by the same causes animated by the same spirit triumphing by the same struggles was consummated in Italy four centuries ago Italy was the first to sound the signal of war against feudalism France has followed Spain and England are beginning to move the rest still sleep If a grand example should be given to the world the day of trial would be much abridged Note the following summary of the revolutions of property from the days of the Roman Empire down to the present time one Fifth century Barbarian invasions division of the lands of the empire into independent portions or freeholds two From the fifth to the eighth century Gradual concentration of freeholds or transformation of the small freeholds into fiefs feuds tenures c Large properties small possessions Charlemagne seven hundred seventy one eight hundred fourteen decrees that all freeholds are dependent upon the king of France three From the eighth to the tenth century The relation between the crown and the superior dependents is broken the latter becoming freeholders while the smaller dependents cease to recognize the king and adhere to the nearest suzerain Feudal system four Twelfth century Movement of the serfs towards liberty emancipation of the communes five Thirteenth century Abolition of personal right and of the feudal system in Italy Italian Republics six Seventeenth century Abolition of feudalism in France during Richelieu s ministry Despotism seven seventeen eighty nine Abolition of all privileges of birth caste provinces and corporations equality of persons and of rights French democracy eight eighteen thirty The principle of concentration inherent in individual property is REMARKED Development of the idea of association The more we reflect upon this series of transformations and changes the more clearly we see that they were necessary in their principle in their manifestations and in their result It was necessary that inexperienced conquerors eager for liberty should divide the Roman Empire into a multitude of estates as free and independent as themselves It was necessary that these men who liked war even better than liberty should submit to their leaders and as the freehold represented the man that property should violate property It was necessary that under the rule of a nobility always idle when not fighting there should grow up a body of laborers who by the power of production and by the division and circulation of wealth would gradually gain control over commerce industry and a portion of the land and who having become rich would aspire to power and authority also It was necessary finally that liberty and equality of rights having been achieved and individual property still existing attended by robbery poverty social inequality and oppression there should be an inquiry into the cause of this evil and an idea of universal association formed whereby on condition of labor all interests should be protected and consolidated Evil when carried too far says a learned jurist cures itself and the political innovation which aims to increase the power of the State finally succumbs to the effects of its own work The Germans to secure their independence chose chiefs and soon they were oppressed by their kings and noblemen The monarchs surrounded themselves with volunteers in order to control the freemen and they found themselves dependent upon their proud vassals The missi dominici were sent into the provinces to maintain the power of the emperors and to protect the people from the oppressions of the noblemen and not only did they usurp the imperial power to a great extent but they dealt more severely with the inhabitants The freemen became vassals in order to get rid of military service and court duty and they were immediately involved in all the personal quarrels of their seigniors and compelled to do jury duty in their courts The kings protected the cities and the communes in the hope of freeing them from the yoke of the grand vassals and of rendering their own power more absolute and those same communes have in several European countries procured the establishment of a constitutional power are now holding royalty in check and are giving rise to a universal desire for political reform Meyer Judicial Institutions of Europe In recapitulation What was feudalism A confederation of the grand seign iors against the villeins and against the king sixty What is constitutional government A confederation of the bourgeoisie against the laborers and against the king sixty one How did feudalism end In the union of the communes and the royal authority How will the bourgeoisie aristocracy end In the union of the proletariat and the sovereign power What was the immediate result of the struggle of the communes and the king against the seigniors The monarchical unity of Louis XIV What will be the result of the struggle of the proletariat and the sovereign power combined against the bourgeoisie The absolute unity of the nation and the government It remains to be seen whether the nation one and supreme will be represented in its executive and central power by ONE by FIVE by ONE HUNDRED or ONE THOUSAND that is it remains to be seen whether the royalty of the barricades intends to maintain itself by the people or without the people and whether Louis Philippe wishes his reign to be the most famous in all history I have made this statement as brief but at the same time as accurate as I could neglecting facts and details that I might give the more attention to the economical relations of society For the study of history is like the study of the human organism just as the latter has its system its organs and its functions which can be treated separately so the former has its ensemble its instruments and its causes Of course I do not pretend that the principle of property is a complete resume of all the social forces but as in that wonderful machine which we call our body the harmony of the whole allows us to draw a general conclusion from the consideration of a single function or organ so in discussing historical causes I have been able to reason with absolute accuracy from a single order of facts certain as I was of the perfect correlation which exists between this special order and universal history As is the property of a nation so is its family its marriage its religion its civil and military organization and its legislative and judicial institutions History viewed from this standpoint is a grand and sublime psychological study Well sir in writing against property have I done more than quote the language of history I have said to modern society the daughter and heiress of all preceding societies Age guod agis complete the task which for six thousand years you have been executing under the inspiration and by the command of God hasten to finish your journey turn neither to the right nor the left but follow the road which lies before you You seek reason law unity and discipline but hereafter you can find them only by stripping off the veils of your infancy and ceasing to follow instinct as a guide Awaken your sleeping conscience open your eyes to the pure light of reflection and science behold the phantom which troubled your dreams and so long kept you in a state of unutterable anguish Know thyself O long deluded society one know thy enemy And I have denounced property We often hear the defenders of the right of domain quote in defence of their views the testimony of nations and ages We can judge from what has just been said how far this historical argument conforms to the real facts and the conclusions of science To complete this apology I must examine the various theories Neither politics nor legislation nor history can be explained and understood without a positive theory which defines their elements and discovers their laws in short without a philosophy Now the two principal schools which to this day divide the attention of the world do not satisfy this condition The first essentially PRACTICAL in its character confined to a statement of facts and buried in learning cares very little by what laws humanity develops itself To it these laws are the secret of the Almighty which no one can fathom without a commission from on high In applying the facts of history to government this school does not reason it does not anticipate it makes no comparison of the past with the present in order to predict the future In its opinion the lessons of experience teach us only to repeat old errors and its whole philosophy consists in perpetually retracing the tracks of antiquity instead of going straight ahead forever in the direction in which they point The second school may be called either FATALISTIC or PANTHEISTIC To it the movements of empires and the revolutions of humanity are the manifestations the incarnations of the Almighty The human race identified with the divine essence wheels in a circle of appearances informations and destructions which necessarily excludes the idea of absolute truth and destroys providence and liberty Corresponding to these two schools of history there are two schools of jurisprudence similarly opposed and possessed of the same peculiarities one The practical and conventional school to which the law is always a creation of the legislator an expression of his will a privilege which he condescends to grant in short a gratuitous affirmation to be regarded as judicious and legitimate no matter what it declares two The fatalistic and pantheistic school sometimes called the historical school which opposes the despotism of the first and maintains that law like literature and religion is always the expression of society its manifestation its form the external realization of its mobile spirit and its ever changing inspirations Each of these schools denying the absolute rejects thereby all positive and a priori philosophy Now it is evident that the theories of these two schools whatever view we take of them are utterly unsatisfactory for opposed they form no dilemma that is if one is false it does not follow that the other is true and united they do not constitute the truth since they disregard the absolute without which there is no truth They are respectively a THESIS and an ANTITHESIS There remains to be found then a SYNTHESIS which predicating the absolute justifies the will of the legislator explains the variations of the law annihilates the theory of the circular movement of humanity and demonstrates its progress The legists by the very nature of their studies and in spite of their obstinate prejudices have been led irresistibly to suspect that the absolute in the science of law is not as chimerical as is commonly supposed and this suspicion arose from their comparison of the various relations which legislators have been called upon to regulate M Laboulaye the laureate of the Institute begins his History of Property with these words While the law of contract which regulates only the mutual interests of men has not varied for centuries except in certain forms which relate more to the proof than to the character of the obligation the civil law of property which regulates the mutual relations of citizens has undergone several radical changes and has kept pace in its variations with all the vicissitudes of society The law of contract which holds essentially to those principles of eternal justice which are engraven upon the depths of the human heart is the immutable element of jurisprudence and in a certain sense its philosophy Property on the contrary is the variable element of jurisprudence its history its policy Marvellous There is in law and consequently in politics something variable and something invariable The invariable element is obligation the bond of justice duty the variable element is property that is the external form of law the subject matter of the contract Whence it follows that the law can modify change reform and judge property Reconcile that if you can with the idea of an eternal absolute permanent and indefectible right However M Laboulaye is in perfect accord with himself when he adds Possession of the soil rests solely upon force until society takes it in hand and espouses the cause of the possessor sixty two and a little farther The right of property is not natural but social The laws not only protect property they give it birth c Now that which the law has made the law can unmake especially since according to M Laboulaye an avowed partisan of the historical or pantheistic school the law is not absolute is not an idea but a form But why is it that property is variable and unlike obligation incapable of definition and settlement Before affirming somewhat boldly without doubt that in right there are no absolute principles the most dangerous most immoral most tyrannical in a word most anti social assertion imaginable it was proper that the right of property should be subjected to a thorough examination in order to put in evidence its variable arbitrary and contingent elements and those which are eternal legitimate and absolute then this operation performed it became easy to account for the laws and to correct all the codes Now this examination of property I claim to have made and in the fullest detail but either from the public s lack of interest in an unrecommended and unattractive pamphlet or which is more probable from the weakness of exposition and want of genius which characterize the work the First Memoir on Property passed unnoticed scarcely would a few communists having turned its leaves deign to brand it with their disapprobation You alone sir in spite of the disfavor which I showed for your economical predecessors in too severe a criticism of them you alone have judged me justly and although I cannot accept at least literally your first judgment yet it is to you alone that I appeal from a decision too equivocal to be regarded as final It not being my intention to enter at present into a discussion of principles I shall content myself with estimating from the point of view of this simple and intelligible absolute the theories of property which our generation has produced The most exact idea of property is given us by the Roman law faithfully followed in this particular by the ancient legists It is the absolute exclusive autocratic domain of a man over a thing a domain which begins by USUCAPTION is maintained by POSSESSION and finally by the aid of PRESCRIPTION finds its sanction in the civil law a domain which so identifies the man with the thing that the proprietor can say He who uses my field virtually compels me to labor for him therefore he owes me compensation I pass in silence the secondary modes by which property can be acquired tradition sale exchange inheritance c which have nothing in common with the origin of property Accordingly Pothier said THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY and not simply PROPERTY And the most learned writers on jurisprudence in imitation of the Roman praetor who recognized a RIGHT OF PROPERTY and a RIGHT OF POSSESSION have carefully distinguished between the DOMAIN and the right of USUFRUCT USE and HABITATION which reduced to its natural limits is the very expression of justice and which is in my opinion to supplant domanial property and finally form the basis of all jurisprudence But sir admire the clumsiness of systems or rather the fatality of logic While the Roman law and all the savants inspired by it teach that property in its origin is the right of first occupancy sanctioned by law the modern legists dissatisfied with this brutal definition claim that property is based upon LABOR Immediately they infer that he who no longer labors but makes another labor in his stead loses his right to the earnings of the latter It is by virtue of this principle that the serfs of the middle ages claimed a legal right to property and consequently to the enjoyment of political rights that the clergy were despoiled in eighty nine of their immense estates and were granted a pension in exchange that at the restoration the liberal deputies opposed the indemnity of one billion francs The nation said they has acquired by twenty five years of labor and possession the property which the emigrants forfeited by abandonment and long idleness why should the nobles be treated with more favor than the priests sixty three This position is quite in harmony with my principles and I heartily applaud the indignation of M Lerminier but I do not know that a proprietor was ever deprived of his property because UNWORTHY and as reasonable social and even useful as the thing may seem it is quite contrary to the uses and customs of property All usurpations not born of war have been caused and supported by labor All modern history proves this from the end of the Roman empire down to the present day And as if to give a sort of legal sanction to these usurpations the doctrine of labor subversive of property is professed at great length in the Roman law under the name of PRESCRIPTION The man who cultivates it has been said makes the land his own consequently no more property This was clearly seen by the old jurists who have not failed to denounce this novelty while on the other hand the young school hoots at the absurdity of the first occupant theory Others have presented themselves pretending to reconcile the two opinions by uniting them They have failed like all the juste milieux of the world and are laughed at for their eclecticism At present the alarm is in the camp of the old doctrine from all sides pour IN DEFENCES OF PROPERTY STUDIES REGARDING PROPERTY THEORIES OF PROPERTY each one of which giving the lie to the rest inflicts a fresh wound upon property Consider indeed the inextricable embarrassments the contradictions the absurdities the incredible nonsense in which the bold defenders of property so lightly involve themselves I choose the eclectics because those killed the others cannot survive M Troplong jurist passes for a philosopher in the eyes of the editors of Le Droit I tell the gentlemen of Le Droit that in the judgment of philosophers M Troplong is only an advocate and I prove my assertion M Troplong is a defender of progress The words of the code says he are fruitful sap with which the classic works of the eighteenth century overflow To wish to suppress them is to violate the law of progress and to forget that a science which moves is a science which grows sixty four Now the only mutable and progressive portion of law as we have already seen is that which concerns property If then you ask what reforms are to be introduced into the right of property M Troplong makes no reply what progress is to be hoped for no reply what is to be the destiny of property in case of universal association no reply what is the absolute and what the contingent what the true and what the false in property no reply M Troplong favors quiescence and in statu quo in regard to property What could be more unphilosophical in a progressive philosopher Nevertheless M Troplong has thought about these things There are he says many weak points and antiquated ideas in the doctrines of modern authors concerning property witness the works of MM Toullier and Duranton The doctrine of M Troplong promises then strong points advanced and progressive ideas Let us see let us examine Man placed in the presence of matter is conscious of a power over it which has been given to him to satisfy the needs of his being King of inanimate or unintelligent nature he feels that he has a right to modify it govern it and fit it for his use There it is the subject of property which is legitimate only when exercised over things never when over persons M Troplong is so little of a philosopher that he does not even know the import of the philosophical terms which he makes a show of using He says of matter that it is the SUBJECT of property he should have said the OBJECT M Troplong uses the language of the anatomists who apply the term SUBJECT to the human matter used in their experiments This error of our author is repeated farther on Liberty which overcomes matter the subject of property c The SUBJECT of property is man its OBJECT is matter But even this is but a slight mortification directly we shall have some crucifixions Thus according to the passage just quoted it is in the conscience and personality of man that the principle of property must be sought Is there any thing new in this doctrine Apparently it never has occurred to those who since the days of Cicero and Aristotle and earlier have maintained that THINGS BELONG TO THE FIRST OCCUPANT that occupation may be exercised by beings devoid of conscience and personality The human personality though it may be the principle or the subject of property as matter is the object is not the CONDITION Now it is this condition which we most need to know So far M Troplong tells us no more than his masters and the figures with which he adorns his style add nothing to the old idea Property then implies three terms The subject the object and the condition There is no difficulty in regard to the first two terms As to the third the condition of property down to this day for the Greek as for the Barbarian has been that of first occupancy What now would you have it progressive doctor When man lays hands for the first time upon an object without a master he performs an act which among individuals is of the greatest importance The thing thus seized and occupied participates so to speak in the personality of him who holds it It becomes sacred like himself It is impossible to take it without doing violence to his liberty or to remove it without rashly invading his person Diogenes did but express this truth of intuition when he said Stand out of my light Very good but would the prince of cynics the very personal and very haughty Diogenes have had the right to charge another cynic as rent for this same place in the sunshine a bone for twenty four hours of possession It is that which constitutes the proprietor it is that which you fail to justify In reasoning from the human personality and individuality to the right of property you unconsciously construct a syllogism in which the conclusion includes more than the premises contrary to the rules laid down by Aristotle The individuality of the human person proves INDIVIDUAL POSSESSION originally called proprietas in opposition to collective possession communio It gives birth to the distinction between THINE and MINE true signs of equality not by any means of subordination From equivocation to equivocation says M Michelet sixty five property would crawl to the end of the world man could not limit it were not he himself its limit Where they clash there will be its frontier In short individuality of being destroys the hypothesis of communism but it does not for that reason give birth to domain that domain by virtue of which the holder of a thing exercises over the person who takes his place a right of prestation and suzerainty that has always been identified with property itself Further that he whose legitimately acquired possession injures nobody cannot be nonsuited without flagrant injustice is a truth not of INTUITION as M Troplong says but of INWARD SENSATION sixty six which has nothing to do with property M Troplong admits then occupancy as a condition of property In that he is in accord with the Roman law in accord with MM Toullier and Duranton but in his opinion this condition is not the only one and it is in this particular that his doctrine goes beyond theirs But however exclusive the right arising from sole occupancy does it not become still more so when man has moulded matter by his labor when he has deposited in it a portion of himself re creating it by his industry and setting upon it the seal of his intelligence and activity Of all conquests that is the most legitimate for it is the price of labor He who should deprive a man of the thing thus remodelled thus humanized would invade the man himself and would inflict the deepest wounds upon his liberty I pass over the very beautiful explanations in which M Troplong discussing labor and industry displays the whole wealth of his eloquence M Troplong is not only a philosopher he is an orator an artist HE ABOUNDS WITH APPEALS TO THE CONSCIENCE AND THE PASSIONS I might make sad work of his rhetoric should I undertake to dissect it but I confine myself for the present to his philosophy If M Troplong had only known how to think and reflect before abandoning the original fact of occupancy and plunging into the theory of labor he would have asked himself What is it to occupy And he would have discovered that OCCUPANCY is only a generic term by which all modes of possession are expressed seizure station immanence habitation cultivation use consumption c that labor consequently is but one of a thousand forms of occupancy He would have understood finally that the right of possession which is born of labor is governed by the same general laws as that which results from the simple seizure of things What kind of a legist is he who declaims when he ought to reason who continually mistakes his metaphors for legal axioms and who does not so much as know how to obtain a universal by induction and form a category If labor is identical with occupancy the only benefit which it secures to the laborer is the right of individual possession of the object of his labor if it differs from occupancy it gives birth to a right equal only to itself that is a right which begins continues and ends with the labor of the occupant It is for this reason in the words of the law that one cannot acquire a just title to a thing by labor alone He must also hold it for a year and a day in order to be regarded as its possessor and possess it twenty or thirty years in order to become its proprietor These preliminaries established M Troplong s whole structure falls of its own weight and the inferences which he attempts to draw vanish Property once acquired by occupation and labor it naturally preserves itself not only by the same means but also by the refusal of the holder to abdicate for from the very fact that it has risen to the height of a right it is its nature to perpetuate itself and to last for an indefinite period Rights considered from an ideal point of view are imperishable and eternal and time which affects only the contingent can no more disturb them than it can injure God himself It is astonishing that our author in speaking of the IDEAL TIME and ETERNITY did not work into his sentence the DIVINE WINGS of Plato so fashionable to day in philosophical works With the exception of falsehood I hate nonsense more than any thing else in the world PROPERTY ONCE ACQUIRED Good if it is acquired but as it is not acquired it cannot be preserved RIGHTS ARE ETERNAL Yes in the sight of God like the archetypal ideas of the Platonists But on the earth rights exist only in the presence of a subject an object and a condition Take away one of these three things and rights no longer exist Thus individual possession ceases at the death of the subject upon the destruction of the object or in case of exchange or abandonment Let us admit however with M Troplong that property is an absolute and eternal right which cannot be destroyed save by the deed and at the will of the proprietor What are the consequences which immediately follow from this position To show the justice and utility of prescription M Troplong supposes the case of a bona fide possessor whom a proprietor long since forgotten or even unknown is attempting to eject from his possession At the start the error of the possessor was excusable but not irreparable Pursuing its course and growing old by degrees it has so completely clothed itself in the colors of truth it has spoken so loudly the language of right it has involved so many confiding interests that it fairly may be asked whether it would not cause greater confusion to go back to the reality than to sanction the fictions which it an error without doubt has sown on its way Well yes it must be confessed without hesitation that the remedy would prove worse than the disease and that its application would lead to the most outrageous injustice How long since utility became a principle of law When the Athenians by the advice of Aristides rejected a proposition eminently advantageous to their republic but also utterly unjust they showed finer moral perception and greater clearness of intellect than M Troplong Property is an eternal right independent of time indestructible except by the act and at the will of the proprietor and here this right is taken from the proprietor and on what ground Good God on the ground of ABSENCE Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice in giving and taking away rights When it pleases these gentlemen idleness unworthiness or absence can invalidate a right which under quite similar circumstances labor residence and virtue are inadequate to obtain Do not be astonished that legists reject the absolute Their good pleasure is law and their disordered imaginations are the real cause of the EVOLUTIONS in jurisprudence If the nominal proprietor should plead ignorance his claim would be none the more valid Indeed his ignorance might arise from inexcusable carelessness et cetera What in order to legitimate dispossession through prescription you suppose faults in the proprietor You blame his absence which may have been involuntary his neglect not knowing what caused it his carelessness a gratuitous supposition of your own It is absurd One very simple observation suffices to annihilate this theory Society which they tell us makes an exception in the interest of order in favor of the possessor as against the old proprietor owes the latter an indemnity since the privilege of prescription is nothing but expropriation for the sake of public utility But here is something stronger In society a place cannot remain vacant with impunity A new man arises in place of the old one who disappears or goes away he brings here his existence becomes entirely absorbed and devotes himself to this post which he finds abandoned Shall the deserter then dispute the honor of the victory with the soldier who fights with the sweat standing on his brow and bears the burden of the day in behalf of a cause which he deems just When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion who can tell where it will stop M Troplong admits and justifies usurpation in case of the ABSENCE of the proprietor and on a mere presumption of his CARELESSNESS But when the neglect is authenticated when the abandonment is solemnly and voluntarily set forth in a contract in the presence of a magistrate when the proprietor dares to say I cease to labor but I still claim a share of the product then the absentee s right of property is protected the usurpation of the possessor would be criminal farm rent is the reward of idleness Where is I do not say the consistency but the honesty of this law Prescription is a result of the civil law a creation of the legislator Why has not the legislator fixed the conditions differently why instead of twenty and thirty years is not a single year sufficient to prescribe why are not voluntary absence and confessed idleness as good grounds for dispossession as involuntary absence ignorance or apathy But in vain should we ask M Troplong the philosopher to tell us the ground of prescription Concerning the code M Troplong does not reason The interpreter he says must take things as they are society as it exists laws as they are made that is the only sensible starting point Well then write no more books cease to reproach your predecessors who like you have aimed only at interpretation of the law for having remained in the rear talk no more of philosophy and progress for the lie sticks in your throat M Troplong denies the reality of the right of possession he denies that possession has ever existed as a principle of society and he quotes M de Savigny who holds precisely the opposite position and whom he is content to leave unanswered At one time M Troplong asserts that possession and property are CONTEMPORANEOUS and that they exist AT THE SAME TIME which implies that the RIGHT of property is based on the FACT of possession a conclusion which is evidently absurd at another he denies that possession HAD ANY HISTORICAL EXISTENCE PRIOR TO PROPERTY an assertion which is contradicted by the customs of many nations which cultivate the land without appropriating it by the Roman law which distinguished so clearly between POSSESSION and PROPERTY and by our code itself which makes possession for twenty or thirty years the condition of property Finally M Troplong goes so far as to maintain that the Roman maxim Nihil comune habet proprietas cum possessione which contains so striking an allusion to the possession of the ager publicus and which sooner or later will be again accepted without qualification expresses in French law only a judicial axiom a simple rule forbidding the union of an action possessoire with an action petitoire an opinion as retrogressive as it is unphilosophical In treating of actions possessoires M Troplong is so unfortunate or awkward that he mutilates economy through failure to grasp its meaning Just as property he writes gave rise to the action for revendication so possession the jus possessionis was the cause of possessory interdicts There were two kinds of interdicts the interdict recuperandae possessionis and the interdict retinendae possessionis which correspond to our complainte en cas de saisine et nouvelete There is also a third adipiscendae possessionis of which the Roman law books speak in connection with the two others But in reality this interdict is not possessory for he who wishes to acquire possession by this means does not possess and has not possessed and yet acquired possession is the condition of possessory interdicts Why is not an action to acquire possession equally conceivable with an action to be reinstated in possession When the Roman plebeians demanded a division of the conquered territory when the proletaires of Lyons took for their motto Vivre en travaillant ou mourir en combattant to live working or die fighting when the most enlightened of the modern economists claim for every man the right to labor and to live they only propose this interdict adipiscendae possessionis which embarrasses M Troplong so seriously And what is my object in pleading against property if not to obtain possession How is it that M Troplong the legist the orator the philosopher does not see that logically this interdict must be admitted since it is the necessary complement of the two others and the three united form an indivisible trinity to RECOVER to MAINTAIN to ACQUIRE To break this series is to create a blank destroy the natural synthesis of things and follow the example of the geometrician who tried to conceive of a solid with only two dimensions But it is not astonishing that M Troplong rejects the third class of actions possessoires when we consider that he rejects possession itself He is so completely controlled by his prejudices in this respect that he is unconsciously led not to unite that would be horrible in his eyes but to identify the action possessoire with the action petitoire This could be easily proved were it not too tedious to plunge into these metaphysical obscurities As an interpreter of the law M Troplong is no more successful than as a philosopher One specimen of his skill in this direction and I am done with him Code of Civil Procedure Art twenty three Actions possessoires are only when commenced within the year of trouble by those who have held possession for at least a year by an irrevocable title M Troplong s comments Ought we to maintain as Duparc Poullain and Lanjuinais would have us the rule spoliatus ante omnia restituendus when an individual who is neither proprietor nor annual possessor is expelled by a third party who has no right to the estate I think not Art twenty three of the Code is general it absolutely requires that the plaintiff in actions possessoires shall have been in peaceable possession for a year at least That is the invariable principle it can in no case be modified And why should it be set aside The plaintiff had no seisin he had no privileged possession he had only a temporary occupancy insufficient to warrant in his favor the presumption of property which renders the annual possession so valuable Well this ae facto occupancy he has lost another is invested with it possession is in the hands of this new comer Now is not this a case for the application of the principle In pari causa possesser potior habetur Should not the actual possessor be preferred to the evicted possessor Can he not meet the complaint of his adversary by saying to him Prove that you were an annual possessor before me for you are the plaintiff As far as I am concerned it is not for me to tell you how I possess nor how long I have possessed Possideo quia possideo I have no other reply no other defence When you have shown that your action is admissible then we will see whether you are entitled to lift the veil which hides the origin of my possession And this is what is honored with the name of jurisprudence and philosophy the restoration of force What when I have moulded matter by my labor I quote M Troplong when I have deposited in it a portion of myself M Troplong when I have re created it by my industry and set upon it the seal of my intelligence M Troplong on the ground that I have not possessed it for a year a stranger may dispossess me and the law offers me no protection And if M Troplong is my judge M Troplong will condemn me And if I resist my adversary if for this bit of mud which I may call MY FIELD and of which they wish to rob me a war breaks out between the two competitors the legislator will gravely wait until the stronger having killed the other has had possession for a year No no Monsieur Troplong you do not understand the words of the law for I prefer to call in question your intelligence rather than the justice of the legislator You are mistaken in your application of the principle In pari causa possessor potior habetur the actuality of possession here refers to him who possessed at the time when the difficulty arose not to him who possesses at the time of the complaint And when the code prohibits the reception of actions possessoires in cases where the possession is not of a year s duration it simply means that if before a year has elapsed the holder relinquishes possession and ceases actually to occupy in propria persona he cannot avail himself of an action possessoire against his successor In a word the code treats possession of less than a year as it ought to treat all possession however long it has existed that is the condition of property ought to be not merely seisin for a year but perpetual seisin I will not pursue this analysis farther When an author bases two volumes of quibbles on foundations so uncertain it may be boldly declared that his work whatever the amount of learning displayed in it is a mess of nonsense unworthy a critic s attention At this point sir I seem to hear you reproaching me for this conceited dogmatism this lawless arrogance which respects nothing claims a monopoly of justice and good sense and assumes to put in the pillory any one who dares to maintain an opinion contrary to its own This fault they tell me more odious than any other in an author was too prominent a characteristic of my First Memoir and I should do well to correct it It is important to the success of my defence that I should vindicate myself from this reproach and since while perceiving in myself other faults of a different character I still adhere in this particular to my disputatious style it is right that I should give my reasons for my conduct I act not from inclination but from necessity I say then that I treat my authors as I do for two reasons a REASON OF RIGHT and a REASON OF INTENTION both peremptory one Reason of right When I preach equality of fortunes I do not advance an opinion more or less probable a utopia more or less ingenious an idea conceived within my brain by means of imagination only I lay down an absolute truth concerning which hesitation is impossible modesty superfluous and doubt ridiculous But do you ask what assures me that that which I utter is true What assures me sir The logical and metaphysical processes which I use the correctness of which I have demonstrated by a priori reasoning the fact that I possess an infallible method of investigation and verification with which my authors are unacquainted and finally the fact that for all matters relating to property and justice I have found a formula which explains all legislative variations and furnishes a key for all problems Now is there so much as a shadow of method in M Toullier M Troplong and this swarm of insipid commentators almost as devoid of reason and moral sense as the code itself Do you give the name of method to an alphabetical chronological analogical or merely nominal classification of subjects Do you give the name of method to these lists of paragraphs gathered under an arbitrary head these sophistical vagaries this mass of contradictory quotations and opinions this nauseous style this spasmodic rhetoric models of which are so common at the bar though seldom found elsewhere Do you take for philosophy this twaddle this intolerable pettifoggery adorned with a few scholastic trimmings No no a writer who respects himself never will consent to enter the balance with these manipulators of law misnamed JURISTS and for my part I object to a comparison two Reason of intention As far as I am permitted to divulge this secret I am a conspirator in an immense revolution terrible to charlatans and despots to all exploiters of the poor and credulous to all salaried idlers dealers in political panaceas and parables tyrants in a word of thought and of opinion I labor to stir up the reason of individuals to insurrection against the reason of authorities According to the laws of the society of which I am a member all the evils which afflict humanity arise from faith in external teachings and submission to authority And not to go outside of our own century is it not true for instance that France is plundered scoffed at and tyrannized over because she speaks in masses and not by heads The French people are penned up in three or four flocks receiving their signal from a chief responding to the voice of a leader and thinking just as he says A certain journal it is said has fifty thousand subscribers assuming six readers to every subscriber we have three hundred thousand sheep browsing and bleating at the same cratch Apply this calculation to the whole periodical press and you find that in our free and intelligent France there are two millions of creatures receiving every morning from the journals spiritual pasturage Two millions In other words the entire nation allows a score of little fellows to lead it by the nose By no means sir do I deny to journalists talent science love of truth patriotism and what you please They are very worthy and intelligent people whom I undoubtedly should wish to resemble had I the honor to know them That of which I complain and that which has made me a conspirator is that instead of enlightening us these gentlemen command us impose upon us articles of faith and that without demonstration or verification When for example I ask why these fortifications of Paris which in former times under the influence of certain prejudices and by means of a concurrence of extraordinary circumstances supposed for the sake of the argument to have existed may perhaps have served to protect us but which it is doubtful whether our descendants will ever use when I ask I say on what grounds they assimilate the future to a hypothetical past they reply that M Thiers who has a great mind has written upon this subject a report of admirable elegance and marvellous clearness At this I become angry and reply that M Thiers does not know what he is talking about Why having wanted no detached forts seven years ago do we want them to day Oh damn it they say the difference is great the first forts were too near to us with these we cannot be bombarded You cannot be bombarded but you can be blockaded and will be if you stir What to obtain blockade forts from the Parisians it has sufficed to prejudice them against bombardment forts And they thought to outwit the government Oh the sovereignty of the people Damn it M Thiers who is wiser than you says that it would be absurd to suppose a government making war upon citizens and maintaining itself by force and in spite of the will of the people That would be absurd Perhaps so such a thing has happened more than once and may happen again Besides when despotism is strong it appears almost legitimate However that may be they lied in eighteen thirty three and they lie again in eighteen forty one those who threaten us with the bomb shell And then if M Thiers is so well assured of the intentions of the government why does he not wish the forts to be built before the circuit is extended Why this air of suspicion of the government unless an intrigue has been planned between the government and M Thiers Damn it we do not wish to be again invaded If Paris had been fortified in eighteen fifteen Napoleon would not have been conquered But I tell you that Napoleon was not conquered but sold and that if in eighteen fifteen Paris had had fortifications it would have been with them as with the thirty thousand men of Grouchy who were misled during the battle It is still easier to surrender forts than to lead soldiers Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the enemy But do you not see that the absolutist courts are provoked at our fortifications a proof that they do not think as you do You believe that and for my part I believe that in reality they are quite at ease about the matter and if they appear to tease our ministers they do so only to give the latter an opportunity to decline The absolutist courts are always on better terms with our constitutional monarchy than our monarchy with us Does not M Guizot say that France needs to be defended within as well as without Within against whom Against France O Parisians it is but six months since you demanded war and now you want only barricades Why should the allies fear your doctrines when you cannot even control yourselves How could you sustain a siege when you weep over the absence of an actress But finally do you not understand that by the rules of modern warfare the capital of a country is always the objective point of its assailants Suppose our army defeated on the Rhine France invaded and defenceless Paris falling into the hands of the enemy It would be the death of the administrative power without a head it could not live The capital taken the nation must submit What do you say to that The reply is very simple Why is society constituted in such a way that the destiny of the country depends upon the safety of the capital Why in case our territory be invaded and Paris besieged cannot the legislative executive and military powers act outside of Paris Why this localization of all the vital forces of France Do not cry out upon decentralization This hackneyed reproach would discredit only your own intelligence and sincerity It is not a question of decentralization it is your political fetichism which I attack Why should the national unity be attached to a certain place to certain functionaries to certain bayonets Why should the Place Maubert and the Palace of the Tuileries be the palladium of France Now let me make an hypothesis Suppose it were written in the charter In case the country be again invaded and Paris forced to surrender the government being annihilated and the national assembly dissolved the electoral colleges shall reassemble spontaneously and without other official notice for the purpose of appointing new deputies who shall organize a provisional government at Orleans If Orleans succumbs the government shall reconstruct itself in the same way at Lyons then at Bordeaux then at Bayonne until all France be captured or the enemy driven from the land For the government may perish but the nation never dies The king the peers and the deputies massacred VIVE LA FRANCE Do you not think that such an addition to the charter would be a better safeguard for the liberty and integrity of the country than walls and bastions around Paris Well then do henceforth for administration industry science literature and art that which the charter ought to prescribe for the central government and common defence Instead of endeavoring to render Paris impregnable try rather to render the loss of Paris an insignificant matter Instead of accumulating about one point academies faculties schools and political administrative and judicial centres instead of arresting intellectual development and weakening public spirit in the provinces by this fatal agglomeration can you not without destroying unity distribute social functions among places as well as among persons Such a system in allowing each province to participate in political power and action and in balancing industry intelligence and strength in all parts of the country would equally secure against enemies at home and enemies abroad the liberty of the people and the stability of the government Discriminate then between the centralization of functions and the concentration of organs between political unity and its material symbol Oh that is plausible but it is impossible which means that the city of Paris does not intend to surrender its privileges and that there it is still a question of property Idle talk The country in a state of panic which has been cleverly worked upon has asked for fortifications I dare to affirm that it has abdicated its sovereignty All parties are to blame for this suicide the conservatives by their acquiescence in the plans of the government the friends of the dynasty because they wish no opposition to that which pleases them and because a popular revolution would annihilate them the democrats because they hope to rule in their turn sixty seven That which all rejoice at having obtained is a means of future repression As for the defence of the country they are not troubled about that The idea of tyranny dwells in the minds of all and brings together into one conspiracy all forms of selfishness We wish the regeneration of society but we subordinate this desire to our ideas and convenience That our approaching marriage may take place that our business may succeed that our opinions may triumph we postpone reform Intolerance and selfishness lead us to put fetters upon liberty and because we cannot wish all that God wishes we would if it rested with us stay the course of destiny rather than sacrifice our own interests and self love Is not this an instance where the words of Solomon apply L iniquite a menti a elle meme It is said that on this question of the fortification of Paris the staff of Le National are not agreed This would prove if proof were needed that a journal may blunder and falsify without entitling any one to accuse its editors A journal is a metaphysical being for which no one is really responsible and which owes its existence solely to mutual concessions This idea ought to frighten those worthy citizens who because they borrow their opinions from a journal imagine that they belong to a political party and who have not the faintest suspicion that they are really without a head For this reason sir I have enlisted in a desperate war against every form of authority over the multitude Advance sentinel of the proletariat I cross bayonets with the celebrities of the day as well as with spies and charlatans Well when I am fighting with an illustrious adversary must I stop at the end of every phrase like an orator in the tribune to say the learned author the eloquent writer the profound publicist and a hundred other platitudes with which it is fashionable to mock people These civilities seem to me no less insulting to the man attacked than dishonorable to the aggressor But when rebuking an author I say to him Citizen your doctrine is absurd and if to prove my assertion is an offence against you I am guilty of it immediately the listener opens his ears he is all attention and if I do not succeed in convincing him at least I give his thought an impulse and set him the wholesome example of doubt and free examination Then do not think sir that in tripping up the philosophy of your very learned and very estimable confrere M Troplong I fail to appreciate his talent as a writer in my opinion he has too much for a jurist nor his knowledge though it is too closely confined to the letter of the law and the reading of old books In these particulars M Troplong offends on the side of excess rather than deficiency Further do not believe that I am actuated by any personal animosity towards him or that I have the slightest desire to wound his self love I know M Troplong only by his Treatise on Prescription which I wish he had not written and as for my critics neither M Troplong nor any of those whose opinion I value will ever read me Once more my only object is to prove as far as I am able to this unhappy French nation that those who make the laws as well as those who interpret them are not infallible organs of general impersonal and absolute reason I had resolved to submit to a systematic criticism the semi official defence of the right of property recently put forth by M Wolowski your colleague at the Conservatory With this view I had commenced to collect the documents necessary for each of his lectures but soon perceiving that the ideas of the professor were incoherent that his arguments contradicted each other that one affirmation was sure to be overthrown by another and that in M Wolowski s lucubrations the good was always mingled with the bad and being by nature a little suspicious it suddenly occurred to me that M Wolowski was an advocate of equality in disguise thrown in spite of himself into the position in which the patriarch Jacob pictures one of his sons inter duas clitellas between two stools as the proverb says In more parliamentary language I saw clearly that M Wolowski was placed between his profound convictions on the one hand and his official duties on the other and that in order to maintain his position he had to assume a certain slant Then I experienced great pain at seeing the reserve the circumlocution the figures and the irony to which a professor of legislation whose duty it is to teach dogmas with clearness and precision was forced to resort and I fell to cursing the society in which an honest man is not allowed to say frankly what he thinks Never sir have you conceived of such torture I seemed to be witnessing the martyrdom of a mind I am going to give you an idea of these astonishing meetings or rather of these scenes of sorrow Monday Nov twenty eighteen forty The professor declares in brief one That the right of property is not founded upon occupation but upon the impress of man two That every man has a natural and inalienable right to the use of matter Now if matter can be appropriated and if notwithstanding all men retain an inalienable right to the use of this matter what is property and if matter can be appropriated only by labor how long is this appropriation to continue questions that will confuse and confound all jurists whatsoever Then M Wolowski cites his authorities Great God what witnesses he brings forward First M Troplong the great metaphysician whom we have discussed then M Louis Blanc editor of the Revue du Progres who came near being tried by jury for publishing his Organization of Labor and who escaped from the clutches of the public prosecutor only by a juggler s trick sixty eight Corinne I mean Madame de Stael who in an ode making a poetical comparison of the land with the waves of the furrow of a plough with the wake of a vessel says that property exists only where man has left his trace which makes property dependent upon the solidity of the elements Rousseau the apostle of liberty and equality but who according to M Wolowski attacked property only AS A JOKE and in order to point a paradox Robespierre who prohibited a division of the land because he regarded such a measure as a rejuvenescence of property and who while awaiting the definitive organization of the republic placed all property in the care of the people that is transferred the right of eminent domain from the individual to society Babeuf who wanted property for the nation and communism for the citizens M Considerant who favors a division of landed property into shares that is who wishes to render property nominal and fictitious the whole being intermingled with jokes and witticisms intended undoubtedly to lead people away from the HORNETS NESTS at the expense of the adversaries of the right of property November twenty six M Wolowski supposes this objection Land like water air and light is necessary to life therefore it cannot be appropriated and he replies The importance of landed property diminishes as the power of industry increases Good this importance DIMINISHES but it does not DISAPPEAR and this of itself shows landed property to be illegitimate Here M Wolowski pretends to think that the opponents of property refer only to property in land while they merely take it as a term of comparison and in showing with wonderful clearness the absurdity of the position in which he places them he finds a way of drawing the attention of his hearers to another subject without being false to the truth which it is his office to contradict Property says M Wolowski is that which distinguishes man from the animals That may be but are we to regard this as a compliment or a satire Mahomet says M Wolowski decreed property And so did Genghis Khan and Tamerlane and all the ravagers of nations What sort of legislators were they Property has been in existence ever since the origin of the human race Yes and so has slavery and despotism also and likewise polygamy and idolatry But what does this antiquity show The members of the Council of the State M Portalis at their head did not raise in their discussion of the Code the question of the legitimacy of property Their silence says M Wolowski is a precedent in favor of this right I may regard this reply as personally addressed to me since the observation belongs to me I reply As long as an opinion is universally admitted the universality of belief serves of itself as argument and proof When this same opinion is attacked the former faith proves nothing we must resort to reason Ignorance however old and pardonable it may be never outweighs reason Property has its abuses M Wolowski confesses But he says these abuses gradually disappear To day their cause is known They all arise from a false theory of property In principle property is inviolable but it can and must be checked and disciplined Such are the conclusions of the professor When one thus remains in the clouds he need not fear to equivocate Nevertheless I would like him to define these ABUSES of property to show their cause to explain this true theory from which no abuse is to spring in short to tell me how without destroying property it can be governed for the greatest good of all Our civil code says M Wolowski in speaking of this subject leaves much to be desired I think it leaves every thing undone Finally M Wolowski opposes on the one hand the concentration of capital and the absorption which results therefrom and on the other he objects to the extreme division of the land Now I think that I have demonstrated in my First Memoir that large accumulation and minute division are the first two terms of an economical trinity a THESIS and an ANTITHESIS But while M Wolowski says nothing of the third term the SYNTHESIS and thus leaves the inference in suspense I have shown that this third term is ASSOCIATION which is the annihilation of property November thirty LITERARY PROPERTY M Wolowski grants that it is just to recognize the rights of talent which is not in the least hostile to equality but he seriously objects to perpetual and absolute property in the works of genius to the profit of the authors heirs His main argument is that society has a right of collective production over every creation of the mind Now it is precisely this principle of collective power that I developed in my Inquiries into Property and Government and on which I have established the complete edifice of a new social organization M Wolowski is as far as I know the first jurist who has made a legislative application of this economical law Only while I have extended the principle of collective power to every sort of product M Wolowski more prudent than it is my nature to be confines it to neutral ground So that that which I am bold enough to say of the whole he is contented to affirm of a part leaving the intelligent hearer to fill up the void for himself However his arguments are keen and close One feels that the professor finding himself more at ease with one aspect of property has given the rein to his intellect and is rushing on towards liberty one Absolute literary property would hinder the activity of other men and obstruct the development of humanity It would be the death of progress it would be suicide What would have happened if the first inventions the plough the level the saw c had been appropriated Such is the first proposition of M Wolowski I reply Absolute property in land and tools hinders human activity and obstructs progress and the free development of man What happened in Rome and in all the ancient nations What occurred in the middle ages What do we see to day in England in consequence of absolute property in the sources of production The suicide of humanity two Real and personal property is in harmony with the social interest In consequence of literary property social and individual interests are perpetually in conflict The statement of this proposition contains a rhetorical figure common with those who do not enjoy full and complete liberty of speech This figure is the anti phrasis or contre verite It consists according to Dumarsais and the best humanists in saying one thing while meaning another M Wolowski s proposition naturally expressed would read as follows Just as real and personal property is essentially hostile to society so in consequence of literary property social and individual interests are perpetually in conflict three M de Montalembert in the Chamber of Peers vehemently protested against the assimilation of authors to inventors of machinery an assimilation which he claimed to be injurious to the former M Wolowski replies that the rights of authors without machinery would be nil that without paper mills type foundries and printing offices there could be no sale of verse and prose that many a mechanical invention the compass for instance the telescope or the steam engine is quite as valuable as a book Prior to M Montalembert M Charles Comte had laughed at the inference in favor of mechanical inventions which logical minds never fail to draw from the privileges granted to authors He says M Comte who first conceived and executed the idea of transforming a piece of wood into a pair of sabots or an animal s hide into a pair of sandals would thereby have acquired an exclusive right to make shoes for the human race Undoubtedly under the system of property For in fact this pair of sabots over which you make so merry is the creation of the shoemaker the work of his genius the expression of his thought to him it is his poem quite as much as Le Roi s amuse is M Victor Hugo s drama Justice for all alike If you refuse a patent to a perfecter of boots refuse also a privilege to a maker of rhymes four That which gives importance to a book is a fact external to the author and his work Without the intelligence of society without its development and a certain community of ideas passions and interests between it and the authors the works of the latter would be worth nothing The exchangeable value of a book is due even more to the SOCIAL CONDITION than to the talent displayed in it Indeed it seems as if I were copying my own words This proposition of M Wolowski contains a special expression of a general and absolute idea one of the strongest and most conclusive against the right of property Why do artists like mechanics find the means to live Because society has made the fine arts like the rudest industries objects of consumption and exchange governed consequently by all the laws of commerce and political economy Now the first of these laws is the equipoise of functions that is the equality of associates five M Wolowski indulges in sarcasm against the petitioners for literary property There are authors he says who crave the privileges of authors and who for that purpose point out the power of the melodrama They speak of the niece of Corneille begging at the door of a theatre which the works of her uncle had enriched To satisfy the avarice of literary people it would be necessary to create literary majorats and make a whole code of exceptions I like this virtuous irony But M Wolowski has by no means exhausted the difficulties which the question involves And first is it just that MM Cousin Guizot Villemain Damiron and company paid by the State for delivering lectures should be paid a second time through the booksellers that I who have the right to report their lectures should not have the right to print them Is it just that MM Noel and Chapsal overseers of the University should use their influence in selling their selections from literature to the youth whose studies they are instructed to superintend in consideration of a salary And if that is not just is it not proper to refuse literary property to every author holding public offices and receiving pensions or sinecures Again shall the privilege of the author extend to irreligious and immoral works calculated only to corrupt the heart and obscure the understanding To grant this privilege is to sanction immorality by law to refuse it is to censure the author And since it is impossible in the present imperfect state of society to prevent all violations of the moral law it will be necessary to open a license office for books as well as morals But then three fourths of our literary people will be obliged to register and recognized thenceforth on their own declaration as PROSTITUTES they will necessarily belong to the public We pay toll to the prostitute we do not endow her Finally shall plagiarism be classed with forgery If you reply Yes you appropriate in advance all the subjects of which books treat if you say No you leave the whole matter to the decision of the judge Except in the case of a clandestine reprint how will he distinguish forgery from quotation imitation plagiarism or even coincidence A savant spends two years in calculating a table of logarithms to nine or ten decimals He prints it A fortnight after his book is selling at half price it is impossible to tell whether this result is due to forgery or competition What shall the court do In case of doubt shall it award the property to the first occupant As well decide the question by lot These however are trifling considerations but do we see that in granting a perpetual privilege to authors and their heirs we really strike a fatal blow at their interests We think to make booksellers dependent upon authors a delusion The booksellers will unite against works and their proprietors Against works by refusing to push their sale by replacing them with poor imitations by reproducing them in a hundred indirect ways and no one knows how far the science of plagiarism and skilful imitation may be carried Against proprietors Are we ignorant of the fact that a demand for a dozen copies enables a bookseller to sell a thousand that with an edition of five hundred he can supply a kingdom for thirty years What will the poor authors do in the presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers I will tell them what they will do They will enter the employ of those whom they now treat as pirates and to secure an advantage they will become wage laborers A fit reward for ignoble avarice and insatiable pride sixty nine Contradictions of contradictions Genius is the great leveller of the world cries M de Lamartine then genius should be a proprietor Literary property is the fortune of democracy This unfortunate poet thinks himself profound when he is only puffed up His eloquence consists solely in coupling ideas which clash with each other ROUND SQUARE DARK SUN FALLEN ANGEL PRIEST and LOVE THOUGHT and POETRY GUNIUS and FORTUNE LEVELING and PROPERTY Let us tell him in reply that his mind is a dark luminary that each of his discourses is a disordered harmony and that all his successes whether in verse or prose are due to the use of the extraordinary in the treatment of the most ordinary subjects Le National in reply to the report of M Lamartine endeavors to prove that literary property is of quite a different nature from landed property as if the nature of the right of property depended on the object to which it is applied and not on the mode of its exercise and the condition of its existence But the main object of Le National is to please a class of proprietors whom an extension of the right of property vexes that is why Le National opposes literary property Will it tell us once for all whether it is for equality or against it six OBJECTION Property in occupied land passes to the heirs of the occupant Why say the authors should not the work of genius pass in like manner to the heirs of the man of genius M Wolowski s reply Because the labor of the first occupant is continued by his heirs while the heirs of an author neither change nor add to his works In landed property the continuance of labor explains the continuance of the right Yes when the labor is continued but if the labor is not continued the right ceases Thus is the right of possession founded on personal labor recognized by M Wolowski M Wolowski decides in favor of granting to authors property in their works for a certain number of years dating from the day of their first publication The succeeding lectures on patents on inventions were no less instructive although intermingled with shocking contradictions inserted with a view to make the useful truths more palatable The necessity for brevity compels me to terminate this examination here not without regret Thus of two eclectic jurists who attempt a defence of property one is entangled in a set of dogmas without principle or method and is constantly talking nonsense and the other designedly abandons the cause of property in order to present under the same name the theory of individual possession Was I wrong in claiming that confusion reigned among legists and ought I to be legally prosecuted for having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood its glory eclipsed The ordinary resources of the law no longer sufficing philosophy political economy and the framers of systems have been consulted All the oracles appealed to have been discouraging The philosophers are no clearer to day than at the time of the eclectic efflorescence nevertheless through their mystical apothegms we can distinguish the words PROGRESS UNITY ASSOCIATION SOLIDARITY FRATERNITY which are certainly not reassuring to proprietors One of these philosophers M Pierre Leroux has written two large books in which he claims to show by all religious legislative and philosophical systems that since men are responsible to each other equality of conditions is the final law of society It is true that this philosopher admits a kind of property but as he leaves us to imagine what property would become in presence of equality we may boldly class him with the opponents of the right of increase I must here declare freely in order that I may not be suspected of secret connivance which is foreign to my nature that M Leroux has my full sympathy Not that I am a believer in his quasi Pythagorean philosophy upon this subject I should have more than one observation to submit to him provided a veteran covered with stripes would not despise the remarks of a conscript not that I feel bound to this author by any special consideration for his opposition to property In my opinion M Leroux could and even ought to state his position more explicitly and logically But I like I admire in M Leroux the antagonist of our philosophical demigods the demolisher of usurped reputations the pitiless critic of every thing that is respected because of its antiquity Such is the reason for my high esteem of M Leroux such would be the principle of the only literary association which in this century of coteries I should care to form We need men who like M Leroux call in question social principles not to diffuse doubt concerning them but to make them doubly sure men who excite the mind by bold negations and make the conscience tremble by doctrines of annihilation Where is the man who does not shudder on hearing M Leroux exclaim There is neither a paradise nor a hell the wicked will not be punished nor the good rewarded Mortals cease to hope and fear you revolve in a circle of appearances humanity is an immortal tree whose branches withering one after another feed with their debris the root which is always young Where is the man who on hearing this desolate confession of faith does not demand with terror Is it then true that I am only an aggregate of elements organized by an unknown force an idea realized for a few moments a form which passes and disappears Is it true that my mind is only a harmony and my soul a vortex What is the ego what is God what is the sanction of society In former times M Leroux would have been regarded as a great culprit worthy only like Vanini of death and universal execration To day M Leroux is fulfilling a mission of salvation for which whatever he may say he will be rewarded Like those gloomy invalids who are always talking of their approaching death and who faint when the doctor s opinion confirms their pretence our materialistic society is agitated and loses countenance while listening to this startling decree of the philosopher Thou shalt die Honor then to M Leroux who has revealed to us the cowardice of the Epicureans to M Leroux who renders new philosophical solutions necessary Honor to the anti eclectic to the apostle of equality In his work on Humanity M Leroux commences by positing the necessity of property You wish to abolish property but do you not see that thereby you would annihilate man and even the name of man You wish to abolish property but could you live without a body I will not tell you that it is necessary to support this body I will tell you that this body is itself a species of property In order clearly to understand the doctrine of M Leroux it must be borne in mind that there are three necessary and primitive forms of society communism property and that which to day we properly call association M Leroux rejects in the first place communism and combats it with all his might Man is a personal and free being and therefore needs a sphere of independence and individual activity M Leroux emphasizes this in adding You wish neither family nor country nor property therefore no more fathers no more sons no more brothers Here you are related to no being in time and therefore without a name here you are alone in the midst of a billion of men who to day inhabit the earth How do you expect me to distinguish you in space in the midst of this multitude If man is indistinguishable he is nothing Now he can be distinguished individualized only through a devotion of certain things to his use such as his body his faculties and the tools which he uses Hence says M Leroux the necessity of appropriation in short property But property on what condition Here M Leroux after having condemned communism denounces in its turn the right of domain His whole doctrine can be summed up in this single proposition Man may be made by property a slave or a despot by turns That posited if we ask M Leroux to tell us under what system of property man will be neither a slave nor a despot but free just and a citizen M Leroux replies in the third volume of his work on Humanity There are three ways of destroying man s communion with his fellows and with the universe one By separating man in time two by separating him in space three by dividing the land or in general terms the instruments of production by attaching men to things by subordinating man to property by making man a proprietor This language it must be confessed savors a little too strongly of the metaphysical heights which the author frequents and of the school of M Cousin Nevertheless it can be seen clearly enough it seems to me that M Leroux opposes the exclusive appropriation of the instruments of production only he calls this non appropriation of the instruments of production a NEW METHOD of establishing property while I in accordance with all precedent call it a destruction of property In fact without the appropriation of instruments property is nothing Hitherto we have confined ourselves to pointing out and combating the despotic features of property by considering property alone We have failed to see that the despotism of property is a correlative of the division of the human race that property instead of being organized in such a way as to facilitate the unlimited communion of man with his fellows and with the universe has been on the contrary turned against this communion Let us translate this into commercial phraseology In order to destroy despotism and the inequality of conditions men must cease from competition and must associate their interests Let employer and employed now enemies and rivals become associates Now ask any manufacturer merchant or capitalist whether he would consider himself a proprietor if he were to share his revenue and profits with this mass of wage laborers whom it is proposed to make his associates Family property and country are finite things which ought to be organized with a view to the infinite For man is a finite being who aspires to the infinite To him absolute finiteness is evil The infinite is his aim the indefinite his right Few of my readers would understand these hierophantic words were I to leave them unexplained M Leroux means by this magnificent formula that humanity is a single immense society which in its collective unity represents the infinite that every nation every tribe every commune and every citizen are in different degrees fragments or finite members of the infinite society the evil in which results solely from individualism and privilege in other words from the subordination of the infinite to the finite finally that to attain humanity s end and aim each part has a right to an indefinitely progressive development All the evils which afflict the human race arise from caste The family is a blessing the family caste the nobility is an evil Country is a blessing the country caste supreme domineering conquering is an evil property individual possession is a blessing the property caste the domain of property of Pothier Toullier Troplong c is an evil Thus according to M Leroux there is property and property the one good the other bad Now as it is proper to call different things by different names if we keep the name property for the former we must call the latter robbery rapine brigandage If on the contrary we reserve the name property for the latter we must designate the former by the term POSSESSION or some other equivalent otherwise we should be troubled with an unpleasant synonymy What a blessing it would be if philosophers daring for once to say all that they think would speak the language of ordinary mortals Nations and rulers would derive much greater profit from their lectures and applying the same names to the same ideas would come perhaps to understand each other I boldly declare that in regard to property I hold no other opinion than that of M Leroux but if I should adopt the style of the philosopher and repeat after him Property is a blessing but the property caste the statu quo of property is an evil I should be extolled as a genius by all the bachelors who write for the reviews seventy If on the contrary I prefer the classic language of Rome and the civil code and say accordingly Possession is a blessing but property is robbery immediately the aforesaid bachelors raise a hue and cry against the monster and the judge threatens me Oh the power of language Le National on the other hand has laughed at M Leroux and his ideas on property charging him with TAUTOLOGY and CHILDISHNESS Le National does not wish to understand Is it necessary to remind this journal that it has no right to deride a dogmatic philosopher because it is without a doctrine itself From its foundation Le National has been a nursery of intriguers and renegades From time to time it takes care to warn its readers Instead of lamenting over all its defections the democratic sheet would do better to lay the blame on itself and confess the shallowness of its theories When will this organ of popular interests and the electoral reform cease to hire sceptics and spread doubt I will wager without going further that M Leon Durocher the critic of M Leroux is an anonymous or pseudonymous editor of some bourgeois or even aristocratic journal The economists questioned in their turn propose to associate capital and labor You know sir what that means If we follow out the doctrine we soon find that it ends in an absorption of property not by the community but by a general and indissoluble commandite so that the condition of the proprietor would differ from that of the workingman only in receiving larger wages This system with some peculiar additions and embellishments is the idea of the phalanstery But it is clear that if inequality of conditions is one of the attributes of property it is not the whole of property That which makes property a DELIGHTFUL THING as some philosopher I know not who has said is the power to dispose at will not only of one s own goods but of their specific nature to use them at pleasure to confine and enclose them to excommunicate mankind as M Pierre Leroux says in short to make such use of them as passion interest or even caprice may suggest What is the possession of money a share in an agricultural or industrial enterprise or a government bond coupon in comparison with the infinite charm of being master of one s house and grounds under one s vine and fig tree Beati possidentes says an author quoted by M Troplong Seriously can that be applied to a man of income who has no other possession under the sun than the market and in his pocket his money As well maintain that a trough is a coward A nice method of reform They never cease to condemn the thirst for gold and the growing individualism of the century and yet most inconceivable of contradictions they prepare to turn all kinds of property into one property in coin I must say something further of a theory of property lately put forth with some ado I mean the theory of M Considerant The Fourierists are not men who examine a doctrine in order to ascertain whether it conflicts with their system On the contrary it is their custom to exult and sing songs of triumph whenever an adversary passes without perceiving or noticing them These gentlemen want direct refutations in order that if they are beaten they may have at least the selfish consolation of having been spoken of Well let their wish be gratified M Considerant makes the most lofty pretensions to logic His method of procedure is always that of MAJOR MINOR AND CONCLUSION He would willingly write upon his hat Argumentator in barbara But M Considerant is too intelligent and quick witted to be a good logician as is proved by the fact that he appears to have taken the syllogism for logic The syllogism as everybody knows who is interested in philosophical curiosities is the first and perpetual sophism of the human mind the favorite tool of falsehood the stumbling block of science the advocate of crime The syllogism has produced all the evils which the fabulist so eloquently condemned and has done nothing good or useful it is as devoid of truth as of justice We might apply to it these words of Scripture Celui qui met en lui sa confiance perira Consequently the best philosophers long since condemned it so that now none but the enemies of reason wish to make the syllogism its weapon M Considerant then has built his theory of property upon a syllogism Would he be disposed to stake the system of Fourier upon his arguments as I am ready to risk the whole doctrine of equality upon my refutation of that system Such a duel would be quite in keeping with the warlike and chivalric tastes of M Considerant and the public would profit by it for one of the two adversaries falling no more would be said about him and there would be one grumbler less in the world The theory of M Considerant has this remarkable feature that in attempting to satisfy at the same time the claims of both laborers and proprietors it infringes alike upon the rights of the former and the privileges of the latter In the first place the author lays it down as a principle one That the use of the land belongs to each member of the race that it is a natural and imprescriptible right similar in all respects to the right to the air and the sunshine two That the right to labor is equally fundamental natural and imprescriptible I have shown that the recognition of this double right would be the death of property I denounce M Considerant to the proprietors But M Considerant maintains that the right to labor creates the right of property and this is the way he reasons Major Premise Every man legitimately possesses the thing which his labor his skill or in more general terms his action has created To which M Considerant adds by way of comment Indeed the land not having been created by man it follows from the fundamental principle of property that the land being given to the race in common can in no wise be the exclusive and legitimate property of such and such individuals who were not the creators of this value If I am not mistaken there is no one to whom this proposition at first sight and in its entirety does not seem utterly irrefutable Reader distrust the syllogism First I observe that the words LEGITIMATELY POSSESSES signify to the author s mind is LEGITIMATE PROPRIETOR otherwise the argument being intended to prove the legitimacy of property would have no meaning I might here raise the question of the difference between property and possession and call upon M Considerant before going further to define the one and the other but I pass on This first proposition is doubly false one In that it asserts the act of CREATION to be the only basis of property two In that it regards this act as sufficient in all cases to authorize the right of property And in the first place if man may be proprietor of the game which he does not create but which he KILLS of the fruits which he does not create but which he GATHERS of the vegetables which he does not create but which he PLANTS of the animals which he does not create but which he REARS it is conceivable that men may in like manner become proprietors of the land which they do not create but which they clear and fertilize The act of creation then is not NECESSARY to the acquisition of the right of property I say further that this act alone is not always sufficient and I prove it by the second premise of M Considerant Minor Premise Suppose that on an isolated island on the soil of a nation or over the whole face of the earth the extent of the scene of action does not affect our judgment of the facts a generation of human beings devotes itself for the first time to industry agriculture manufactures c This generation by its labor intelligence and activity creates products develops values which did not exist on the uncultivated land Is it not perfectly clear that the property of this industrious generation will stand on a basis of right if the value or wealth produced by the activity of all be distributed among the producers according to each one s assistance in the creation of the general wealth That is unquestionable That is quite questionable For this value or wealth PRODUCED BY THE ACTIVITY OF ALL is by the very fact of its creation COLLECTIVE wealth the use of which like that of the land may be divided but which as property remains UNDIVIDED And why this undivided ownership Because the society which creates is itself indivisible a permanent unit incapable of reduction to fractions And it is this unity of society which makes the land common property and which as M Considerant says renders its use imprescriptible in the case of every individual Suppose indeed that at a given time the soil should be equally divided the very next moment this division if it allowed the right of property would become illegitimate Should there be the slightest irregularity in the method of transfer men members of society imprescriptible possessors of the land might be deprived at one blow of property possession and the means of production In short property in capital is indivisible and consequently inalienable not necessarily when the capital is UNCREATED but when it is COMMON or COLLECTIVE I confirm this theory against M Considerant by the third term of his syllogism Conclusion The results of the labor performed by this generation are divisible into two classes between which it is important clearly to distinguish The first class includes the products of the soil which belong to this first generation in its usufructuary capacity augmented improved and refined by its labor and industry These products consist either of objects of consumption or instruments of labor It is clear that these products are the legitimate property of those who have created them by their activity Second class Not only has this generation created the products just mentioned objects of consumption and instruments of labor but it has also added to the original value of the soil by cultivation by the erection of buildings by all the labor producing permanent results which it has performed This additional value evidently constitutes a product a value created by the activity of the first generation and if BY ANY MEANS WHATEVER the ownership of this value be distributed among the members of society equitably that is in proportion to the labor which each has performed each will legitimately possess the portion which he receives He may then dispose of this legitimate and private property as he sees fit exchange it give it away or transfer it and no other individual or collection of other individuals that is society can lay any claim to these values Thus by the distribution of collective capital to the use of which each associate either in his own right or in right of his authors has an imprescriptible and undivided title there will be in the phalanstery as in the France of eighteen forty one the poor and the rich some men who to live in luxury have only as Figaro says to take the trouble to be born and others for whom the fortune of life is but an opportunity for long continued poverty idlers with large incomes and workers whose fortune is always in the future some privileged by birth and caste and others pariahs whose sole civil and political rights are THE RIGHT TO LABOR AND THE RIGHT TO LAND For we must not be deceived in the phalanstery every thing will be as it is to day an object of property machines inventions thought books the products of art of agriculture and of industry animals houses fences vineyards pastures forests fields every thing in short except the UNCULTIVATED LAND Now would you like to know what uncultivated land is worth according to the advocates of property A square league hardly suffices for the support of a savage says M Charles Comte Estimating the wretched subsistence of this savage at three hundred francs per year we find that the square league necessary to his life is relatively to him faithfully represented by a rent of fifteen francs In France there are twenty eight thousand square leagues the total rent of which by this estimate would be four hundred and twenty thousand francs which when divided among nearly thirty four millions of people would give each an INCOME OF A CENTIME AND A QUARTER That is the new right which the great genius of Fourier has invented IN BEHALF OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE and with which his first disciple hopes to reform the world I denounce M Considerant to the proletariat If the theory of M Considerant would at least really guarantee this property which he cherishes so jealously I might pardon him the flaws in his syllogism certainly the best one he ever made in his life But no that which M Considerant takes for property is only a privilege of extra pay In Fourier s system neither the created capital nor the increased value of the soil are divided and appropriated in any effective manner the instruments of labor whether created or not remain in the hands of the phalanx the pretended proprietor can touch only the income He is permitted neither to realize his share of the stock nor to possess it exclusively nor to administer it whatever it be The cashier throws him his dividend and then proprietor eat the whole if you can The system of Fourier would not suit the proprietors since it takes away the most delightful feature of property the free disposition of one s goods It would please the communists no better since it involves unequal conditions It is repugnant to the friends of free association and equality in consequence of its tendency to wipe out human character and individuality by suppressing possession family and country the threefold expression of the human personality Of all our active publicists none seem to me more fertile in resources richer in imagination more luxuriant and varied in style than M Considerant Nevertheless I doubt if he will undertake to reestablish his theory of property If he has this courage this is what I would say to him Before writing your reply consider well your plan of action do not scour the country have recourse to none of your ordinary expedients no complaints of civilization no sarcasms upon equality no glorification of the phalanstery Leave Fourier and the departed in peace and endeavor only to re adjust the pieces of your syllogism To this end you ought first to analyze closely each proposition of your adversary second to show the error either by a direct refutation or by proving the converse third to oppose argument to argument so that objection and reply meeting face to face the stronger may break down the weaker and shiver it to atoms By that method only can you boast of having conquered and compel me to regard you as an honest reasoner and a good artillery man I should have no excuse for tarrying longer with these phalansterian crotchets if the obligation which I have imposed upon myself of making a clean sweep and the necessity of vindicating my dignity as a writer did not prevent me from passing in silence the reproach uttered against me by a correspondent of La Phalange We have seen but lately says this journalist seventy one that M Proudhon enthusiast as he has been for the science created by Fourier is or will be an enthusiast for any thing else whatsoever If ever sectarians had the right to reproach another for changes in his beliefs this right certainly does not belong to the disciples of Fourier who are always so eager to administer the phalansterian baptism to the deserters of all parties But why regard it as a crime if they are sincere Of what consequence is the constancy or inconstancy of an individual to the truth which is always the same It is better to enlighten men s minds than to teach them to be obstinate in their prejudices Do we not know that man is frail and fickle that his heart is full of delusions and that his lips are a distillery of falsehood Omnis homo meudax Whether we will or no we all serve for a time as instruments of this truth whose kingdom comes every day God alone is immutable because he is eternal That is the reply which as a general rule an honest man is entitled always to make and which I ought perhaps to be content to offer as an excuse for I am no better than my fathers But in a century of doubt and apostasy like ours when it is of importance to set the small and the weak an example of strength and honesty of utterance I must not suffer my character as a public assailant of property to be dishonored I must render an account of my old opinions Examining myself therefore upon this charge of Fourierism and endeavoring to refresh my memory I find that having been connected with the Fourierists in my studies and my friendships it is possible that without knowing it I have been one of Fourier s partisans Jerome Lalande placed Napoleon and Jesus Christ in his catalogue of atheists The Fourierists resemble this astronomer if a man happens to find fault with the existing civilization and to admit the truth of a few of their criticisms they straightway enlist him willy nilly in their school Nevertheless I do not deny that I have been a Fourierist for since they say it of course it may be so But sir that of which my ex associates are ignorant and which doubtless will astonish you is that I have been many other things in religion by turns a Protestant a Papist an Arian and Semi Arian a Manichean a Gnostic an Adamite even and a Pre Adamite a Sceptic a Pelagian a Socinian an Anti Trinitarian and a Neo Christian seventy two in philosophy and politics an Idealist a Pantheist a Platonist a Cartesian an Eclectic that is a sort of juste milieu a Monarchist an Aristocrat a Constitutionalist a follower of Babeuf and a Communist I have wandered through a whole encyclopaedia of systems Do you think it surprising sir that among them all I was for a short time a Fourierist For my part I am not at all surprised although at present I have no recollection of it One thing is sure that my superstition and credulity reached their height at the very period of my life which my critics reproachfully assign as the date of my Fourieristic beliefs Now I hold quite other views My mind no longer admits that which is demonstrated by syllogisms analogies or metaphors which are the methods of the phalanstery but demands a process of generalization and induction which excludes error Of my past OPINIONSS I retain absolutely none I have acquired some KNOWLEDGE I no longer BELIEVE I either KNOW or am IGNORANT In a word in seeking for the reason of things I saw that I was a RATIONALIST Undoubtedly it would have been simpler to begin where I have ended But then if such is the law of the human mind if all society for six thousand years has done nothing but fall into error if all mankind are still buried in the darkness of faith deceived by their prejudices and passions guided only by the instinct of their leaders if my accusers themselves are not free from sectarianism for they call themselves FOURIERISTS am I alone inexcusable for having in my inner self at the secret tribunal of my conscience begun anew the journey of our poor humanity I would by no means then deny my errors but sir that which distinguishes me from those who rush into print is the fact that though my thoughts have varied much my writings do not vary To day even and on a multitude of questions I am beset by a thousand extravagant and contradictory opinions but my opinions I do not print for the public has nothing to do with them Before addressing my fellow men I wait until light breaks in upon the chaos of my ideas in order that what I may say may be not the whole truth no man can know that but nothing but the truth This singular disposition of my mind to first identify itself with a system in order to better understand it and then to reflect upon it in order to test its legitimacy is the very thing which disgusted me with Fourier and ruined in my esteem the societary school To be a faithful Fourierist in fact one must abandon his reason and accept every thing from a master doctrine interpretation and application M Considerant whose excessive intolerance anathematizes all who do not abide by his sovereign decisions has no other conception of Fourierism Has he not been appointed Fourier s vicar on earth and pope of a Church which unfortunately for its apostles will never be of this world Passive belief is the theological virtue of all sectarians especially of the Fourierists Now this is what happened to me While trying to demonstrate by argument the religion of which I had become a follower in studying Fourier I suddenly perceived that by reasoning I was becoming incredulous that on each article of the creed my reason and my faith were at variance and that my six weeks labor was wholly lost I saw that the Fourierists in spite of their inexhaustible gabble and their extravagant pretension to decide in all things were neither savants nor logicians nor even believers that they were SCIENTIFIC QUACKS who were led more by their self love than their conscience to labor for the triumph of their sect and to whom all means were good that would reach that end I then understood why to the Epicureans they promised women wine music and a sea of luxury to the rigorists maintenance of marriage purity of morals and temperance to laborers high wages to proprietors large incomes to philosophers solutions the secret of which Fourier alone possessed to priests a costly religion and magnificent festivals to savants knowledge of an unimaginable nature to each indeed that which he most desired In the beginning this seemed to me droll in the end I regarded it as the height of impudence No sir no one yet knows of the foolishness and infamy which the phalansterian system contains That is a subject which I mean to treat as soon as I have balanced my accounts with property seventy three It is rumored that the Fourierists think of leaving France and going to the new world to found a phalanstery When a house threatens to fall the rats scamper away that is because they are rats Men do better they rebuild it Not long since the saint Simonians despairing of their country which paid no heed to them proudly shook the dust from their feet and started for the Orient to fight the battle of free woman Pride wilfulness mad selfishness True charity like true faith does not worry never despairs it seeks neither its own glory nor its interest nor empire it does every thing for all speaks with indulgence to the reason and the will and desires to conquer only by persuasion and sacrifice Remain in France Fourierists if the progress of humanity is the only thing which you have at heart There is more to do here than in the new world Otherwise go you are nothing but liars and hypocrites The foregoing statement by no means embraces all the political elements all the opinions and tendencies which threaten the future of property but it ought to satisfy any one who knows how to classify facts and to deduce their law or the idea which governs them Existing society seems abandoned to the demon of falsehood and discord and it is this sad sight which grieves so deeply many distinguished minds who lived too long in a former age to be able to understand ours Now while the short sighted spectator begins to despair of humanity and distracted and cursing that of which he is ignorant plunges into scepticism and fatalism the true observer certain of the spirit which governs the world seeks to comprehend and fathom Providence The memoir on Property published last year by the pensioner of the Academy of Besancon is simply a study of this nature The time has come for me to relate the history of this unlucky treatise which has already caused me so much chagrin and made me so unpopular but which was on my part so involuntary and unpremeditated that I would dare to affirm that there is not an economist not a philosopher not a jurist who is not a hundred times guiltier than I There is something so singular in the way in which I was led to attack property that if on hearing my sad story you persist sir in your blame I hope at least you will be forced to pity me I never have pretended to be a great politician far from that I always have felt for controversies of a political nature the greatest aversion and if in my Essay on Property I have sometimes ridiculed our politicians believe sir that I was governed much less by my pride in the little that I know than by my vivid consciousness of their ignorance and excessive vanity Relying more on Providence than on men not suspecting at first that politics like every other science contained an absolute truth agreeing equally well with Bossuet and Jean Jacques I accepted with resignation my share of human misery and contented myself with praying to God for good deputies upright ministers and an honest king By taste as well as by discretion and lack of confidence in my powers I was slowly pursuing some commonplace studies in philology mingled with a little metaphysics when I suddenly fell upon the greatest problem that ever has occupied philosophical minds I mean the criterion of certainty Those of my readers who are unacquainted with the philosophical terminology will be glad to be told in a few words what this criterion is which plays so great a part in my work The criterion of certainty according to the philosophers will be when discovered an infallible method of establishing the truth of an opinion a judgment a theory or a system in nearly the same way as gold is recognized by the touchstone as iron approaches the magnet or better still as we verify a mathematical operation by applying the PROOF TIME has hitherto served as a sort of criterion for society Thus the primitive men having observed that they were not all equal in strength beauty and labor judged and rightly that certain ones among them were called by nature to the performance of simple and common functions but they concluded and this is where their error lay that these same individuals of duller intellect more restricted genius and weaker personality were predestined to SERVE the others that is to labor while the latter rested and to have no other will than theirs and from this idea of a natural subordination among men sprang domesticity which voluntarily accepted at first was imperceptibly converted into horrible slavery Time making this error more palpable has brought about justice Nations have learned at their own cost that the subjection of man to man is a false idea an erroneous theory pernicious alike to master and to slave And yet such a social system has stood several thousand years and has been defended by celebrated philosophers even to day under somewhat mitigated forms sophists of every description uphold and extol it But experience is bringing it to an end Time then is the criterion of societies thus looked at history is the demonstration of the errors of humanity by the argument reductio ad absurdum Now the criterion sought for by metaphysicians would have the advantage of discriminating at once between the true and the false in every opinion so that in politics religion and morals for example the true and the useful being immediately recognized we should no longer need to await the sorrowful experience of time Evidently such a secret would be death to the sophists that cursed brood who under different names excite the curiosity of nations and owing to the difficulty of separating the truth from the error in their artistically woven theories lead them into fatal ventures disturb their peace and fill them with such extraordinary prejudice Up to this day the criterion of certainty remains a mystery this is owing to the multitude of criteria that have been successively proposed Some have taken for an absolute and definite criterion the testimony of the senses others intuition these evidence those argument M Lamennais affirms that there is no other criterion than universal reason Before him M de Bonald thought he had discovered it in language Quite recently M Buchez has proposed morality and to harmonize them all the eclectics have said that it was absurd to seek for an absolute criterion since there were as many criteria as special orders of knowledge Of all these hypotheses it may be observed That the testimony of the senses is not a criterion because the senses relating us only to phenomena furnish us with no ideas that intuition needs external confirmation or objective certainty that evidence requires proof and argument verification that universal reason has been wrong many a time that language serves equally well to express the true or the false that morality like all the rest needs demonstration and rule and finally that the eclectic idea is the least reasonable of all since it is of no use to say that there are several criteria if we cannot point out one I very much fear that it will be with the criterion as with the philosopher s stone that it will finally be abandoned not only as insolvable but as chimerical Consequently I entertain no hopes of having found it nevertheless I am not sure that some one more skilful will not discover it Be it as it may with regard to a criterion or criteria there are methods of demonstration which when applied to certain subjects may lead to the discovery of unknown truths bring to light relations hitherto unsuspected and lift a paradox to the highest degree of certainty In such a case it is not by its novelty nor even by its content that a system should be judged but by its method The critic then should follow the example of the Supreme Court which in the cases which come before it never examines the facts but only the form of procedure Now what is the form of procedure A method I then looked to see what philosophy in the absence of a criterion had accomplished by the aid of special methods and I must say that I could not discover in spite of the loudly proclaimed pretensions of some that it had produced any thing of real value and at last wearied with the philosophical twaddle I resolved to make a new search for the criterion I confess it to my shame this folly lasted for two years and I am not yet entirely rid of it It was like seeking a needle in a haystack I might have learned Chinese or Arabic in the time that I have lost in considering and reconsidering syllogisms in rising to the summit of an induction as to the top of a ladder in inserting a proposition between the horns of a dilemma in decomposing distinguishing separating denying affirming admitting as if I could pass abstractions through a sieve I selected justice as the subject matter of my experiments Finally after a thousand decompositions recompositions and double compositions I found at the bottom of my analytical crucible not the criterion of certainty but a metaphysico economico political treatise whose conclusions were such that I did not care to present them in a more artistic or if you will more intelligible form The effect which this work produced upon all classes of minds gave me an idea of the spirit of our age and did not cause me to regret the prudent and scientific obscurity of my style How happens it that to day I am obliged to defend my intentions when my conduct bears the evident impress of such lofty morality You have read my work sir and you know the gist of my tedious and scholastic lucubrations Considering the revolutions of humanity the vicissitudes of empires the transformations of property and the innumerable forms of justice and of right I asked Are the evils which afflict us inherent in our condition as men or do they arise only from an error This inequality of fortunes which all admit to be the cause of society s embarrassments is it as some assert the effect of Nature or in the division of the products of labor and the soil may there not have been some error in calculation Does each laborer receive all that is due him and only that which is due him In short in the present conditions of labor wages and exchange is no one wronged are the accounts well kept is the social balance accurate Then I commenced a most laborious investigation It was necessary to arrange informal notes to discuss contradictory titles to reply to captious allegations to refute absurd pretensions and to describe fictitious debts dishonest transactions and fraudulent accounts In order to triumph over quibblers I had to deny the authority of custom to examine the arguments of legislators and to oppose science with science itself Finally all these operations completed I had to give a judicial decision I therefore declared my hand upon my heart before God and men that the causes of social inequality are three in number one GRATUITOUS APPROPRIATION OF COLLECTIVE WEALTH two INEQUALITY IN EXCHANGE three THE RIGHT OF PROFIT OR INCREASE And since this threefold method of extortion is the very essence of the domain of property I denied the legitimacy of property and proclaimed its identity with robbery That is my only offence I have reasoned upon property I have searched for the criterion of justice I have demonstrated not the possibility but the necessity of equality of fortunes I have allowed myself no attack upon persons no assault upon the government of which I more than any one else am a provisional adherent If I have sometimes used the word PROPRIETOR I have used it as the abstract name of a metaphysical being whose reality breathes in every individual not alone in a privileged few Nevertheless I acknowledge for I wish my confession to be sincere that the general tone of my book has been bitterly censured They complain of an atmosphere of passion and invective unworthy of an honest man and quite out of place in the treatment of so grave a subject If this reproach is well founded which it is impossible for me either to deny or admit because in my own cause I cannot be judge if I say I deserve this charge I can only humble myself and acknowledge myself guilty of an involuntary wrong the only excuse that I could offer being of such a nature that it ought not to be communicated to the public All that I can say is that I understand better than any one how the anger which injustice causes may render an author harsh and violent in his criticisms When after twenty years of labor a man still finds himself on the brink of starvation and then suddenly discovers in an equivocation an error in calculation the cause of the evil which torments him in common with so many millions of his fellows he can scarcely restrain a cry of sorrow and dismay But sir though pride be offended by my rudeness it is not to pride that I apologize but to the proletaires to the simple minded whom I perhaps have scandalized My angry dialectics may have produced a bad effect on some peaceable minds Some poor workingman more affected by my sarcasm than by the strength of my arguments may perhaps have concluded that property is the result of a perpetual Machiavelianism on the part of the governors against the governed a deplorable error of which my book itself is the best refutation I devoted two chapters to showing how property springs from human personality and the comparison of individuals Then I explained its perpetual limitation and following out the same idea I predicted its approaching disappearance How then could the editors of the Revue Democratique after having borrowed from me nearly the whole substance of their economical articles dare to say The holders of the soil and other productive capital are more or less wilful accomplices in a vast robbery they being the exclusive receivers and sharers of the stolen goods The proprietors WILFULLY guilty of the crime of robbery Never did that homicidal phrase escape my pen never did my heart conceive the frightful thought Thank Heaven I know not how to calumniate my kind and I have too strong a desire to seek for the reason of things to be willing to believe in criminal conspiracies The millionnaire is no more tainted by property than the journeyman who works for thirty sous per day On both sides the error is equal as well as the intention The effect is also the same though positive in the former and negative in the latter I accused property I did not denounce the proprietors which would have been absurd and I am sorry that there are among us wills so perverse and minds so shattered that they care for only so much of the truth as will aid them in their evil designs Such is the only regret which I feel on account of my indignation which though expressed perhaps too bitterly was at least honest and legitimate in its source However what did I do in this essay which I voluntarily submitted to the Academy of Moral Sciences Seeking a fixed axiom amid social uncertainties I traced back to one fundamental question all the secondary questions over which at present so keen and diversified a conflict is raging This question was the right of property Then comparing all existing theories with each other and extracting from them that which is common to them all I endeavored to discover that element in the idea of property which is necessary immutable and absolute and asserted after authentic verification that this idea is reducible to that of INDIVIDUAL AND TRANSMISSIBLE POSSESSION SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXCHANGE BUT NOT OF ALIENATION FOUNDED ON LABOR AND NOT ON FICTITIOUS OCCUPANCY OR IDLE CAPRICE I said further that this idea was the result of our revolutionary movements the culminating point towards which all opinions gradually divesting themselves of their contradictory elements converge And I tried to demonstrate this by the spirit of the laws by political economy by psychology and history A Father of the Church finishing a learned exposition of the Catholic doctrine cried in the enthusiasm of his faith Domine si error est a te decepti sumus if my religion is false God is to blame I as well as this theologian can say If equality is a fable God through whom we act and think and are God who governs society by eternal laws who rewards just nations and punishes proprietors God alone is the author of evil God has lied The fault lies not with me But if I am mistaken in my inferences I should be shown my error and led out of it It is surely worth the trouble and I think I deserve this honor There is no ground for proscription For in the words of that member of the Convention who did not like the guillotine to kill is not to reply Until then I persist in regarding my work as useful social full of instruction for public officials worthy in short of reward and encouragement For there is one truth of which I am profoundly convinced nations live by absolute ideas not by approximate and partial conceptions therefore men are needed who define principles or at least test them in the fire of controversy Such is the law the idea first the pure idea the understanding of the laws of God the theory practice follows with slow steps cautious attentive to the succession of events sure to seize towards this eternal meridian the indications of supreme reason The company operation of theory and practice produces in humanity the realization of order the absolute truth seventy four All of us as long as we live are called each in proportion to his strength to this sublime work The only duty which it imposes upon us is to refrain from appropriating the truth to ourselves either by concealing it or by accommodating it to the temper of the century or by using it for our own interests This principle of conscience so grand and so simple has always been present in my thought Consider in fact sir that which I might have done but did not wish to do I reason on the most honorable hypothesis What hindered me from concealing for some years to come the abstract theory of the equality of fortunes and at the same time from criticising constitutions and codes from showing the absolute and the contingent the immutable and the ephemeral the eternal and the transitory in laws present and past from constructing a new system of legislation and establishing on a solid foundation this social edifice ever destroyed and as often rebuilt Might I not taking up the definitions of casuists have clearly shown the cause of their contradictions and uncertainties and supplied at the same time the inadequacies of their conclusions Might I not have confirmed this labor by a vast historical exposition in which the principle of exclusion and of the accumulation of property the appropriation of collective wealth and the radical vice in exchanges would have figured as the constant causes of tyranny war and revolution It should have been done you say Do not doubt sir that such a task would have required more patience than genius With the principles of social economy which I have analyzed I would have had only to break the ground and follow the furrow The critic of laws finds nothing more difficult than to determine justice the labor alone would have been longer Oh if I had pursued this glittering prospect and like the man of the burning bush with inspired countenance and deep and solemn voice had presented myself some day with new tables there would have been found fools to admire boobies to applaud and cowards to offer me the dictatorship for in the way of popular infatuations nothing is impossible But sir after this monument of insolence and pride what should I have deserved in your opinion at the tribunal of God and in the judgment of free men Death sir and eternal reprobation I therefore spoke the truth as soon as I saw it waiting only long enough to give it proper expression I pointed out error in order that each might reform himself and render his labors more useful I announced the existence of a new political element in order that my associates in reform developing it in concert might arrive more promptly at that unity of principles which alone can assure to society a better day I expected to receive if not for my book at least for my commendable conduct a small republican ovation And behold journalists denounce me academicians curse me political adventurers great God think to make themselves tolerable by protesting that they are not like me I give the formula by which the whole social edifice may be scientifically reconstructed and the strongest minds reproach me for being able only to destroy The rest despise me because I am unknown When the Essay on Property fell into the reformatory camp some asked Who has spoken Is it Arago Is it Lamennais Michel de Bourges or Garnier Pages And when they heard the name of a new man We do not know him they would reply Thus the monopoly of thought property in reason oppresses the proletariat as well as the bourgeoisie The worship of the infamous prevails even on the steps of the tabernacle But what am I saying May evil befall me if I blame the poor creatures Oh let us not despise those generous souls who in the excitement of their patriotism are always prompt to identify the voice of their chiefs with the truth Let us encourage rather their simple credulity enlighten complacently and tenderly their precious sincerity and reserve our shafts for those vain glorious spirits who are always admiring their genius and in different tongues caressing the people in order to govern them These considerations alone oblige me to reply to the strange and superficial conclusions of the Journal du Peuple issue of Oct eleven eighteen forty on the question of property I leave therefore the journalist to address myself only to his readers I hope that the self love of the writer will not be offended if in the presence of the masses I ignore an individual You say proletaires of the Peuple For the very reason that men and things exist there always will be men who will possess things nothing therefore can destroy property In speaking thus you unconsciously argue exactly after the manner of M Cousin who always reasons from possession to PROPERTY This coincidence however does not surprise me M Cousin is a philosopher of much mind and you proletaires have still more Certainly it is honorable even for a philosopher to be your companion in error Originally the word PROPERTY was synonymous with PROPER or INDIVIDUAL POSSESSION It designated each individual s special right to the use of a thing But when this right of use inert if I may say so as it was with regard to the other usufructuaries became active and paramount that is when the usufructuary converted his right to personally use the thing into the right to use it by his neighbor s labor then property changed its nature and its idea became complex The legists knew this very well but instead of opposing as they ought this accumulation of profits they accepted and sanctioned the whole And as the right of farm rent necessarily implies the right of use in other words as the right to cultivate land by the labor of a slave supposes one s power to cultivate it himself according to the principle that the greater includes the less the name property was reserved to designate this double right and that of possession was adopted to designate the right of use Whence property came to be called the perfect right the right of domain the eminent right the heroic or quiritaire right in Latin jus perfectum jus optimum jus quiritarium jus dominii while possession became assimilated to farm rent Now that individual possession exists of right or better from natural necessity all philosophers admit and can easily e demonstrated but when in imitation of M Cousin we assume it to be the basis of the domain of property we fall into the sophism called sophisma amphiboliae vel ambiguitatis which consists in changing the meaning by a verbal equivocation People often think themselves very profound because by the aid of expressions of extreme generality they appear to rise to the height of absolute ideas and thus deceive inexperienced minds and what is worse this is commonly called EXAMINING ABSTRACTIONS But the abstraction formed by the comparison of identical facts is one thing while that which is deduced from different acceptations of the same term is quite another The first gives the universal idea the axiom the law the second indicates the order of generation of ideas All our errors arise from the constant confusion of these two kinds of abstractions In this particular languages and philosophies are alike deficient The less common an idiom is and the more obscure its terms the more prolific is it as a source of error a philosopher is sophistical in proportion to his ignorance of any method of neutralizing this imperfection in language If the art of correcting the errors of speech by scientific methods is ever discovered then philosophy will have found its criterion of certainty Now then the difference between property and possession being well established and it being settled that the former for the reasons which I have just given must necessarily disappear is it best for the slight advantage of restoring an etymology to retain the word PROPERTY My opinion is that it would be very unwise to do so and I will tell why I quote from the Journal du Peuple To the legislative power belongs the right to regulate property to prescribe the conditions of acquiring possessing and transmitting it It cannot be denied that inheritance assessment commerce industry labor and wages require the most important modifications You wish proletaires to REGULATE PROPERTY that is you wish to destroy it and reduce it to the right of possession For to regulate property without the consent of the proprietors is to deny the right OF DOMAIN to associate employees with proprietors is to destroy the EMINENT right to suppress or even reduce farm rent house rent revenue and increase generally is to annihilate PERFECT property Why then while laboring with such laudable enthusiasm for the establishment of equality should you retain an expression whose equivocal meaning will always be an obstacle in the way of your success There you have the first reason a wholly philosophical one for rejecting not only the thing but the name property Here now is the political the highest reason Every social revolution M Cousin will tell you is effected only by the realization of an idea either political moral or religious When Alexander conquered Asia his idea was to avenge Greek liberty against the insults of Oriental despotism when Marius and Caesar overthrew the Roman patricians their idea was to give bread to the people when Christianity revolutionized the world its idea was to emancipate mankind and to substitute the worship of one God for the deities of Epicurus and Homer when France rose in eighty nine her idea was liberty and equality before the law There has been no true revolution says M Cousin with out its idea so that where an idea does not exist or even fails of a formal expression revolution is impossible There are mobs conspirators rioters regicides There are no revolutionists Society devoid of ideas twists and tosses about and dies in the midst of its fruitless labor Nevertheless you all feel that a revolution is to come and that you alone can accomplish it What then is the idea which governs you proletaires of the nineteenth century for really I cannot call you revolutionists What do you think what do you believe what do you want Be guarded in your reply I have read faithfully your favorite journals your most esteemed authors I find everywhere only vain and puerile entites nowhere do I discover an idea I will explain the meaning of this word entite new without doubt to most of you By entite is generally understood a substance which the imagination grasps but which is incognizable by the senses and the reason Thus the SOPORIFIC POWER of opium of which Sganarelle speaks and the PECCANT HUMORS of ancient medicine are entites The entite is the support of those who do not wish to confess their ignorance It is incomprehensible or as saint Paul says the argumentum non apparentium In philosophy the entite is often only a repetition of words which add nothing to the thought For example when M Pierre Leroux who says so many excellent things but who is too fond in my opinion of his Platonic formulas assures us that the evils of humanity are due to our IGNORANCE OF LIFE M Pierre Leroux utters an entite for it is evident that if we are evil it is because we do not know how to live but the knowledge of this fact is of no value to us When M Edgar Quinet declares that France suffers and declines because there is an ANTAGONISM of men and of interests he declares an entite for the problem is to discover the cause of this antagonism When M Lamennais in thunder tones preaches self sacrifice and love he proclaims two entites for we need to know on what conditions self sacrifice and love can spring up and exist So also proletaires when you talk of LIBERTY PROGRESS and THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE you make of these naturally intelligible things so many entites in space for on the one hand we need a new definition of liberty since that of eighty nine no longer suffices and on the other we must know in what direction society should proceed in order to be in progress As for the sovereignty of the people that is a grosser entite than the sovereignty of reason it is the entite of entites In fact since sovereignty can no more be conceived of outside of the people than outside of reason it remains to be ascertained who among the people shall exercise the sovereignty and among so many minds which shall be the sovereigns To say that the people should elect their representatives is to say that the people should recognize their sovereigns which does not remove the difficulty at all But suppose that equal by birth equal before the law equal in personality equal in social functions you wish also to be equal in conditions Suppose that perceiving all the mutual relations of men whether they produce or exchange or consume to be relations of commutative justice in a word social relations suppose I say that perceiving this you wish to give this natural society a legal existence and to establish the fact by law I say that then you need a clear positive and exact expression of your whole idea that is an expression which states at once the principle the means and the end and I add that that expression is ASSOCIATION And since the association of the human race dates at least rightfully from the beginning of the world and has gradually established and perfected itself by successively divesting itself of its negative elements slavery nobility despotism aristocracy and feudalism I say that to eliminate the last negation of society to formulate the last revolutionary idea you must change your old rallying cries NO MORE ABSOLUTISM NO MORE NOBILITY NO MORE SLAVES into that of NO MORE PROPERTY But I know what astonishes you poor souls blasted by the wind of poverty and crushed by your patrons pride it is EQUALITY whose consequences frighten you How you have said in your journal how can we dream of a level which being unnatural is therefore unjust How shall we pay the day s labor of a Cormenin or a Lamennais Plebeians listen When after the battle of Salamis the Athenians assembled to award the prizes for courage after the ballots had been collected it was found that each combatant had one vote for the first prize and Themistocles all the votes for the second The people of Minerva were crowned by their own hands Truly heroic souls all were worthy of the olive branch since all had ventured to claim it for themselves Antiquity praised this sublime spirit Learn proletaires to esteem yourselves and to respect your dignity You wish to be free and you know not how to be citizens Now whoever says citizens necessarily says equals If I should call myself Lamennais or Cormenin and some journal speaking of me should burst forth with these hyperboles INCOMPARABLE GENIUS SUPERIOR MIND CONSUMMATE VIRTUE NOBLE CHARACTER I should not like it and should complain first because such eulogies are never deserved and second because they furnish a bad example But I wish in order to reconcile you to equality to measure for you the greatest literary personage of our century Do not accuse me of envy proletaires if I a defender of equality estimate at their proper value talents which are universally admired and which I better than any one know how to recognize A dwarf can always measure a giant all that he needs is a yardstick You have seen the pretentious announcements of L Esquisse d une Philosophie and you have admired the work on trust for either you have not read it or if you have you are incapable of judging it Acquaint yourselves then with this speculation more brilliant than sound and while admiring the enthusiasm of the author cease to pity those useful labors which only habit and the great number of the persons engaged in them render contemptible I shall be brief for notwithstanding the importance of the subject and the genius of the author what I have to say is of but little moment M Lamennais starts with the existence of God How does he demonstrate it By Cicero s argument that is by the consent of the human race There is nothing new in that We have still to find out whether the belief of the human race is legitimate or as Kant says whether our subjective certainty of the existence of God corresponds with the objective truth This however does not trouble M Lamennais He says that if the human race believes it is because it has a reason for believing Then having pronounced the name of God M Lamennais sings a hymn and that is his demonstration This first hypothesis admitted M Lamennais follows it with a second namely that there are three persons in God But while Christianity teaches the dogma of the Trinity only on the authority of revelation M Lamennais pretends to arrive at it by the sole force of argument and he does not perceive that his pretended demonstration is from beginning to end anthropomorphism that is an ascription of the faculties of the human mind and the powers of nature to the Divine substance New songs new hymns God and the Trinity thus DEMONSTRATED the philosopher passes to the creation a third hypothesis in which M Lamennais always eloquent varied and sublime DEMONSTRATES that God made the world neither of nothing nor of something nor of himself that he was free in creating but that nevertheless he could not but create that there is in matter a matter which is not matter that the archetypal ideas of the world are separated from each other in the Divine mind by a division which is obscure and unintelligible and yet substantial and real which involves intelligibility c We meet with like contradictions concerning the origin of evil To explain this problem one of the profoundest in philosophy M Lamennais at one time denies evil at another makes God the author of evil and at still another seeks outside of God a first cause which is not God an amalgam of entites more or less incoherent borrowed from Plato Proclus Spinoza I might say even from all philosophers Having thus established his trinity of hypotheses M Lamennais deduces therefrom by a badly connected chain of analogies his whole philosophy And it is here especially that we notice the syncretism which is peculiar to him The theory of M Lamennais embraces all systems and supports all opinions Are you a materialist Suppress as useless entites the three persons in God then starting directly from heat light and electro magnetism which according to the author are the three original fluids the three primary external manifestations of Will Intelligence and Love you have a materialistic and atheistic cosmogony On the contrary are you wedded to spiritualism With the theory of the immateriality of the body you are able to see everywhere nothing but spirits Finally if you incline to pantheism you will be satisfied by M Lamennais who formally teaches that the world is not an EMANATION from Divinity which is pure pantheism but a FLOW of Divinity I do not pretend however to deny that L Esquisse contains some excellent things but by the author s declaration these things are not original with him it is the system which is his That is undoubtedly the reason why M Lamennais speaks so contemptuously of his predecessors in philosophy and disdains to quote his originals He thinks that since L Esquisse contains all true philosophy the world will lose nothing when the names and works of the old philosophers perish M Lamennais who renders glory to God in beautiful songs does not know how as well to render justice to his fellows His fatal fault is this appropriation of knowledge which the theologians call the PHILOSOPHICAL SIN or the SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST a sin which will not damn you proletaires nor me either In short L Esquisse judged as a system and divested of all which its author borrows from previous systems is a commonplace work whose method consists in constantly explaining the known by the unknown and in giving entites for abstractions and tautologies for proofs Its whole theodicy is a work not of genius but of imagination a patching up of neo Platonic ideas The psychological portion amounts to nothing M Lamennais openly ridiculing labors of this character without which however metaphysics is impossible The book which treats of logic and its methods is weak vague and shallow Finally we find in the physical and physiological speculations which M Lamennais deduces from his trinitarian cosmogony grave errors the preconceived design of accommodating facts to theory and the substitution in almost every case of hypothesis for reality The third volume on industry and art is the most interesting to read and the best It is true that M Lamennais can boast of nothing but his style As a philosopher he has added not a single idea to those which existed before him Why then this excessive mediocrity of M Lamennais considered as a thinker a mediocrity which disclosed itself at the time of the publication of the Essai sur l Indifference It is because remember this well proletaires Nature makes no man truly complete and because the development of certain faculties almost always excludes an equal development of the opposite faculties it is because M Lamennais is preeminently a poet a man of feeling and sentiment Look at his style exuberant sonorous picturesque vehement full of exaggeration and invective and hold it for certain that no man possessed of such a style was ever a true metaphysician This wealth of expression and illustration which everybody admires becomes in M Lamennais the incurable cause of his philosophical impotence His flow of language and his sensitive nature misleading his imagination he thinks that he is reasoning when he is only repeating himself and readily takes a description for a logical deduction Hence his horror of positive ideas his feeble powers of analysis his pronounced taste for indefinite analogies verbal abstractions hypothetical generalities in short all sorts of entites Further the entire life of M Lamennais is conclusive proof of his anti philosophical genius Devout even to mysticism an ardent ultramontane an intolerant theocrat he at first feels the double influence of the religious reaction and the literary theories which marked the beginning of this century and falls back to the middle ages and Gregory VII then suddenly becoming a progressive Christian and a democrat he gradually leans towards rationalism and finally falls into deism At present everybody waits at the trap door As for me though I would not swear to it I am inclined to think that M Lamennais already taken with scepticism will die in a state of indifference He owes to individual reason and methodical doubt this expiation of his early essays It has been pretended that M Lamennais preaching now a theocracy now universal democracy has been always consistent that under different names he has sought invariably one and the same thing unity Pitiful excuse for an author surprised in the very act of contradiction What would be thought of a man who by turns a servant of despotism under Louis XVI a demagogue with Robespierre a courtier of the Emperor a bigot during fifteen years of the Restoration a conservative since eighteen thirty should dare to say that he ever had wished for but one thing public order Would he be regarded as any the less a renegade from all parties Public order unity the world s welfare social harmony the union of the nations concerning each of these things there is no possible difference of opinion Everybody wishes them the character of the publicist depends only upon the means by which he proposes to arrive at them But why look to M Lamennais for a steadfastness of opinion which he himself repudiates Has he not said The mind has no law that which I believe to day I did not believe yesterday I do not know that I shall believe it to morrow No there is no real superiority among men since all talents and capacities are combined never in one individual This man has the power of thought that one imagination and style still another industrial and commercial capacity By our very nature and education we possess only special aptitudes which are limited and confined and which become consequently more necessary as they gain in depth and strength Capacities are to each other as functions and persons who would dare to classify them in ranks The finest genius is by the laws of his existence and development the most dependent upon the society which creates him Who would dare to make a god of the glorious child It is not strength which makes the man said a Hercules of the market place to the admiring crowd it is character That man who had only his muscles held force in contempt The lesson is a good one proletaires we should profit by it It is not talent which is also a force it is not knowledge it is not beauty which makes the man It is heart courage will virtue Now if we are equal in that which makes us men how can the accidental distribution of secondary faculties detract from our manhood Remember that privilege is naturally and inevitably the lot of the weak and do not be misled by the fame which accompanies certain talents whose greatest merit consists in their rarity and a long and toilsome apprenticeship It is easier for M Lamennais to recite a philippic or sing a humanitarian ode after the Platonic fashion than to discover a single useful truth it is easier for an economist to apply the laws of production and distribution than to write ten lines in the style of M Lamennais it is easier for both to speak than to act You then who put your hands to the work who alone truly create why do you wish me to admit your inferiority But what am I saying Yes you are inferior for you lack virtue and will Ready for labor and for battle you have when liberty and equality are in question neither courage nor character In the preface to his pamphlet on Le Pays et le Gouvernement as well as in his defence before the jury M Lamennais frankly declared himself an advocate of property Out of regard for the author and his misfortune I shall abstain from characterizing this declaration and from examining these two sorrowful performances M Lamennais seems to be only the tool of a quasi radical party which flatters him in order to use him without respect for a glorious but hence forth powerless old age What means this profession of faith From the first number of L Avenir to L Esquisse d une Philosophie M Lamennais always favors equality association and even a sort of vague and indefinite communism M Lamennais in recognizing the right of property gives the lie to his past career and renounces his most generous tendencies Can it then be true that in this man who has been too roughly treated but who is also too easily flattered strength of talent has already outlived strength of will It is said that M Lamennais has rejected the offers of several of his friends to try to procure for him a commutation of his sentence M Lamennais prefers to serve out his time May not this affectation of a false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right of property The Huron when taken prisoner hurls insults and threats at his conqueror that is the heroism of the savage the martyr prays for his executioners and is willing to receive from them his life that is the heroism of the Christian Why has the apostle of love become an apostle of anger and revenge Has then the translator of L Imitation forgotten that he who offends charity cannot honor virtue Galileo retracting on his knees before the tribunal of the inquisition his heresy in regard to the movement of the earth and recovering at that price his liberty seems to me a hundred times grander than M Lamennais What if we suffer for truth and justice must we in retaliation thrust our persecutors outside the pale of human society and when sentenced to an unjust punishment must we decline exemption if it is offered to us because it pleases a few base satellites to call it a pardon Such is not the wisdom of Christianity But I forgot that in the presence of M Lamennais this name is no longer pronounced May the prophet of L Avenir be soon restored to liberty and his friends but above all may he henceforth derive his inspiration only from his genius and his heart O proletaires proletaires how long are you to be victimized by this spirit of revenge and implacable hatred which your false friends kindle and which perhaps has done more harm to the development of reformatory ideas than the corruption ignorance and malice of the government Believe me at the present time everybody is to blame In fact in intention or in example all are found wanting and you have no right to accuse any one The king himself God forgive me I do not like to justify a king the king himself is like his predecessors only the personification of an idea and an idea proletaires which possesses you yet His greatest wrong consists in wishing for its complete realization while you wish it realized only partially consequently in being logical in his government while you in your complaints are not at all so You clamor for a second regicide He that is without sin among you let him cast at the prince of property the first stone How successful you would have been if in order to influence men you had appealed to the self love of men if in order to alter the constitution and the law you had placed yourselves within the constitution and the law Fifty thousand laws they say make up our political and civil codes Of these fifty thousand laws twenty five thousand are for you twenty five thousand against you Is it not clear that your duty is to oppose the former to the latter and thus by the argument of contradiction drive privilege into its last ditch This method of action is henceforth the only useful one being the only moral and rational one For my part if I had the ear of this nation to which I am attached by birth and predilection with no intention of playing the leading part in the future republic I would instruct the laboring masses to conquer property through institutions and judicial pleadings to seek auxiliaries and accomplices in the highest ranks of society and to ruin all privileged classes by taking advantage of their common desire for power and popularity The petition for the electoral reform has already received two hundred thousand signatures and the illustrious Arago threatens us with a million Surely that will be well done but from this million of citizens who are as willing to vote for an emperor as for equality could we not select ten thousand signatures I mean bona fide signatures whose authors can read write cipher and even think a little and whom we could invite after due perusal and verbal explanation to sign such a petition as the following TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR MONSIEUR LE MINISTRE On the day when a royal ordinance decreeing the establishment of model national workshops shall appear in the Moniteur the undersigned to the number of TEN THOUSAND will repair to the Palace of the Tuileries and there with all the power of their lungs will shout Long live Louis Philippe On the day when the Moniteur shall inform the public that this petition is refused the undersigned to the number of TEN THOUSAND will say secretly in their hearts Down with Louis Philippe If I am not mistaken such a petition would have some effect seventy five The pleasure of a popular ovation would be well worth the sacrifice of a few millions They sow so much to reap unpopularity Then if the nation its hopes of eighteen thirty restored should feel it its duty to keep its promise and it would keep it for the word of the nation is like that of God sacred if I say the nation reconciled by this act with the public spirited monarchy should bear to the foot of the throne its cheers and its vows and should at that solemn moment choose me to speak in its name the following would be the substance of my speech SIRE This is what the nation wishes to say to your Majesty O King you see what it costs to gain the applause of the citizens Would you like us henceforth to take for our motto Let us help the King the King will help us Do you wish the people to cry THE KING AND THE FRENCH NATION Then abandon these grasping bankers these quarrelsome lawyers these miserable bourgeois these infamous writers these dishonored men All these Sire hate you and continue to support you only because they fear us Finish the work of our kings wipe out aristocracy and privilege consult with these faithful proletaires with the nation which alone can honor a sovereign and sincerely shout Long live the king The rest of what I have to say sir is for you alone others would not understand me You are I perceive a republican as well as an economist and your patriotism revolts at the very idea of addressing to the authorities a petition in which the government of Louis Philippe should be tacitly recognized National workshops it were well to have such institutions established you think but patriotic hearts never will accept them from an aristocratic ministry nor by the courtesy of a king Already undoubtedly your old prejudices have returned and you now regard me only as a sophist as ready to flatter the powers that be as to dishonor by pushing them to an extreme the principles of equality and universal fraternity What shall I say to you That I should so lightly compromise the future of my theories either this clever sophistry which is attributed to me must be at bottom a very trifling affair or else my convictions must be so firm that they deprive me of free will But not to insist further on the necessity of a compromise between the executive power and the people it seems to me sir that in doubting my patriotism you reason very capriciously and that your judgments are exceedingly rash You sir ostensibly defending government and property are allowed to be a republican reformer phalansterian any thing you wish I on the contrary demanding distinctly enough a slight reform in public economy am foreordained a conservative and likewise a friend of the dynasty I cannot explain myself more clearly So firm a believer am I in the philosophy of accomplished facts and the statu quo of governmental forms that instead of destroying that which exists and beginning over again the past I prefer to render every thing legitimate by correcting it It is true that the corrections which I propose though respecting the form tend to finally change the nature of the things corrected Who denies it But it is precisely that which constitutes my system of statu quo I make no war upon symbols figures or phantoms I respect scarecrows and bow before bugbears I ask on the one hand that property be left as it is but that interest on all kinds of capital be gradually lowered and finally abolished on the other hand that the charter be maintained in its present shape but that method be introduced into administration and politics That is all Nevertheless submitting to all that is though not satisfied with it I endeavor to conform to the established order and to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar s Is it thought for instance that I love property Very well I am myself a proprietor and do homage to the right of increase as is proved by the fact that I have creditors to whom I faithfully pay every year a large amount of interest The same with politics Since we are a monarchy I would cry LONG LIVE THE KING rather than suffer death which does not prevent me however from demanding that the irremovable inviolable and hereditary representative of the nation shall act with the proletaires against the privileged classes in a word that the king shall become the leader of the radical party Thereby we proletaires would gain every thing and I am sure that at this price Louis Philippe might secure to his family the perpetual presidency of the republic And this is why I think so If there existed in France but one great functional inequality the duty of the functionary being from one end of the year to the other to hold full court of savants artists soldiers deputies inspectors c it is evident that the expenses of the presidency then would be the national expenses and that through the reversion of the civil list to the mass of consumers the great inequality of which I speak would form an exact equation with the whole nation Of this no economist needs a demonstration Consequently there would be no more fear of cliques courtiers and appanages since no new inequality could be established The king as king would have friends unheard of thing but no family His relatives or kinsmen agnats et cognats if they were fools would be nothing to him and in no case with the exception of the heir apparent would they have even in court more privileges than others No more nepotism no more favor no more baseness No one would go to court save when duty required or when called by an honorable distinction and as all conditions would be equal and all functions equally honored there would be no other emulation than that of merit and virtue I wish the king of the French could say without shame My brother the gardener my sister in law the milk maid my son the prince royal and my son the blacksmith His daughter might well be an artist That would be beautiful sir that would be royal no one but a buffoon could fail to understand it In this way I have come to think that the forms of royalty may be made to harmonize with the requirements of equality and have given a monarchical form to my republican spirit I have seen that France contains by no means as many democrats as is generally supposed and I have compromised with the monarchy I do not say however that if France wanted a republic I could not accommodate myself equally well and perhaps better By nature I hate all signs of distinction crosses of honor gold lace liveries costumes honorary titles c and above all parades If I had my way no general should be distinguished from a soldier nor a peer of France from a peasant Why have I never taken part in a review for I am happy to say sir that I am a national guard I have nothing else in the world but that Because the review is always held at a place which I do not like and because they have fools for officers whom I am compelled to obey You see and this is not the best of my history that in spite of my conservative opinions my life is a perpetual sacrifice to the republic Nevertheless I doubt if such simplicity would be agreeable to French vanity to that inordinate love of distinction and flattery which makes our nation the most frivolous in the world M Lamartine in his grand Meditation on Bonaparte calls the French A NATION OF BRUTUSES We are merely a nation of Narcissuses Previous to eighty nine we had the aristocracy of blood then every bourgeois looked down upon the commonalty and wished to be a nobleman Afterwards distinction was based on wealth and the bourgeoisie jealous of the nobility and proud of their money used eighteen thirty to promote not liberty by any means but the aristocracy of wealth When through the force of events and the natural laws of society for the development of which France offers such free play equality shall be established in functions and fortunes then the beaux and the belles the savants and the artists will form new classes There is a universal and innate desire in this Gallic country for fame and glory We must have distinctions be they what they may nobility wealth talent beauty or dress I suspect MM Arage and Garnier Pages of having aristocratic manners and I picture to myself our great journalists in their columns so friendly to the people administering rough kicks to the compositors in their printing offices This man once said Le National in speaking of Carrel whom we had proclaimed FIRST CONSUL Is it not true that the monarchical principle still lives in the hearts of our democrats and that they want universal suffrage in order to make themselves kings Since Le National prides itself on holding more fixed opinions than Le Journal des Debats I presume that Armand Carrel being dead M Armand Marrast is now first consul and M Garnier Pages second consul In every thing the deputy must give way to the journalist I do not speak of M Arago whom I believe to be in spite of calumny too learned for the consulship Be it so Though we have consuls our position is not much altered I am ready to yield my share of sovereignty to MM Armand Marrast and Garnier Pages the appointed consuls provided they will swear on entering upon the duties of their office to abolish property and not be haughty Forever promises Forever oaths Why should the people trust in tribunes when kings perjure themselves Alas truth and honesty are no longer as in the days of King John in the mouth of princes A whole senate has been convicted of felony and the interest of the governors always being for some mysterious reason opposed to the interest of the governed parliaments follow each other while the nation dies of hunger No no No more protectors no more emperors no more consuls Better manage our affairs ourselves than through agents Better associate our industries than beg from monopolies and since the republic cannot dispense with virtues we should labor for our reform This therefore is my line of conduct I preach emancipation to the proletaires association to the laborers equality to the wealthy I push forward the revolution by all means in my power the tongue the pen the press by action and example My life is a continual apostleship Yes I am a reformer I say it as I think it in good faith and that I may be no longer reproached for my vanity I wish to convert the world Very likely this fancy springs from an enthusiastic pride which may have turned to delirium but it will be admitted at least that I have plenty of company and that my madness is not monomania At the present day everybody wishes to be reckoned among the lunatics of Beranger To say nothing of the Babeufs the Marats and the Robespierres who swarm in our streets and workshops all the great reformers of antiquity live again in the most illustrious personages of our time One is Jesus Christ another Moses a third Mahomet this is Orpheus that Plato or Pythagoras Gregory VII himself has risen from the grave together with the evangelists and the apostles and it may turn out that even I am that slave who having escaped from his master s house was forthwith made a bishop and a reformer by saint Paul As for the virgins and holy women they are expected daily at present we have only Aspasias and courtesans Now as in all diseases the diagnostic varies according to the temperament so my madness has its peculiar aspects and distinguishing characteristic Reformers as a general thing are jealous of their role they suffer no rivals they want no partners they have disciples but no company laborers It is my desire on the contrary to communicate my enthusiasm and to make it as far as I can epidemic I wish that all were like myself reformers in order that there might be no more sects and that Christs Anti Christs and false Christs might be forced to understand and agree with each other Again every reformer is a magician or at least desires to become one Thus Moses Jesus Christ and the apostles proved their mission by miracles Mahomet ridiculed miracles after having endeavored to perform them Fourier more cunning promises us wonders when the globe shall be covered with phalansteries For myself I have as great a horror of miracles as of authorities and aim only at logic That is why I continually search after the criterion of certainty I work for the reformation of ideas Little matters it that they find me dry and austere I mean to conquer by a bold struggle or die in the attempt and whoever shall come to the defence of property I swear that I will force him to argue like M Considerant or philosophize like M Troplong Finally and it is here that I differ most from my compeers I do not believe it necessary in order to reach equality to turn every thing topsy turvy To maintain that nothing but an overturn can lead to reform is in my judgment to construct a syllogism and to look for the truth in the regions of the unknown Now I am for generalization induction and progress I regard general disappropriation as impossible attacked from that point the problem of universal association seems to me insolvable Property is like the dragon which Hercules killed to destroy it it must be taken not by the head but by the tail that is by profit and interest I stop I have said enough to satisfy any one who can read and understand The surest way by which the government can baffle intrigues and break up parties is to take possession of science and point out to the nation at an already appreciable distance the rising oriflamme of equality to say to those politicians of the tribune and the press for whose fruitless quarrels we pay so dearly You are rushing forward blind as you are to the abolition of property but the government marches with its eyes open You hasten the future by unprincipled and insincere controversy but the government which knows this future leads you thither by a happy and peaceful transition The present generation will not pass away before France the guide and model of civilized nations has regained her rank and legitimate influence But alas the government itself who shall enlighten it Who can induce it to accept this doctrine of equality whose terrible but decisive formula the most generous minds hardly dare to acknowledge I feel my whole being tremble when I think that the testimony of three men yes of three men who make it their business to teach and define would suffice to give full play to public opinion to change beliefs and to fix destinies Will not the three men be found May we hope or not What must we think of those who govern us In the world of sorrow in which the proletaire moves and where nothing is known of the intentions of power it must be said that despair prevails But you sir you who by function belong to the official world you in whom the people recognize one of their noblest friends and property its most prudent adversary what say you of our deputies our ministers our king Do you believe that the authorities are friendly to us Then let the government declare its position let it print its profession of faith in equality and I am dumb Otherwise I shall continue the war and the more obstinacy and malice is shown the oftener will I redouble my energy and audacity I have said before and I repeat it I have sworn not on the dagger and the death s head amid the horrors of a catacomb and in the presence of men besmeared with blood but I have sworn on my conscience to pursue property to grant it neither peace nor truce until I see it everywhere execrated I have not yet published half the things that I have to say concerning the right of domain nor the best things Let the knights of property if there are any who fight otherwise than by retreating be prepared every day for a new demonstration and accusation let them enter the arena armed with reason and knowledge not wrapped up in sophisms for justice will be done To become enlightened we must have liberty That alone suffices but it must be the liberty to use the reason in regard to all public matters And yet we hear on every hand authorities of all kinds and degrees crying Do not reason If a distinction is wanted here is one The PUBLIC use of the reason always should be free but the PRIVATE use ought always to be rigidly restricted By public use I mean the scientific literary use by private that which may be taken advantage of by civil officials and public functionaries Since the governmental machinery must be kept in motion in order to preserve unity and attain our object we must not reason we must obey But the same individual who is bound from this point of view to passive obedience has the right to speak in his capacity of citizen and scholar He can make an appeal to the public submit to it his observations on events which occur around him and in the ranks above him taking care however to avoid offences which are punishable Reason then as much as you like only obey Kant Fragment on the Liberty of Thought and of the Press Tissot s Translation These words of the great philosopher outline for me my duty I have delayed the reprint of the work entitled What is Property in order that I might lift the discussion to the philosophical height from which ridiculous clamor has dragged it down and that by a new presentation of the question I might dissipate the fears of good citizens I now reenter upon the public use of my reason and give truth full swing The second edition of the First Memoir on Property will immediately follow the publication of this letter Before issuing any thing further I shall await the observations of my critics and the company operation of the friends of the people and of equality Hitherto I have spoken in my own name and on my own personal responsibility It was my duty I was endeavoring to call attention to principles which antiquity could not discover because it knew nothing of the science which reveals them political economy I have then testified as to FACTS in short I have been a WITNESS Now my role changes It remains for me to deduce the practical consequences of the facts proclaimed The position of PUBLIC PROSECUTOR is the only one which I am henceforth fitted to fill and I shall sum up the case in the name of the PEOPLE I am sir with all the consideration that I owe to your talent and your character Your very humble and most obedient servant P J PROUDHON Pensioner of the Academy of Besancon P S During the session of April two the Chamber of Deputies rejected by a very large majority the literary property bill BECAUSE IT DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT Nevertheless literary property is only a special form of the right of property which everybody claims to understand Let us hope that this legislative precedent will not be fruitless for the cause of equality The consequence of the vote of the Chamber is the abolition of capitalistic property property incomprehensible contradictory impossible and absurd FOOTNOTES Footnote one In the French edition of Proudhon s works the above sketch of his

spared a book which had already excited the indignation of the magistrates M Vivien is not the only official to whom I have been indebted since my first publication for assistance and protection but such generosity in the political arena is so rare that one may acknowledge it graciously and freely I have always thought for my part that bad institutions made bad magistrates just as the cowardice

ancestors appears in all its rudeness After having made first cousins heirs where there were no legitimate children they could not so divide the property between two different branches as to prevent the simultaneous existence of extreme wealth and extreme poverty in the same family For example James dying leaves two sons Peter and John heirs of his fortune James s property is divided equally between them But Peter has only one daughter while John his brother leaves six sons It is clear that to be true to the principle of equality and at the same time to that of heredity the two estates must be divided in seven equal portions among the children of Peter and John for otherwise a stranger might marry Peter s daughter and by this alliance half of the property of James the grandfather would be transferred to another family which is contrary to the principle of heredity Furthermore John s children would be poor on account of their number while their cousin being an only child would be rich which is contrary to the principle of equality If we extend this combined application of two principles apparently opposed to each other we shall become convinced that the right of succession which is assailed with so little wisdom in our day is no obstacle to the maintenance of equality Footnote thirteen Zeus klesios Footnote fourteen Giraud Investigations into the Right of Property among the Romans Footnote fifteen Precarious from precor I pray because the act of concession expressly signified that the lord in answer to the prayers of his men or slaves had granted them permission to labor Footnote sixteen I cannot conceive how any one dares to justify the inequality of conditions by pointing to the base inclinations and propensities of certain men Whence comes this shameful degradation of heart and mind to which so many fall victims if not from the misery and abjection into which property plunges them Footnote seventeen How many citizens are needed to support a professor of philosophy Thirty five millions How many for an economist Two billions And for a literary man who is neither a savant nor an artist nor a philosopher nor an economist and who writes newspaper novels None Footnote eighteen There is an error in the author s calculation here but the translator feeling sure that the reader will understand Proudhon s meaning prefers not to alter his figures Translator Footnote nineteen Hoc inter se differunt onanismus et manuspratio nempe quod haec a solitario exercetur ille autem a duobus reciprocatur masculo scilicet et faemina Porro foedam hanc onanismi venerem ludentes uxoria mariti habent nunc omnigm suavissimam Footnote twenty Polyandry plurality of husbands Footnote twenty one Infanticide has just been publicly advocated in England in a pamphlet written by a disciple of Malthus He proposes an ANNUAL MASSACRE OF THE INNOCENTS in all families containing more children than the law allows and he asks that a magnificent cemetery adorned with statues groves fountains and flowers be set apart as a special burying place for the superfluous children Mothers would resort to this delightful spot to dream of the happiness of these little angels and would return quite comforted to give birth to others to be buried in their turn Footnote twenty two To perform an act of benevolence towards one s neighbor is called in Hebrew to do justice in Greek to take compassion or pity from which is derived the French aumone in Latin to perform an act of love or charity in French give alms We can trace the degradation of this principle through these various expressions the first signifies duty the second only sympathy the third affection a matter of choice not an obligation the fourth caprice Footnote twenty three I mean here by equite what the Latins called humanitas that is the kind of sociability which is peculiar to man Humanity gentle and courteous to all knows how to distinguish ranks virtues and capacities without injury to any Footnote twenty four Justice and equite never have been understood Footnote twenty five Between woman and man there may exist love passion ties of custom and the like but there is no real society Man and woman are not companions The difference of the sexes places a barrier between them like that placed between animals by a difference of race Consequently far from advocating what is now called the emancipation of woman I should incline rather if there were no other alternative to exclude her from society Footnote twenty six The strong box of Cosmo de Medici was the grave of Florentine liberty said M Michelet to the College of France Footnote twenty seven My right is my lance and my buckler General de Brossard said like Achilles I get wine gold and women with my lance and my buckler Footnote twenty eight It would be interesting and profitable to review the authors who have written on usury or to use the gentler expression which some prefer lendingat interest The theologians always have opposed usury but since they have admitted always the legitimacy of rent and since rent is evidently identical with interest they have lost themselves in a labyrinth of subtle distinctions and have finally reached a pass where they do not know what to think of usury The Church the teacher of morality so jealous and so proud of the purity of her doctrine has always been ignorant of the real nature of property and usury She even has proclaimed through her pontiffs the most deplorable errors Non potest mutuum said Benedict XIV locationi ullo pacto comparari Rent says Bossuet is as far from usury as heaven is from the earth How on such a doctrine condemn lending at interest how justify the Gospel which expressly forbids usury The difficulty of theologians is a very serious one Unable to refute the economical demonstrations which rightly assimilate interest to rent they no longer dare to condemn interest and they can say only that there must be such a thing as usury since the Gospel forbids it Footnote twenty nine I preach the Gospel I live by the Gospel said the Apostle meaning thereby that he lived by his labor The Catholic clergy prefer to live by property The struggles in the communes of the middle ages between the priests and bishops and the large proprietors and seigneurs are famous The papal excommunications fulminated in defence of ecclesiastical revenues are no less so Even to day the official organs of the Gallican clergy still maintain that the pay received by the clergy is not a salary but an indemnity for goods of which they were once proprietors and which were taken from them in eighty nine by the Third Estate The clergy prefer to live by the right of increase rather than by labor Footnote thirty The meaning ordinarily attached to the word anarchy is absence of principle absence of rule consequently it has been regarded as synonymous with disorder Footnote thirty one If such ideas are ever forced into the minds of the people it will be by representative government and the tyranny of talkers Once science thought and speech were characterized by the same expression To designate a thoughtful and a learned man they said a man quick to speak and powerful in discourse For a long time speech has been abstractly distinguished from science and reason Gradually this abstraction is becoming realized as the logicians say in society so that we have to day savants of many kinds who talk but little and TALKERS who are not even savants in the science of speech Thus a philosopher is no longer a savant he is a talker Legislators and poets were once profound and sublime characters now they are talkers A talker is a sonorous bell whom the least shock suffices to set in perpetual motion With the talker the flow of speech is always directly proportional to the poverty of thought Talkers govern the world they stun us they bore us they worry us they suck our blood and laugh at us As for the savants they keep silence if they wish to say a word they are cut short Let them write Footnote thirty two libertas librare libratio libra liberty to liberate libration balance pound words which have a common derivation Liberty is the balance of rights and duties To make a man free is to balance him with others that is to put him or their level Footnote thirty three In a monthly publication the first number of which has just appeared under the name of L Egalitaire self sacrifice is laid down as a principle of equality This is a confusion of ideas Self sacrifice taken alone is the last degree of inequality To seek equality in self sacrifice is to confess that equality is against nature Equality must be based upon justice upon strict right upon the principles invoked by the proprietor himself otherwise it will never exist Self sacrifice is superior to justice but it cannot be imposed as law because it is of such a nature as to admit of no reward It is indeed desirable that everybody shall recognize the necessity of self sacrifice and the idea of L Egalitaire is an excellent example Unfortunately it can have no effect What would you reply indeed to a man who should say to you I do not want to sacrifice myself Is he to be compelled to do so When self sacrifice is forced it becomes oppression slavery the exploitation of man by man Thus have the proletaires sacrificed themselves to property Footnote thirty four The disciples of Fourier have long seemed to me the most advanced of all modern socialists and almost the only ones worthy of the name If they had understood the nature of their task spoken to the people awakened their sympathies and kept silence when they did not understand if they had made less extravagant pretensions and had shown more respect for public intelligence perhaps the reform would now thanks to them be in progress But why are these earnest reformers continually bowing to power and wealth that is to all that is anti reformatory How in a thinking age can they fail to see that the world must be converted by DEMONSTRATION not by myths and allegories Why do they the deadly enemies of civilization borrow from it nevertheless its most pernicious fruits property inequality of fortune and rank gluttony concubinage prostitution what do I know theurgy magic and sorcery Why these endless denunciations of morality metaphysics and psychology when the abuse of these sciences which they do not understand constitutes their whole system Why this mania for deifying a man whose principal merit consisted in talking nonsense about things whose names even he did not know in the strongest language ever put upon paper Whoever admits the infallibility of a man becomes thereby incapable of instructing others Whoever denies his own reason will soon proscribe free thought The phalansterians would not fail to do it if they had the power Let them condescend to reason let them proceed systematically let them give us demonstrations instead of revelations and we will listen willingly Then let them organize manufactures agriculture and commerce let them make labor attractive and the most humble functions honorable and our praise shall be theirs Above all let them throw off that Illuminism which gives them the appearance of impostors or dupes rather than believers and apostles Footnote thirty five Individual possession is no obstacle to extensive cultivation and unity of exploitation If I have not spoken of the drawbacks arising from small estates it is because I thought it useless to repeat what so many others have said and what by this time all the world must know But I am surprised that the economists who have so clearly shown the disadvantages of spade husbandry have failed to see that it is caused entirely by property above all that they have not perceived that their plan for mobilizing the soil is a first step towards the abolition of property Footnote thirty six In the Chamber of Deputies during the session of the fifth of January eighteen forty one M Dufaure moved to renew the expropriation bill on the ground of public utility Footnote thirty seven What is Property Chap IV Ninth Proposition Footnote thirty eight Tu cognovisti sessionem meam et resurrectionem meam Psalm one hundred thirty nine Footnote thirty nine The emperor Nicholas has just compelled all the manufacturers in his empire to maintain at their own expense within their establishments small hospitals for the reception of sick workmen the number of beds in each being proportional to the number of laborers in the factory You profit by man s labor the Czar could have said to his proprietors you shall be responsible for man s life M Blanqui has said that such a measure could not succeed in France It would be an attack upon property a thing hardly conceivable even in Russia Scythia or among the Cossacks but among us the oldest sons of civilization I fear very much that this quality of age may prove in the end a mark of decrepitude Footnote forty Course of M Blanqui Lecture of Nov two hundred seventy one thousand eight hundred forty Footnote forty one In Mazaniello the Neapolitan fisherman demands amid the applause of the galleries that a tax be levied upon luxuries Footnote forty two Seme le champ proletaire C est l l oisif qui recoltera Footnote forty three In some countries the enjoyment of certain political rights depends upon the amount of property But in these same countries property is expressive rather than attributive of the qualifications necessary to the exercise of these rights It is rather a conjectural proof than the cause of these qualifications Rossi Treatise on Penal Law Footnote forty four Lecture of December twenty two Footnote forty five Lecture of Jan fifteen eighteen forty one Footnote forty six Lecture of Jan fifteen eighteen forty one Footnote forty seven MM Blanqui and Wolowski Footnote forty eight Subject proposed by the Fourth Class of the Institute the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences What would be the effect upon the working class of the organization of labor according to the modern ideas of association Footnote forty nine Subject proposed by the Academy of Besancon The economical and moral consequences in France up to the present time and those which seem likely to appear in future of the law concerning the equal division of hereditary property between the children Footnote fifty greater property The Vulgate translates it avaritia Footnote fifty one Similar or analogous customs have existed among all nations Consult among other works Origin of French Law by M Michelet and Antiquities of German Law by Grimm Footnote fifty two Dees hominesque testamur nos arma neque contra patriam cepisse neque quo periculum aliis faceremus

Lapsis In this passage saint Cyprian alludes to lending on mortgages and to compound interest Footnote fifty five Inquiries concerning Property among the Romans Footnote fifty six Its acquisitive nature works rapidly in the sleep of the law It is ready at the word to absorb every thing Witness the famous equivocation about the ox hide which when cut up into thongs was large enough to enclose the site of Carthage The legend has reappeared several times since Dido Such is the love of man for the land Limited by tombs measured by the members of the human body by the thumb the foot and the arm it harmonizes as far as possible with the very proportions of man Nor is he satisfied yet he calls Heaven to witness that it is his he tries to or his land to give it the form of heaven In his titanic intoxication he describes property in the very terms which he employs in describing the Almighty fundus optimus maximus He shall make it his couch and they shall be separated no more Michelet Origin of French Law Footnote fifty seven M Guizot denies that Christianity alone is entitled to the glory of the abolition of slavery To this end he says many causes were necessary the evolution of other ideas and other principles of civilization So general an assertion cannot be refuted Some of these ideas and causes should have been pointed out that we might judge whether their source was not wholly Christian or whether at least the Christian spirit had not penetrated and thus fructified them Most of the emancipation charters begin with these words For the love of God and the salvation of my soul Footnote fifty eight Weregild the fine paid for the murder of a man So much for a count so much for a baron so much for a freeman so much for a priest for a slave nothing His value was restored to the proprietor Footnote fifty nine The spirit of despotism and monopoly which animated the communes has not escaped the attention of historians The formation of the commoners associations says Meyer did not spring from the true spirit of liberty but from the desire for exemption from the charges of the seigniors from individual interests and jealousy of the welfare of others Each commune or corporation opposed the creation of every other and this spirit increased to such an extent that the King of England Henry V having established a university at Caen in fourteen thirty two the city and university of Paris opposed the registration of the edict Footnote sixty Feudalism was in spirit and in its providential destiny a long protest of the human personality against the monkish communism with which Europe in the middle ages was overrun After the orgies of Pagan selfishness society carried to the opposite extreme by the Christian religion risked its life by unlimited self denial and absolute indifference to the pleasures of the world Feudalism was the balance weight which saved Europe from the combined influence of the religious communities and the Manlchean sects which had sprung up since the fourth century under different names and in different countries Modern civilization is indebted to feudalism for the definitive establishment of the person of marriage of the family and of country See on this subject Guizot History of Civilization in Europe Footnote sixty one This was made evident in July eighteen thirty and the years which followed it when the electoral bourgeoisie effected a revolution in order to get control over the king and suppressed the emeutes in order to restrain the people The bourgeoisie through the jury the magistracy its position in the army and its municipal despotism governs both royalty and the people It is the bourgeoisie which more than any other class is conservative and retrogressive It is the bourgeoisie which makes and unmakes ministries It is the bourgeoisie which has destroyed the influence of the Upper Chamber and which will dethrone the King whenever he shall become unsatisfactory to it It is to please the bourgeoisie that royalty makes itself unpopular It is the bourgeoisie which is troubled at the hopes of the people and which hinders reform The journals of the bourgeoisie are the ones which preach morality and religion to us while reserving scepticism and indifference for themselves which attack personal government and favor the denial of the electoral privilege to those who have no property The bourgeoisie will accept any thing rather than the emancipation of the proletariat As soon as it thinks its privileges threatened it will unite with royalty and who does not know that at this very moment these two antagonists have suspended their quarrels It has been a question of property Footnote sixty two The same opinion was recently expressed from the tribune by one of our most honorable Deputies M Gauguier Nature said he has not endowed man with landed property Changing the adjective LANDED which designates only a species into CAPITALISTIC which denotes the genus M Gauguier made an egalitaire profession of faith Footnote sixty three A professor of comparative legislation M Lerminier has gone still farther He has dared to say that the nation took from the clergy all their possessions not because of IDLENESS but because of UNWORTHINESS You have civilized the world cries this apostle of equality speaking to the priests and for that reason your possessions were given you In your hands they were at once an instrument and a reward But you do not now deserve them for you long since ceased to civilize any thing whatever Footnote sixty four Treatise on Prescription Footnote sixty five Origin of French Law Footnote sixty six To honor one s parents to be grateful to one s benefactors to neither kill nor steal truths of inward sensation To obey God rather than men to render to each that which is his the whole is greater than a part a straight line is the shortest road from one point to another truths of intuition All are a priori but the first are felt by the conscience and imply only a simple act of the soul the second are perceived by the reason and imply comparison and relation In short the former are sentiments the latter are ideas Footnote sixty seven Armand Carrel would have favored the fortification of the capital Le National has said again and again placing the name of its old editor by the side of the names of Napoleon and Vauban What signifies this exhumation of an anti popular politician It signifies that Armand Carrel wished to make government an individual and irremovable but elective property and that he wished this property to be elected not by the people but by the army The political system of Carrel was simply a reorganization of the pretorian guards Carrel also hated the pequins That which he deplored in the revolution of July was not they say the insurrection of the people but the victory of the people over the soldiers That is the reason why Carrel after eighteen thirty would never support the patriots Do you answer me with a few regiments he asked Armand Carrel regarded the army the military power as the basis of law and government This man undoubtedly had a moral sense within him but he surely had no sense of justice Were he still in this world I declare it boldly liberty would have no greater enemy than Carrel Footnote sixty eight In a very short article which was read by M Wolowski M Louis Blanc declares in substance that he is not a communist which I easily believe that one must be a fool to attack property but he does not say why and that it is very necessary to guard against confounding property with its abuses When Voltaire overthrew Christianity he repeatedly avowed that he had no spite against religion but only against its abuses Footnote sixty nine The property fever is at its height among writers and artists and it is curious to see the complacency with which our legislators and men of letters cherish this devouring passion An artist sells a picture and then the merchandise delivered assumes to prevent the purchaser from selling engravings under the pretext that he the painter in selling the original has not sold his DESIGN A dispute arises between the amateur and the artist in regard to both the fact and the law M Villemain the Minister of Public Instruction being consulted as to this particular case finds that the painter is right only the property in the design should have been specially reserved in the contract so that in reality M Villemain recognizes in the artist a power to surrender his work and prevent its communication thus contradicting the legal axiom One CANNOT GIVE AND KEEP AT THE SAME TIME A strange reasoner is M Villemain An ambiguous principle leads to a false conclusion Instead of rejecting the principle M Villemain hastens to admit the conclusion With him the reductio ad absurdum is a convincing argument Thus he is made official defender of literary property sure of being understood and sustained by a set of loafers the disgrace of literature and the plague of public morals Why then does M Villemain feel so strong an interest in setting himself up as the chief of the literary classes in playing for their benefit the role of Trissotin in the councils of the State and in becoming the accomplice and associate of a band of profligates soi disant men of letters who for more than ten years have labored with such deplorable success to ruin public spirit and corrupt the heart by warping the mind Footnote seventy M Leroux has been highly praised in a review for having defended property I do not know whether the industrious encyclopedist is pleased with the praise but I know very well that in his place I should mourn for reason and for truth Footnote seventy one Impartial of Besancon Footnote seventy two The Arians deny the divinity of Christ The Semi Arians differ from the Arians only by a few subtle distinctions M Pierre Leroux who regards Jesus as a man but claims that the Spirit of God was infused into him is a true Semi Arian The Manicheans admit two company existent and eternal principles God and matter spirit and flesh light and darkness good and evil but unlike the Phalansterians who pretend to reconcile the two the Manicheans make war upon matter and labor with all their might for the destruction of the flesh by condemning marriage and forbidding reproduction which does not prevent them however from indulging in all the carnal pleasures which the intensest lust can conceive of In this last particular the tendency of the Fourieristic morality is quite Manichean The Gnostics do not differ from the early Christians As their name indicates they regarded themselves as inspired Fourier who held peculiar ideas concerning the visions of somnambulists and who believed in the possibility of developing the magnetic power to such an extent as to enable us to commune with invisible beings might if he were living pass also for a Gnostic The Adamites attend mass entirely naked from motives of chastity Jean Jacques Rousseau who took the sleep of the senses for chastity and who saw in modesty only a refinement of pleasure inclined towards Adamism I know such a sect whose members usually celebrate their mysteries in the costume of Venus coming from the bath The Pre Adamites believe that men existed before the first man I once met a Pre Adamite True he was deaf and a Fourierist The Pelagians deny grace and attribute all the merit of good works to liberty The Fourierists who teach that man s nature and passions are good are reversed Pelagians they give all to grace and nothing to liberty The Socinians deists in all other respects admit an original revelation Many people are Socinians to day who do not suspect it and who regard their opinions as new The Neo Christians are those simpletons who admire Christianity because it has produced bells and cathedrals Base in soul corrupt in heart dissolute in mind and senses the Neo Christians seek especially after the external form and admire religion as they love women for its physical beauty They believe in a coming revelation as well as a transfiguration of Catholicism They will sing masses at the grand spectacle in the phalanstery Footnote seventy three It should be understood that the above refers only to the moral and political doctrines of Fourier doctrines which like all philosophical and religious systems have their root and raison d existence in society itself and for this reason deserve to be examined The peculiar speculations of Fourier and his sect concerning cosmogony geology natural history physiology and psychology I leave to the attention of those who would think it their duty to seriously refute the fables of Blue Beard and the Ass s Skin Footnote seventy four A writer for the radical press M Louis Raybaud said in the preface to his Studies of Contemporary Reformers Who does not know that morality is relative Aside from a few grand sentiments which are strikingly instinctive the measure of human acts varies with nations and climates and only civilization the progressive education of the race can lead to a universal morality The absolute escapes our contingent and finite nature the absolute is the secret of God God keep from evil M Louis Raybaud But I cannot help remarking that all political apostates begin by the negation of the absolute which is really the negation of truth What can a writer who professes scepticism have in common with radical views What has he to say to his readers What judgment is he entitled to pass upon contemporary reformers M Raybaud thought it would seem wise to repeat an old impertinence of the legist and that may serve him for an excuse We all have these weaknesses But I am surprised that a man of so much intelligence as M Raybaud who STUDIES SYSTEMS fails to see the very thing he ought first to recognize namely that systems are the progress of the mind towards the absolute Footnote seventy five The electoral reform it is continually asserted is not an END but a MEANS Undoubtedly but what then is the end Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its object How can the people choose their representatives unless they know in advance the purpose for which they choose them and the object of the commission which they entrust to them But it is said the very business of those chosen by the people is to find out the object of the reform That is a quibble What is to hinder these persons who are to be elected in future from first seeking for this object and then when they have found it from communicating it to the people The reformers have well said that while the object of the electoral reform remains in the least indefinite it will be only a means of transferring power from the hands of petty tyrants to the hands of other tyrants We know already how a nation may be oppressed by being led to believe that it is obeying only its own laws The history of universal suffrage among all nations is the history of the restrictions of liberty by and in the name of the multitude Still if the electoral reform in its present shape were rational practical acceptable to clean consciences and upright minds perhaps one might be excused though ignorant of its object for supporting it But no the text of the petition determines nothing makes no distinctions requires no conditions no guarantee it establishes the right without the duty Every Frenchman is a voter and eligible to office As well say Every bayonet is intelligent every savage is civilized every slave is free In its vague generality the reformatory petition is the weakest of abstractions or the highest form of political treason Consequently the enlightened patriots distrust and despise each other The most radical writer of the time he whose economical and social theories are without comparison the most advanced M Leroux has taken a bold stand against universal suffrage and democratic government and has written an exceedingly keen criticism of J J Rousseau That is undoubtedly the reason why M Leroux is no longer the philosopher of Le National That journal like Napoleon does not like men of ideas Nevertheless Le National ought to know that he who fights against ideas will perish by ideas End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of What is Property by P J Proudhon END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHAT IS PROPERTY This file
