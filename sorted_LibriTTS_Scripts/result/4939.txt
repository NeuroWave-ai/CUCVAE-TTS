Flaubert pessimist and master of cadenced lyric prose urged young writers to lead ascetic lives that in their art they might be violent Chopin s violence was psychic a travailing and groaning of the spirit the bright roughness of adventure was missing from his quotidian existence The tragedy was within One recalls Maurice Maeterlinck Whereas most of our life is passed far from blood cries and swords and the tears of men have become silent invisible and almost spiritual Chopin went from Poland to France from Warsaw to Paris where finally he was borne to his grave in Pere la Chaise He lived loved and died and not for him were the perils prizes and fascinations of a hero s career He fought his battles within the walls of his soul we may note and enjoy them in his music His outward state was not niggardly of incident though his inner life was richer nourished as it was in the silence and the profound unrest of a being that irritably resented every intrusion There were events that left ineradicable impressions upon his nature upon his work his early love his sorrow at parting from parents and home the shock of the Warsaw revolt his passion for George Sand the death of his father and of his friend Matuszynski and the rupture with Madame Sand these were crises of his history All else was but an indeterminate factor in the scheme of his earthly sojourn Chopin though not an anchorite resembled Flaubert being both proud and timid he led a detached life hence his art was bold and violent Unlike Liszt he seldom sought the glamor of the theatre and was never in such public view as his maternal admirer Sand He was Frederic Francois Chopin composer teacher of piano and a lyric genius of the highest range Recently the date of his birth has been again discussed by Natalie Janotha the Polish pianist Chopin was born in Zelazowa Wola six miles from Warsaw March one eighteen oh nine This place is sometimes spelled Jeliasovaya Volia The medallion made for the tomb by Clesinger the son in law of George Sand and the watch given by the singer Catalan in eighteen twenty with the inscription Donne par Madame Catalan a Frederic Chopin age de dix ans have incited a conflict of authorities Karasowski was informed by Chopin s sister that the correct year of his birth was eighteen oh nine and Szulc Sowinski and Niecks agree with him Szulc asserts that the memorial in the Holy Cross Church Warsaw where Chopin s heart is preserved bears the date March two eighteen oh nine Chopin so Henry T Finck declares was twenty two years of age when he wrote to his teacher Elsner in eighteen thirty one Liszt told Niecks in eighteen seventy eight that Karasowski had published the correct date in his biography Now let us consider Janotha s arguments According to her evidence the composer s natal day was February twenty two eighteen ten and his christening occurred April twenty eight of the same year The following baptismal certificate originally in Latin and translated by Finck is adduced It is said to be from the church in which Chopin was christened I the above have performed the ceremony of baptizing in water a boy with the double name Frederic Francois on the twenty twod day of February son of the musicians Nicolai Choppen a Frenchman and Justina de Krzyzanowska his legal spouse God parents the musicians Franciscus Grembeki and Donna Anna Skarbekowa Countess of Zelazowa Wola The wrong date was chiselled upon the monument unveiled October fourteen eighteen ninety four at Chopin s birthplace erected practically through the efforts of Milia Balakireff the Russian composer Janotha whose father founded the Warsaw Conservatory informed Finck that the later date has also been put on other monuments in Poland Now Chopin s father was not a musician neither was his mother I cannot trace Grembeki but we know that the Countess Skarbek mother of Chopin s namesake was not a musician however the title musician in the baptismal certificate may have signified something eulogistic at that time Besides the Polish clergy was not a particularly accurate class But Janotha has more testimony in her controversy with me in eighteen ninety six she quoted Father Bielawski the present cure of Brochow parish church of Zelazowa Wola this reverend person consulted records and gave as his opinion that eighteen ten is authentic Nevertheless the biography of Wojcicki and the statement of the Chopin family contradict him And so the case stands Janotha continues firm in her belief although authorities do not justify her position All this petty pother arose since Niecks comprehensive biography appeared So sure was he of his facts that he disposed of the pseudo date in one footnote Perhaps the composer was to blame artists male as well as female have been known to make themselves younger in years by conveniently forgetting their birthdate or by attributing the error to carelessness in the registry of dates Surely the Chopin family could not have been mistaken in such an important matter Regarding Chopin s ancestry there is still a moiety of doubt His father was born August seventeen seventeen seventy the same year as Beethoven at Nancy Lorraine Some claim that he had Polish blood in his veins Szulc claims that he was the natural son of a Polish nobleman who followed King Stanislas Leszcinski to Lorraine dropping the Szopen or Szop for the more Gallic Chopin When Frederic went to Paris he in turn changed the name from Szopen to Chopin which is common in France Chopin s father emigrated to Warsaw in seventeen eighty seven enticed by the offer of a compatriot there in the tobacco business and was the traditional Frenchman of his time well bred agreeable and more than usually cultivated He joined the national guard during the Kosciuszko revolution in seventeen ninety four When business stagnated he was forced to teach in the family of the Leszynskis Mary of that name one of his pupils being beloved by Napoleon I became the mother of Count Walewski a minister of the second French empire Drifting to Zelazowa Wola Nicholas Chopin lived in the house of the Countess Skarbek acting as tutor to her son Frederic There he made the acquaintance of Justina Krzyzanowska born of poor but noble parents He married her in eighteen oh six and she bore him four children three girls and the boy Frederic Francois With a refined scholarly French father Polish in political sentiments and an admirable Polish mother patriotic to the extreme Frederic grew to be an intelligent vivacious home loving lad Never a hearty boy but never very delicate he seemed to escape most of the disagreeable ills of childhood The moonstruck pale sentimental calf of many biographers he never was Strong evidence exists that he was merry pleasure loving and fond of practical jokes While his father was never rich the family after the removal to Warsaw lived at ease The country was prosperous and Chopin the elder became a professor in the Warsaw Lyceum His children were brought up in an atmosphere of charming simplicity love and refinement The mother was an ideal mother and as George Sand declared Chopin s only love But as we shall discover later Lelia was ever jealous jealous even of Chopin s past His sisters were gifted gentle and disposed to pet him Niecks has killed all the pretty fairy tales of his poverty and suffering Strong common sense ruled the actions of Chopin s parents and when his love for music revealed itself at an early age they engaged a teacher named Adalbert Zwyny a Bohemian who played the violin and taught piano Julius Fontana one of the first friends of the boy he committed suicide in Paris December thirty one eighteen sixty nine says that at the age of twelve Chopin knew so much that he was left to himself with the usual good and ill results He first played on February twenty four eighteen eighteen a concerto by Gyrowetz and was so pleased with his new collar that he naively told his mother Everybody was looking at my collar His musical precocity not as marked as Mozart s but phenomenal withal brought him into intimacy with the Polish aristocracy and there his taste for fashionable society developed The Czartoryskis Radziwills Skarbeks Potockis Lubeckis and the Grand Duke Constantine with his Princess Lowicka made life pleasant for the talented boy Then came his lessons with Joseph Elsner in composition lessons of great value Elsner saw the material he had to mould and so deftly did he teach that his pupil s individuality was never checked never warped For Elsner Chopin entertained love and reverence to him he wrote from Paris asking his advice in the matter of studying with Kalkbrenner and this advice he took seriously From Zwyny and Elsner even the greatest ass must learn something he is quoted as having said Then there are the usual anecdotes one is tempted to call them the stock stories of the boyhood of any great composer In infancy Chopin could not hear music without crying Mozart was morbidly sensitive to the tones of a trumpet Later the Polish lad sported familiarly with his talents for he is related to have sent to sleep and awakened a party of unruly boys at his father s school Another story is his fooling of a Jew merchant He had high spirits perhaps too high for his slender physique He was a facile mimic and Liszt Balzac Bocage Sand and others believed that he would have made an actor of ability With his sister Emilia he wrote a little comedy Altogether he was a clever if not a brilliant lad His letters show that he was not the latter for while they are lively they do not reveal much literary ability But their writer saw with open eyes eyes that were disposed to caricature the peculiarities of others This trait much clarified and spiritualized in later life became a distinct ironic note in his character Possibly it attracted Heine although his irony was on a more intellectual plane His piano playing at this time was neat and finished and he had already begun those experimentings in technique and tone that afterward revolutionized the world of music and the keyboard He being sickly and his sister s health poor the pair was sent in eighteen twenty six to Reinerz a watering place in Prussian Silesia This with a visit to his godmother a titled lady named Wiesiolowska and a sister of Count Frederic Skarbek the name does not tally with the one given heretofore as noted by Janotha consumed this year In eighteen twenty seven he left his regular studies at the Lyceum and devoted his time to music He was much in the country listening to the fiddling and singing of the peasants thus laying the corner stone of his art as a national composer In the fall of eighteen twenty eight he went to Berlin and this trip gave him a foretaste of the outer world Stephen Heller who saw Chopin in eighteen thirty described him as pale of delicate health and not destined so they said in Warsaw for a long life This must have been during one of his depressed periods for his stay in Berlin gives a record of unclouded spirits However his sister Emilia died young of pulmonary trouble and doubtless Frederic was predisposed to lung complaint He was constantly admonished by his relatives to keep his coat closed Perhaps as in Wagner s case the uncontrollable gayety and hectic humors were but so many signs of a fatal disintegrating process Wagner outlived them until the Scriptural age but Chopin succumbed when grief disappointment and intense feeling had undermined him For the dissipations of the average sensual man he had an abiding contempt He never smoked in fact disliked it His friend Sand differed greatly in this respect and one of the saddest anecdotes related by De Lenz accuses her of calling for a match to light her cigar Frederic un fidibus she commanded and Frederic obeyed mister Philip Hale mentions a letter from Balzac to his Countess Hanska dated March fifteen eighteen forty one which concludes George Sand did not leave Paris last year She lives at Rue Pigalle No sixteen Chopin is always there Elle ne fume que des cigarettes et pas autre chose mister Hale states that the italics are in the letter So much for De Lenz and his fidibus I am impelled here to quote from mister Earnest Newman s Study of Wagner because Chopin s exaltation of spirits alternating with irritability and intense depression were duplicated in Wagner mister Newman writes of Wagner There have been few men in whom the torch of life has burned so fiercely In his early days he seems to have had that gayety of temperament and that apparently boundless energy which men in his case as in that of Heine Nietzsche Amiel and others have wrongly assumed to be the outcome of harmonious physical and mental health There is a pathetic exception in the outward lives of so many men of genius the bloom being to the instructed eye only the indication of some subtle nervous derangement only the forerunner of decay The overmastering cerebral agitation that obsessed Wagner s life was as with Chopin a symptom not a sickness but in the latter it had not yet assumed a sinister turn Chopin s fourteen days in Berlin he went there under the protection of his father s friend Professor Jarocki to attend the great scientific congress were full of joy unrestrained The pair left Warsaw September nine eighteen twenty eight and after five days travel in a diligence arrived at Berlin This was a period of leisure travelling and living Frederic saw Spontini Mendelssohn and Zelter at a distance and heard Freischutz He attended the congress and made sport of the scientists Alexander von Humboldt included On the way home they stopped at a place called Zullichau and Chopin improvised on Polish airs so charmingly that the stage was delayed all hands turning in to listen This is another of the anecdotes of honorable antiquity Count Tarnowski relates that Chopin left Warsaw with a light heart with a mind full of ideas perhaps full of dreams of fame and happiness I have only twenty kreuzers in my pockets he writes in his note book and it seems to me that I am richer than Arthur Potocki whom I met only a moment ago besides this witty conceptions fun showing a quiet and cheerful spirit for example May it be permitted to me to sign myself as belonging to the circle of your friends F Chopin Or A welcome moment in which I can express to you my friendship F Chopin office clerk Or again Ah my most lordly sir I do not myself yet understand the joy which I feel on entering the circle of your real friends F Chopin penniless These letters have a Micawber ring but they indicate Chopin s love of jest Sikorski tells a story of the lad s improvising in church so that the priest choir and congregation were forgotten by him The travellers arrived at Warsaw October six after staying a few days in Posen where the Prince Radziwill lived here Chopin played in private This prince composer despite what Liszt wrote did not contribute a penny to the youth s musical education though he always treated him in a sympathetic manner Hummel and Paganini visited Warsaw in eighteen twenty nine The former he met and admired the latter he worshipped This year may have seen the composition if not the publication of the Souvenir de Paganini said to be in the key of A major and first published in the supplement of the Warsaw Echo Muzyczne Niecks writes that he never saw a copy of this rare composition Paderewski tells me he has the piece and that it is weak having historic interest only I cannot find much about the Polish poet Julius Slowacki who died the same year eighteen forty nine as Edgar Allan Poe Tarnowski declares him to have been Chopin s warmest friend and in his poetry a starting point of inspiration for the composer In July eighteen twenty nine accompanied by two friends Chopin started for Vienna Travelling in a delightful old fashioned manner the party saw much of the country Galicia Upper Silesia and Moravia the Polish Switzerland On July thirty one they arrived in the Austrian capital Then Chopin first began to enjoy an artistic atmosphere to live less parochially His home life sweet and tranquil as it was could not fail to hurt him as artist he was flattered and coddled and doubtless the touch of effeminacy in his person was fostered In Vienna the life was gayer freer and infinitely more artistic than in Warsaw He met every one worth knowing in the artistic world and his letters at that period are positively brimming over with gossip and pen pictures of the people he knew The little drop of malice he injects into his descriptions of the personages he encounters is harmless enough and proves that the young man had considerable wit Count Gallenberg the lessee of the famous Karnthnerthor Theatre was kind to him and the publisher Haslinger treated him politely He had brought with him his variations on La ci darem la mano altogether the times seemed propitious and much more so when he was urged to give a concert Persuaded to overcome a natural timidity he made his Vienna debut at this theatre August eleven eighteen twenty nine playing on a Stein piano his Variations opus two His Krakowiak Rondo had been announced but the parts were not legible so instead he improvised He had success being recalled and his improvisation on the Polish tune called Chmiel and a theme from La Dame Blanche stirred up much enthusiasm in which a grumbling orchestra joined The press was favorable though Chopin s playing was considered rather light in weight His style was admired and voted original here the critics could see through the millstone while a lady remarked It s a pity his appearance is so insignificant This reached the composer s ear and caused him an evil quarter of an hour for he was morbidly sensitive but being like most Poles secretive managed to hide it August eighteen encouraged by his triumph Chopin gave a second concert on the same stage This time he played the Krakowiak and his talent for composition was discussed by the newspapers He plays very quietly without the daring elan which distinguishes the artist from the amateur said one his defect is the non observance of the indication of accent at the beginning of musical phrases What was then admired in Vienna was explosive accentuations and piano drumming The article continues As in his playing he was like a beautiful young tree that stands free and full of fragrant blossoms and ripening fruits so he manifested as much estimable individuality in his compositions where new figures and passages new forms unfolded themselves This rather acute critique translated by doctor Niecks is from the Wiener Theaterzeitung of August twenty eighteen twenty nine The writer of it cannot be accused of misoneism that hardening of the faculties of curiousness and prophecy that semi paralysis of the organs of hearing which afflicts critics of music so early in life and evokes rancor and dislike to novelties Chopin derived no money from either of his concerts By this time he was accustomed to being reminded of the lightness and exquisite delicacy of his touch and the originality of his style It elated him to be no longer mistaken for a pupil and he writes home that my manner of playing pleases the ladies so very much This manner never lost its hold over female hearts and the airs caprices and little struttings of Frederic are to blame for the widely circulated legend of his effeminate ways The legend soon absorbed his music and so it has come to pass that this fiction begotten of half fact and half mental indolence has taken root like the noxious weed it is When Rubinstein Tausig and Liszt played Chopin in passional phrases the public and critics were aghast This was a transformed Chopin indeed a Chopin transposed to the key of manliness Yet it is the true Chopin The young man s manners were a trifle feminine but his brain was masculine electric and his soul courageous His Polonaises Ballades Scherzi and Etudes need a mighty grip a grip mental and physical Chopin met Czerny He is a good man but nothing more he said of him Czerny admired the young pianist with the elastic hand and on his second visit to Vienna characteristically inquired Are you still industrious Czerny s brain was a tireless incubator of piano exercises while Chopin so fused the technical problem with the poetic idea that such a nature as the old pedagogue s must have been unattractive to him He knew Franz Lachner and other celebrities and seems to have enjoyed a mild flirtation with Leopoldine Blahetka a popular young pianist for he wrote of his sorrow at parting from her On August nineteen he left with friends for Bohemia arriving at Prague two days later There he saw everything and met Klengel of canon fame a still greater canon eer than the redoubtable Jadassohn of Leipzig Chopin and Klengel liked each other Three days later the party proceeded to Teplitz and Chopin played in aristocratic company He reached Dresden August twenty six heard Spohr s Faust and met capellmeister Morlacchi that same Morlacchi whom Wagner succeeded as a conductor January ten eighteen forty three vide Finck s Wagner By September twelve after a brief sojourn in Breslau Chopin was again safe at home in Warsaw About this time he fell in love with Constantia Gladowska a singer and pupil of the Warsaw Conservatory Niecks dwells gingerly upon his fervor in love and friendship a passion with him and thinks that it gives the key to his life Of his romantic friendship for Titus Woyciechowski and John Matuszynski his Johnnie there are abundant evidences in the letters They are like the letters of a love sick maiden But Chopin s purity of character was marked he shrank from coarseness of all sorts and the Fates only know what he must have suffered at times from George Sand and her gallant band of retainers To this impressionable man Parisian badinage not to call it anything stronger was positively antipathetical Of him we might indeed say in Lafcadio Hearn s words Every mortal man has been many million times a woman And was it the Goncourts who dared to assert that there are no women of genius women of genius are men Chopin needed an outlet for his sentimentalism His piano was but a sieve for some and we are rather amused than otherwise on reading the romantic nonsense of his boyish letters After the Vienna trip his spirits and his health flagged He was overwrought and Warsaw became hateful to him for he loved but had not the courage to tell it to the beloved one He put it on paper he played it but speak it he could not Here is a point that reveals Chopin s native indecision his inability to make up his mind He recalls to me the Frederic Moreau of Flaubert s L Education Sentimentale There is an atrophy of the will for Chopin can neither propose nor fly from Warsaw He writes letters that are full of self reproaches letters that must have both bored and irritated his friends Like many other men of genius he suffered all his life from folie de doute indeed his was what specialists call a beautiful case This halting and irresolution was a stumbling block in his career and is faithfully mirrored in his art Chopin went to Posen in October eighteen twenty nine and at the Radziwills was attracted by the beauty and talent of the Princess Elisa who died young George Sand has noted Chopin s emotional versatility in the matter of falling in and out of love He could accomplish both of an evening and a crumpled roseleaf was sufficient cause to induce frowns and capricious flights decidedly a young man tres difficile He played at the Ressource in November eighteen twenty nine the Variations opus two On March seventeen eighteen thirty he gave his first concert in Warsaw and selected the adagio and rondo of his first concerto the one in F minor and the Potpourri on Polish airs His playing was criticised for being too delicate an old complaint but the musicians Elsner Kurpinski and the rest were pleased Edouard Wolff said they had no idea in Warsaw of the real greatness of Chopin He was Polish this the public appreciated but of Chopin the individual they missed entirely the flavor A week later spurred by adverse and favorable criticism he gave a second concert playing the same excerpts from this concerto the slow movement is Constance Gladowska musically idealized the Krakowiak and an improvisation The affair was a success From these concerts he cleared six hundred dollars not a small sum in those days for an unknown virtuoso A sonnet was printed in his honor champagne was offered him by an enthusiastic Paris bred but not born pianist named Dunst who for this act will live in all chronicles of piano playing Worse still Orlowski served up the themes of his concerto into mazurkas and had the impudence to publish them Then came the last blow he was asked by a music seller for his portrait which he refused having no desire he said with a shiver to see his face on cheese and butter wrappers Some of the criticisms were glowing others absurd as criticisms occasionally are Chopin wrote to Titus the same rhapsodical protestations and finally declared in meticulous peevishness I will no longer read what people write about me This has the familiar ring of the true artist who cares nothing for the newspapers but reads them religiously after his own and his rivals concerts Chopin heard Henrietta Sontag with great joy he was ever a lover and a connoisseur of singing He advised young pianists to listen carefully and often to great singers Mdlle de Belleville the pianist and Lipinski the violinist were admired and he could write a sound criticism when he chose But the Gladowska is worrying him Unbearable longing is driving him to exile He attends her debut as Agnese in Paer s opera of that title and writes a complete description of the important function to Titus who is at his country seat where Chopin visits him betimes Agitated he thinks of going to Berlin or Vienna but after much philandering remains in Warsaw On October eleven eighteen thirty following many preparations and much emotional shilly shallying Chopin gave his third and last Warsaw concert He played the E minor concerto for the first time in public but not in sequence The first and last two movements were separated by an aria such being the custom of those days Later he gave the Fantasia on Polish airs Best of all for him Miss Gladowska sang a Rossini air wore a white dress and roses in her hair and was charmingly beautiful Thus Chopin and the details have all the relevancy of a male besieged by Dan Cupid Chopin must have played well He said so himself and he was always a cautious self critic despite his pride His vanity and girlishness peep out in his recital by the response to a quartet of recalls I believe I did it yesterday with a certain grace for Brandt had taught me how to do it properly He is not speaking of his poetic performance but of his bow to the public As he formerly spoke to his mother of his pretty collar so as young man he makes much of his deportment But it is all quite in the role scratch an artist and you surprise a child Of course Constantia sang wonderfully Her low B came out so magnificently that Zielinski declared it alone was worth a thousand ducats Ah these enamored ones Chopin left Warsaw November one eighteen thirty for Vienna and without declaring his love Or was he a rejected suitor History is dumb He never saw his Gladowska again for he did not return to Warsaw The lady was married in eighteen thirty two preferring a solid certainty to nebulous genius to Joseph Grabowski a merchant at Warsaw Her husband so saith a romantic biographer Count Wodzinski became blind perhaps even a blind country gentleman was preferable to a lachrymose pianist Chopin must have heard of the attachment in eighteen thirty one Her name almost disappears from his correspondence Time as well as other nails drove from his memory her image If she was fickle he was inconstant and so let us waste no pity on this episode over which lakes of tears have been shed and rivers of ink have been spilt Chopin was accompanied by Elsner and a party of friends as far as Wola a short distance from Warsaw There the pupils of the Conservatory sang a cantata by Elsner and after a banquet he was given a silver goblet filled with Polish earth being adjured so Karasowski relates never to forget his country or his friends wherever he might wander Chopin his heart full of sorrow left home parents friends and ideal severed with his youth and went forth in the world with the keyboard and a brain full of beautiful music as his only weapons At Kaliz he was joined by the faithful Titus and the two went to Breslau where they spent four days going to the theatre and listening to music Chopin played quite impromptu two movements of his E minor concerto supplanting a tremulous amateur In Dresden where they arrived November ten they enjoyed themselves with music Chopin went to a soiree at doctor Kreyssig s and was overwhelmed at the sight of a circle of dames armed with knitting needles which they used during the intervals of music making in the most formidable manner He heard Auber and Rossini operas and Rolla the Italian violinist and listened with delight to Dotzauer and Kummer the violoncellists the cello being an instrument for which he had a consuming affection Rubini the brother of the great tenor he met and was promised important letters of introduction if he desired to visit Italy He saw Klengel again who told the young Pole thereby pleasing him very much that his playing was like John Field s Prague was also visited and he arrived at Vienna in November There he confidently expected a repetition of his former successes but was disappointed Haslinger received him coldly and refused to print his variations or concerto unless he got them for nothing Chopin s first brush with the hated tribe of publishers begins here and he adopts as his motto the pleasing device Pay thou animal a motto he strictly adhered to in money matters Chopin was very particular The bulk of his extant correspondence is devoted to the exposure of the ways and wiles of music publishers Animal is the mildest term he applies to them Jew the most frequent objurgation After all Chopin was very Polish He missed his friends the Blahetkas who had gone to Stuttgart and altogether did not find things so promising as formerly No profitable engagements could be secured and to cap his misery Titus his other self left him to join the revolutionists in Poland November thirty His letters reflect his mental agitation and terror over his parents safety A thousand times he thought of renouncing his artistic ambitions and rushing to Poland to fight for his country He never did and his indecision it was not cowardice is our gain Chopin put his patriotism his wrath and his heroism into his Polonaises That is why we have them now instead of Chopin having been the target of some black browed Russian Chopin was psychically brave let us not cavil at the almost miraculous delicacy of his organization He wrote letters to his parents and to Matuszyriski but they are not despairing at least not to the former He pretended gayety and had great hopes for the future for he was living entirely on means supplied him by his father News of Constantia gladdened him and he decided to go to Italy but the revolution early in eighteen thirty one decided him for France doctor Malfatti was good to him and cheered him and he managed to accomplish much social visiting The letters of this period are most interesting He heard Sarah Heinefetter sing and listened to Thaiberg s playing of a movement of his own concerto Thalberg was three years younger than Chopin and already famous Chopin did not admire him Thalberg plays famously but he is not my man He plays forte and piano with the pedals but not with the hand takes tenths as easily as I do octaves and wears studs with diamonds Thalberg was not only too much of a technician for Chopin but he was also a Jew and a successful one In consequence both poet and Pole revolted Hummel called on Frederic but we hear nothing of his opinion of the elder man and his music this is all the more strange considering how much Chopin built on Hummel s style Perhaps that is the cause of the silence just as Wagner s dislike for Meyerbeer was the result of his obligations to the composer of Les Huguenots He heard Aloys Schmitt play and uttered the very Heinesque witticism that he is already over forty years old and composes eighty years old music This in a letter to Elsner Our Chopin could be amazingly sarcastic on occasion He knew Slavik the violin virtuoso Merk the cellist and all the music publishers At a concert given by Madame Garzia Vestris in April eighteen thirty one he appeared and in June gave a concert of his own at which he must have played the E minor concerto because of a passing mention in a musical paper He studied much and it was July twenty eighteen thirty one before he left Vienna after a second last and thoroughly discouraging visit Chopin got a passport vised for London passant par Paris Londres and had permission from the Russian Ambassador to go as far as Munich Then the cholera gave him some bother as he had to secure a clean bill of health but he finally got away The romantic story of I am only passing through Paris which he is reported to have said in after years has been ruthlessly shorn of its sentiment At Munich he played his second concerto and pleased greatly But he did not remain in the Bavarian capital hastening to Stuttgart where he heard of the capture of Warsaw by the Russians September eight eighteen thirty one This news it is said was the genesis of the great C minor etude in opus ten sometimes called the Revolutionary Chopin exclaimed in a letter dated December sixteen eighteen thirty one All this caused me much pain who could have foreseen it and in another letter he wrote How glad my mamma will be that I did not go back Count Tarnowski in his recollections prints some extracts from a diary said to have been kept by Chopin According to this his agitation must have been terrible Here are several examples My poor father My dearest ones Perhaps they hunger Maybe he has not anything to buy bread for mother Perhaps my sisters have fallen victims to the fury of the Muscovite soldiers Oh father is this the consolation of your old age Mother poor suffering mother is it for this you outlived your daughter And I here unoccupied And I am here with empty hands Sometimes I groan suffer and despair at the piano O God move the earth that it may swallow the humanity of this century May the most cruel fortune fall upon the French that they did not come to our aid All this sounds a trifle melodramatic and quite unlike Chopin He did not go to Warsaw but started for France at the end of September arriving early in October eighteen thirty one Poland s downfall had aroused him from his apathy even if it sent him further from her This journey as Liszt declares settled his fate Chopin was twenty two years old when he reached Paris II PARIS IN THE MAELSTROM Here according to Niecks is the itinerary of Chopin s life for the next eighteen years In Paris twenty seven Boulevard Poisonniere to five and thirty eight Chaussee d Antin to Aix la Chapelle Carlsbad Leipzig Heidelberg Marienbad and London to Majorca to five Rue Tronchet sixteen Rue Pigalle and nine Square d Orleans to England and Scotland to nine Square d Orleans once more Rue Chaillot and twelve Place Vendeme and then Pere la Chaise the last resting place It may be seen that Chopin was a restless though not roving nature In later years his inability to remain settled in one place bore a pathological impress consumptives are often so The Paris of eighteen thirty one the Paris of arts and letters was one of the most delightful cities in the world for the culture loving The molten tide of passion and decorative extravagance that swept over intellectual Europe three score years and ten ago bore on its foaming crest Victor Hugo prince of romanticists Near by was Henri Heine he left Heinrich across the Rhine Heine who dipped his pen in honey and gall who sneered and wept in the same couplet The star of classicism had seemingly set In the rich conflict of genius were Gautier Schumann and the rest All was romance fantasy and passion and the young men heard the moon sing silvery you remember De Musset and the leaves rustle rhythms to the heart beats of lovers Away with the gray beards cried he of the scarlet waistcoat and all France applauded Ernani Pity it was that the romantic infant had to die of intellectual anaemia leaving as a legacy the memories and work of one of the most marvellous groupings of genius since the Athens of Pericles The revolution of eighteen forty eight called from the mud the sewermen Flaubert his face to the past gazed sorrowfully at Carthage and wrote an epic of the French bourgeois Zola and his crowd delved into a moral morass and the world grew weary of them And then the faint fading flowers of romanticism were put into albums where their purple harmonies and subtle sayings are pressed into sweet twilight forgetfulness Berlioz mad Hector of the flaming locks whose orchestral ozone vivified the scores of Wagnerand Liszt began to sound garishly empty brilliantly superficial the colossal nightingale is difficult to classify even to day A romantic by temperament he unquestionably was But then his music all color nuance and brilliancy was not genuinely romantic in its themes Compare him with Schumann and the genuine romanticist tops the virtuoso Berlioz I suspect was a magnified virtuoso His orchestral technique is supreme but his music fails to force its way into my soul It pricks the nerves it pleases the sense of the gigantic the strange the formless but there is something uncanny about it all like some huge prehistoric bird an awful Pterodactyl with goggle eyes horrid snout and scream Berlioz like Baudelaire has the power of evoking the shudder But as John Addington Symonds wrote The shams of the classicists the spasms of the romanticists have alike to be abandoned Neither on a mock Parnassus nor on a paste board Blocksberg can the poet of the age now worship The artist walks the world at large beneath the light of natural day All this was before the Polish charmer distilled his sugared wormwood his sweet exasperated poison for thirsty souls in morbid Paris Think of the men and women with whom the new comer associated for his genius was quickly divined Hugo Lamartine Pere Lamenais ah what balm for those troubled days was in his Paroles d un Croyant Chateaubriand Saint Simon Merimee Gautier Liszt Victor Cousin Baudelaire Ary Scheffer Berlioz Heine who asked the Pole news of his muse the laughing nymph If she still continued to drape her silvery veil around the flowing locks of her green hair with a coquetry so enticing if the old sea god with the long white beard still pursued this mischievous maid with his ridiculous love De Musset De Vigny Rossini Meyerbeer Auber Sainte Beuve Adolphe Nourrit Ferdinand Hiller Balzac Dumas Heller Delacroix the Hugo of painters Michelet Guizot Thiers Niemcevicz and Mickiewicz the Polish bards and George Sand the quintessence of the Paris of art and literature The most eloquent page in Liszt s Chopin is the narrative of an evening in the Chaussee d Antin for it demonstrates the Hungarian s literary gifts and feeling for the right phrase This description of Chopin s apartment invaded by surprise has a hypnotizing effect on me The very furnishings of the chamber seem vocal under Liszt s fanciful pen In more doubtful taste is his statement that the glace which covers the grace of the elite as it does the fruit of their desserts could not have been satisfactory to Chopin Liszt despite his tendency to idealize Chopin after his death is our most trustworthy witness at this period Chopin was an ideal to Liszt though he has not left us a record of his defects The Pole was ombrageux and easily offended he disliked democracies in fact mankind in the bulk stunned him This is one reason combined with a frail physique of his inability to conquer the larger public Thalberg could do it his aristocratic tournure imperturbability beautiful touch and polished mechanism won the suffrage of his audiences Liszt never stooped to cajole He came he played he overwhelmed Chopin knew all this knew his weaknesses and fought to overcome them but failed Another crumpled roseleaf for this man of excessive sensibility Since told of Liszt and first related by him is the anecdote of Chopin refusing to play on being incautiously pressed after dinner giving as a reason Ah sir I have eaten so little Even though his host was gauche it cannot be denied that the retort was rude Chopin met Osborne Mendelssohn who rather patronized him with his Chopinetto Baillot the violinist and Franchomme the cellist With the latter he contracted a lasting friendship often playing duos with him and dedicating to him his G minor cello Sonata He called on Kalkbrenner then the first pianist of his day who was puzzled by the prodigious novelty of the young Pole s playing Having heard Herz and Hiller Chopin did not fear to perform his E minor concerto for him He tells all about the interview in a letter to Titus Are you a pupil of Field s was asked by Kalkbrenner who remarked that Chopin had the style of Cramer and the touch of Field Not having a standard by which to gauge the new phenomenon Kalkbrenner was forced to fall back on the playing of men he knew He then begged Chopin to study three years with him only three but Elsner in an earnest letter dissuaded his pupil from making any experiments that might hurt his originality of style Chopin actually attended the class of Kalkbrenner but soon quit for he had nothing to learn of the pompous penurious pianist The Hiller story of how Mendelssohn Chopin Liszt and Heller teased this grouty old gentleman on the Boulevard des Italiens is capital reading if not absolutely true Yet Chopin admired Kalkbrenner s finished technique despite his platitudinous manner Heine said or rather quoted Koreff that Kalkbrenner looked like a bonbon that had been in the mud Niecks thinks Chopin might have learned of Kalkbrenner on the mechanical side Chopin in public was modest about his attainments looking upon himself as self taught I cannot create a new school because I do not even know the old he said It is this very absence of scholasticism that is both the power and weakness of his music In reality his true technical ancestor was Hummel He played the E minor concerto first in Paris February twenty six eighteen thirty two and some smaller pieces Although Kalkbrenner Baillot and others participated Chopin was the hero of the evening The affair was a financial failure the audience consisting mostly of distinguished and aristocratic Poles Mendelssohn who disliked Kalkbrenner and was angered at his arrogance in asking Chopin to study with him applauded furiously After this Hiller writes nothing more was heard of Chopin s lack of technique The criticisms were favorable On May twenty eighteen thirty two Chopin appeared at a charity concert organized by Prince de la Moskowa He was lionized in society and he wrote to Titus that his heart beat in syncopation so exciting was all this adulation social excitement and rapid gait of living But he still sentimentalizes to Titus and wishes him in Paris A flirtation of no moment with Francilla Pixis the adopted daughter of Pixis the hunchback pianist cruelly mimicked by Chopin aroused the jealousy of the elder artist Chopin was delighted for he was malicious in a dainty way What do you think of this he writes I a dangerous seducteur The Paris letters to his parents were unluckily destroyed as Karasowski relates by Russian soldiers in Warsaw September nineteen eighteen sixty three and with them were burned his portrait by Ary Scheffer and his first piano The loss of the letters is irremediable Karasowski who saw some of them says they were tinged with melancholy Despite his artistic success Chopin needed money and began to consider again his projected trip to America Luckily he met Prince Valentine Radziwill on the street so it is said and was persuaded to play at a Rothschild soiree From that moment his prospects brightened for he secured paying pupils Niecks the iconoclast has run this story to earth and finds it built on airy romantic foundations Liszt Hiller Franchomme and Sowinski never heard of it although it was a stock anecdote of Chopin Chopin must have broadened mentally as well as musically in this congenial artistic environment He went about hobnobbed with princesses and of the effect of this upon his compositions there can be no doubt If he became more cosmopolitan he also became more artificial and for a time the salon with its perfumed elegant atmosphere threatened to drug his talent into forgetfulness of loftier aims Luckily the master sculptor Life intervened and real troubles chiselled his character on tragic broader and more passionate lines He played frequently in public during eighteen thirty two eighteen thirty three with Hiller Liszt Herz and Osborne and much in private There was some rivalry in this parterre of pianists Liszt Chopin and Hiller indulged in friendly contests and Chopin always came off winner when Polish music was essayed He delighted in imitating his colleagues Thalberg especially Adolphe Brisson tells of a meeting of Sand Chopin and Thalberg where as Mathias says the lady chattered like a magpie and Thalberg after being congratulated by Chopin on his magnificent virtuosity reeled off polite phrases in return doubtless he valued the Pole s compliments for what they were worth The moment his back was presented Chopin at the keyboard was mocking him It was then Chopin told Sand of his pupil Georges Mathias c est une bonne caboche Thalberg took his revenge whenever he could After a concert by Chopin he astonished Hiller by shouting on the way home In reply to questions he slily answered that he needed a forte as he had heard nothing but pianissimo the entire evening Chopin was never a hearty partisan of the Romantic movement Its extravagance misplaced enthusiasm turbulence attacks on church state and tradition disturbed the finical Pole while noise reclame and boisterousness chilled and repulsed him He wished to be the Uhland of Poland but he objected to smashing idols and refused to wade in gutters to reach his ideal He was not a fighter yet as one reviews the past half century it is his still small voice that has emerged from the din the golden voice of a poet and not the roar of the artistic demagogues of his day Liszt s influence was stimulating but what did not Chopin do for Liszt Read Schumann He managed in eighteen thirty four to go to Aix la Chapelle to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival There he met Hiller and Mendelssohn at the painter Schadow s and improvised marvellously so Hiller writes He visited Coblenz with Hiller before returning home Professor Niecks has a deep spring of personal humor which he taps at rare intervals He remarks that the coming to Paris and settlement there of his friend Matuszynski must have been very gratifying to Chopin who felt so much the want of one with whom to sigh This slanting allusion is matched by his treatment of George Sand After literally ratting her in a separate chapter he winds up his work with the solemn assurance that he abstains from pronouncing judgment because the complete evidence did not seem to me to warrant my doing so This is positively delicious When I met this biographer at Bayreuth in eighteen ninety six I told him how much I had enjoyed his work adding that I found it indispensable in the re construction of Chopin Professor Niecks gazed at me blandly he is most amiable and scholarly looking and remarked You are not the only one He was probably thinking of the many who have had recourse to his human documents of Chopin But Niecks in eighteen eighty eight built on Karasowski Liszt Schumann Sand and others so the process is bound to continue Since eighteen eighty eight much has been written of Chopin much surmised With Matuszysnki the composer was happier He devoutly loved his country and despite his sarcasm was fond of his countrymen Never an extravagant man he invariably assisted the Poles After eighteen thirty four five Chopin s activity as a public pianist began to wane He was not always understood and was not so warmly welcomed as he deserved to be on one occasion when he played the Larghetto of his F minor concerto in a Conservatoire concert its frigid reception annoyed him very much Nevertheless he appeared at a benefit concert at Habeneck s April twenty six eighteen thirty five The papers praised but his irritability increased with every public performance About this time he became acquainted with Bellini for whose sensuous melodies he had a peculiar predilection In July eighteen thirty five Chopin met his father at Carlsbad Then he went to Dresden and later to Leipzig playing privately for Schumann Clara Wieck Wenzel and Mendelssohn Schumann gushes over Chopin but this friendliness was never reciprocated On his return to Paris Chopin visited Heidelberg where he saw the father of his pupil Adolphe Gutmann and reached the capital of the civilized world the middle of October Meanwhile a love affair had occupied his attention in Dresden In September eighteen thirty five Chopin met his old school friends the Wodzinskis former pupils at his father s school He fell in love with their sister Marie and they became engaged He spoke to his father about the matter and for the time Paris and his ambitions were forgotten He enjoyed a brief dream of marrying and of settling near Warsaw teaching and composing the occasional dream that tempts most active artists soothing them with the notion that there is really a haven of rest from the world s buffets Again the gods intervened in the interest of music The father of the girl objected on the score of Chopin s means and his social position artists were not Paderewskis in those days although the mother favored the romance The Wodzinskis were noble and wealthy In the summer of eighteen thirty six at Marienbad Chopin met Marie again In eighteen thirty seven the engagement was broken and the following year the inconstant beauty married the son of Chopin s godfather Count Frederic Skarbek As the marriage did not prove a success perhaps the lady played too much Chopin a divorce ensued and later she married a gentleman by the name of Orpiszewski Count Wodzinski wrote Les Trois Romans de Frederic Chopin in which he asserts that his sister rejected Chopin at Marienbad in eighteen thirty six But Chopin survived the shock He went back to Paris and in July eighteen thirty seven accompanied by Camille Pleyel and Stanislas Kozmian visited England for the first time His stay was short only eleven days and his chest trouble dates from this time He played at the house of James Broadwood the piano manufacturer being introduced by Pleyel as M Fritz but his performance betrayed his identity His music was already admired by amateurs but the critics with a few exceptions were unfavorable to him Now sounds for the first time the sinister motif of the George Sand affair In deference to mister Hadow I shall not call it a liaison It was not in the vulgar sense Chopin might have been petty a common failing of artistic men but he was never vulgar in word or deed He disliked the woman with the sombre eye before he had met her Her reputation was not good no matter if George Eliot Matthew Arnold Elizabeth Barrett Browning and others believed her an injured saint mister Hadow indignantly repudiates anything that savors of irregularity in the relations of Chopin and Aurore Dudevant If he honestly believes that their contemporaries flagrantly lied and that the woman s words are to be credited why by all means let us leave the critic in his Utopia Mary Queen of Scots has her Meline why should not Sand boast of at least one apologist for her life besides herself I do not say this with cynical intent Nor do I propose to discuss the details of the affair which has been dwelt upon ad nauseam by every twanger of the romantic string The idealists will always see a union of souls the realists and there were plenty of them in Paris taking notes from eighteen thirty seven to eighteen forty seven view the alliance as a matter for gossip The truth lies midway Chopin a neurotic being met the polyandrous Sand a trampler on all the social and ethical conventions albeit a woman of great gifts repelled at first he gave way before the ardent passion she manifested toward him She was his elder so could veil the situation with the maternal mask and she was the stronger intellect more celebrated Chopin was but a pianist in the eyes of the many and so won by her magnetism the man she desired Paris artistic Paris was full of such situations Liszt protected the Countess d Agoult who bore him children Cosima Von Bulow Wagner among the rest Balzac Balzac that magnificent combination of Bonaparte and Byron pirate and poet was apparently leading the life of a saint but his most careful student Viscount Spelboerch de Lovenjoul whose name is veritably Balzac ian tells us some different stories even Gustave Flaubert the ascetic giant of Rouen had a romance with Madame Louise Colet a mediocre writer and imitator of Sand as was Countess d Agoult the Frankfort Jewess better known as Daniel Stern that lasted from eighteen forty six to eighteen fifty four according to Emile Faguet Here then was a medium which was the other side of good and evil a new transvaluation of morals as Nietzsche would say Frederic deplored the union for he was theoretically a Catholic Did he not once resent the visit of Liszt and a companion to his apartments when he was absent Indeed he may be fairly called a moralist Carefully reared in the Roman Catholic religion he died confessing that faith With the exception of the Sand episode his life was not an irregular one He abhorred the vulgar and tried to conceal this infatuation from his parents This intimacy however did the pair no harm artistically notwithstanding the inevitable sorrow and heart burnings at the close Chopin had some one to look after him he needed it and in the society of this brilliant Frenchwoman he throve amazingly his best work may be traced to Nohant and Majorca She on her side profited also After the bitterness of her separation from Alfred de Musset about eighteen thirty three she had been lonely for the Pagello intermezzo was of short duration The De Musset Sand story was not known in its entirety until eighteen ninety six Again M Spelboerch de Lovenjoul must be consulted as he possessed a bundle of letters that were written by George Sand and M Buloz the editor of La Revue des Deux Mondes in eighteen fifty eight De Musset went to Venice with Sand in the fall of eighteen thirty three They had the maternal sanction and means supplied by Madame de Musset The story gives forth the true Gallic resonance on being critically tapped De Musset returned alone sick in body and soul and thenceforth absinthe was his constant solace There had been references vague and disquieting of a doctor Pagello for whom Sand had suddenly manifested one of her extraordinary fancies This she denied but De Musset s brother plainly intimated that the aggravating cause of his brother s illness had been the unexpected vision of Sand coquetting with the young medical man called in to prescribe for Alfred doctor Pagello in eighteen ninety six was interviewed by doctor Cabanes of the Paris Figaro and here is his story of what had happened in eighteen thirty three This story will explain the later behavior of la merle blanche toward Chopin One night George Sand after writing three pages of prose full of poetry and inspiration took an unaddressed envelope placed therein the poetic declaration and handed it to doctor Pagello He seeing no address did not or feigned not to understand for whom the letter was intended and asked George Sand what he should do with it Snatching the letter from his hands she wrote upon the envelope To the Stupid Pagello Some days afterward George Sand frankly told De Musset that henceforth she could be to him only a friend De Musset died in eighteen fifty seven and after his death Sand startled Paris with Elle et Lui an obvious answer to Confessions of a Child of the Age De Musset s version an uncomplimentary one to himself of their separation The poet s brother Paul rallied to his memory with Lui et Elle and even Louisa Colet ventured into the fracas with a trashy novel called Lui During all this mud throwing the cause of the trouble calmly lived in the little Italian town of Belluno It was doctor Giuseppe Pagello who will go down in literary history as the one man that played Joseph to George Sand Now do you ask why I believe that Sand left Chopin when she was bored with him The words some days afterwards are significant I print the Pagello story not only because it is new but as a reminder that George Sand in her love affairs was always the man She treated Chopin as a child a toy used him for literary copy pace mister Hadow and threw him over after she had wrung out all the emotional possibilities of the problem She was true to herself even when she attempted to palliate her want of heart Beware of the woman who punctuates the pages of her life with heart and maternal feelings If I do not believe any more in tears it is because I saw thee crying exclaimed Chopin Sand was the product of abnormal forces she herself was abnormal and her mental activity while it created no permanent types in literary fiction was also abnormal She dominated Chopin as she had dominated Jules Sandeau Calmatta the mezzotinter De Musset Franz Liszt Delacroix Michel de Bourges I have not the exact chronological order and later Flaubert The most lovable event in the life of this much loved woman was her old age affair purely platonic with Gustave Flaubert The correspondence shows her to have been maternal to the last In the recently published Lettres a l etrangere of Honore de Balzac this about Sand is very apropos A visit paid to George Sand at Nohant in March eighteen thirty eight brought the following to Madame Hanska It was rather well that I saw her for we exchanged confidences regarding Sandeau I who blamed her to the last for deserting him now feel only a deep compassion for her as you will have for me when you learn with whom we have had relations she of love I of friendship But she has been even more unhappy with Musset So here she is in retreat denouncing both marriage and love because in both she has found nothing but delusion I will tell you of her immense and secret devotion to these two men and you will agree that there is nothing in common between angels and devils All the follies she has committed are claims to glory in the eyes of great and beautiful souls She has been the dupe of la Dorval Bocage Lamenais et cetera through the same sentiment she is the dupe of Liszt and Madame d Agoult So let us accept without too much questioning as did Balzac a reader of souls the Sand Chopin partnership and follow its sinuous course until eighteen forty seven Chopin met Sand at a musical matinee in eighteen thirty seven Niecks throttles every romantic yarn about the pair that has been spoken or printed He got his facts viva voce from Franchomme Sand was antipathetic to Chopin but her technique for overcoming masculine coyness was as remarkable in its particular fashion as Chopin s proficiency at the keyboard They were soon seen together and everywhere She was not musical not a trained musician but her appreciation for all art forms was highly sympathetic Not a beautiful woman being swarthy and rather heavy set in figure this is what she was as seen by Edouard Grenier She was short and stout but her face attracted all my attention the eyes especially They were wonderful eyes a little too close together it may be large with full eyelids and black very black but by no means lustrous they reminded me of unpolished marble or rather of velvet and this gave a strange dull even cold expression to her countenance Her fine eyebrows and these great placid eyes gave her an air of strength and dignity which was not borne out by the lower part of her face Her nose was rather thick and not over shapely Her mouth was also rather coarse and her chin small She spoke with great simplicity and her manners were very quiet But she attracted with imperious power all that she met Liszt felt this attraction at one time and it is whispered that Chopin was jealous of him Pouf the woman who could conquer Franz Liszt in his youth must have been a sorceress He too was versatile In eighteen thirty eight Sand s boy Maurice being ill she proposed a visit to Majorca Chopin went with the party in November and full accounts of the Mediterranean trip Chopin s illness the bad weather discomforts and all the rest may be found in the Histoire de Ma Vie by Sand It was a time of torment Chopin is a detestable invalid said Sand and so they returned to Nohant in June eighteen thirty nine They saw Genoa for a few days in May but that is as far as Chopin ever penetrated into the promised land Italy at one time a passion with him Sand enjoyed the subtle and truly feminine pleasure of again entering the city which six years before she had visited in company with another man the former lover of Rachel Chopin s health in eighteen thirty nine was a source of alarm to himself and his friends He had been dangerously ill at Majorca and Marseilles Fever and severe coughing proved to be the dread forerunners of the disease that killed him ten years later He was forced to be very careful in his habits resting more giving fewer lessons playing but little in private or public and becoming frugal of his emotions Now Sand began to cool though her lively imagination never ceased making graceful touching pictures of herself in the roles of sister of mercy mother and discreet friend all merged into one sentimental composite Her invalid was her one thought and for an active mind and body like hers it must have been irksome to submit to the caprices of a moody ailing man He composed at Nohant and she has told us all about it how he groaned wrote and re wrote and tore to pieces draft after draft of his work This brings to memory another martyr to style Gustave Flaubert who for forty years in a room at Croisset near Rouen wrestled with the devils of syntax and epithet Chopin was of an impatient nervous disposition All the more remarkable then his capacity for taking infinite pains Like Balzac he was never pleased with the final revise of his work he must needs aim at finishing touches His letters at this period are interesting for the Chopinist but for the most part they consist of requests made to his pupils Fontana Gutmann and others to jog the publishers to get him new apartments to buy him many things Wagner was not more importunate or minatory than this Pole who depended on others for the material comforts and necessities of his existence Nor is his abuse of friends and patrons the Leos and others indicative of an altogether frank sincere nature He did not hesitate to lump them all as pigs and Jews if anything happened to jar his nerves Money money is the leading theme of the Paris and Mallorean letters Sand was a spendthrift and Chopin had often to put his hands in his pocket for her He charged twenty francs a lesson but was not a machine and for at least four months of the year he earned nothing Hence his anxiety to get all he could for his compositions Heaven born geniuses are sometimes very keen in financial transactions and indeed why should they not be In eighteen thirty nine Chopin met Moscheles They appeared together at saint Cloud playing for the royal family Chopin received a gold cup Moscheles a travelling case The King gave him this said the amiable Frederic to get the sooner rid of him There were two public concerts in eighteen forty one and eighteen forty two the first on April twenty six at Pleyel s rooms the second on February twenty at the same hall Niecks devotes an engrossing chapter to the public accounts and the general style of Chopin s playing of this more hereafter From eighteen forty three to eighteen forty seven Chopin taught and spent the vacations at Nohant to which charming retreat Liszt Matthew Arnold Delacroix Charles Rollinat and many others came His life was apparently happy He composed and amused himself with Maurice and Solange the terrible children of this Bohemian household There according to reports Chopin and Liszt were in friendly rivalry are two pianists ever friendly Liszt imitating Chopin s style and once in the dark they exchanged places and fooled their listeners Liszt denied this Another story is of one or the other working the pedal rods the pedals being broken This too has been laughed to scorn by Liszt Nor could he recall having played while Viardot Garcia sang out on the terrace of the chateau Garcia s memory is also short about this event Rollinat Delacroix and Sand have written abundant souvenirs of Nohant and its distinguished gatherings so let us not attempt to impugn the details of the Chopin legend that legend which coughs deprecatingly as it points to its aureoled alabaster brow De Lenz should be consulted for an account of this period he will add the finishing touches of unreality that may be missing Chopin knew every one of note in Paris The best salons were open to him Some of his confreres have not hesitated to describe him as a bit snobbish for during the last ten years of his life he was generally inaccessible But consider his retiring nature his suspicious Slavic temperament above all his delicate health Where one accuses him of indifference and selfishness there are ten who praise his unfaltering kindness generosity and forbearance He was as a rule a kind and patient teacher and where talent was displayed his interest trebled Can you fancy this Ariel of the piano giving lessons to hum drum pupils Playing in a charmed and bewitching circle of countesses surrounded by the luxury and the praise that kills Chopin is a much more natural figure yet he gave lessons regularly and appeared to relish them He had not much taste for literature He liked Voltaire though he read but little that was not Polish did he really enjoy Sand s novels and when asked why he did not compose symphonies or operas answered that his metier was the piano and to it he would stick He spoke French though with a Polish accent and also German but did not care much for German music except Bach and Mozart Beethoven save in the C sharp minor and several other sonatas was not sympathetic Schubert he found rough Weber in his piano music too operatic and Schumann he dismissed without a word He told Heller that the Carneval was really not music at all This remark is one of the curiosities of musical anecdotage But he had his gay moments when he would gossip chatter imitate every one cut up all manner of tricks and like Wagner stand on his head Perhaps it was feverish agitated gayety yet somehow it seemed more human than that eternal Thaddeus of Warsaw melancholy and regret for the vanished greatness and happiness of Poland a greatness and happiness that never had existed Chopin disliked letter writing and would go miles to answer one in person He did not hate any one in particular being rather indifferent to every one and to political events except where Poland was concerned Theoretically he hated Jews and Russians yet associated with both He was like his music a bundle of unreconciled affirmations and evasions and never could have been contented anywhere or with any one Of himself he said that he was in this world like the E string of a violin on a contrabass This divine dissatisfaction led him to extremes to the flouting of friends for fancied affronts to the snubbing of artists who sometimes visited him He grew suspicious of Liszt and for ten years was not on terms of intimacy with him although they never openly quarrelled The breach which had been very perceptibly widening became hopeless in eighteen forty seven when Sand and Chopin parted forever A literature has grown up on the subject Chopin never had much to say but Sand did so did Chopin s pupils who were quite virulent in their assertions that she killed their master The break had to come It was the inevitable end of such a friendship The dynamics of free love have yet to be formulated This much we know two such natures could never entirely cohere When the novelty wore off the stronger of the two the one least in love took the initial step It was George Sand who took it with Chopin He would never have had the courage nor the will The final causes are not very interesting Niecks has sifted all the evidence before the court and jury of scandal mongers The main quarrel was about the marriage of Solange Sand with Clesinger the sculptor Her mother did not oppose the match but later she resented Clesinger s actions He was coarse and violent she said with the true mother in law spirit and when Chopin received the young woman and her husband after a terrible scene at Nohant she broke with him It was a good excuse He had ennuied her for several years and as he had completed his artistic work on this planet and there was nothing more to be studied the psychological portrait was supposedly painted Madame George got rid of him The dark stories of maternal jealousy of Chopin s preference for Solange the visit to Chopin of the concierge s wife to complain of her mistress behavior with her husband all these rakings I leave to others It was a triste affair and I do not doubt in the least that it undermined Chopin s feeble health Why not Animals die of broken hearts and this emotional product of Poland deprived of affection home and careful attention may well as De Lenz swears have died of heart break Recent gossip declares that Sand was jealous of Chopin s friendships this is silly mister A B Walkley the English dramatic critic after declaring that he would rather have lived during the Balzac epoch in Paris continues in this entertaining vein And then one might have had a chance of seeing George Sand in the thick of her amorisms For my part I would certainly rather have met her than Pontius Pilate The people who saw her in her old age Flaubert Gautier the Goncourts have left us copious records of her odd appearance her perpetual cigarette smoking and her whimsical life at Nohant But then she was only an extinct volcano she must have been much more interesting in full eruption Of her earlier career the period of Musset and Pagello she herself told us something in Elle et Lui and correspondence published a year or so ago in the Revue de Paris told us more But to my mind the most fascinating chapter in this part of her history is the Chopin chapter covering the next decade or roughly speaking the forties She has revealed something of this time naturally from her own point of view in Lucrezia Floriana eighteen forty seven For it is of course one of the most notorious characteristics of George Sand that she invariably turned her loves into copy The mixture of passion and printer s ink in this lady s composition is surely one of the most curious blends ever offered to the palate of the epicure But it was a blend which gave the lady an unfair advantage for posterity We hear too much of her side of the matter This one feels especially as regards her affair with Chopin With Musset she had to reckon a writer like herself and against her Elle et Lui we can set his Confession d un enfant du siecle But poor Chopin being a musician was not good at copy The emotions she gave him he had to pour out in music which delightful as sound is unfortunately vague as a literary document How one longs to have his full true and particular account of the six months he spent with George Sand in Majorca M Pierre Mille who has just published in the Revue Bleue some letters of Chopin first printed it seems in a Warsaw newspaper would have us believe that the lady was really the masculine partner We are to understand that it was Chopin who did the weeping and pouting and scene making while George Sand did the consoling the pooh poohing and the protecting Liszt had already given us a characteristic anecdote of this Majorca period We see George Sand in sheer exuberance of health and animal spirits wandering out into the storm while Chopin stays at home to have an attack of nerves to give vent to his anxiety oh artistic temperament by composing a prelude and to fall fainting at the lady s feet when she returns safe and sound There is no doubt that the lady had enough of the masculine temper in her to be the first to get tired And as poor Chopin was coughing and swooning most of the time this is scarcely surprising But she did not leave him forthwith She kept up the pretence of loving him in a maternal protecting sort of way out of pity as it were for a sick child So much the published letters clearly show Many of them are dated from Nohant But in themselves the letters are dull enough Chopin composed with the keyboard of a piano with ink and paper he could do little Probably his love letters were wooden productions and George Sand we know was a fastidious critic in that matter She had received and written so many But any rate Chopin did not write whining recriminations like Mussel His real view of her we shall never know and if you like you may say it is no business of ours She once uttered a truth about that though not apropos of Chopin There are so many things between two lovers of which they alone can be the judges Chopin gave his last concert in Paris February sixteen eighteen forty eight at Pleyel s He was ill but played beautifully Oscar Commettant said he fainted in the artist s room Sand and Chopin met but once again She took his hand which was trembling and cold but he escaped without saying a word He permitted himself in a letter to Grzymala from London dated November seventeen eighteen eighteen forty eight to speak of Sand I have never cursed any one but now I am so weary of life that I am near cursing Lucrezia But she suffers too and suffers more because she grows older in wickedness What a pity about Soli Alas everything goes wrong with the world I wonder what mister Hadow thinks of this reference to Sand Soli is Solange Sand who was forced to leave her husband because of ill treatment As her mother once boxed Clesinger s ears at Nohant she followed the example In trying to settle the affair Sand quarrelled hopelessly with her daughter That energetic descendant of emancipated woman formed a partnership literary of course with the Marquis Alfieri the nephew of the Italian poet Her salon was as much in vogue as her mother s but her tastes were inclined to politics revolutionary politics preferred She had for associates Gambetta Jules Ferry Floquet Taine Herve Weiss the critic of the Debats Henri Fouquier and many others She had the curved Hebraic nose of her mother and hair coal black She died in her chateau at Montgivray and was buried March twenty eighteen ninety nine at Nohant where as my informant says her mother died of over much cigarette smoking She was a clever woman and wrote a book Masks and Buffoons Maurice Sand died in eighteen eighty three He was the son of his mother who was gathered to her heterogeneous ancestors June eight eighteen seventy six In literature George Sand is a feminine pendant to Jean Jacques Rousseau full of ill digested troubled fermenting social political philosophical and religious speculations and theories She wrote picturesque French smooth flowing and full of color The sketches of nature of country life have positive value but where has vanished her gallery of Byronic passion pursued women Where are the Lelias the Indianas the Rudolstadts She had not as mister Henry James points out a faculty for characterization As Flaubert wrote her In spite of your great Sphinx eyes you have always seen the world as through a golden mist She dealt in vague vast figures and so her Prince Karol in Lucrezia Floriana unquestionably intended for Chopin is a burlesque little wonder he was angered when the precious children asked him Cher M Chopin have you read Lucrezia Mamma has put you in it Of all persons Sand was pre elected to give to the world a true a sympathetic picture of her friend She understood him but she had not the power of putting him between the coversof a book If Flaubert or better still Pierre Loti could have known Chopin so intimately we should possess a memoir in which every vibration of emotion would be recorded every shade noted and all pinned with the precise adjective the phrase exquisite III ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND PERE LA CHAISE The remaining years of Chopin s life were lonely His father died in eighteen forty four of chest and heart complaint his sister Emilia died of consumption ill omens these and shortly after John Matuszynski died Titus Woyciechowski was in far off Poland on his estates and Chopin had but Grzymala and Fontana to confide in they being Polish he preferred them although he was diplomatic enough not to let others see this Both Franchomme and Gutmann whispered to Niecks at different times that each was the particular soul the alter ego of Chopin He appeared to give himself to his friends but it was usually surface affection He had coaxing coquettish ways playful ways that cost him nothing when in good spirits So he was more loved than loving This is another trait of the man which allied with his fastidiousness and spiritual brusquerie made him difficult to decipher The loss of Sand completed his misery and we find him in poor health when he arrived in London for the second and last time April twenty one eighteen forty eight mister A J Hipkins is the chief authority on the details of Chopin s visit to England To this amiable gentleman and learned writer on pianos Franz Hueffer Joseph Bennett and Niecks are indebted for the most of their facts From them the curious may learn all there is to learn The story is not especially noteworthy being in the main a record of ill health complainings lamentations and not one signal artistic success War was declared upon Chopin by a part of the musical world The criticism was compounded of pure malice and stupidity Chopin was angered but little for he was too sick to care now He went to an evening party but missed the Macready dinner where he was to have met Thackeray Berlioz missus Procter and Sir Julius Benedict With Benedict he played a Mozart duet at the Duchess of Sutherland s Whether he played at court the Queen can tell Niecks cannot He met Jenny Lind Goldschmidt and liked her exceedingly as did all who had the honor of knowing her She sided with him woman like in the Sand affair echoes of which had floated across the channel and visited him in Paris in eighteen forty nine Chopin gave two matinees at the houses of Adelaide Kemble and Lord Falmouth June twenty three and July seven They were very recherche so it appears Viardot Garcia sang The composer s face and frame were wasted by illness and mister Solomon spoke of his long attenuated fingers He made money and that was useful to him for doctors bills and living had taken up his savings There was talk of his settling in London but the climate not to speak of the unmusical atmosphere would have been fatal to him Wagner succumbed to both sturdy fighter that he was Chopin left for Scotland in August and stopped at the house of his pupil Miss Stirling Her name is familiar to Chopin students for the two nocturnes opus fifty five are dedicated to her He was nearly killed with kindness but continually bemoaned his existence At the house of doctor Lyschinski a Pole he lodged in Edinburgh and was so weak that he had to be carried up and down stairs To the doctor s good wife he replied in answer to the question George Sand is your particular friend Not even George Sand And is he to be blamed for evading tiresome reminders of the past He confessed that his excessive thinness had caused Sand to address him as My Dear Corpse Charming is it not Miss Stirling was doubtless in love with him and Princess Czartoryska followed him to Scotland to see if his health was better So he was not altogether deserted by the women indeed he could not live without their little flatteries and agreeable attentions It is safe to say that a woman was always within call of Chopin He played at Manchester on the twenty eighth of August but his friend mister Osborne who was present says his playing was too delicate to create enthusiasm and I felt truly sorry for him On his return to Scotland he stayed with mister and missus Salis Schwabe mister J Cuthbert Hadden wrote several years ago in the Glasgow Herald of Chopin s visit to Scotland in eighteen forty eight The tone poet was in the poorest health but with characteristic tenacity played at concerts and paid visits to his admirers mister Hadden found the following notice in the back files of the Glasgow Courier Monsieur Chopin has the honour to announce that his matinee musicale will take place on Wednesday the twenty seventh September in the Merchant Hall Glasgow To commence at half past two o clock Tickets limited in number half a guinea each and full particulars to be had from mister Muir Wood forty two Buchanan street He continues The net profits of this concert are said to have been exactly Lsixty a ridiculously low sum when we compare it with the earnings of later day virtuosi nay still more ridiculously low when we recall the circumstance that for two concerts in Glasgow sixteen years before this Paganini had L fourteen hundred Muir Wood who has since died said I was then a comparative stranger in Glasgow but I was told that so many private carriages had never been seen at any concert in the town In fact it was the county people who turned out with a few of the elite of Glasgow society Being a morning concert the citizens were busy otherwise and half a guinea was considered too high a sum for their wives and daughters The late doctor James Hedderwick of Glasgow tells in his reminiscences that on entering the hall he found it about one third full It was obvious that a number of the audience were personal friends of Chopin doctor Hedderwick recognized the composer at once as a little fragile looking man in pale gray suit including frock coat of identical tint and texture moving about among the company conversing with different groups and occasionally consulting his watch which seemed to be no bigger than an agate stone on the forefinger of an alderman Whiskerless beardless fair of hair and pale and thin of face his appearance was interesting and conspicuous and when after a final glance at his miniature horologe he ascended the platform and placed himself at the instrument he at once commanded attention doctor Hedderwick says it was a drawing room entertainment more piano than forte though not without occasional episodes of both strength and grandeur It was perfectly clear to him that Chopin was marked for an early grave So far as can be ascertained there are now living only two members of that Glasgow audience of eighteen forty eight One of the two is Julius Seligmann the veteran president of the Glasgow Society of Musicians who in response to some inquiries on the subject writes as follows Several weeks before the concert Chopin lived with different friends or pupils on their invitations in the surrounding counties I think his pupil Miss Jane Stirling had something to do with all the general arrangements Muir Wood managed the special arrangements of the concert and I distinctly remember him telling me that he never had so much difficulty in arranging a concert as on this occasion Chopin constantly changed his mind Wood had to visit him several times at the house of Admiral Napier at Milliken Park near Johnstone but scarcely had he returned to Glasgow when he was summoned back to alter something The concert was given in the Merchant Hall Hutcheson street now the County Buildings The hall was about three quarters filled Between Chopin s playing Madame Adelasio de Margueritte daughter of a well known London physician sang and mister Muir accompanied her Chopin was evidently very ill His touch was very feeble and while the finish grace elegance and delicacy of his performances were greatly admired by the audience the want of power made his playing somewhat monotonous I do not remember the whole programme but he was encored for his well known mazurka in B flat op seven No one which he repeated with quite different nuances from those of the first time The audience was very aristocratic consisting mostly of ladies among whom were the then Duchess of Argyll and her sister Lady Blantyre The other survivor is George Russell Alexander son of the proprietor of the Theatre Royal Dunlop street who in a letter to the writer remarks especially upon Chopin s pale cadaverous appearance My emotion he says was so great that two or three times I was compelled to retire from the room to recover myself I have heard all the best and most celebrated stars of the musical firmament but never one has left such an impress on my mind Chopin played October four in Edinburgh and returned to London in November after various visits We read of a Polish ball and concert at which he played but the affair was not a success He left England in January eighteen forty nine and heartily glad he was to go Do you see the cattle in this meadow he asked en route for Paris Ca a plus d intelligence que des Anglais which was not nice of him Perhaps M Niedzwiecki to whom he made the remark took as earnest a pure bit of nonsense and perhaps He certainly disliked England and the English Now the curtain prepares to fall on the last dreary finale of Chopin s life a life not for a moment heroic yet lived according to his lights and free from the sordid and the soil of vulgarity Jules Janin said He lived ten miraculous years with a breath ready to fly away and we know that his servant Daniel had always to carry him to bed For ten years he had suffered from so much illness that a relapse was not noticed by the world His very death was at first received with incredulity for as Stephen Heller said he had been reported dead so often that the real news was doubted In eighteen forty seven his legs began to bother him by swelling and M Mathias described him as a painful spectacle the picture of exhaustion the back bent head bowed but always amiable and full of distinction His purse was empty and his lodgings in the Rue Chaillot were represented to the proud man as being just half their cost the balance being paid by the Countess Obreskoff a Russian lady Like a romance is the sending by Miss Stirling of twenty five thousand francs but it is nevertheless true The noble hearted Scotchwoman heard of Chopin s needs through Madame Rubio a pupil and the money was raised That packet containing it was mislaid or lost by the portress of Chopin s house but found after the woman had been taxed with keeping it Chopin his future assured moved to Place Vendome No twelve There he died His sister Louise was sent for and came from Poland to Paris In the early days of October he could no longer sit upright without support Gutmann and the Countess Delphine Potocka his sister and M Gavard were constantly with him It was Turgenev who spoke of the half hundred countesses in Europe who claimed to have held the dying Chopin in their arms In reality he died in Gutmann s raising that pupil s hand to his mouth and murmuring cher ami as he expired Solange Sand was there but not her mother who called and was not admitted so they say Gutmann denies having refused her admittance On the other hand if she had called Chopin s friends would have kept her away from him from the man who told Franchomme two days before his death She said to me that I would die in no arms but hers Surely unless she was monstrous in her egotism and she was not George Sand did not hear this sad speech without tears and boundless regrets Alas all things come too late for those who wait Tarnowski relates that Chopin gave his last orders in perfect consciousness He begged his sister to burn all his inferior compositions I owe it to the public he said and to myself to publish only good things I kept to this resolution all my life I wish to keep to it now This wish has not been respected The posthumous publications are for the most part feeble stuff Chopin died October seventeen eighteen forty nine between three and four in the morning after having been shrived by the Abbe Jelowicki His last word according to Gavard was Plus on being asked if he suffered Regarding the touching and slightly melodramatic death bed scene on the day previous when Delphine Potocka sang Stradella and Mozart or was it Marcello Liszt Karasowski and Gutmann disagree The following authentic account of the last hours of Chopin appears here for the first time in English translated by mister Hugh Craig In Liszt s well known work on Chopin second edition eighteen seventy nine mention is made of a conversation that he had held with the Abbe Jelowicki respecting Chopin s death and in Niecks biography of Chopin some sentences from letters by the Abbe are quoted These letters written in French have been translated and published in the Allgemeine Musik Zeitung to which they were given by the Princess Marie Hohenlohe the daughter of Princess Caroline Sayn Wittgenstein Liszt s universal legatee and executor who died in eighteen eighty seven For many years so runs the document the life of Chopin was but a breath His frail weak body was visibly unfitted for the strength and force of his genius It was a wonder how in such a weak state he could live at all and occasionally act with the greatest energy His body was almost diaphanous his eyes were almost shadowed by a cloud from which from time to time the lightnings of his glance flashed Gentle kind bubbling with humor and every way charming he seemed no longer to belong to earth while unfortunately he had not yet thought of heaven He had good friends but many bad friends These bad friends were his flatterers that is his enemies men and women without principles or rather with bad principles Even his unrivalled success so much more subtle and thus so much more stimulating than that of all other artists carried the war into his soul and checked the expression of faith and of prayer The teachings of the fondest most pious mother became to him a recollection of his childhood s love In the place of faith doubt had stepped in and only that decency innate in every generous heart hindered him from indulging in sarcasm and mockery over holy things and the consolations of religion While he was in this spiritual condition he was attacked by the pulmonary disease that was soon to carry him away from us The knowledge of this cruel sickness reached me on my return from Rome With beating heart I hurried to him to see once more the friend of my youth whose soul was infinitely dearer to me than all his talent I found him not thinner for that was impossible but weaker His strength sank his life faded visibly He embraced me with affection and with tears in his eyes thinking not of his own pain but of mine he spoke of my poor friend Eduard Worte whom I had just lost you know how He was shot a martyr of liberty at Vienna November ten eighteen forty eight I availed myself of his softened mood to speak to him about his soul I recalled his thoughts to the piety of his childhood and of his beloved mother Yes he said in order not to offend my mother I would not die without the sacraments but for my part I do not regard them in the sense that you desire I understand the blessing of confession in so far as it is the unburdening of a heavy heart into a friendly hand but not as a sacrament I am ready to confess to you if you wish it because I love you not because I hold it necessary Enough a crowd of anti religious speeches filled me with terror and care for this elect soul and I feared nothing more than to be called to be his confessor Several months passed with similar conversations so painful to me the priest and the sincere friend Yet I clung to the conviction that the grace of God would obtain the victory over this rebellious soul even if I knew not how After all my exertions prayer remained my only refuge On the evening of October twelve I had with my brethren retired to pray for a change in Chopin s mind when I was summoned by orders of the physician in fear that he would not live through the night I hastened to him He pressed my hand but bade me at once to depart while he assured me he loved me much but did not wish to speak to me Imagine if you can what a night I passed Next day was the thirteenth the day of saint Edward the patron of my poor brother I said mass for the repose of his soul and prayed for Chopin s soul My God I cried if the soul of my brother Edward is pleasing to thee give me this day the soul of Frederic In double distress I then went to the melancholy abode of our poor sick man I found him at breakfast which was served as carefully as ever and after he had asked me to partake I said My friend today is the name day of my poor brother Oh do not let us speak of it he cried Dearest friend I continued you must give me something for my brother s name day What shall I give you Your soul Ah I understand Here it is take it At these words unspeakable joy and anguish seized me What should I say to him What should I do to restore his faith how not to lose instead of saving this beloved soul How should I begin to bring it back to God I flung myself on my knees and after a moment of collecting my thoughts I cried in the depths of my heart Draw it to Thee Thyself my God Without saying a word I held out to our dear invalid the crucifix Rays of divine light flames of divine fire streamed I might say visibly from the figure of the crucified Saviour and at once illumined the soul and kindled the heart of Chopin Burning tears streamed from his eyes His faith was once more revived and with unspeakable fervor he made his confession and received the Holy Supper After the blessed Viaticum penetrated by the heavenly consecration which the sacraments pour forth on pious souls he asked for Extreme Unction He wished to pay lavishly the sacristan who accompanied me and when I remarked that the sum presented by him was twenty times too much he replied Oh no for what I have received is beyond price From this hour he was a saint The death struggle began and lasted four days Patience trust in God even joyful confidence never left him in spite of all his sufferings till the last breath He was really happy and called himself happy In the midst of the sharpest sufferings he expressed only ecstatic joy touching love of God thankfulness that I had led him back to God contempt of the world and its good and a wish for a speedy death He blessed his friends and when after an apparently last crisis he saw himself surrounded by the crowd that day and night filled his chamber he asked me Why do they not pray At these words all fell on their knees and even the Protestants joined in the litanies and prayers for the dying Day and night he held my hand and would not let me leave him No you will not leave me at the last moment he said and leaned on my breast as a little child in a moment of danger hides itself in its mother s breast Soon he called upon Jesus and Mary with a fervor that reached to heaven soon he kissed the crucifix in an excess of faith hope and love He made the most touching utterances I love God and man he said I am happy so to die do not weep my sister My friends do not weep I am happy I feel that I am dying Farewell pray for me Exhausted by deathly convulsions he said to the physicians Let me die Do not keep me longer in this world of exile Let me die why do you prolong my life when I have renounced all things and God has enlightened my soul God calls me why do you keep me back Another time he said O lovely science that only lets one suffer longer Could it give me back my strength qualify me to do any good to make any sacrifice but a life of fainting of grief of pain to all who love me to prolong such a life O lovely science Then he said again You let me suffer cruelly Perhaps you have erred about my sickness But God errs not He punishes me and I bless him therefor Oh how good is God to punish me here below Oh how good God is His usual language was always elegant with well chosen words but at last to express all his thankfulness and at the same time all the misery of those who die unreconciled to God he cried Without you I should have croaked krepiren like a pig While dying he still called on the names of Jesus Mary Joseph kissed the crucifix and pressed it to his heart with the cry Now I am at the source of Blessedness Thus died Chopin and in truth his death was the most beautiful concerto of all his life The worthy abbe must have had a phenomenal memory I hope that it was an exact one His story is given in its entirety because of its novelty The only thing that makes me feel in the least sceptical is that La Mara the pen name of a writer on musical subjects translated these letters into German But every one agrees that Chopin s end was serene indeed it is one of the musical death beds of history another was Mozart s His face was beautiful and young in the flower covered coffin says Liszt He was buried from the Madeleine October thirty with the ceremony befitting a man of genius The B flat minor Funeral march orchestrated by Henri Reber was given and during the ceremony Lefebure Wely played on the organ the E and B minor Preludes The pall bearers were distinguished men Meyerbeer Delacroix Pleyel and Franchomme at least Theophile Gautier so reported it for his journal Even at his grave in Pere la Chaise no two persons could agree about Chopin This controversy is quite characteristic of Chopin who was always the calm centre of argument He was buried in evening clothes his concert dress but not at his own request Kwiatowski the portrait painter told this to Niecks It is a Polish custom for the dying to select their grave clothes yet Lombroso writes that Chopin in his will directed that he should be buried in a white tie small shoes and short breeches adducing this as an evidence of his insanity He further adds he abandoned the woman whom he tenderly loved because she offered a chair to some one else before giving the same invitation to himself Here we have a Sand story raised to the dignity of a diagnosed symptom It is like the other nonsense IV THE ARTIST Chopin s personality was a pleasant persuasive one without being so striking or so dramatic as Liszt s As a youth his nose was too large his lips thin the lower one protruding Later Moscheles said that he looked like his music Delicacy and a certain aristrocratic bearing a harmonious ensemble produced a most agreeable sensation He was of slim frame middle height fragile but wonderfully flexible limbs delicately formed hands very small feet an oval softly outlined head a pale transparent complexion long silken hair of a light chestnut color parted on one side tender brown eyes intelligent rather than dreamy a finely curved aquiline nose a sweet subtle smile graceful and varied gestures This precise description is by Niecks Liszt said he had blue eyes but he has been overruled Chopin was fond of elegant costly attire and was very correct in the matter of studs walking sticks and cravats Not the ideal musician we read of but a gentleman Berlioz told Legouve to see Chopin for he is something which you have never seen and some one you will never forget An orchidaceous individuality this With such personal refinement he was a man punctual and precise in his habits Associating constantly with fashionable folk his naturally dignified behavior was increased He was an aristocrat there is no other word and he did not care to be hail fellow well met with the musicians A certain primness and asperity did not make him popular While teaching his manner warmed the earnest artist came to life all halting of speech and polite insincerities were abandoned His pupils adored him Here at least the sentiment was one of solidarity De Lenz is his most censorious critic and did not really love Chopin The dislike was returned for the Pole suspected that his pupil was sent by Liszt to spy on his methods This I heard in Paris Chopin was a remarkable teacher He never taught but one genius little Filtsch the Hungarian lad of whom Liszt said When he starts playing I will shut up shop The boy died in eighteen forty five aged fifteen Paul Gunsberg who died the same year was also very talented Once after delivering in a lovely way the master s E minor concerto Filtsch was taken by Chopin to a music store and presented with the score of Beethoven s Fidelio He was much affected by the talents of this youthful pupil Lindsay Sloper and Brinley Richards studied with Chopin Caroline Hartmann Gutmann Lysberg Georges Mathias Mlle O Meara many Polish ladies of rank Delphine Potocka among the rest Madame Streicher Carl Mikuli Madame Rubio Madame Peruzzi Thomas Tellefsen Casimir Wernik Gustav Schumann Werner Steinbrecher and many others became excellent pianists Was the American pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk ever his pupil His friends say so but Niecks does not mention him Ernst Pauer questions it We know that Gottschalk studied in Paris with Camille Stamaty and made his first appearance there in eighteen forty seven This was shortly before Chopin s death when his interest in music had abated greatly No doubt Gottschalk played for Chopin for he was the first to introduce the Pole s music in America Chopin was very particular about the formation of the touch giving Clementi s Preludes at first Is that a dog barking was his sudden exclamation at a rough attack He taught the scales staccato and legato beginning with E major Ductility ease gracefulness were his aim stiffness harshness annoyed him He gave Clementi Moscheles and Bach Before playing in concert he shut himself up and played not Chopin but Bach always Bach Absolute finger independence and touch discrimination and color are to be gained by playing the preludes and fugues of Bach Chopin started a method but it was never finished and his sister gave it to the Princess Czartoryska after his death It is a mere fragment Janotha has translated it One point is worth quoting He wrote No one notices inequality in the power of the notes of a scale when it is played very fast and equally as regards time In a good mechanism the aim is not to play everything with an equal sound but to acquire a beautiful quality of touch and a perfect shading For a long time players have acted against nature in seeking to give equal power to each finger On the contrary each finger should have an appropriate part assigned it The thumb has the greatest power being the thickest finger and the freest Then comes the little finger at the other extremity of the hand The middle finger is the main support of the hand and is assisted by the first Finally comes the third the weakest one As to this Siamese twin of the middle finger some players try to force it with all their might to become independent A thing impossible and most likely unnecessary There are then many different qualities of sound just as there are several fingers The point is to utilize the differences and this in other words is the art of fingering Here it seems to me is one of the most practical truths ever uttered by a teacher Pianists spend thousands of hours trying to subjugate impossible muscles Chopin who found out most things for himself saw the waste of time and force I recommend his advice He was ever particular about fingering but his innovations horrified the purists Play as you feel was his motto a rather dangerous precept for beginners He gave to his pupils the concertos and sonatas all carefully graded of Mozart Scarlatti Field Dussek Hummel Beethoven Mendelssohn Weber and Hiller and of Schubert the four hand pieces and dances Liszt he did not favor which is natural Liszt having written nothing but brilliant paraphrases in those days The music of the later Liszt is quite another thing Chopin s genius for the pedal his utilization of its capacity for the vibration of related strings the overtones I refer to later Rubinstein said The piano bard the piano rhapsodist the piano mind the piano soul is Chopin Tragic romantic lyric heroic dramatic fantastic soulful sweet dreamy brilliant grand simple all possible expressions are found in his compositions and all are sung by him upon his instrument Chopin is dead only fifty years but his fame has traversed the half century with ease and bids fair to build securely in the loves of our great grandchildren The six letters that comprise his name pursue every piano that is made Chopin and modern piano playing are inseparable and it is a strain upon homely prophecy to predict a time when the two shall be put asunder Chopin was the greatest interpreter of Chopin and following him came those giants of other days Liszt Tausig and Rubinstein While he never had the pupils to mould as had Liszt Chopin made some excellent piano artists They all had or have the old guard dies bravely his tradition but exactly what the Chopin tradition is no man may dare to say Anton Rubinstein when I last heard him played Chopin inimitably Never shall I forget the Ballades the two Polonaises in F sharp minor and A flat major the B flat minor Prelude the A minor Winter Wind the two C minor studies and the F minor Fantasie Yet the Chopin pupils assembled in judgment at Paris when he gave his Historical Recitals refused to accept him as an interpreter His touch was too rich and full his tone too big Chopin did not care for Liszt s reading of his music though he trembled when he heard him thunder in the Eroica Polonaise I doubt if even Karl Tausig impeccable artist unapproachable Chopin player would have pleased the composer Chopin played as his moods prompted and his playing was the despair and delight of his hearers Rubinstein did all sorts of wonderful things with the coda of the Barcarolle such a page but Sir Charles Halle said that it was clever but not Chopinesque Yet Halle heard Chopin at his last Paris concert February eighteen forty eight play the two forte passages in the Barcarolle pianissimo and with all sorts of dynamic finesse This is precisely what Rubinstein did and his pianissimo was a whisper Von Bulow was too much of a martinet to reveal the poetic quality though he appreciated Chopin on the intellectual side his touch was not beautiful enough The Slavic and Magyar races are your only true Chopin interpreters Witness Liszt the magnificent Rubinstein a passionate genius Tausig who united in his person all the elements of greatness Essipowa fascinating and feminine the poetic Paderewski de Pachmann the fantastic subtle Joseffy and Rosenthal a phenomenon A world great pianist was this Frederic Francois Chopin He played as he composed uniquely All testimony is emphatic as to this Scales that were pearls a touch rich sweet supple and singing and a technique that knew no difficulties these were part of Chopin s equipment as a pianist He spiritualized the timbre of his instrument until it became transformed into something strange something remote from its original nature His pianissimo was an enchanting whisper his forte seemed powerful by contrast so numberless were the gradations so widely varied his dynamics The fairylike quality of his play his diaphanous harmonies his liquid tone his pedalling all were the work of a genius and a lifetime and the appealing humanity he infused into his touch gave his listeners a delight that bordered on the supernatural So the accounts critical professional and personal read There must have been a hypnotic quality in his performances that transported his audience wherever the poet willed Indeed the stories told wear an air of enthusiasm that borders on the exaggerated on the fantastic Crystalline pearls falling on red hot velvet or did Scudo write this of Liszt infinite nuance and the mingling of silvery bells these are a few of the least exuberant notices Was it not Heine who called Thalberg a king Liszt a prophet Chopin a poet Herz an advocate Kalkbrenner a minstrel Madame Pleyel a sibyl and Doehler a pianist The limpidity the smoothness and ease of Chopin s playing were after all on the physical plane It was the poetic melancholy the grandeur above all the imaginative lift that were more in evidence than mere sensuous sweetness Chopin had we know his salon side when he played with elegance brilliancy and coquetry But he had dark moments when the keyboard was too small his ideas too big for utterance Then he astounded thrilled his auditors They were rare moments His mood versatility was reproduced in his endless colorings and capricious rhythms The instrument vibrated with these new nameless effects like the violin in Paganini s hands It was ravishing He was called the Ariel the Undine of the piano There was something imponderable fluid vaporous evanescent in his music that eluded analysis and eluded all but hard headed critics This novelty was the reason why he has been classed as a gifted amateur and even to day is he regarded by many musicians as a skilful inventor of piano passages and patterned figures instead of what he really is one of the most daring harmonists since Bach Chopin s elastic hand small thin with lightly articulated fingers was capable of stretching tenths with ease Examine his first study for confirmation of this His wrist was very supple Stephen Heller said that it was a wonderful sight to see Chopin s small hands expand and cover a third of the keyboard It was like the opening of the mouth of a serpent about to swallow a rabbit whole He played the octaves in the A flat Polonaise with infinite ease but pianissimo Now where is the tradition when confronted by the mighty crashing of Rosenthal in this particular part of the Polonaise Of Karl Tausig Weitzmann said that he relieved the romantically sentimental Chopin of his Weltschmerz and showed him in his pristine creative vigor and wealth of imagination In Chopin s music there are many pianists many styles and all are correct if they are poetically musical logical and individually sincere Of his rubato I treat in the chapter devoted to the Mazurkas making also an attempt to define the zal of his playing and music When Chopin was strong he used a Pleyel piano when he was ill an Erard a nice fable of Liszt s He said that he liked the Erard but he really preferred the Pleyel with its veiled sonority What could not he have accomplished with the modern grand piano In the artist s room of the Maison Pleyel there stands the piano at which Chopin composed the Preludes the G minor nocturne the Funeral March the three supplementary etudes the A minor Mazurka the Tarantelle the F minor Fantasie and the B minor Scherzo A brass tablet on the inside lid notes this The piano is still in good condition as regards tone and action Mikuli asserted that Chopin brought out an immense tone in cantabiles He had not a small tone but it was not the orchestral tone of our day Indeed how could it be with the light action and tone of the French pianos built in the first half of the century After all it was quality not quantity that Chopin sought Each one of his ten fingers was a delicately differentiated voice and these ten voices could sing at times like the morning stars Rubinstein declared that all the pedal marks are wrong in Chopin I doubt if any edition can ever give them as they should be for here again the individual equation comes into play Apart from certain fundamental rules for managing the pedals no pedagogic regulations should ever be made for the more refined nuances The portraits of Chopin differ widely There is the Ary Scheffer the Vigneron praised by Mathias the Bovy medallion the Duval drawing and the head by Kwiatowski Delacroix tried his powerful hand at transfixing in oil the fleeting expressions of Chopin Felix Barrias Franz Winterhalter and Albert Graefle are others who tried with more or less success Anthony Kolberg painted Chopin in eighteen forty eight forty nine Kleczynski reproduces it it is mature in expression The Clesinger head I have seen at Pere la Chaise It is mediocre and lifeless Kwiatowski has caught some of the Chopin spirit in the etching that may be found in volume one of Niecks biography The Winterhalter portrait in mister Hadow s volume is too Hebraic and the Graefle is a trifle ghastly It is the dead Chopin but the nose is that of a predaceous bird painfully aquiline The Echo Muzyczne Warsaw of October eighteen ninety nine in Polish seventeen Pazdziernika printed a picture of the composer at the age of seventeen It is that of a thoughtful poetic but not handsome lad his hair waving over a fine forehead a feminine mouth large aquiline nose the nostrils delicately cut and about his slender neck a Byronic collar Altogether a novel likeness Like the Chopin interpretation a satisfactory Chopin portrait is extremely rare As some difficulty was experienced in discovering the identity of Countess Delphine Potocka I applied in eighteen ninety nine to mister Jaraslow de Zielinski a pianist of Buffalo New York for assistance he is an authority on Polish and Russian music and musicians Here are the facts he kindly transmitted In eighteen thirty three beautiful Polish women came to Nice to pass the winter They were the daughters of Count Komar the business manager of the wealthy Count Potocki They were singularly accomplished they spoke half the languages of Europe drew well and sang to perfection All they needed was money to make them queens of society this they soon obtained and with it high rank Their graceful manners and loveliness won the hearts of three of the greatest of noblemen Marie married the Prince de Beauvau Craon Delphine became Countess Potocka and Nathalie Marchioness Medici Spada The last named died young a victim to the zeal in favor of the cholera stricken of Rome The other two sisters went to live in Paris and became famous for their brilliant elegance Their sumptuous hotels or palaces were thrown open to the most prominent men of genius of their time and hither came Chopin to meet not only with the homage due to his genius but with a tender and sisterly friendship which proved one of the greatest consolations of his life To the amiable Princess de Beauvau he dedicated his famous Polonaise in F sharp minor op forty four written in the brilliant bravura style for pianists of the first force To Delphine Countess Potocka he dedicated the loveliest of his valses op sixty four No one so well transcribed by Joseffy into a study in thirds Therefore the picture of the Grafin Potocka in the Berlin gallery is not that of Chopin s devoted friend Here is another Count Tarnowski story It touches on a Potocka episode Chopin liked and knew how to express individual characteristics on the piano Just as there formerly was a rather widely known fashion of describing dispositions and characters in so called portraits which gave to ready wits a scope for parading their knowledge of people and their sharpness of observation so he often amused himself by playing such musical portraits Without saying whom he had in his thoughts he illustrated the characters of a few or of several people present in the room and illustrated them so clearly and so delicately that the listeners could always guess correctly who was intended and admired the resemblance of the portrait One little anecdote is related in connection with this which throws some light on his wit and a little pinch of sarcasm in it During the time of Chopin s greatest brilliancy and popularity in the year eighteen thirty five he once played his musical portraits in a certain Polish salon where the three daughters of the house were the stars of the evening After a few portraits had been extemporized one of these ladies wished to have hers Mme Delphine Potocka Chopin in reply drew her shawl from her shoulders threw it on the keyboard and began to play implying in this two things first that he knew the character of the brilliant and famous queen of fashion so well that by heart and in the dark he was able to depict it secondly that this character and this soul is hidden under habits ornamentations and decorations of an elegant worldly life through the symbol of elegance and fashion of that day as the tones of the piano through the shawl Because Chopin did not label his works with any but general titles Ballades Scherzi Studies Preludes and the like his music sounds all the better the listener is not pinned down to any precise mood the music being allowed to work its particular charm without the aid of literary crutches for unimaginative minds doctor Niecks gives specimens of what the ingenious publisher without a sense of humor did with some of Chopin s compositions Adieu a

never is not now a favorite The mazurkas generally received the title of Souvenir de la Pologne In commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Chopin October seventeen eighteen ninety nine a medal was struck at Warsaw bearing on one side an artistically executed profile of the Polish composer On the reverse the design represents a lyre surrounded by a laurel branch and having engraved upon it the opening bars of the Mazurka in A flat major The name of the great composer with the dates of his birth and death are given in the margin Paderewski is heading a movement to remove from Paris to Warsaw the ashes of the pianist but it is doubtful if it can be managed Paris will certainly object to losing the bones of such a genius Chopin s acoustic parallelisms are not so concrete so vivid as Wagner s Nor are they so theatrical so obvious It does not however require much fancy to conjure up the drums and tramplings of three conquests in the Eroica Polonaise or the F sharp major Impromptu The rhythms of the Cradle Song and the Barcarolle are suggestive enough and if you please there are dew drops in his cadenzas and there is the whistling of the wind in the last A minor Study Of the A flat Study Chopin said Imagine a little shepherd who takes refuge in a peaceful grotto from an approaching storm In the distance rushes the wind and the rain while the shepherd gently plays a melody on his flute This is quoted by Kleczynski There are word whisperings in the next study in F minor whilst the symbolism of the dance the Valse Mazurka Polonaise Menuetto Bolero Schottische Krakowiak and Tarantella is admirably indicated in all of them The bells of the Funeral March the will o wisp character of the last movement of the B flat minor Sonata the dainty Butterfly Study in G flat opus twenty five the aeolian murmurs of the E flat Study in opus ten the tiny prancing silvery hoofs in the F major Study opus twenty five the flickering flame like C major Study No seven opus ten the spinning in the D flat Valse and the cyclonic rush of chromatic double notes in the E flat minor Scherzo these are not studied imitations but spontaneous transpositions to the ideal plane of primary natural phenomena Chopin s system if it be a system of cadenzas fioriture embellishment and ornamentation is perhaps traceable to the East In his Folk Music Studies mister H E Krehbiel quotes the description of a rhapsodical embellishment called alap which after going through a variety of ad libitum passages rejoins the melody with as much grace as if it had never been disunited the musical accompaniment all the while keeping time These passages are not reckoned essential to the melody but are considered only as grace notes introduced according to the fancy of the singer when the only limitations by which the performer is bound are the notes peculiar to that particular melody and a strict regard to time Chopin founded no school although the possibilities of the piano were canalized by him In playing as in composition only the broad trend of his discoveries may be followed for his was a manner not a method He has had for followers Liszt Rubinstein Mikuli Zarembski Nowakowski Xaver Scharwenka Saint Saens Scholtz Heller Nicode Moriz Moszkowski Paderewski Stojowski Arenski Leschetizki the two Wieniawskis and a whole group of the younger Russians Liadoff Scriabine and the rest Even Brahms in his F sharp major Sonata and E flat minor Scherzo shows Chopin s influence Indeed but for Chopin much modern music would not exist But a genuine school exists not Henselt was only a German who fell asleep and dreamed of Chopin To a Thalberg ian euphony he has added a technical figuration not unlike Chopin s and a spirit quite Teutonic in its sentimentality Rubinstein calls Chopin the exhalation of the third epoch in art He certainly closed one With a less strong rhythmic impulse and formal sense Chopin s music would have degenerated into mere overperfumed impressionism The French piano school of his day indeed of today is entirely drowned by its devotion to cold decoration to unemotional ornamentation Mannerisms he had what great artist has not but the Greek in him as in Heine kept him from formlessness He is seldom a landscapist but he can handle his brush deftly before nature if he must He paints atmosphere the open air at eventide with consummate skill and for playing fantastic tricks on your nerves in the depiction of the superhuman he has a peculiar faculty Remember that in Chopin s early days the Byronic pose the grandiose and the horrible prevailed witness the pictures of Ingres and Delacroix and Richter wrote with his heart strings saturated in moonshine and tears Chopin did not altogether escape the artistic vices of his generation As a man he was a bit of poseur the little whisker grown on one side of his face the side which he turned to his audience is a note of foppery but was ever a detester of the sham artistic He was sincere and his survival when nearly all of Mendelssohn much of Schumann and half of Berlioz have suffered an eclipse is proof positive of his vitality The fruit of his experimentings in tonality we see in the whole latter day school of piano dramatic and orchestral composers That Chopin may lead to the development and adoption of the new enharmonic scales the Homotonic scales I do not know For these M A de Bertha claimed the future of music He wrote Now vaporously illumined by the crepuscular light of a magical sky on the boundaries of the major and minor modes now seeming to spring from the bowels of the earth with sepulchral inflexions melody moves with ease on the serried degrees of the enharmonic scales Lively or slow she always assumed in them the accents of a fatalist impossibility for the laws of arithmetic have preceded her and there still remains as it were an atmosphere of proud rigidity Melancholy or passionate she preserves the reflected lines of a primitive rusticity which clings to the homotones in despite of their artificial origin But all this will be in the days to come when the flat keyboard will be superseded by a Janko many banked clavier contrivance when mister Krehbiel s oriental srootis are in use and mister Apthorp s nullitonic order no key at all is invented Then too a new Chopin may be born but I doubt it Despite his idiomatic treatment of the piano it must be remembered that Chopin under Sontag s and Paganini s influence imitated both voice and violin on the keyboard His lyricism is most human while the portamento the slides trills and indescribably subtle turns are they not of the violin Wagner said to mister Dannreuther see Finck s Wagner and his Works that Mozart s music and Mozart s orchestra are a perfect match an equally perfect balance exists between Palestrina s choir and Palestrina s counterpoint and I find a similar correspondence between Chopin s piano and some of his Etudes and Preludes I do not care for the Ladies Chopin there is too much of the Parisian salon in that but he has given us many things which are above the salon Which latter statement is slightly condescending Recollect however Chopin s calm depreciation of Schumann mister John F Runciman the English critic asserts that Chopin thought in terms of the piano and only the piano So when we see Chopin s orchestral music or Wagner s music for the piano we realize that neither is talking his native tongue the tongue which nature fitted him to speak Speaking of Chopin and the Sick Men mister Runciman is most pertinent These inheritors of rickets and exhausted physical frames made some of the most wonderful music of the century for us Schubert was the most wonderful of them all but Chopin runs him very close He wrote less far less than Schubert wrote but for the quantity he did write its finish is miraculous It may be feverish merely mournful cadavre or tranquil and entirely beautiful but there is not a phrase that is not polished as far as a phrase will bear polishing It is marvellous music but all the same it is sick unhealthy music Liszt s estimate of the technical importance of Chopin s works writes mister W J Henderson is not too large It was Chopin who systematized the art of pedalling and showed us how to use both pedals in combination to produce those wonderful effects of color which are so necessary in the performance of his music The harmonic schemes of the simplest of Chopin s works are marvels of originality and musical loveliness and I make bold to say that his treatment of the passing note did much toward showing later writers how to produce the restless and endless complexity of the harmony in contemporaneous orchestral music Heinrich Pudor in his strictures on German music is hardly complimentary to Chopin Wagner is a thorough going decadent an off shoot an epigonus not a progonus His cheeks are hollow and pale but the Germans have the full red cheeks Equally decadent is Liszt Liszt is a Hungarian and the Hungarians are confessedly a completely disorganized self outlived dying people No less decadent is Chopin whose figure comes before one as flesh without bones this morbid womanly womanish slip slop powerless sickly bleached sweet caramel Pole This has a ring of Nietzsche Nietzsche who boasted of his Polish origin Now listen to the fatidical Pole Przybyszewski In the beginning there was sex out of sex there was nothing and in it everything was And sex made itself brain whence was the birth of the soul And then as mister Vance Thompson who first Englished this Mass of the Dead wrote He pictures largely in great cosmic symbols decorated with passionate and mystic fervors the singular combat between the growing soul and the sex from which it fain would be free Arno Holz thus parodies Przybyszewski In our soul there is surging and singing a song of the victorious bacteria Our blood lacks the white corpuscles On the sounding board of our consciousness there echoes along the frightful symphony of the flesh It becomes objective in Chopin he alone the modern primeval man puts our brains on the green meadows he alone thinks in hyper European dimensions He alone rebuilds the shattered Jerusalem of our souls All of which shows to what comically delirious lengths this sort of deleterious soul probing may go It would be well to consider this word decadent and its morbid implications There is a fashion just now in criticism to over accentuate the physical and moral weaknesses of the artist Lombroso started the fashion Nordau carried it to its logical absurdity yet it is nothing new In Hazlitt s day he complains that genius is called mad by foolish folk mister Newman writes in his Wagner that art in general and music in particular ought not to be condemned merely in terms of the physical degeneration or abnormality of the artist Some of the finest work in art and literature indeed has been produced by men who could not from any standpoint be pronounced normal In the case of Flaubert of De Maupassant of Dostoievsky of Poe and a score of others though the organic system was more or less flawed the work remains touched with that universal quality that gives artistic permanence even to perceptions born of the abnormal mister Newman might have added other names to his list those of Michael Angelo and Beethoven and Swinburne Really is any great genius quite sane according to philistine standards The answer must be negative The old enemy has merely changed his mode of attack instead of charging genius with madness the abnormal used in an abnormal sense is lugged in and though these imputations of degeneracy moral and physical have in some cases proven true the genius of the accused one can in no wise be denied But then as mister Philip Hale asks Why this timidity at being called decadent What s in the name Havelock Ellis in his masterly study of Joris Karl Huysmans considers the much misunderstood phenomenon in art called decadence Technically a decadent style is only such in relation to a classic style It is simply a further development of a classic style a further specialization the homogeneous in Spencerian phraseology having become heterogeneous The first is beautiful because the parts are subordinated to the whole the second is beautiful because the whole is subordinated to the parts Then he proceeds to show in literature that Sir Thomas Browne Emerson Pater Carlyle Poe Hawthorne and Whitman are decadents not in any invidious sense but simply in the breaking up of the whole for the benefit of its parts Nietzsche is quoted to the effect that in the period of corruption in the evolution of societies we are apt to overlook the fact that the energy which in more primitive times marked the operations of a community as a whole has now simply been transferred to the individuals themselves and this aggrandizement of the individual really produces an even greater amount of energy And further Ellis All art is the rising and falling of the slopes of a rhythmic curve between these two classic and decadent extremes Decadence suggests to us going down falling decay If we walk down a real hill we do not feel that we commit a more wicked act than when we walked up it Roman architecture is classic to become in its Byzantine developments completely decadent and saint Mark s is the perfected type of decadence in art We have to recognize that decadence is an aesthetic and not a moral conception The power of words is great but they need not befool us We are not called upon to air our moral indignation over the bass end of the musical clef I recommend the entire chapter to such men as Lombroso Levi Max Nordau and Heinrich Pudor who have yet to learn that all confusion of intellectual substances is foolish Oscar Bie states the Chopin case most excellently Chopin is a poet It has become a very bad habit to place this poet in the hands of our youth The concertos and polonaises being put aside no one lends himself worse to youthful instruction than Chopin Because his delicate touches inevitably seem perverse to the youthful mind he has gained the name of a morbid genius The grown man who understands how to play Chopin whose music begins where that of another leaves off whose tones show the supremest mastery in the tongue of music such a man will discover nothing morbid in him Chopin a Pole strikes sorrowful chords which do not occur frequently to healthy normal persons But why is a Pole to receive less justice than a German We know that the extreme of culture is closely allied to decay for perfect ripeness is but the foreboding of corruption Children of course do not know this And Chopin himself would have been much too noble ever to lay bare his mental sickness to the world And his greatness lies precisely in this that he preserves the mean between immaturity and decay His greatness is his aristocracy He stands among musicians in his faultless vesture a noble from head to foot The sublimest emotions toward whose refinement whole generations had tended the last things in our soul whose foreboding is interwoven with the mystery of Judgment Day have in his music found their form Further on I shall attempt I write the word with a patibulary gesture in a sort of a Chopin variorum to analyze the salient aspects technical and aesthetic of his music To translate into prose into any language no matter how poetical the images aroused by his music is impossible I am forced to employ the technical terminology of other arts but against my judgment Read mister W F Apthorp s disheartening dictum in By the Way The entrancing phantasmagoria of picture and incident which we think we see rising from the billowing sea of music is in reality nothing more than an enchanting fata morgana visible at no other angle than that of our own eye The true gist of music it never can be it can never truly translate what is most essential and characteristic in its expression It is but something that we have half unconsciously imputed to music nothing that really exists in music The shadowy miming of Chopin s soul has nevertheless a significance for this generation It is now the reign of the brutal the realistic the impossible in music Formal excellence is neglected and programme music has reduced art to the level of an anecdote Chopin neither preaches nor paints yet his art is decorative and dramatic though in the climate of the ideal He touches earth and its emotional issues in Poland only otherwise his music is a pure aesthetic delight an artistic enchantment freighted with no ethical or theatric messages It is poetry made audible the soul written in sound All that I can faintly indicate is the way it affects me this music with the petals of a glowing rose and the heart of gray ashes Its analogies to Poe Verlaine Shelley Keats Heine and Mickiewicz are but critical sign posts for Chopin is incomparable Chopin is unique Our interval writes Walter Pater is brief Few pass it recollectedly and with full understanding of its larger rhythms and more urgent colors Many endure it in frivol and violence the majority in bored sullen submission Chopin the New Chopin is a foe to ennui and the spirit that denies in his exquisite soul sorrow sweet world pain we may find rich impersonal relief V POET AND PSYCHOLOGIST Music is an order of mystic sensuous mathematics A sounding mirror an aural mode of motion it addresses itself on the formal side to the intellect in its content of expression it appeals to the emotions Ribot admirable psychologist does not hesitate to proclaim music as the most emotional of the arts It acts like a burn like heat cold or a caressing contact and is the most dependent on physiological conditions Music then the most vague of the arts in the matter of representing the concrete is the swiftest surest agent for attacking the sensibilities The CRY made manifest as Wagner asserts it is a cry that takes on fanciful shapes each soul interpreting it in an individual fashion Music and beauty are synonymous just as their form and substance are indivisible Havelock Ellis is not the only aesthetician who sees the marriage of music and sex No other art tells us such old forgotten secrets about ourselves It is in the mightiest of all instincts the primitive sex traditions of the race before man was that music is rooted Beauty is the child of love Dante Gabriel Rossetti has imprisoned in a sonnet the almost intangible feeling aroused by music the feeling of having pursued in the immemorial past the route of evanescence Is it this sky s vast vault or ocean s sound That is Life s self and draws my life from me And by instinct ineffable decree Holds my breath Quailing on the bitter bound Nay is it Life or Death thus thunder crown d That mid the tide of all emergency Now notes my separate wave and to what sea Its difficult eddies labor in the ground Oh what is this that knows the road I came The flame turned cloud the cloud returned to flame The lifted shifted steeps and all the way That draws around me at last this wind warm space And in regenerate rapture turns my face Upon the devious coverts of dismay During the last half of the nineteenth century two men became rulers of musical emotion Richard Wagner and Frederic Francois Chopin The music of the latter is the most ravishing gesture that art has yet made Wagner and Chopin the macrocosm and the microcosm Wagner has made the largest impersonal synthesis attainable of the personal influences that thrill our lives cries Havelock Ellis Chopin a young man slight of frame furiously playing out upon the keyboard his soul the soul of his nation the soul of his time is the most individual composer that has ever set humming the looms of our dreams Wagner and Chopin have a motor element in their music that is fiercer intenser and more fugacious than that of all other composers For them is not the Buddhistic void in which shapes slowly form and fade their psychical tempo is devouring They voiced their age they moulded their age and we listen eagerly to them to these vibrile prophetic voices so sweetly corrosive bardic and appealing Chopin being nearer the soil in the selection of forms his style and structure are more naive more original than Wagner s while his medium less artificial is easier filled than the vast empty frame of the theatre Through their intensity of conception and of life both men touch issues though widely dissimilar in all else Chopin had greater melodic and as great harmonic genius as Wagner he made more themes he was as Rubinstein wrote the last of the original composers but his scope was not scenic he preferred the stage of his soul to the windy spaces of the music drama His is the interior play the eternal conflict between body and soul He viewed music through his temperament and it often becomes so imponderable so bodiless as to suggest a fourth dimension in the art Space is obliterated With Chopin one does not get as from Beethoven the sense of spiritual vastness of the overarching sublime There is the pathos of spiritual distance but it is pathos not sublimity His soul was a star and dwelt apart though not in the Miltonic or Wordsworthian sense A Shelley like tenuity at times wings his thought and he is the creator of a new thrill within the thrill The charm of the dying fall the unspeakable cadence of regret for the love that is dead is in his music like John Keats he sometimes sees Charm d magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn Chopin subtle souled psychologist is more kin to Keats than Shelley he is a greater artist than a thinker His philosophy is of the beautiful as was Keats and while he lingers by the river s edge to catch the song of the reeds his gaze is oftener fixed on the quiring planets He is nature s most exquisite sounding board and vibrates to her with intensity color and vivacity that have no parallel Stained with melancholy his joy is never that of the strong man rejoicing in his muscles Yet his very tenderness is tonic and his cry is ever restrained by an Attic sense of proportion Like Alfred De Vigny he dwelt in a tour d ivoire that faced the west and for him the sunrise was not but O the miraculous moons he discovered the sunsets and cloud shine His notes cast great rich shadows these chains of blown roses drenched in the dew of beauty Pompeian colors are too restricted and flat he divulges a world of half tones some enfolding sunny spots of greenery or singing in silvery shade the song of chromatic ecstasy others huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail and black upon black Chopin is the color genius of the piano his eye was attuned to hues the most fragile and attenuated he can weave harmonies that are as ghostly as a lunar rainbow And lunar like in their libration are some of his melodies glimpses mysterious and vast as of a strange world His utterances are always dynamic and he emerges betimes as if from Goya s tomb and etches with sardonic finger Nada in dust But this spirit of denial is not an abiding mood Chopin throws a net of tone over souls wearied with rancors and revolts bridges salty estranged seas of misery and presently we are viewing a mirrored a fabulous universe wherein Death is dead and Love reigns Lord of all II Heine said that every epoch is a sphinx which plunges into the abyss as soon as its problem is solved Born in the very upheaval of the Romantic revolution a revolution evoked by the intensity of its emotion rather than by the power of its ideas Chopin was not altogether one of the insurgents of art Just when his individual soul germinated who may tell In his early music are discovered the roots and fibres of Hummel and Field His growth involuntary inevitable put forth strange sprouts and he saw in the piano an instrument of two dimensions a third and so his music deepened and took on stranger colors The keyboard had never sung so before he forged its formula A new apocalyptic seal of melody and harmony was let fall upon it Sounding scrolls delicious arabesques gorgeous in tint martial lyric a resonance of emerald a sobbing of fountains as that Chopin of the Gutter Paul Verlaine has it the tear crystallized midway an arrested pearl were overheard in his music and Europe felt a new shudder of sheer delight The literary quality is absent and so is the ethical Chopin may prophesy but he never flames into the divers tongues of the upper heaven Compared with his passionate abandonment to the dance Brahms is the Lao tsze of music the great infant born with gray hair and with the slow smile of childhood Chopin seldom smiles and while some of his music is young he does not raise in the mind pictures of the fatuous romance of youth His passion is mature self sustained and never at a loss for the mot propre And with what marvellous vibration he gamuts the passions festooning them with carnations and great white tube roses but the dark dramatic motive is never lost in the decorative wiles of this magician As the man grew he laid aside his pretty garlands and his line became sterner its traceries more gothic he made Bach his chief god and within the woven walls of his strange harmonies he sings the history of a soul a soul convulsed by antique madness by the memory of awful things a soul lured by Beauty to secret glades wherein sacrificial rites are performed to the solemn sounds of unearthly music Like Maurice de Guerin Chopin perpetually strove to decipher Beauty s enigma and passionately demanded of the sphinx that defies Upon the shores of what oceans have they rolled the stone that hides them O Macareus His name was as the stroke of a bell to the Romancists he remained aloof from them though in a sympathetic attitude The classic is but the Romantic dead said an acute critic Chopin was a classic without knowing it he compassed for the dances of his land what Bach did for the older forms With Heine he led the spirit of revolt but enclosed his note of agitation in a frame beautiful The color the lithe perpetual escape from the formal deceived his critics Schumann among the rest Chopin like Flaubert was the last of the idealists the first of the realists The newness of his form his linear counterpoint misled the critics who accused him of the lack of it Schumann s formal deficiency detracts from much of his music and because of their formal genius Wagner and Chopin will live To Chopin might be addressed Sar Merodack Peladan s words When your hand writes a perfect line the Cherubim descend to find pleasure therein as in a mirror Chopin wrote many perfect lines he is above all the faultless lyrist the Swinburne the master of fiery many rhythms the chanter of songs before sunrise of the burden of the flesh the sting of desire and large moulded lays of passionate freedom His music is to quote Thoreau a proud sweet satire on the meanness of our life He had no feeling for the epic his genius was too concentrated and though he could be furiously dramatic the sustained majesty of blank verse was denied him With musical ideas he was ever gravid but their intensity is parent to their brevity And it must not be forgotten that with Chopin the form was conditioned by the idea He took up the dancing patterns of Poland because they suited his vivid inner life he transformed them idealized them attaining to more prolonged phraseology and denser architecture in his Ballades and Scherzi but these periods are passionate never philosophical All artists are androgynous in Chopin the feminine often prevails but it must be noted that this quality is a distinguishing sign of masculine lyric genius for when he unbends coquets and makes graceful confessions or whimpers in lyric loveliness at fate then his mother s sex peeps out a picture of the capricious beautiful tyrannical Polish woman When he stiffens his soul when Russia gets into his nostrils then the smoke and flame of his Polonaises the tantalizing despair of his Mazurkas are testimony to the strong man soul in rebellion But it is often a psychical masquerade The sag of melancholy is soon felt and the old Chopin the subjective Chopin wails afresh in melodic moodiness That he could attempt far flights one may see in his B flat minor Sonata in his Scherzi in several of the Ballades above all in the F minor Fantasie In this great work the technical invention keeps pace with the inspiration It coheres there is not a flaw in the reverberating marble not a rift in the idea If Chopin diseased to death s door could erect such a Palace of Dreams what might not he have dared had he been healthy But forth from his misery came sweetness and strength like honey from the lion He grew amazingly the last ten years of his existence grew with a promise that recalls Keats Shelley Mozart Schubert and the rest of the early slaughtered angelic crew His flame like spirit waxed and waned in the gusty surprises of a disappointed life To the earth for consolation he bent his ear and caught echoes of the cosmic comedy the far off laughter of the hills the lament of the sea and the mutterings of its depths These things with tales of sombre clouds and shining skies and whisperings of strange creatures dancing timidly in pavonine twilights he traced upon the ivory keys of his instrument and the world was richer for a poet Chopin is not only the poet of the piano he is also the poet of music the most poetic of composers Compared with him Bach seems a maker of solid polyphonic prose Beethoven a scooper of stars a master of growling storms Mozart a weaver of gay tapestries Schumann a divine stammerer Schubert alone of all the composers resembles him in his lyric prodigality Both were masters of melody but Chopin was the master workman of the two and polished after bending and beating his theme fresh from the fire of his forge He knew that to complete his wailing Iliads the strong hand of the reviser was necessary and he also realized that nothing is more difficult for the genius than to retain his gift Of all natures the most prone to pessimism procrastination and vanity the artist is most apt to become ennuied It is not easy to flame always at the focus to burn fiercely with the central fire Chopin knew this and cultivated his ego He saw too that the love of beauty for beauty s sake was fascinating but led to the way called madness So he rooted his art gave it the earth of Poland and its deliquescence is put off to the day when a new system of musical aestheticism will have routed the old when the Ugly shall be king and Melody the handmaiden of science But until that most grievous and undesired time he will catch the music of our souls and give it cry and flesh III Chopin is the open door in music Besides having been a poet and giving vibratory expression to the concrete he was something else he was a pioneer Pioneer because in youth he had bowed to the tyranny of the diatonic scale and savored the illicit joys of the chromatic It is briefly curious that Chopin is regarded purely as a poet among musicians and not as a practical musician They will swear him a phenomenal virtuoso but your musician orchestral and theoretical raises the eyebrow of the supercilious if Chopin is called creative A cunning finger smith a moulder of decorative patterns a master at making new figures all this is granted but speak of Chopin as path breaker in the harmonic forest that true forest of numbers as the forger of a melodic metal the sweetest purest in temper and lo you are regarded as one mentally askew Chopin invented many new harmonic devices he untied the chord that was restrained within the octave leading it into the dangerous but delectable land of extended harmonies And how he chromaticized the prudish rigid garden of German harmony how he moistened it with flashing changeful waters until it grew bold and brilliant with promise A French theorist Albert Lavignac calls Chopin a product of the German Romantic school This is hitching the star to the wagon Chopin influenced Schumann it can be proven a hundred times And Schumann understood Chopin else he could not have written the Chopin of the Carneval which quite out Chopins Chopin Chopin is the musical soul of Poland he incarnates its political passion First a Slav by adoption a Parisian he is the open door because he admitted into the West Eastern musical ideas Eastern tonalities rhythms in fine the Slavic all that is objectionable decadent and dangerous He inducted Europe into the mysteries and seductions of the Orient His music lies wavering between the East and the West A neurotic man his tissues trembling his sensibilities aflame the offspring of a nation doomed to pain and partition it was quite natural for him to go to France Poland had ever been her historical client the France that overheated all Europe Chopin born after two revolutions the true child of insurrection chose Paris for his second home Revolt sat easily upon his inherited aristocratic instincts no proletarian is quite so thorough a revolutionist as the born aristocrat witness Nietzsche and Chopin in the bloodless battle of the Romantics in the silent warring of Slav against Teuton Gaul and Anglo Saxon will ever stand as the protagonist of the artistic drama All that followed the breaking up of the old hard and fast boundaries on the musical map is due to Chopin A pioneer he has been rewarded as such by a polite ignorement or bland condescension He smashed the portals of the convention that forbade a man baring his soul to the multitude The psychology of music is the gainer thereby Chopin like Velasquez could paint single figures perfectly but to great massed effects he was a stranger Wagner did not fail to profit by his marvellously drawn soul portraits Chopin taught his century the pathos of patriotism and showed Grieg the value of national ore He practically re created the harmonic charts he gave voice to the individual himself a product of a nation dissolved by overwrought individualism As Schumann assures us his is the proudest and most poetic spirit of his time Chopin subdued by his familiar demon was a true specimen of Nietzsche s Ubermensch which is but Emerson s Oversoul shorn of her wings Chopin s transcendental scheme of technics is the image of a supernormal lift in composition He sometimes robs music of its corporeal vesture and his transcendentalism lies not alone in his striving after strange tonalities and rhythms but in seeking the emotionally recondite Self tormented ever a dweller on the threshold he saw visions that outshone the glories of Hasheesh and his nerve swept soul ground in its mills exceeding fine music His vision is of beauty he persistently groped at the hem of her robe but never sought to transpose or to tone the commonplace of life For this he reproved Schubert Such intensity cannot be purchased but at the cost of breadth of sanity and his picture of life is not so high wide sublime or awful as Beethoven s Yet is it just as inevitable sincere and as tragically poignant Stanislaw Przybyszewski in his Zur Psychologie des Individuums approaches the morbid Chopin the Chopin who threw open to the world the East who waved his chromatic wand to Liszt Tschaikowsky Saint Saens Goldmark Rubinstein Richard Strauss Dvorak and all Russia with its consonantal composers This Polish psychologist a fulgurant expounder of Nietzsche finds in Chopin faith and mania the true stigma of the mad individualist the individual who in the first instance is naught but an oxidation apparatus Nietzsche and Chopin are the most outspoken individualities of the age he forgets Wagner Chopin himself the finest flowering of a morbid and rare culture His music is a series of psychoses he has the sehnsucht of a marvellously constituted nature and the shrill dissonance of his nerves as seen in the physiological outbursts of the B minor Scherzo is the agony of a tortured soul The piece is Chopin s Iliad in it are the ghosts that lurk near the hidden alleys of the soul but here come out to leer and exult Horla the Horla of Guy de Maupassant the sinister Doppelganger of mankind which races with him to the goal of eternity perhaps to outstrip and master him in the next evolutionary cycle master as does man the brute creation This Horla according to Przybyszewski conquered Chopin and became vocal in his music this Horla has mastered Nietzsche who quite mad gave the world that Bible of the Ubermensch that dancing lyric prose poem Also Sprach Zarathustra Nietzsche s disciple is half right Chopin s moods are often morbid his music often pathological Beethoven too is morbid but in his kingdom so vast so varied the mood is lost or lightly felt while in Chopin s province it looms a maleficent upas tree with flowers of evil and its leaves glistering with sensuousness But so keen for symmetry for all the term formal beauty implies is Chopin that seldom does his morbidity madden his voluptuousness poison His music has its morass but also its upland where the gale blows strong and true Perhaps all art is as the incorrigible Nordau declares a slight deviation from the normal though Ribot scoffs at the existence of any standard of normality The butcher and the candle stick maker have their Horla their secret soul convulsions which they set down to taxation the vapors or weather Chopin has surprised the musical malady of the century He is its chief spokesman After the vague mad noble dreams of Byron Shelley and Napoleon the awakening found those disillusioned souls Wagner Nietzsche and Chopin Wagner sought in the epical rehabilitation of a vanished Valhalla a surcease from the world pain He consciously selected his anodyne and in Die Meistersinger touched a consoling earth Chopin and Nietzsche temperamentally finer and more sensitive than Wagner the one musically the other intellectually sang themselves in music and philosophy because they were so constituted Their nerves rode them to their death Neither found the serenity and repose of Wagner for neither was as sane and both suffered mortally from hyperaesthesia the penalty of all sick genius Chopin s music is the aesthetic symbol of a personality nurtured on patriotism pride and love that it is better expressed by the piano is because of that instrument s idiosyncrasies of evanescent tone sensitive touch and wide range in dynamics It was Chopin s lyre the orchestra of his heart from it he extorted music the most intimate since Sappho Among lyric moderns Heine closely resembles the Pole Both sang because they suffered sang ineffable and ironic melodies both will endure because of their brave sincerity their surpassing art The musical the psychical history of the nineteenth century would be incomplete without the name of Frederic Francois Chopin Wagner externalized its dramatic soul in Chopin the mad lyricism of the Time spirit is made eloquent Into his music modulated the poesy of his age he is one of its heroes a hero of whom Swinburne might have sung O strong winged soul with prophetic Lips hot with the blood beats of song With tremor of heart strings magnetic With thoughts as thunder in throng With consonant ardor of chords That pierce men s souls as with swords And hale them hearing along PART II HIS MUSIC VI THE STUDIES TITANIC EXPERIMENTS October twenty eighteen twenty nine Frederic Chopin aged twenty wrote to his friend Titus Woyciechowski from Warsaw I have composed a study in my own manner and November fourteen the same year I have written some studies in your presence I would play them well Thus quite simply and without booming of cannon or brazen proclamation by bell did the great Polish composer announce an event of supreme interest and importance to the piano playing world Niecks thinks these studies were published in the summer of eighteen thirty three July or August and were numbered op ten Another set of studies op twenty five did not find a publisher until eighteen thirty seven although some of them were composed at the same time as the previous work a Polish musician who visited the French capital in eighteen thirty four heard Chopin play the studies contained in op twenty five The C minor study op ten No twelve commonly known as the Revolutionary was born at Stuttgart September eighteen thirty one while under the excitement caused by the news of the taking of Warsaw by the Russians on September eight eighteen thirty one These dates are given so as to rout effectually any dilatory suspicion that Liszt influenced Chopin in the production of his masterpieces Lina Ramann in her exhaustive biography of Franz Liszt openly declares that Nos nine and twelve of op ten and Nos eleven and twelve of op twenty five reveal the influence of the Hungarian virtuoso Figures prove the fallacy of her assertion The influence was the other way as Liszt s three concert studies show not to mention other compositions When Chopin arrived in Paris his style had been formed he was the creator of a new piano technique The three studies known as Trois Nouvelles Etudes which appeared in eighteen forty in Moscheles and Fetis Method of Methods were published separately afterward Their date of composition we do not know Many are the editions of Chopin s studies but after going over the ground one finds only about a dozen worthy of study and consultation Karasowski gives the date of the first complete edition of the Chopin works as eighteen forty six with Gebethner Wolff Warsaw as publishers Then according to Niecks followed Tellefsen Klindworth Bote Bock Scholtz Peters Breitkopf Hartel Mikuli Schuberth Kahnt Steingraber better known as Mertke s and Schlesinger edited by the great pedagogue Theodor Kullak Xaver Scharwenka has edited Klindworth for the London edition of Augener company Mikuli criticised the Tellefsen edition yet both men had been Chopin pupils This is a significant fact and shows that little reliance can be placed on the brave talk about tradition Yet Mikuli had the assistance of a half dozen of Chopin s favorite pupils and in addition Ferdinand Hiller Herman Scholtz who edited the works for Peters based his results on careful inspection of original French German and English editions besides consulting M Georges Mathias a pupil of Chopin If Fontana Wolff Gutmann Mikuli and Tellefsen who copied from the original Chopin manuscripts under the supervision of the composer cannot agree then upon what foundation are reared the structures of the modern critical editions The early French German and Polish editions are faulty indeed useless because of misprints and errata of all kinds Every succeeding edition has cleared away some of these errors but only in Karl Klindworth has Chopin found a worthy though not faultless editor His edition is a work of genius and was called by Von Bulow the only model edition In a few sections others such as Kullak doctor Hugo Riemann and Hans von Bulow may have outstripped him but as a whole his editing is amazing for its exactitude scholarship fertility in novel fingerings and sympathetic insight in phrasing This edition appeared at Moscow from eighteen seventy three to eighteen seventy six The twenty seven studies of Chopin have been separately edited by Riemann and Von Bulow Let us narrow our investigations and critical comparisons to Klindworth Von Bulow Kullak and Riemann Carl Reinecke s edition of the studies in Breitkopf Hartel s collection offers nothing new neither do Mertke Scholtz and Mikuli The latter one should keep at hand because of the possible freedom from impurities in his text but of phrasing or fingering he contributes little It must be remembered that with the studies while they completely exhibit the entire range of Chopin s genius the play s the thing after all The poetry the passion of the Ballades and Scherzi wind throughout these technical problems like a flaming skein With the modern avidity for exterior as well as interior analysis Mikuli Reinecke Mertke and Scholtz evidence little sympathy It is then from the masterly editing of Kullak Von Bulow Riemann and Klindworth that I shall draw copiously They have in their various ways given us a clue to their musical individuality as well as their precise scholarship Klindworth is the most genially intellectual Von Bulow the most pedagogic and Kullak is poetic while Riemann is scholarly the latter gives more attention to phrasing than to fingering The Chopin studies are poems fit for Parnassus yet they also serve a very useful purpose in pedagogy Both aspects the material and the spiritual should be studied and with four such guides the student need not go astray In the first study of the first book op ten dedicated to Liszt Chopin at a leap reached new land Extended chords had been sparingly used by Hummel and Clementi but to take a dispersed harmony and transform it into an epical study to raise the chord of the tenth to heroic stature that could have been accomplished by Chopin only And this first study in C is heroic Theodore Kullak writes of it Above a ground bass proudly and boldly striding along flow mighty waves of sound The etude whose technical end is the rapid execution of widely extended chord figurations exceeding the span of an octave is to be played on the basis of forte throughout With sharply dissonant harmonies the forte is to be increased to fortissimo diminishing again with consonant ones Pithy accents Their effect is enhanced when combined with an elastic recoil of the hand The irregular black ascending and descending staircases of notes strike the neophyte with terror Like Piranesi s marvellous aerial architectural dreams these dizzy acclivities and descents of Chopin exercise a charm hypnotic if you will for eye as well as ear Here is the new technique in all its nakedness new in the sense of figure design pattern web new in a harmonic way The old order was horrified at the modulatory harshness the young sprigs of the new fascinated and a little frightened A man who could explode a mine that assailed the stars must be reckoned with The nub of modern piano music is in the study the most formally reckless Chopin ever penned Kullak gives Chopin s favorite metronome sign one hundred seventy six to the quarter but this editor rightly believes that the majestic grandeur is impaired and suggests one hundred fifty two instead The gain is at once apparent Indeed Kullak a man of moderate pulse is quite right in his strictures on the Chopin tempi tempi that sprang from the expressively light mechanism of the prevailing pianos of Chopin s day Von Bulow declares that the requisite suppleness of the hand in gradual extension and rapid contraction will be most quickly attained if the player does not disdain first of all to impress on the individual fingers the chord which is the foundation of each arpeggio a sound pedagogic point He also inveighs against the disposition to play the octave basses arpeggio In fact those basses are the argument of the play they must be granitic ponderable and powerful The same authority calls attention to a misprint C which he makes B flat the last note treble in the twenty ninth bar Von Bulow gives the Chopin metronomic marking It remained for Riemann to make some radical changes This learned and worthy doctor astonished the musical world a few years by his new marks of phrasing in the Beethoven symphonies They topsy turvied the old bowing With Chopin new dynamic and agogic accents are rather dangerous at least to the peace of mind of worshippers of the Chopin fetish Riemann breaks two bars into one It is a finished period for him and by detaching several of the sixteenths in the first group the first and fourth he makes the accent clearer at least to the eye He indicates alla breve with eighty eight to the half In later studies examples will be given of this phrasing a phrasing that becomes a mannerism with the editor He offers no startling finger changes The value of his criticism throughout the volume seems to be in the phrasing and this by no means conforms to accepted notions of how Chopin should be interpreted I intend quoting more freely from Riemann than from the others but not for the reason that I consider him as a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night in the desirable land of the Chopin fitudes rather because his piercing analysis lays bare the very roots of these shining examples of piano literature Klindworth contents himself with a straightforward version of the C major study his fingering being the clearest and most admirable The Mikuli edition makes one addition it is a line which binds the last note of the first group to the first of the second The device is useful and occurs only on the upward flights of the arpeggio This study suggests that its composer wished to begin the exposition of his wonderful technical system with a skeletonized statement It is the tree stripped of its bark the flower of its leaves yet austere as is the result there is compensating power dignity and unswerving logic This study is the key with which Chopin unlocked not his heart but the kingdom of technique It should be played for variety unisono with both hands omitting of course the octave bass Von Bulow writes cannily enough that the second study in A minor being chromatically related to Moscheles etude op seventy No three that piece should prepare the way for Chopin s more musical composition In different degrees of tempo strength and rhythmic accent it should be practised omitting the thumb and first finger Mikuli s metronome is one hundred forty four to the quarter Von Bulow s one hundred fourteen Klindworth s the same as Mikuli and Riemann is seventy two to the half with an alla breve The fingering in three of these authorities is almost identical Riemann has ideas of his own both in the phrasing and figuration Look at these first two bars

none	none	without caption Von Bulow orders the middle harmonies to be played throughout distinctly and yet transiently in German fluchtig In fact the entire composition with its murmuring meandering chromatic character is a forerunner to the whispering weaving moonlit effects in some of his later studies The technical purpose is clear but not obtrusive It is intended for the fourth and fifth finger of the right hand but given in unison with both hands it becomes a veritable but laudable torture for the thumb of the left With the repeat of the first at bar thirty six Von Bulow gives a variation in fingering Kullak s method of fingering is this Everywhere that two white keys occur in succession the fifth finger is to be used for C and F in the right hand and for F and E in the left He has also something to say about holding the hand sideways so that the back of the hand and arm form an angle This question of hand position particularly in Chopin is largely a matter of individual formation No two hands are alike no two pianists use the same muscular movements Play along the easiest line of resistance We now have reached a study the third in which the more intimately known Chopin reveals himself This one in E is among the finest flowering of the composer s choice garden It is simpler less morbid sultry and languorous therefore saner than the much bepraised study in C sharp minor No seven op twenty five Niecks writes that this study may be counted among Chopin s loveliest compositions It combines classical chasteness of contour with the fragrance of romanticism Chopin told his faithful Gutmann that he had never in his life written another such melody and once when hearing it raised his arms aloft and cried out Oh ma patrie I cannot vouch for the sincerity of Chopin s utterance for as Runciman writes They were a very Byronic set these young men and they took themselves with ludicrous seriousness Von Bulow calls it a study in expression which is obvious and thinks it should be studied in company with No six in E flat minor This reason is not patent Emotions should not be hunted in couples and the very object of the collection variety in mood as well as mechanism is thus defeated But Von Bulow was ever an ardent classifier Perhaps he had his soul compartmentized He also attempts to regulate the rubato this is the first of the studies wherein the rubato s rights must be acknowledged The bars are even mentioned thirty two thirty three thirty six and thirty seven where tempo license may be indulged But here is a case which innate taste and feeling must guide You can no more teach a real Chopin rubato not the mawkish imitation than you can make a donkey comprehend Kant The metronome is the same in all editions one hundred to the eighth Kullak rightly calls this lovely study ein wunderschones poetisches Tonstuck more in the nocturne than study style He gives in the bravura like cadenza an alternate for small hands but small hands should not touch this piece unless they can grapple the double sixths with ease Klindworth fingers the study with great care The figuration in three of the editions is the same Mikuli separating the voices distinctly Riemann exercises all his ingenuity to make the beginning clear to the eye Musical score excerpt What a joy is the next study No four How well Chopin knew the value of contrast in tonality and sentiment A veritable classic is this piece which despite its dark key color C sharp minor as a foil to the preceding one in E bubbles with life and spurts flame It reminds one of the story of the Polish peasants who are happiest when they sing in the minor mode Kullak calls this a bravura study for velocity and lightness in both hands Accentuation fiery while Von Bulow believes that the irresistible interest inspired by the spirited content of this truly classical and model piece of music may become a stumbling block in attempting to conquer the technical difficulties Hardly The technics of this composition do not lie beneath the surface They are very much in the way of clumsy fingers and heavy wrists Presto eighty eight to the half is the metronome indication in all five editions Klindworth does not comment but I like his fingering and phrasing best of all Riemann repeats his trick of breaking a group detaching a note for emphasis although he is careful to retain the legato bow One wonders why this study does not figure more frequently on programmes of piano recitals It is a fine healthy technical test it is brilliant and the coda is very dramatic Ten bars before the return of the theme there is a stiff digital hedge for the student A veritable lance of tone is this study if justly poised Riemann has his own ideas of the phrasing of the following one the fifth and familiar Black Key etude Examine the first bar Musical Illustration without caption Von Bulow would have grown jealous if he had seen this rather fantastic phrasing It is a trifle too finical though it must be confessed looks pretty I like longer breathed phrasing The student may profit by this analysis The piece is indeed as Kullak says full of Polish elegance Von Bulow speaks rather disdainfully of it as a Damen Salon Etude It is certainly graceful delicately witty a trifle naughty arch and roguish and it is delightfully invented Technically it requires smooth velvet tipped fingers and a supple wrist In the fourth bar third group third note of group Klindworth and Riemann print E flat instead of D flat Mikuli Kullak and Von Bulow use the D flat Now which is right The D flat is preferable There are already two E flats in the bar The change is an agreeable one Joseffy has made a concert variation for this study The metronome of the original is given at one hundred sixteen to the quarter A dark doleful nocturne is No six in E flat minor Niecks praises it in company with the preceding one in E It is beautiful if music so sad may be called beautiful and the melody is full of stifled sorrow The study figure is ingenious but subordinated to the theme In the E major section the piece broadens to dramatic vigor Chopin was not yet the slave of his mood There must be a psychical programme to this study some record of a youthful disillusion but the expression of it is kept well within chaste lines The Sarmatian composer had not yet unlearned the value of reserve The Klindworth reading of this troubled poem is the best though Kullak used Chopin s autographic copy There is no metronomic sign in this autograph Tellefsen gives sixty nine to the quarter Klindworth sixty Riemann sixty nine Mikuli the same Von Bulow and Kullak sixty Kullak also gives several variante from the text adding an A flat to the last group in bar II Riemann and the others make the same addition The note must have been accidentally omitted from the Chopin autograph Two bars will illustrate what Riemann can accomplish when he makes up his mind to be explicit leaving little to the imagination Illustration without caption A luscious touch and a sympathetic soul is needed for this nocturne study We emerge into a clearer more bracing atmosphere in the C major study No seven It is a genuine toccata with moments of tender twilight serving a distinct technical purpose the study of double notes and changing on one key and is as healthy as the toccata by Robert Schumann Here is a brave an undaunted Chopin a gay cavalier with the sunshine shimmering about him There are times when this study seems like light dripping through the trees of a mysterious forest with the delicato there are Puck like rustlings and all the while the pianist without imagination is exercising wrist and ringers in a technical exercise Were ever Beauty and Duty so mated in double harness Pegasus pulling a cloud charged with rain over an arid country For study playing the entire composition with a wrist stroke is advisable It will secure clear articulation staccato and finger memory Von Bulow phrases the study in groups of two Kullak in sixes Klindworth and Mikuli the same while Riemann in alternate twos fours and sixes One sees his logic rather than hears it Von Bulow plastically reproduces the flitting elusive character of the study far better than the others It is quite like him to suggest to the panting and ambitious pupil that the performance in F sharp major with the same fingering as the next study in F No eight would be beneficial It certainly would By the same token the playing of the F minor Sonata the Appassionata of Beethoven in the key of F sharp minor might produce good results This was another crotchet of Wagner s friend and probably was born of the story that Beethoven transposed the Bach fugues in all keys The same is said of Saint Saens In his notes to the F major study Theodor Kullak expatiates at length upon his favorite idea that Chopin must not be played according to his metronomic markings The original autograph gives ninety six to the half the Tellefsen edition eighty eight Klindworth eighty Von Bulow eighty nine Mikuli eighty eight and Riemann the same Kullak takes the slower tempo of Klindworth believing that the old Herz and Czerny ideals of velocity are vanished that the shallow dip of the keys in Chopin s day had much to do with the swiftness and lightness of his playing The noble more sonorous tone of a modern piano requires greater breadth of style and less speedy passage work There can be no doubt as to the wisdom of a broader treatment of this charming display piece How it makes the piano sound what a rich brilliant sweep it secures It elbows the treble to its last euphonious point glitters and crests itself only to fall away as if the sea were melodic and could shatter and tumble into tuneful foam The emotional content is not marked The piece is for the fashionable salon or the concert hall One catches at its close the overtones of bustling plaudits and the clapping of gloved palms Ductility an aristocratic ease a delicate touch and fluent technique will carry off this study with good effect Technically it is useful one must speak of the usefulness of Chopin even in these imprisoned iridescent soap bubbles of his On the fourth line and in the first bar of the Kullak version there is a chord of the dominant seventh in dispersed position that does not occur in any other edition Yet it must be Chopin or one of his disciples for this autograph is in the Royal Library at Berlin Kullak thinks it ought to be omitted moreover he slights an E flat that occurs in all the other editions situated in the fourth group of the twentieth bar from the end The F minor study No nine is the first one of those tone studies of Chopin in which the mood is more petulant than tempestuous The melody is morbid almost irritating and yet not without certain accents of grandeur There is a persistency in repetition that foreshadows the Chopin of the later sadder years The figure in the left hand is the first in which a prominent part is given to that member Not as noble and sonorous a figure as the one in the C minor study it is a distinct forerunner of the bass of the D minor Prelude In this F minor study the stretch is the technical object It is rather awkward for close knit fingers The best fingering is Von Bulow s It is five three one four one three for the first figure All the other editions except Riemann s recommend the fifth finger on F the fourth on C Von Billow believes that small hands beginning with his system will achieve quicker results than by the Chopin fingering This is true Riemann phrases the study with a multiplicity of legato bows and dynamic accents Kullak prefers the Tellefsen metronome eighty rather than the traditional ninety six Most of the others use eighty eight to the quarter except Riemann who espouses the more rapid gait of ninety six Klindworth with his eighty eight strikes a fair medium The verdict of Von Bulow on the following study in A flat No ten has no uncertainty of tone in its proclamation He who can play this study in a really finished manner may congratulate himself on having climbed to the highest point of the pianist s Parnassus as it is perhaps the most difficult piece of the entire set The whole repertory of piano music does not contain a study of perpetuum mobile so full of genius and fancy as this particular one is universally acknowledged to be except perhaps Liszt s Feux Follets The most important point would appear to lie not so much in the interchange of the groups of legato and staccato as in the exercise of rhythmic contrasts the alternation of two and three part metre that is of four and six in the same bar To overcome this fundamental difficulty in the art of musical reproduction is the most important thing here and with true zeal it may even be accomplished easily Kullak writes Harmonic anticipations a rich rhythmic life originating in the changing articulation of the twelve eights in groups of three and two each This etude is an exceedingly piquant composition possessing for the hearer a wondrous fantastic charm if played with the proper insight The metronomic marking is practically the same in all editions one hundred fifty two to the quarter notes The study is one of the most charming of the composer There is more depth in it than in the G flat and F major studies and its effectiveness in the virtuoso sense is unquestionable A savor of the salon hovers over its perfumed measures but there is grace spontaneity and happiness Chopin must have been as happy as his sensitive nature would allow when he conceived this vivacious caprice In all the editions Riemann s excepted there is no doubt left as to the alternations of metres Here are the first few bars of Von Billow s which is normal phrasing Musical score excerpt Read Riemann s version of these bars Musical score excerpt Riemann is conducive to clear sighted phrasing and will set the student thinking but the general effect of accentuation is certainly different All the editors quoted agree with Von Bulow Klindworth and Kullak But if this is a marked specimen of Riemann examine his reading of the phrase wherein Chopin s triple rhythm is supplanted by duple Thus Von Bulow and who will dare cavil Musical score excerpt Riemann Musical score excerpt The difference is more imaginary than real for the stems of the accented notes give us the binary metre But the illustration serves to show how doctor Riemann is disposed to refine upon the gold of Chopin Kullak dilates upon a peculiarity of Chopin the dispersed position of his underlying harmonies This in a footnote to the eleventh study of op ten Here one must let go the critical valve else strangle in pedagogics So much has been written so much that is false perverted sentimentalism and unmitigated cant about the nocturnes that the wonder is the real Chopin lover has not rebelled There are pearls and diamonds in the jewelled collection of nocturnes many are dolorous few dramatic and others are sweetly insane and songful I yield to none in my admiration for the first one of the two in G minor for the psychical despair in the C sharp minor nocturne for that noble drama called the C minor nocturne for the B major the Tuberose nocturne and for the E D flat and G major nocturnes it remains unabated But in the list there is no such picture painted a Corot if ever there was one as this E flat study Its novel design delicate arabesques as if the guitar had been dowered with a soul and the richness and originality of its harmonic scheme gives us pause to ask if Chopin s invention is not almost boundless The melody itself is plaintive a plaintive grace informs the entire piece The harmonization is far more wonderful but to us the chord of the tenth and more remote intervals seem no longer daring modern composition has devilled the musical alphabet into the very caverns of the grotesque yet there are harmonies in the last page of this study that still excite wonder The fifteenth bar from the end is one that Richard Wagner might have made From that bar to the close every group is a masterpiece Remember this study is a nocturne and even the accepted metronomic markings in most editions seventy six to the quarter are not too slow they might even be slower Allegretto and not a shade speedier The color scheme is celestial and the ending a sigh not unmixed with happiness Chopin sensitive poet had his moments of peace of divine content lebensruhe The dizzy appoggiatura leaps in the last two bars set the seal of perfection upon this unique composition Touching upon the execution one may say that it is not for small hands nor yet for big fists The former must not believe that any arrangements or simplified versions will ever produce the aerial effect the swaying of the tendrils of tone intended by Chopin Very large hands are tempted by their reach to crush the life out of the study in not arpeggiating it This I have heard and the impression was indescribably brutal As for fingering Mikuli Von Bulow Kullak Riemann and Klindworth all differ and from them must most pianists differ Your own grasp individual sense of fingering and tact will dictate the management of technics Von Bulow gives a very sensible pattern to work from and Kullak is still more explicit He analyzes the melody and planning the arpeggiating with scrupulous fidelity he shows why the arpeggiating must be affected with the utmost rapidity bordering upon simultaneousness of harmony in the case of many chords Kullak has something to say about the grace notes and this bids me call your attention to Von Bulow s change in the appoggiatura at the last return of the subject A bad misprint is in the Von Bulow edition it is in the seventeenth bar from the end the lowest note in the first bass group and should read E natural instead of the E flat that stands Von Bulow does not use the arpeggio sign after the first chord He rightly believes it makes unclear for the student the subtleties of harmonic changes and fingering He also suggests quite like the fertile Hans Guido that players who have sufficient patience and enthusiasm for the task would find it worth their while to practise the arpeggi the reverse way from top to bottom or in contrary motion beginning with the top note in one hand and the bottom note in the other A variety of devices like this would certainly help to give greater finish to the task Doubtless but consider man s years are but threescore and ten The phrasing of the various editions examined do not vary much Riemann is excepted who has his say in this fashion at the beginning Musical score excerpt More remarkable still is the diversity of opinion regarding the first three bass chord groups in the fifteenth bar from the close the bottom notes in the Von Bulow and Klindworth editions are B flat and two A naturals and in the Riemann Kullak and Mikuli editions the notes are two B flats and one A natural The former sounds more varied but we may suppose the latter to be correct because of Mikuli Here is the particular bar as given by Riemann Musical score excerpt Yet this exquisite flight into the blue this nocturne which should be played before sundown excited the astonishment of Mendelssohn the perplexed wrath of Moscheles and the contempt of Rellstab editor of the Iris who wrote in that journal in eighteen thirty four of the studies in op ten Those who have distorted fingers may put them right by practising these studies but those who have not should not play them at least not without having a surgeon at hand What incredible surgery would have been needed to get within the skull of this narrow critic any savor of the beauty of these compositions In the years to come the Chopin studies will be played for their music without any thought of their technical problems Now the young eagle begins to face the sun begins to mount on wind weaving pinions We have reached the last study of op ten the magnificent one in C minor Four pages suffice for a background upon which the composer has flung with overwhelming fury the darkest the most demoniac expressions of his nature Here is no veiled surmise no smothered rage but all sweeps along in tornadic passion Karasowski s story may be true regarding the genesis of this work but true or not it is one of the greatest dramatic outbursts in piano literature Great in outline pride force and velocity it never relaxes its grim grip from the first shrill dissonance to the overwhelming chordal close This end rings out like the crack of creation It is elemental Kullak calls it a bravura study of the very highest order for the left hand It was composed in eighteen thirty one in Stuttgart shortly after Chopin had received tidings of the taking of Warsaw by the Russians September eight eighteen thirty one Karasowski wrote Grief anxiety and despair over the fate of his relatives and his dearly beloved father filled the measure of his sufferings Under the influence of this mood he wrote the C minor Etude called by many the Revolutionary Etude Out of the mad and tempestuous storm of passages for the left hand the melody rises aloft now passionate and anon proudly majestic until thrills of awe stream over the listener and the image is evoked of Zeus hurling thunderbolts at the world Niecks thinks it superbly grand and furthermore writes The composer seems fuming with rage the left hand rushes impetuously along and the right hand strikes in with passionate ejaculations Von Bulow said This C minor study must be considered a finished work of art in an even higher degree than the study in C sharp minor All of which is pretty but not enough to the point Von Bulow fingers the first passage for the left hand in a very rational manner Klindworth differs by beginning with the third instead of the second finger while Riemann dear innovator takes the group second first third and then the fifth finger on D if you please Kullak is more normal beginning with the third Here is Riemann s phrasing and grouping for the first few bars Notice the half note with peculiar changes of fingering at the end It gives surety and variety Von Bulow makes the changes ring on the second and fifth instead of third and fifth fingers Thus Riemann Musical score excerpt In the above the accustomed phrasing is altered for in all other editions the accent falls upon the first note of each group In Riemann the accentuation seems perverse but there is no question as to its pedagogic value It may be ugly but it is useful though I should not care to hear it in the concert room Another striking peculiarity of the Riemann phrasing is his heavy accent on the top E flat in the principal passage for the left hand He also fingers what Von Bulow calls the chromatic meanderings in an unusual manner both on the first page and the last His idea of the enunciation of the first theme is peculiar Musical score excerpt Mikuli places a legato bow over the first three octaves so does Kullak Von Bulow only over the last two which gives a slightly different effect while Klindworth does the same as Kullak The heavy dynamic accents employed by Riemann are unmistakable They signify the vital importance of the phrase at its initial entrance He does not use it at the repetition but throughout both dynamic and agogic accents are unsparingly used and the study seems to resound with the sullen booming of a park of artillery The working out section with its anticipations of Tristan and Isolde is phrased by all the editors as it is never played Here the technical figure takes precedence over the law of the phrase and so most virtuosi place the accent on the fifth finger regardless of the pattern This is as it should be In Klindworth there is a misprint at the beginning of the fifteenth bar from the end in the bass It should read B natural not B flat The metronome is the same in all editions one hundred sixty to the quarter but speed should give way to breadth at all hazards Von Bulow is the only editor to my knowledge who makes an enharmonic key change in this working out section It looks neater sounds the same but is it Chopin He also gives a variant for public performance by transforming the last run in unisono into a veritable hurricane by interlocked octaves The effect is brazen Chopin needs no such clangorous padding in this etude which gains by legitimate strokes the most startling contrasts The study is full of tremendous pathos it compasses the sublime and in its most torrential moments the composer never quite loses his mental equipoise He too can evoke tragic spirits and at will send them scurrying back to their dim profound It has but one rival in the Chopin studies No twelve op twenty five in the same key II Opus twenty five twelve studies by Frederic Chopin are dedicated to Madame la Comtesse d Agoult The set opens with the familiar study in A flat so familiar that I shall not make further ado about it except to say that it is delicious but played often and badly All that modern editing can do since Miluki is to hunt out fresh accentuation Von Bullow is the worst sinner in this respect for he discovers quaint nooks and dells for his dynamics undreamed of by the composer His edition should be respectfully studied and when mastered discarded for a more poetic interpretation Above all poetry poetry and pedals Without pedalling of the most varied sort this study will remain as dry as a dog gnawed bone Von Bulow says the figure must be treated as a double triplet twice three and not three times two as indicated in the first two bars Klindworth makes the group a sextolet Von Bulow has set forth numerous directions in fingering and phrasing giving the exact number of notes in the bass trill at the end Kullak uses the most ingenious fingering Look at the last group of the last bar second line third page It is the last word in fingering Better to end with Robert Schumann s beautiful description of this study as quoted by Kullak In treating of the present book of Etudes Robert Schumann after comparing Chopin to a strange star seen at midnight wrote as follows Whither his path lies and leads or how long how brilliant its course is yet to be who can say As often however as it shows itself there is ever seen the same deep dark glow the same starry light and the same austerity so that even a child could not fail to recognize it But besides this I have had the advantage of hearing most of these Etudes played by Chopin himself and quite a la Chopin did he play them Of the first one especially he writes Imagine that an aeolian harp possessed all the musical scales and that the hand of an artist were to cause them all to intermingle in all sorts of fantastic embellishments yet in such a way as to leave everywhere audible a deep fundamental tone and a soft continuously singing upper voice and you will get the right idea of his playing But it would be an error to think that Chopin permitted every one of the small notes to be distinctly heard It was rather an undulation of the A flat major chord here and there thrown aloft anew by the pedal Throughout all the harmonies one always heard in great tones a wondrous melody while once only in the middle of the piece besides that chief song a tenor voice became prominent in the midst of chords After the Etude a feeling came over one as of having seen in a dream a beatific picture which when half awake one would gladly recall After these words there can be no doubt as to the mode of delivery No commentary is required to show that the melodic and other important tones indicated by means of large notes must emerge from within the sweetly whispering waves and that the upper tones must be combined so as to form a real melody with the finest and most thoughtful shadings The twenty fourth bar of this study in A major is so Lisztian that Liszt must have benefited by its harmonies And then he played the second in the book in F minor one in which his individuality displays itself in a manner never to be forgotten How charming how dreamy it was Soft as the song of a sleeping child Schumann wrote this about the wonderful study in F minor which whispers not of baleful deeds in a dream as does the last movement of the B flat minor sonata but is the song of a sleeping child No comparison could be prettier for there is a sweet delicate drone that sometimes issues from childish lips having a charm for ears not attuned to grosser things This must have been the study that Chopin played for Henrietta Voigt at Leipsic September twelve eighteen thirty six In her diary she wrote The over excitement of his fantastic manner is imparted to the keen eared It made me hold my breath Wonderful is the ease with which his velvet fingers glide I might almost say fly over the keys He has enraptured me in a way which hitherto had been unknown to me What delighted me was the childlike natural manner which he showed in his demeanor and in his playing Von Bulow believes the interpretation of this magical music should be without sentimentality almost without shading clearly delicately and dreamily executed An ideal pianissimo an accentless quality and completely without passion or rubato There is little doubt this was the way Chopin played it Liszt is an authority on the subject and M Mathias corroborates him Regarding the rhythmical problem to be overcome the combination of two opposing rhythms Von Bulow indicates an excellent method and Kullak devotes part of a page to examples of how the right then the left and finally both hands are to be treated Kullak furthermore writes Or if one will he may also betake himself in fancy to a still green dusky forest and listen in profound solitude to the mysterious rustling and whispering of the foliage What indeed despite the algebraic character of the tone language may not a lively fancy conjure out of or rather into this etude But one thing is to be held fast it is to be played in that Chopin like whisper of which among others Mendelssohn also affirmed that for him nothing more enchanting existed But enough of subjective fancies This study contains much beauty and every bar rules over a little harmonic kingdom of its own It is so lovely that not even the Brahms distortion in double notes or the version in octaves can dull its magnetic crooning At times so delicate is its design that it recalls the faint fantastic tracery made by frost on glass In all instances save one it is written as four unbroken quarter triplets in the bar right hand Not so Riemann He has views of his own both as to fingering and phrasing Musical score excerpt Jean Kleczynski s interesting brochure The Works of Frederic Chopin and Their Proper Interpretation is made up of three lectures delivered at Warsaw While the subject is of necessity foreshortened he says some practical things about the use of the pedals in Chopin s music He speaks of this very study in F minor and the enchanting way Rubinstein and Essipowa ended it the echo like effects on the four C s the pedal floating the tone The pedals are half the battle in Chopin playing ONE CAN NEVER PLAY CHOPIN BEAUTIFULLY ENOUGH Realistic treatment dissipates his dream palaces shatters his aerial architecture He may be played broadly fervently dramatically but coarsely never I deprecate the rose leaf sentimentalism in which he is swathed by nearly all pianists Chopin is a sigh with something pleasing in it wrote some one and it is precisely this notion which has created such havoc among his interpreters But if excess in feeling is objectionable so too is the healthy reading accorded his works by pianists with more brawn than brain The real Chopin player is born and can never be a product of the schools Schumann thinks the third study in F less novel in character although here the master showed his admirable bravura powers But he continues they are all models of bold indwelling creative force truly poetic creations though not without small blots in their details but on the whole striking and powerful Yet if I give my complete opinion I must confess that his earlier collection seems more valuable to me Not that I mean to imply any deterioration for these recently published studies were nearly all written at the same time as the earlier ones and only a few were composed a little while ago the first in A flat and the last magnificent one in C minor both of which display great mastership One may be permitted to disagree with Schumann for op twenty five contains at least two of Chopin s greater studies A minor and C minor The most valuable point of the passage quoted is the clenching of the fact that the studies were composed in a bunch That settles many important psychological details Chopin had suffered much before going to Paris had undergone the purification and renunciation of an unsuccessful love affair and arrived in Paris with his style fully formed in his case the style was most emphatically the man Kullak calls the study in F a spirited little caprice whose kernel lies in the simultaneous application of four different little rhythms to form a single figure in sound which figure is then repeated continuously to the end In these repetitions however changes of accentuation fresh modulations and piquant antitheses serve to make the composition extremely vivacious and effective He pulls apart the brightly colored petals of the thematic flower and reveals the inner chemistry of this delicate growth Four different voices are distinguished in the kernel The third voice is the chief one and after it the first because they determine the melodic and harmonic contents Musical score excerpt of four different voices Kullak and Mikuli dot the C of the first bar Klindworth and Von Bulow do not As to phrasing and fingering I pin my faith to Riemann His version is the most satisfactory Here are the first bars The idea is clearly expressed Musical score excerpt Best of all is the careful accentuation and at a place indicated in no other edition that I have examined With the arrival of the thirty second notes Riemann punctuates the theme this way Musical score excerpt The melody of course in profile is in the eighth notes This gives meaning to the decorative pattern of the passage And what charm buoyancy and sweetness there is in this caprice It has the tantalizing elusive charm of a humming bird in full flight The human element is almost eliminated We are in the open the sun blazes in the blue and all is gay atmospheric and illuding Even where the tone deepens where the shadows grow cooler and darker in the B major section there is little hint of preoccupation with sadness Subtle are the harmonic shifts admirable the ever changing devices of the figuration Riemann accents the B the E A B flat C and F at the close perilous leaps for the left hand but they bring into fine relief the exquisite harmonic web An easy way of avoiding the tricky position in the left hand at this spot thirteen bars from the close is to take the upper C in bass with the right hand thumb and in the next bar the upper B in bass the same way This minimizes the risk of the skip and it is perfectly legitimate to do this in public at least The ending to be breathed away according to Kullak is variously fingered He also prescribes a most trying fingering for the first group fourth finger on both hands This is useful for study but for performance the third finger is surer Von Bulow advises the player to keep the upper part of the body as still as possible as any haste of movement would destroy the object in view which is the acquisition of a loose wrist He also suggests certain phrasing in bar seventeen and forbids a sharp cutting manner in playing the sforzati at the last return of the subject Kullak is copious in his directions and thinks the touch should be light and the hand gliding and in the B major part fiery wilful accentuation of the inferior beats Capricious fantastic and graceful this study is Chopin in rare spirits Schumann has the phrase the study should be executed with amiable bravura There is a misprint in the Kullak edition at the beginning of the thirty second notes an A instead of an F upsets the tonality besides being absurd Of the fourth study in A minor there is little to add to Theodor Kullak who writes In the broadest sense of the word every piece of music is an etude In a narrower sense however we demand of an etude that it shall have a special end in view promote facility in something and lead to the conquest of some particular difficulty whether of technics of rhythm expression or delivery Robert Schumann Collected Writings i two hundred one The present study is less interesting from a technical than a rhythmical point of view While the chief beats of the measure first threed fifth and seventh eighths are represented only by single tones in the bass part which are to a certain extent free and unconcerned and void of all encumbrance the inferior parts of the measure twod fourth sixth and eighth eighths are burdened with chords the most of which moreover are provided with accents in opposition to the regular beats of the measure Further there is associated with these chords or there may be said to grow out of them a cantilene in the upper voice which appears in syncopated form opposite to the strong beats of the bass This cantilene begins on a weak beat and produces numerous suspensions which in view of the time of their entrance appear as so many retardations and delayals of melodic tones All these things combine to give the composition a wholly peculiar coloring to render its flow somewhat restless and to stamp the etude as a little characteristic piece a capriccio which might well be named Inquietude As regards technics two things are to be studied the staccato of the chords and the execution of the cantilena The chords must be formed more by pressure than by striking The fingers must support themselves very lightly upon the chord keys and then rise again with the back of the hand in the most elastic manner The upward movement of the hand must be very slight Everything must be done with the greatest precision and not merely in a superficial manner Where the cantilena appears every melodic tone must stand apart from the tones of the accompaniment as if in relief Hence the fingers for the melodic tones must press down the keys allotted to them with special force in doing which the back of the hand may be permitted to turn lightly to the right sideward stroke especially when there is a rest in the accompaniment Compare with this etude the introduction to the Capriccio in B minor with orchestra by Felix Mendelssohn first page Aside from a few rallentando places the etude is to be played strictly in time I prefer the Klindworth editing of this rather sombre nervous composition which may be merely an etude but it also indicates a slightly pathologic condition With its breath catching syncopations and narrow emotional range the A minor study has nevertheless moments of power and interest Riemann s phrasing while careful is not more enlightening than Klindworth s Von Bulow says The bass must be strongly marked throughout even when piano and brought out in imitation of the upper part Singularly enough his is the only edition in which the left hand arpeggios at the close though in the final bar both hands may do so This is editorial quibbling Stephen Heller remarked that this study reminded him of the first bar of the Kyrie rather the Requiem Aeternam of Mozart s Requiem It is safe to say that the fifth study in E minor is less often heard in the concert room than any one of its companions I cannot recall having heard it since Annette Essipowa gave that famous recital during which she played the entire twenty seven studies Yet it is a sonorous piano piece rich in embroideries and general decorative effect in the middle section Perhaps the rather perverse capricious and not altogether amiable character of the beginning has caused pianists to be wary of introducing it at a recital It is hugely effective and also difficult especially if played with the same fingering throughout as Von Bulow suggests Niecks quotes Stephen Heller s partiality for this very study In the Gazette Musicale February twenty four eighteen thirty nine Heller wrote of Chopin s op twenty five What more do we require to pass one or several evenings in as perfect a happiness as possible As for me I seek in this collection of poesy this is the only name appropriate to the works of Chopin some favorite pieces which I might fix in my memory rather than others Who could retain everything For this reason I have in my notebook quite particularly marked the numbers four five and seven of the present poems Of these twelve much loved studies every one of which has a charm of its own the three numbers are those I prefer to all the rest The middle part of this E minor study recalls Thalberg Von Bulow cautions the student against the accenting of the first note with the thumb right hand as it does not form part of the melody but only comes in as an unimportant passing note This refers to the melody in E He also writes that the addition of the third in the left hand Klindworth edition needs no special justification I discovered one marked difference in the Klindworth edition The leap in the left hand first variant of the theme tenth bar from beginning is preceded by an appoggiatura E natural The jump is to F sharp instead of G as in the Mikuli Kullak and Riemann editions Von Bulow uses the F sharp but without the ninth below Riemann phrases the piece so as to get the top melody B E and G and his stems are below instead of above as in Mikuli and Von Bulow Kullak dots the eighth note Riemann uses a sixteenth thus Musical score excerpt Kullak writes that the figure one hundred eighty four is not found on the older metronomes This is not too fast for the capriccio with its pretty and ingenious rhythmical transformations As regards the execution of the one hundred and thirtieth bar Von Bulow says The acciaccature prefixes are to be struck simultaneously with the other parts as also the shake in bar one hundred thirty four and following bars this must begin with the upper auxiliary note These details are important Kullak concludes his notes thus Despite all the little transformations of the motive member which forms the kernel its recognizability remains essentially unimpaired Meanwhile out of these little metamorphoses there is developed a rich rhythmic life which the performer must bring out with great precision If in addition he possesses a fine feeling for what is graceful coquettish or agreeably capricious he will understand how to heighten still further the charm of the chief part which as far as its character is concerned reminds one of Etude op twenty five No three The secondary part in major begins Its kernel is formed of a beautiful broad melody which if soulfully conceived and delivered will sing its way deep into the heart of the listener For the accompaniment in the right hand we find chord arpeggiations in triplets afterward in sixteenths calmly ascending and descending and surrounding the melody as with a veil They are to be played almost without accentuation It was Louis Ehlert who wrote of the celebrated study in G sharp minor op twenty five No six Chopin not only versifies an exercise in thirds he transforms it into such a work of art that in studying it one could sooner fancy himself on Parnassus than at a lesson He deprives every passage of all mechanical appearance by promoting it to become the embodiment of a beautiful thought which in turn finds graceful expression in its motion And indeed in the piano literature no more remarkable merging of matter and manner exists The means justifies the end and the means employed by the composer are beautiful there is no other word to describe the style and architectonics of this noble study It is seldom played in public because of its difficulty With the Schumann Toccata the G sharp minor study stands at the portals of the delectable land of Double Notes Both compositions have a common ancestry in the Czerny Toccata and both are the parents of such a sensational offspring as Balakirew s Islamey In reading through the double note studies for the instrument it is in the nature of a miracle to come upon Chopin s transfiguration of such a barren subject This study is first music then a technical problem Where two or three pianists are gathered together in the name of Chopin the conversation is bound to formulate itself thus How do you finger the double chromatic thirds in the G sharp minor study That question answered your digital politics are known You are classified ranged If you are heterodox you are eagerly questioned if you follow Von Bulow and stand by the Czerny fingering you are regarded as a curiosity As the interpretation of the study is not taxing let us examine the various fingerings First a fingering given by Leopold Godowsky It is for double chromatic thirds Musical score excerpt You will now be presented with a battalion of authorities so that you may see at a glance the various efforts to climb those slippery chromatic heights Here is Mikuli Musical score excerpt Kullak s is exactly the same as above It is the so called Chopin fingering as contrasted with the so called Czerny fingering though in reality Clementi s as mister John Kautz contends In the latter the third and fifth fingers fall upon C sharp and E and F sharp and A in the right hand and upon C and E flat and G and B flat in the left Klindworth also employs the Chopin fingering Von Bulow makes this statement As the peculiar fingering adopted by Chopin for chromatic scales in thirds appears to us to render their performance in legatissimo utterly unattainable on our modern instruments we have exchanged it where necessary for the older method of Hummel Two of the greatest executive artists of modern times Alexander Dreyschock and Carl Tausig were theoretically and practically of the same opinion It is to be conjectured that Chopin was influenced in his method of fingering by the piano of his favorite makers Pleyel and Wolff of Paris who before they adopted the double echappement certainly produced instruments with the most pliant touch possible and therefore regarded the use of the thumb in the ascending scale on two white keys in succession the semitones EF and BC as practicable On the grand piano of the present day we regard it as irreconcilable with conditions of crescendo legato This Chopin fingering in reality derives directly from Hummel See his Piano School So he gives this fingering Musical score excerpt He also suggests the following phrasing for the left hand This is excellent Musical score excerpt Riemann not only adopts new fingering for the double note scale but also begins the study with the trill on first and third second and fourth instead of the usual first and fourth second and fifth fingers adopted by the rest This is his notion of the run in chromatic thirds Musical score excerpt For the rest the study must be played like the wind or as Kullak says Apart from a few places and some accents the Etude is to be played almost throughout in that Chopin whisper The right hand must play its thirds especially the diatonic and chromatic scales with such equality that no angularity of motion shall be noticeable where the fingers pass under or over each other The left hand too must receive careful attention and special study The chord passages and all similar ones must be executed discreetly and legatissimo Notes with double stems must be distinguished from notes with single stems by means of stronger shadings for they are mutually interconnected Von Bulow calls the seventh study the one in C sharp minor a nocturne a duo for cello and flute He ingeniously smooths out the unequal rhythmic differences of the two hands and justly says the piece does not work out any special technical matter This study is the most lauded of all Yet I cannot help agreeing with Niecks who writes of it he oddly enough places it in the key of E A duet between a He and a She of whom the former shows himself more talkative and emphatic than the latter is indeed very sweet but perhaps also somewhat tiresomely monotonous as such tete a tetes naturally are to third parties For Chopin s contemporaries this was one of his greatest efforts Heller wrote It engenders the sweetest sadness the most enviable torments and if in playing it one feels oneself insensibly drawn toward mournful and melancholy ideas it is a disposition of the soul which I prefer to all others Alas how I love these sombre and mysterious dreams and Chopin is the god who creates them In this etude Kleczynski thinks there are traces of weariness of life and quotes Orlowski Chopin s friend He is only afflicted with homesickness Willeby calls this study the most beautiful of them all For me it is both morbid and elegiac There is nostalgia in it the nostalgia of a sick lacerated soul It contains in solution all the most objectionable and most endearing qualities of the master Perhaps we have heard its sweet highly perfumed measures too often Its interpretation is a matter of taste Kullak has written the most ambitious programme for it Here is a quotation from Albert R Parsons translation in Schirmer s edition of Kullak Throughout the entire piece an elegiac mood prevails The composer paints with psychologic truthfulness a fragment out of the life of a deeply clouded soul He lets a broken heart filled with grief proclaim its sorrow in a language of pain which is incapable of being misunderstood The heart has lost not something but everything The tones however do not always bear the impress of a quiet melancholy resignation More passionate impulses awaken and the still plaint becomes a complaint against cruel fate It seeks the conflict and tries through force of will to burst the fetters of pain or at least to alleviate it through absorption in a happy past But in vain The heart has not lost something it has lost everything The musical poem divides into three or if one views the little episode in B major as a special part into four parts strophes of which the last is an elaborated repetition of the first with a brief closing part appended The whole piece is a song or better still an aria in which two principal voices are to be brought out the upper one is in imitation of a human voice while the lower one must bear the character throughout of an obligato violoncello It is well known that Chopin was very fond of the violoncello and that in his piano compositions he imitated the style of passages peculiar to that instrument The two voices correspond closely supplementing and imitating each other reciprocally Between the two a third element exists an accompaniment of eighths in uniform succession without any significance beyond that of filling out the harmony This third element is to be kept wholly subordinate The little one voiced introduction in recitative style which precedes the aria reminds one vividly of the beginning of the Ballade in G minor op twenty three The D flat study No eight is called by Von Bulow the most useful exercise in the whole range of etude literature It might truly be called l indispensable du pianiste if the term through misuse had not fallen into disrepute As a remedy for stiff fingers and preparatory to performing in public playing it six times through is recommended even to the most expert pianist Only six times The separate study of the left hand is recommended Kullak finds this study surprisingly euphonious but devoid of depth of content It is an admirable study for the cultivation of double sixths It contains a remarkable passage of consecutive fifths that set the theorists by the ears Riemann manages to get some new editorial comment upon it The nimble study No nine which bears the title of The Butterfly is in G flat Von Bulow transposes it enharmonically to F sharp avoiding numerous double flats The change is not laudable He holds anything but an elevated opinion of the piece classing it with a composition of the Charles Mayer order This is unjust the study if not deep is graceful and certainly very effective It has lately become the stamping ground for the display of piano athletics Nearly all modern virtuosi pull to pieces the wings of this gay little butterfly They smash it they bang it and adding insult to cruelty they finish it with three chords mounting an octave each time thus giving a conventional character to the close the very thing the composer avoids Much distorted phrasing is also indulged in The Tellefsen s edition and Klindworth s give these differences Musical score excerpt Mikuli Von Bulow and Kullak place the legato bow over the first three notes of the group Riemann of course is different Musical score excerpt The metronomic markings are about the same in all editions Asiatic wildness according to Von Bulow pervades the B minor study op twenty five No ten although Willeby claims it to be only a study in octaves for the left hand Von Bulow furthermore compares it because of its monophonic character to the Chorus of Dervishes in Beethoven s Ruins of Athens Niecks says it is a real pandemonium for a while holier sounds intervene but finally hell prevails The study is for Kullak somewhat far fetched and forced in invention and leaves one cold although it plunges on wildly to the end Von Bulow has made the most complete edition Klindworth strengthens the first and the seventh eighth notes of the fifth bar before the last by filling in the harmonics of the left hand This etude is an important one technically because many pianists make little of it that does not abate its musical significance and I am almost inclined to group it with the last two studies of this opus The opening is portentous and soon becomes a driving whirlwind of tone Chopin has never penned a lovelier melody than the one in B the middle section of this etude it is only to be compared to the one in the same key in the B minor Scherzo while the return to the first subject is managed as consummately as in the E flat minor Scherzo from op thirty five I confess to being stirred by this B minor study with its tempo at a forced draught and with its precipitous close There is a lushness about the octave melody the tune may be a little overripe but it is sweet sensuous music and about it hovers the hush of a rich evening in early autumn And now the Winter Wind the study in A minor op twenty five No eleven Here even Von Bulow becomes enthusiastic It must be mentioned as a particular merit of this the longest and in every respect the grandest of Chopin s studies that while producing the greatest fulness of sound imaginable it keeps itself so entirely and utterly unorchestral and represents piano music in the most accurate sense of the word To Chopin is due the honor and credit of having set fast the boundary between piano and orchestral music which through other composers of the romantic school especially Robert Schumann has been defaced and blotted out to the prejudice and damage of both species Kullak is equally as warm in his praise of it One of the grandest and most ingenious of Chopin s etudes and a companion piece to op ten No twelve which perhaps it even surpasses It is a bravura study of the highest order and is captivating through the boldness and originality of its passages whose rising and falling waves full of agitation overflow the entire keyboard captivating through its harmonic and modulatory shadings and captivating finally through a wonderfully invented little theme which is drawn like a red thread through all the flashing and glittering waves of tone and which as it were prevents them from scattering to all quarters of the heavens This little theme strictly speaking only a phrase of two measures is in a certain sense the motto which serves as a superscription for the etude appearing first one voiced and immediately afterward four voiced The slow time Lento shows the great importance which is to be attached to it They who have followed thus far and agree with what has been said cannot be in doubt concerning the proper artistic delivery To execute the passages quite in the rapid time prescribed one must possess a finished technique Great facility lightness of touch equality strength and endurance in the forte passages together with the clearest distinctness in the piano and pianissimo all of this must have been already achieved for the interpreter must devote his whole attention to the poetic contents of the composition especially to the delivery of the march like rhythms which possess a life of their own appearing now calm and circumspect and anon bold and challenging The march like element naturally requires strict playing in time This study is magnificent and moreover it is music In bar fifteen Von Bulow makes B natural the second note of the last group although all other editions except Klindworth use a B flat Von Bulow has common sense on his side The B flat is a misprint The same authority recommends slow staccato practice with the lid of the piano closed Then the hurly burly of tone will not intoxicate the player and submerge his critical faculty Each editor has his notion of the phrasing of the initial sixteenths Thus Mikuli s which is normal Musical score excerpt Klindworth fingers this passage more ingeniously but phrases it about the same omitting the sextolet mark Kullak retains it Von Bulow makes his phrase run in this fashion Musical score excerpt As regards grouping Riemann follows Von Bulow but places his accents differently The canvas is Chopin s largest for the idea and its treatment are on a vastly grander scale than any contained in the two concertos The latter are after all miniatures precious ones if you will joined and built with cunning artifice in neither work is there the resistless overflow of this etude which has been compared to the screaming of the winter blasts Ah how Chopin puts to flight those modern men who scheme out a big decorative pattern and then have nothing wherewith to fill it He never relaxes his theme and its fluctuating surprises are many The end is notable for the fact that scales appear Chopin very seldom uses scale figures in his studies From Hummel to Thalberg and Herz the keyboard had glittered with spangled scales Chopin must have been sick of them as sick of them as of the left hand melody with arpeggiated accompaniment in the right a la Thalberg Scales had been used too much hence Chopin s sparing employment of them In the first C sharp minor study op ten there is a run for the left hand in the coda In the seventh study same key op twenty five there are more The second study of op ten in A minor is a chromatic scale study but there are no other specimens of the form until the mighty run at the conclusion of this A minor study It takes prodigious power and endurance to play this work prodigious power passion and no little poetry It is open air music storm music and at times moves in processional splendor Small souled men no matter how agile their fingers should avoid it The prime technical difficulty is the management of the thumb Kullak has made a variant at the end for concert performance It is effective The average metronomic marking is sixty nine to the half Kullak thinks the twelfth and last study of op twenty five in C minor a grand magnificent composition for practice in broken chord passages for both hands which requires no comment I differ from this worthy teacher Rather is Niecks more to my taste No twelve C minor in which the emotions rise not less high than the waves of arpeggios which symbolize them Von Bulow is didactic The requisite strength for this grandiose bravura study can only be attained by the utmost clearness and thus only by a gradually increasing speed It is therefore most desirable to practise it piano also by way of variety for otherwise the strength of tone might easily degenerate into hardness and in the poetic striving after a realistic portrayal of a storm on the piano the instrument as well as the piece would come to grief The pedal is needful to give the requisite effect and must change with every new harmony but it should only be used in the latter stages of study when the difficulties are nearly mastered We have our preferences Mine in op twenty five is the C minor study which like the prelude in D minor is full of the sound of great guns Willeby thinks otherwise On page eighty one in his life of Chopin he has the courage to write Had Professor Niecks applied the term monotonous to No twelve we should have been more ready to indorse his opinion as although great power is manifested the very sameness of the form of the arpeggio figure causes a certain amount of monotony to be felt The C minor study is in a degree a return to the first study in C While the idea in the former is infinitely nobler more dramatic and tangible there is in the latter naked primeval simplicity the larger eloquence the elemental puissance Monotonous A thousand times no Monotonous as is the thunder and spray of the sea when it tumbles and roars on some sullen savage shore Beethov ian in its ruggedness the Chopin of this C minor study is as far removed from the musical dandyisms of the Parisian drawing rooms as is Beethoven himself It is orchestral in intention and a true epic of the piano Riemann places half notes at the beginning of each measure as a reminder of the necessary clinging of the thumbs I like Von Bulow s version the best of all His directions are most minute He gives the Liszt method of working up the climax in octave triplets How Liszt must have thundered through this tumultuous work Before it all criticism should be silenced that fails to allow Chopin a place among the greatest creative musicians We are here in the presence of Chopin the musician not Chopin the composer for piano III In eighteen forty Trois Nouvelles Etudes by Frederic Chopin appeared in the Methode des Methodes pour le piano by F J Fetis and I Moscheles It was odd company for the Polish composer Internal evidence seems to show writes Niecks that these weakest of the master s studies which however are by no means uninteresting and certainly very characteristic may be regarded more than op twenty five as the outcome of a gleaning The last decade has added much to the artistic stature of these three supplementary studies They have something of the concision of the Preludes The first is a masterpiece In F minor the theme in triplet quarters broad sonorous and passionate is unequally pitted against four eight notes in the bass The technical difficulty to be overcome is purely rhythmic and Kullak takes pains to show how it may be overcome It is the musical the emotional content of the study that fascinates The worthy editor calls it a companion piece to the F minor study in op twenty five The comparison is not an apt one Far deeper is this new study and although the doors never swing quite open we divine the tragic issues concealed Beautiful in a different way is the A flat study which follows Again the problem is a rhythmical one and again the composer demonstrates his exhaustless invention and his power of evoking a single mood viewing all its lovely contours and letting it melt away like dream magic Full of gentle sprightliness and lingering sweetness is this study Chopin has the hypnotic quality more than any composer of the century Richard Wagner excepted After you have enjoyed playing this study read Kullak and his triplicity in biplicity It may do you good and it will not harm the music In all the editions save one that I have seen the third study in D flat begins on A flat like the famous Valse in D flat The exception is Klindworth who starts with B flat the note above The study is full of sunny good humor spiritualized humor and leaves the most cheering impression after its performance Its technical object is a simultaneous legato and staccato The result is an idealized Valse in allegretto tempo the very incarnation of joy tempered by aristocratic reserve Chopin never romps but he jests wittily and always in supremely good taste This study fitly closes his extraordinary labors in this form and it is as if he had signed it F Chopin et ego in Arcady Among the various editions let me recommend Klindworth for daily usage while frequent reference to Von Bulow Riemann and Kullak cannot fail to prove valuable curious and interesting Of the making of Chopin editions there is seemingly no end In eighteen ninety four I saw in manuscript some remarkable versions of the Chopin Studies by Leopold Godowsky The study in G sharp minor was the first one published and played in public by this young pianist Unlike the Brahms derangements they are musical but immensely difficult Topsy turvied as are the figures a Chopin even if lop sided hovers about sometimes with eye brows uplifted sometimes with angry knitted forehead and not seldom amused to the point of smiling You see his narrow shoulders shrugged in the Polish fashion as he examines the study in double thirds transposed to the left hand Curiously enough this transcription difficult as it is does not tax the fingers as much as a bedevilment of the A minor op twenty five No four which is extremely difficult demanding color discrimination and individuality of finger More breath catching and a piece at which one must cry out Hats off gentlemen A tornado is the caprice called Badinage But if it is meant to badinage it is no sport for the pianist of everyday technical attainments This is formed of two studies In the right hand is the G flat study op twenty five No nine and in the left the black key study op ten No five The two go laughing through the world like old friends brother and sister they are tonally trailing behind them a cloud of iridescent glory Godowsky has cleverly combined the two following their melodic curves as nearly as is possible In some places he has thickened the harmonies and shifted the black key figures to the right hand It is the work of a remarkable pianist This is the way it looks on paper at the beginning Musical llustration The same study G flat op ten No five is also treated separately the melody being transferred to the treble The Butterfly octaves in another study are made to hop nimbly along in the left hand and the C major study op ten No seven Chopin s Toccata is arranged for the left hand and seems very practical and valuable Here the adapter has displayed great taste and skill especially on the third page The pretty musical idea is not destroyed but viewed from other points of vantage Op ten No two is treated like a left hand study as it should be Chopin did not always give enough work to the left hand and the first study of this opus in C is planned on brilliant lines for both hands Ingenious is the manipulation of the seldom played op twenty five No five in E minor As a study in rhythms and double notes it is very welcome The F minor study op twenty five No two as considered by the ambidextrous Godowsky is put in the bass where it whirrs along to the melodic encouragement of a theme of the paraphraser s own in the right This study has suffered the most of all for Brahms in his heavy Teutonic way set it grinding double sixths while Isidor Philipp in his Studies for the Left Hand has harnessed it to sullen octaves This Frenchman by the way has also arranged for left hand alone the G sharp minor the D flat double sixths the A minor Winter Wind studies the B flat minor prelude and terrible to relate the last movement of the Chopin B flat minor Sonata Are the Godowsky transcriptions available Certainly In ten years so rapid is the technical standard advancing they will be used in the curriculum of students Whether he has treated Chopin with reverence I leave my betters to determine What has reverence to do with the case anyhow Plato is parsed in the schoolroom and Beethoven taught in conservatories Therefore why worry over the question of Godowsky s attitude Besides he is writing for the next generation presumably a generation of Rosenthals And now having passed over the salt and stubbly domain of pedagogics what is the dominant impression gleaned from the twenty seven Chopin studies Is it not one of admiration tinged with wonder at such a prodigal display of thematic and technical invention Their variety is great the aesthetic side is nowhere neglected for the purely mechanical and in the most poetic of them stuff may be found for delicate fingers Astounding canorous enchanting alembicated and dramatic the Chopin studies are exemplary essays in emotion and manner In them is mirrored all of Chopin the planetary as well as the secular Chopin When most of his piano music has gone the way of all things fashioned by mortal hands these studies will endure will stand for the nineteenth century as Beethoven crystallized the eighteenth Bach the seventeenth centuries in piano music Chopin is a classic VII MOODS IN MINIATURE THE PRELUDES The Preludes bear the opus number twenty eight and are dedicated to J C Kessler a composer of well known piano studies It is only the German edition that bears his name the French and English being inscribed by Chopin a son ami Pleyel As Pleyel advanced the pianist two thousand francs for the Preludes he had a right to say These are my Preludes Niecks is authority for Chopin s remark I sold the Preludes to Pleyel because he liked them This was in eighteen thirty eight when Chopin s health demanded a change of climate He wished to go to Majorca with Madame Sand and her children and had applied for money to the piano maker and publisher Camille Pleyel He received but five hundred francs in advance the balance being paid on delivery of the manuscript The Preludes were published in eighteen thirty nine yet there is internal evidence which proves that most of them had been composed before the trip to the Balearic Islands This will upset the very pretty legend of music making at the monastery of Valdemosa Have we not all read with sweet credulity the eloquent pages in George Sand in which the storm is described that overtook the novelist and her son Maurice After terrible trials dangers and delays they reached their home and found Chopin at the piano Uttering a cry he arose and stared at the pair Ah I knew well that you were dead It was the sixth prelude the one in B minor that he played and dreaming as Sand writes that he saw himself drowned in a lake heavy ice cold drops of water fell at regular intervals upon his breast and when I called his attention to those drops of water which were actually falling upon the roof he denied having heard them He was even vexed at what I translated by the term imitative harmony He protested with all his might and he was right against the puerility of these imitations for the ear His genius was full of mysterious harmonies of nature Yet this prelude was composed previous to the Majorcan episode The Preludes says Niecks consist to a great extent at least of pickings from the composer s portfolios of pieces sketches and memoranda written at various times and kept to be utilized when occasion might offer Gutmann Chopin s pupil who nursed him to the last declared the Preludes to have been composed before he went away with Madame Sand and to Niecks personally he maintained that he had copied all of them Niecks does not credit him altogether for there are letters in which several of the Preludes are mentioned as being sent to Paris so he reaches the conclusion that Chopin s labors at Majorca on the Preludes were confined to selecting filing and polishing This seems to be a sensible solution Robert Schumann wrote of these Preludes I must signalize them as most remarkable I will confess I expected something quite different carried out in the grand style of his studies It is almost the contrary here these are sketches the beginning of studies or if you will ruins eagles feathers all strangely intermingled But in every piece we find in his own hand Frederic Chopin wrote it One recognizes him in his pauses in his impetuous respiration He is the boldest the proudest poet soul of his time To be sure the book also contains some morbid feverish repellant traits but let everyone look in it for something that will enchant him Philistines however must keep away It was in these Preludes that Ignaz Moscheles first comprehended Chopin and his methods of execution The German pianist had found his music harsh and dilettantish in modulation but Chopin s originality of performance he glides lightly over the keys in a fairy like way with his delicate fingers quite reconciled the elder man to this strange music To Liszt the Preludes seem modestly named but are not the less types of perfection in a mode created by himself and stamped like all his other works with the high impress of his poetic genius Written in the commencement of his career they are characterized by a youthful vigor not to be found in some of his subsequent works even when more elaborate finished and richer in combinations a vigor which is entirely lost in his latest productions marked by an overexcited sensibility a morbid irritability and giving painful intimations of his own state of suffering and exhaustion Liszt as usual erred on the sentimental side Chopin being essentially a man of moods like many great men and not necessarily feminine in this respect cannot always be pinned down to any particular period Several of the Preludes are very morbid I purposely use this word as is some of his early music while he seems quite gay just before his death The Preludes follow out no technical idea are free creations on a small basis and exhibit the musician in all his versatility says Louis Ehlert No work of Chopin s portrays his inner organization so faithfully and completely Much is embryonic It is as though he turned the leaves of his fancy without completely reading any page Still one finds in them the thundering power of the Scherzi the half satirical half coquettish elegance of the Mazurkas and the southern luxuriously fragrant breath of the Nocturnes Often it is as though they were small falling stars dissolved into tones as they fall Jean Kleczynski who is credited with understanding Chopin himself a Pole and a pianist thinks that people have gone too far in seeking in the Preludes for traces of that misanthropy of that weariness of life to which he was prey during his stay in the Island of Majorca Very few of the Preludes present this character of ennui and that which is the most marked the second one must have been written according to Count Tarnowski a long time before he went to Majorca What is there to say concerning the other Preludes full of good humor and gaiety No eighteen in E flat No twenty one in B flat No twenty three in F or the last in D minor Is it not strong and energetic concluding as it does with three cannon shots Willeby in his Frederic Francois Chopin considers at length the Preludes He agrees in the main with Niecks that certain of these compositions were written at Valdemosa Nos four six nine thirteen twenty and twenty one and that Chopin having sketches of others with him completed the whole there and published them under one opus number The atmosphere of those I have named is morbid and azotic to them there clings a faint flavor of disease a something which is overripe in its lusciousness and febrile in its passion This in itself inclines me to believe they were written at the time named This is all very well but Chopin was faint and febrile in his music before he went to Majorca and the plain facts adduced by Gutmann and Niecks cannot be passed over Henry James an old admirer of Madame Sand admits her utter unreliability and so we may look upon her evidence as romantic but by no means infallible The case now stands Chopin may have written a few of the Preludes at Majorca filed them finished them but the majority of them were in his portfolio in eighteen thirty seven and eighteen thirty eight Op forty five a separate Prelude in C sharp minor was published in December eighteen forty one It was composed at Nohant in August of that year It is dedicated to Mme la Princesse Elizabeth Czernicheff whose name as Chopin confesses in a letter he knows not how to spell II Theodore Kullak is curt and pedagogic in his preface to the Preludes He writes Chopin s genius nowhere reveals itself more charmingly than within narrowly bounded musical forms The Preludes are in their aphoristic brevity masterpieces of the first rank Some of them appear like briefly sketched mood pictures related to the nocturne style and offer no technical hindrance even to the less advanced player I mean Nos four six seven nine fifteen and twenty More difficult are Nos seventeen twenty five and eleven without however demanding eminent virtuosity The other Preludes belong to a species of character etude Despite their brevity of outline they are on a par with the great collections op ten and op twenty five In so far as it is practicable special cases of individual endowments not being taken into consideration I would propose the following order of succession Begin with Nos one fourteen ten twenty two twenty three three and eighteen Very great bravura is demanded by Nos twelve eight sixteen and twenty four The difficulty of the other Preludes Nos two five thirteen nineteen and twenty one lies in the delicate piano and legato technique which on account of the extended positions leaps and double notes presupposes a high degree of development This is eminently a common sense grouping The first prelude which like the first etude begins in C has all the characteristics of an impromptu We know the wonderful Bach Preludes which grew out of a free improvisation to the collection of dance forms called a suite and the preludes which precede his fugues In the latter Bach sometimes exhibits all the objectivity of the study or toccata and often wears his heart in full view Chopin s Preludes the only preludes to be compared to Bach s are largely personal subjective and intimate This first one is not Bach ian yet it could have been written by no one but a devout Bach student The pulsating passionate agitated feverish hasty qualities of the piece are modern so is the changeful modulation It is a beautiful composition rising to no dramatic heights but questioning and full of life Klindworth writes in triplet groups Kullak in quintolets Breitkopf Hartel do not doctor Hugo Riemann who has edited a few of the Preludes phrases the first bars thus Desperate and exasperating to the nerves is the second prelude in A minor It is an asymmetric tune Chopin seldom wrote ugly music but is this not ugly forlorn despairing almost grotesque and discordant It indicates the deepest depression in its sluggish snake like progression Willeby finds a resemblance to the theme of the first nocturne And such a theme The tonality is vague beginning in E minor Chopin s method of thematic parallelism is here very clear A small figure is repeated in descending keys until hopeless gloom and depraved melancholy are reached in the closing chords Chopin now is morbid here are all his most antipathetic qualities There is aversion to life in this music he is a true lycanthrope A self induced hypnosis a mental an emotional atrophy are all present Kullak divides the accompaniment difficult for small hands between the two Riemann detaches the eighth notes of the bass figures as is his wont for greater clearness Like Klindworth he accents heavily the final chords He marks his metronome fifty to the half note All the editions are lento with alla breve That the Preludes are a sheaf of moods loosely held together by the rather vague title is demonstrated by the third in the key of G The rippling rain like figure for the left hand is in the nature of a study The melody is delicate in sentiment Gallic in its esprit A true salon piece this prelude has no hint of artificiality It is a precise antithesis to the mood of the previous one Graceful and gay the G major prelude is a fair reflex of Chopin s sensitive and naturally buoyant nature It requires a light hand and nimble fingers The melodic idea requires no special comment Kullak phrases it differently from Riemann and Klindworth The latter is the preferable Klindworth gives seventy two to the half note as his metronomic marking Riemann only sixty which is too slow while Klindworth contents himself by marking a simple Vivace Regarding the fingering one may say that all tastes are pleased in these three editions Klindworth s is the easiest Riemann breaks up the phrase in the bass figure but I cannot see the gain on the musical side Niecks truthfully calls the fourth prelude in E minor a little poem the exquisitely sweet languid pensiveness of which defies description The composer seems to be absorbed in the narrow sphere of his ego from which the wide noisy world is for the time shut out Willeby finds this prelude to be one of the most beautiful of these spontaneous sketches for they are no more than sketches The melody seems literally to wail and reaches its greatest pitch of intensity at the stretto For Karasowski it is a real gem and alone would immortalize the name of Chopin as a poet It must have been this number that impelled Rubinstein to assert that the Preludes were the pearls of his works In the Klindworth edition fifth bar from the last the editor has filled in the harmonies to the first six notes of the left hand added thirds which is not reprehensible although uncalled for Kullak makes some new dynamic markings and several enharmonic changes He also gives as metronome sixty nine to the quarter This tiny prelude contains wonderful music The grave reiteration of the theme may have suggested to Peter Cornelius his song Ein Ton Chopin expands a melodic unit and one singularly pathetic The whole is like some canvas by Rembrandt Rembrandt who first dramatized the shadow in which a single motif is powerfully handled some sombre effect of echoing light in the profound of a Dutch interior For background Chopin has substituted his soul no one in art except Bach or Rembrandt could paint as Chopin did in this composition Its despair has the antique flavor and there is a breadth nobility and proud submission quite free from the tortured whimpering complaint of the second prelude The picture is small but the subject looms large in meanings The fifth prelude in D is Chopin at his happiest Its arabesque pattern conveys a most charming content and there is a dewy freshness a joy in life that puts to flight much of the morbid tittle tattle about Chopin s sickly soul The few bars of this prelude so seldom heard in public reveal musicianship of the highest order The harmonic scheme is intricate Klindworth phrases the first four bars so as to bring out the alternate B and B flat It is Chopin spinning his finest his most iridescent web The next prelude the sixth in B minor is doleful pessimistic As George Sand says It precipitates the soul into frightful depression It is the most frequently played and oh how meaninglessly prelude of the set this and the one in D flat Classical is its repression of feeling its pure contour The echo effect is skilfully managed monotony being artfully avoided Klindworth rightfully slurs the duple group of eighths Kullak tries for the same effect by different means The duality of the voices should be clearly expressed The tempo marked in both editions lento assai is fast To be precise Klindworth gives sixty six to the quarter The plaintive little mazurka of two lines the seventh prelude is a mere silhouette of the national dance Yet in its measures is compressed all Mazovia Klindworth makes a variant in the fourth bar from the last a G sharp instead of an F sharp It is a more piquant climax perhaps not admissible to the Chopin purist In the F sharp minor prelude No seven Chopin gives us a taste of his grand manner For Niecks the piece is jerky and agitated and doubtless suggests a mental condition bordering on anxiety but if frenzy there is it is kept well in check by the exemplary taste of the composer The sadness is rather elegiac remote and less poignant than in the E minor prelude Harmonic heights are reached on the second page surely Wagner knew these bars when he wrote Tristan and Isolde while the ingenuity of the figure and avoidance of a rhythmical monotone are evidences of Chopin s feeling for the decorative It is a masterly prelude Klindworth accents the first of the bass triplets and makes an unnecessary enharmonic change at the sixth and seventh lines There is a measure of grave content in the ninth prelude in E It is rather gnomic and contains hints of both Brahms and Beethoven It has an ethical quality but that may be because of its churchly rhythm and color The C sharp minor prelude No ten must be the eagle wings of Schumann s critique There is a flash of steel gray deepening into black and then the vision vanishes as though some huge bird aloft had plunged down through blazing sunlight leaving a color echo in the void as it passed to its quarry Or to be less figurative this prelude is a study in arpeggio with double notes interspersed and is too short to make more than a vivid impression No II in B is all too brief It is vivacious dolce indeed and most cleverly constructed Klindworth gives a more binding character to the first double notes Another gleam of the Chopin sunshine Storm clouds gather in the G sharp minor the twelfth prelude so unwittingly imitated by Grieg in his Menuetto of the same key and in its driving presto we feel the passionate clench of Chopin s hand It is convulsed with woe but the intellectual grip the self command are never lost in these two pages of perfect writing The figure is suggestive and there is a well defined technical problem as well as a psychical character Disputed territory is here the editors do not agree about the twelfth and eleventh bars from the last According to Breitkopf Hartel the bass octaves are E both times Mikuli gives G sharp the first time instead of E Klindworth G sharp the second time Riemann E and also Kullak The G sharp seems more various In the thirteenth prelude F sharp major here is lovely atmosphere pure and peaceful The composer has found mental rest Exquisitely poised are his pinions for flight and in the piu lento he wheels significantly and majestically about in the blue The return to earth is the signal for some strange modulatory tactics It is an impressive close Then almost without pause the blood begins to boil in this fragile man s veins His pulse beat increases and with stifled rage he rushes into the battle It is the fourteenth prelude in the sinister key of E flat minor and its heavy sullen arched triplets recalls for Niecks the last movement of the B flat minor Sonata but there is less interrogation in the prelude less sophistication and the heat of conflict over it all There is not a break in the clouds until the beginning of the fifteenth the familiar prelude in D flat This must be George Sand s Some of them create such vivid impressions that the shades of dead monks seem to rise and pass before the hearer in solemn and gloomy funereal pomp The work needs no programme Its serene beginning lugubrious interlude with the dominant pedal never ceasing a basso ostinato gives color to Kleczynski s contention that the prelude in B minor is a mere sketch of the idea fully elaborated in No fifteen The foundation of the picture is the drops of rain falling at regular intervals the echo principle again which by their continual patter bring the mind to a state of sadness a melody full of tears is heard through the rush of the rain then passing to the key of C sharp minor it rises from the depths of the bass to a prodigious crescendo indicative of the terror which nature in its deathly aspect excites in the heart of man Here again the form does not allow the ideas to become too sombre notwithstanding the melancholy which seizes you a feeling of tranquil grandeur revives you To Niecks the C sharp minor portion affects one as in an oppressive dream The re entrance of the opening D flat which dispels the dreadful nightmare comes upon one with the smiling freshness of dear familiar nature The prelude has a nocturnal character It has become slightly banal from frequent repetition likewise the C sharp minor study in opus twenty five But of its beauty balance and exceeding chastity there can be no doubt The architecture is at once Greek and Gothic The sixteenth prelude in the relative key of B flat minor is the boldest of the set Its scale figures seldom employed by Chopin boil and glitter the thematic thread of the idea never being quite submerged Fascinating full of perilous acclivities and sudden treacherous descents this most brilliant of preludes is Chopin in riotous spirits He plays with the keyboard it is an avalanche anon a cascade then a swift stream which finally after mounting to the skies descends to an abyss Full of imaginative lift caprice and stormy dynamics this prelude is the darling of the virtuoso Its pregnant introduction is like a madly jutting rock from which the eagle spirit of the composer precipitates itself In the twenty third bar there is curious editorial discrepancy Klindworth uses an A natural in the first of the four groups of sixteenths Kullak a B natural Riemann follows Kullak Nor is this all Kullak in the second group right hand has an E flat Klindworth a D natural Which is correct Klindworth s texture is more closely chromatic and it sounds better the chromatic parallelism being more carefully preserved Yet I fancy that Kullak has tradition on his side The seventeenth prelude Niecks finds Mendelssohn ian I do not It is suave sweet well developed yet Chopin to the core and its harmonic life surprisingly rich and novel The mood is one of tranquillity The soul loses itself in early autumnal revery while there is yet splendor on earth and in the skies Full of tonal contrasts this highly finished composition is grateful to the touch The eleven booming A flats on the last page are historical Klindworth uses a B flat instead of a G at the beginning of the melody It is logical but is it Chopin The fiery recitatives of No eighteen in F minor are a glimpse of Chopin muscular and not hectic In these editions you will find three different groupings of the cadenzas It is Riemann s opportunity for pedagogic editing and he does not miss it In the first long breathed group of twenty two sixteenth notes he phrases as shown on the following page It may be noticed that Riemann even changes the arrangement of the bars This prelude is dramatic almost to an operatic degree Sonorous rather grandiloquent it is a study in declamation the declamation of the slow movement in the F minor concerto Schumann may have had the first phrase in his mind when he wrote his Aufschwung This page of Chopin s the torso of a larger idea is nobly rhetorical Musical score excerpt What piano music is the nineteenth prelude in E flat Its widely dispersed harmonies its murmuring grace and June like beauty are they not Chopin the Chopin we best love He is ever the necromancer ever invoking phantoms but with its whirring melody and furtive caprice this particular shape is an alluring one And difficult it is to interpret with all its plangent lyric freedom No twenty in C minor contains in its thirteen bars the sorrows of a nation It is without doubt a sketch for a funeral march and of it George Sand must have been thinking when she wrote that one prelude of Chopin contained more music than all the trumpetings of Meyerbeer Of exceeding loveliness is the B flat major prelude No twenty one It is superior in content and execution to most of the nocturnes In feeling it belongs to that form The melody is enchanting The accompaniment figure shows inventive genius Klindworth employs a short appoggiatura Kullak the long in the second bar Judge of what is true editorial sciolism when I tell you that Riemann who evidently believes in a rigid melodic structure has inserted an E flat at the end of bar four thus maiming the tender elusive quality of Chopin s theme This is cruelly pedantic The prelude arrests one in ecstasy the fixed period of contemplation of the saint or the hypnotized sets in and the awakening is almost painful Chopin adopting the relative minor key as a pendant to the picture in B flat thrills the nerves by a bold dissonance in the next prelude No twenty two Again concise paragraphs filled with the smoke of revolt and conflict The impetuosity of this largely moulded piece in G minor its daring harmonics read the seventeenth and eighteenth bars and dramatic note make it an admirable companion to the Prelude in F minor Technically it serves as an octave study for the left hand In the concluding bar but one Chopin has in the F major Prelude attempted a most audacious feat in harmony An E flat in the bass of the third group of sixteenths leaves the whole composition floating enigmatically in thin air It deliciously colors the close leaving a sense of suspense of anticipation which is not tonally realized for the succeeding number is in a widely divorced key But it must have pressed hard the philistines And this prelude the twenty third is fashioned out of the most volatile stuff Aerial imponderable and like a sun shot spider web oscillating in the breeze of summer its hues change at every puff It is in extended harmonics and must be delivered with spirituality The horny hand of the toilsome pianist would shatter the delicate swinging fantasy of the poet Kullak points out a variant in the fourteenth bar G instead of B natural being used by Riemann Klindworth prefers the latter We have reached the last prelude of op twenty eight In D minor it is sonorously tragic troubled by fevers and visions and capricious irregular and massive in design It may be placed among Chopin s greater works the two Etudes in C minor the A minor and the F sharp minor Prelude The bass requires an unusual span and the suggestion by Kullak that the thumb of the right hand may eke out the weakness of the left is only for the timid and the small of fist But I do not counsel following his two variants in the fifth and twenty third bars Chopin s text is more telling Like the vast reverberation of monstrous waves on the implacable coast of a remote world is this prelude Despite its fatalistic ring its note of despair is not dispiriting Its issues are larger more impersonal more elemental than the other preludes It is a veritable Appassionata but its theatre is cosmic and no longer behind the closed doors of the cabinet of Chopin s soul The Seelenschrei of Stanislaw Przybyszewski is here explosions of wrath and revolt not Chopin suffers but his countrymen Kleczynski speaks of the three tones at the close They are the final clangor of oppressed almost overthrown reason After the subject reappears in C minor there is a shift to D flat and for a moment a point of repose is gained but this elusive rest is brief The theme reappears in the tonic and in octaves and the tension becomes too great the accumulated passion discharges and dissolves in a fierce gust of double chromatic thirds and octaves Powerful repellant this prelude is almost infernal in its pride and scorn But in it I discern no vestige of uncontrolled hysteria It is well nigh as strong rank and human as Beethoven The various editorial phraseology is not of much moment Riemann uses thirty second notes for the cadenzas Kullak eighths and Klindworth sixteenths Niecks writes of the Prelude in C sharp minor op forty five that it deserves its name better than almost any one of the twenty four still I would rather call it improvisata It seems unpremeditated a heedless outpouring when sitting at the piano in a lonely dreary hour perhaps in the twilight The quaver figure rises aspiringly and the sustained parts swell out proudly The piquant cadenza forestalls in the progression of diminished chords favorite effects of some of our more modern composers The modulation from C sharp minor to D major and back again after the cadenza is very striking and equally beautiful Elsewhere I have called attention to the Brahmsian coloring of this prelude Its mood is fugitive and hard to hold after capture Recondite it is and not music for the multitude Niecks does not think Chopin created a new type in the Preludes They are too unlike each other in form and character Yet notwithstanding the fleeting evanescent moods of the Preludes there is designedly a certain unity of feeling and contrasted tonalities all being grouped in approved Bach ian manner This may be demonstrated by playing them through at a sitting which Arthur Friedheim the Russian virtuoso did in a concert with excellent effect As if wishing to exhibit his genius in perspective Chopin carved these cameos with exceeding fineness exceeding care In a few of them the idea overbalances the form but the greater number are exquisite examples of a just proportion of manner and matter a true blending of voice and vision Even in the more microscopic ones the tracery echoing like the spirals in strange seashells is marvellously measured Much in miniature are these sculptured Preludes of the Polish poet VIII IMPROMPTUS AND VALSES To write of the four Impromptus in their own key of unrestrained feeling and pondered intention would not be as easy as recapturing the first careless rapture of the lark With all the freedom of an improvisation the Chopin impromptu has a well defined form There is structural impulse although the patterns are free and original The mood color is not much varied in three the first third and fourth but in the second there is a ballade like quality that hints of the tragic The A flat Impromptu op twenty nine is if one is pinned down to the title the happiest named of the set Its seething prankish nimble bubbling quality is indicated from the start the D natural in the treble against the C and E flat the dominant in the bass is a most original effect and the flowing triplets of the first part of this piece give a ductile gracious high bred character to it The chromatic involutions are many and interesting When the F minor part is reached the ear experiences the relief of a strongly contrasted rhythm The simple duple measure so naturally ornamented is nobly broadly melodious After the return of the first dimpling theme there is a short coda a chiaroscura and then with a few chords the composition goes to rest A bird flew that way Rubato should be employed for as Kleczynski says Here everything totters from foundation to summit and everything is nevertheless so beautiful and so clear But only an artist with velvety fingers should play this sounding arabesque There is more limpidezza more pure grace of line in the first Impromptu than in the second in F sharp op thirty six Here symmetry is abandoned as Kullak remarks but the compensation of intenser emotional issues is offered There is something sphinx like in the pose of this work Its nocturnal beginning with the carillon like bass a bass that ever recalls to me the faint buried tones of Hauptmann s Sunken Bell the sweetly grave close of the section the faint hoof beats of an approaching cavalcade with the swelling thunders of its passage surely suggests a narrative a programme After the D major episode there are two bars of anonymous modulation these bars creak on their hinges and the first subject reappears in F then climbs to F sharp thence merges into a glittering melodic organ point exciting brilliant the whole subsiding into an echo of earlier harmonies The final octaves are marked fortissimo which always seems brutal Yet its logic lies in the scheme of the composer Perhaps he wished to arouse us harshly from his dreamland as was his habit while improvising for friends a glissando would send them home shivering after an evening of delicious reverie Niecks finds this Impromptu lacking the pith of the first To me it is of more moment than the other three It is irregular and wavering in outline the moods are wandering and capricious yet who dares deny its power its beauty In its use of accessory figures it does not reveal so much ingenuity but just because the figure in the carpet is not so varied in pattern its passion is all the deeper It is another Ballade sadder more meditative of the tender grace of vanished days The third Impromptu in G flat op fifty one is not often played It may be too difficult for the vandal with an average technique but it is neither so fresh in feeling nor so spontaneous in utterance as its companions There is a touch of the faded blase and it is hardly healthy in sentiment Here are some ophidian curves in triplets as in the first Impromptu but with interludes of double notes in coloring tropical and rich to morbidity The E flat minor trio is a fine bit of melodic writing The absence of simplicity is counterbalanced by greater freedom of modulation and complexity of pattern The impromptu flavor is not missing and there is allied to delicacy of design a strangeness of sentiment that strangeness which Edgar Poe declared should be a constituent element of all great art The Fantaisie Impromptu in C sharp minor op sixty six was published by Fontana in eighteen fifty five and is one of the few posthumous works of Chopin worthy of consideration It was composed about eighteen thirty four A true Impromptu but the title of Fantaisie given by Fontana is superfluous The piece presents difficulties chiefly rhythmical Its involuted first phrases suggest the Bellini an fioriture so dear to Chopin but the D flat part is without nobility Here is the same kind of saccharine melody that makes mawkish the trio in the Marche Funebre There seems no danger that this Fantaisie Impromptu will suffer from neglect for it is the joy of the piano student who turns its presto into a slow blurred mess of badly related rhythms and its slower movement into a long drawn sentimental agony but in the hands of a master the C sharp minor Impromptu is charming though not of great depth The first Impromptu dedicated to Mlle la Comtesse de Lobau was published December eighteen thirty seven the second May eighteen forty the third dedicated to Madame la Comtesse Esterhazy February eighteen forty three Not one of these four Impromptus is as naive as Schubert s they are more sophisticated and do not smell of nature and her simplicities Of the Chopin Valses it has been said that they are dances of the soul and not of the body Their animated rhythms insouciant airs and brilliant coquettish atmosphere the true atmosphere of the ballroom seem to smile at Ehlert s poetic exaggeration The valses are the most objective of the Chopin works and in few of them is there more than a hint of the sullen Sargasson seas of the nocturnes and scherzi Nietzsche s la Gaya Scienza the Gay Science is beautifully set forth in the fifteen Chopin valses They are less intimate in the psychic sense but exquisite exemplars of social intimacy and aristocratic abandon As Schumann declared the dancers of these valses should be at least countesses There is a high bred reserve despite their intoxication and never a hint of the brawling peasants of Beethoven Grieg Brahms Tschaikowsky and the rest But little of Vienna is in Chopin Around the measures of this most popular of dances he has thrown mystery allurement and in them secret whisperings and the unconscious sigh It is going too far not to dance to some of this music for it is putting Chopin away from the world he at times loved Certain of the valses may be danced the first second fifth sixth and a few others The dancing would be of necessity more picturesque and less conventional than required by the average valse and there must be fluctuations of tempo sudden surprises and abrupt languors The mazurkas and polonaises are danced to day in Poland why not the valses Chopin s genius reveals itself in these dance forms and their presentation should be not solely a psychic one Kullak stern old pedagogue divides these dances into two groups the first dedicated to Terpsichore the second a frame for moods Chopin admitted that he was unable to play valses in the Viennese fashion yet he has contrived to rival Strauss in his own genre Some of these valses are trivial artificial most of them are bred of candlelight and the swish of silken attire and a few are poetically morbid and stray across the border into the rhythms of the mazurka All of them have been edited to death reduced to the commonplace by vulgar methods of performance but are altogether sprightly delightful specimens of the composer s careless vagrant and happy moods Kullak utters words of warning to the unquiet sex regarding the habitual neglect of the bass It should mean something in valse tempo but it usually does not Nor need it be brutally banged the fundamental tone must be cared for the subsidiary harmonies lightly indicated The rubato in the valses need not obtrude itself as in the mazurkas Opus eighteen in E flat was published in June eighteen thirty four and dedicated to Mile Laura Harsford It is a true ballroom picture spirited and infectious in rhythms Schumann wrote rhapsodically of it The D flat section has a tang of the later Chopin There is bustle even chatter in this valse which in form and content is inferior to op thirty four No I A flat The three valses of this set were published December eighteen thirty eight There are many editorial differences in the A flat Valse owing to the careless way it was copied and pirated Klindworth and Kullak are the safest for dynamic markings This valse may be danced as far as its dithyrhambic coda Notice in this coda as in many other places the debt Schumann owes Chopin for a certain passage in the Preambule of his Carneval The next Valse in A minor has a tinge of Sarmatian melancholy indeed it is one of Chopin s most desponding moods The episode in C rings of the mazurka and the A major section is of exceeding loveliness Its coda is characteristic This valse is a favorite and who need wonder The F major Valse the last of this series is a whirling wild dance of atoms It has the perpetuum mobile quality and older masters would have prolonged its giddy arabesques into pages of senseless spinning It is quite long enough as it is The second theme is better but the appoggiatures are flippant It buzzes to the finish Of it is related that Chopin s cat sprang upon his keyboard and in its feline flight gave him the idea of the first measures I suppose as there is a dog valse there had to be one for the cat But as Rossini would have said Ca sent de Scarlatti The A minor Valse was of the three Chopin s favorite When Stephen Heller told him this too was his beloved valse Chopin was greatly pleased inviting the Hungarian composer Niecks relates to luncheon at the Cafe Riche Not improvised in the ballroom as the preceding yet a marvellous epitome is the A flat Valse op forty two published July eighteen forty It is the best rounded specimen of Chopin s experimenting with the form The prolonged trill on E flat summoning us to the ballroom the suggestive intermingling of rhythms duple and triple the coquetry hesitation passionate avowal and the superb coda with its echoes of evening have not these episodes a charm beyond compare Only Schumann in certain pages of his Carneval seizes the secret of young life and love but his is not so finished so glowing a tableau Regarding certain phrasing of this valse Moriz Rosenthal wrote to the London Musical Standard In Music there is Liberty and Fraternity but seldom Equality and in music Social Democracy has no voice Notes have a right to the Aftertone Nachton and this right depends upon their role in the key The Vorhalt accented passing note will always have an accent On this point Riemann must without question be considered right Likewise the feeling player will mark those notes that introduce the transition to another key We will consider now our example and set down my accents Musical score excerpt In the first bar we have the tonic chord of its major key as bass and are thus not forced to any accent In the second bar we have the dominant harmony in the bass and in the treble C which falls upon the down beat as Vorhalt to the next tone B flat so it must be accented Also in the fourth bar the B flat is Vorhalt to the B flat and likewise requires an accent In bars six seven and eight the notes A flat B flat and C are without doubt the characteristic ones of the passage and the E flat has in each case only a secondary significance That a genius like Chopin did not indicate everything accurately is quite explainable He flew where we merely limp after Moreover these accents must be felt rather than executed with softest touch and as tenderly as possible The D flat Valse le valse du petit chien is of George Sand s own prompting One evening at her home in the Square d Orleans she was amused by her little pet dog chasing its tail She begged Chopin her little pet pianist to set the tail to music He did so and behold the world is richer for this piece I do not dispute the story It seems well grounded but then it is so ineffably silly The three valses of this op sixty four were published September eighteen forty seven and are respectively dedicated to the Comtesse Delphine Potocka the Baronne Nathaniel de Rothschild and the Baronne Bronicka I shall not presume to speak of the execution of the D flat Valse like the rich it is always with us It is usually taken at a meaningless rapid gait I have heard it played by a genuine Chopin pupil M Georges Mathias and he did not take it prestissimo He ran up the D flat scale ending with a sforzato at the top and gave a variety of nuance to the composition The cantabile is nearly always delivered with sloppiness of sentiment This valse has been served up in a highly indigestible condition for concert purposes by Tausig Joseffy whose arrangement was the first to be heard here Theodore Ritter Rosenthal and Isidor Philipp The C sharp minor Valse is the most poetic of all The first theme has never been excelled by Chopin for a species of veiled melancholy It is a fascinating lyrical sorrow and what Kullak calls the psychologic motivation of the first theme in the curving figure of the second does not relax the spell A space of clearer skies warmer more consoling winds are in the D flat interlude but the spirit of unrest ennui returns The elegiac imprint is unmistakable in this soul dance The A flat Valse which follows is charming It is for superior souls who dance with intellectual joy with the joy that comes of making exquisite patterns and curves Out of the salon and from its brilliantly lighted spaces the dancers do not wander do not dance into the darkness and churchyard as Ehlert imagines of certain other valses The two valses in op sixty nine three valses op seventy and the two remaining valses in E minor and E major need not detain us They are posthumous The first of op sixty nine in F minor was composed in eighteen thirty six the B minor in eighteen twenty nine G flat op seventy in eighteen thirty five F minor in eighteen forty three and D flat major eighteen thirty The E major and E minor were composed in eighteen twenty nine Fontana gave these compositions to the world The F minor Valse op sixty nine No one has a charm of its own Kullak prints the Fontana and Klindworth variants This valse is suavely melancholy but not so melancholy as the B minor of the same opus It recalls in color the B minor mazurka Very gay and sprightly is the G flat Valse op seventy No I The next in F minor has no special physiognomy while the third in D flat contains as Niecks points out germs of the op forty two and the op thirty four Valses It recalls to me the D flat study in the supplementary series The E minor Valse without opus is beloved It is very graceful and not without sentiment The major part is the early Chopin The E major Valse is published in the Mikuli edition It is commonplace hinting of its composer only in places Thus ends the collection of valses not Chopin s most signal success in art but a success that has dignified and given beauty to this conventional dance form IX NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES THE NOCTURNES Here is the chronology of the nocturnes Op nine three nocturnes January eighteen thirty three op fifteen three nocturnes January eighteen thirty four op twenty seven two nocturnes May eighteen thirty six op thirty two two nocturnes December eighteen thirty seven op thirty seven two nocturnes May eighteen forty op forty eight two nocturnes November eighteen forty one op fifty five two nocturnes August eighteen forty four op sixty two two nocturnes September eighteen forty six In addition there is a nocturne written in eighteen twenty eight and published by Fontana with the opus number seventy two No two and the lately discovered one in C sharp minor written when Chopin was young and published in eighteen ninety five This completes the nocturne list but following Niecks system of formal grouping I include the Berceuse and Barcarolle as full fledged specimens of nocturnes John Field has been described as the forerunner of Chopin The limpid style of this pupil and friend of Clementi his beautiful touch and finished execution were certainly admired and imitated by the Pole Field s nocturnes are now neglected so curious are Time s caprices and without warrant for not only is Field the creator of the form but in both his concertos and nocturnes he has written charming sweet and sane music He rather patronized Chopin for whose melancholy pose he had no patience He has a talent of the hospital growled Field in the intervals between his wine drinking pipe smoking and the washing of his linen the latter economical habit he contracted from Clementi There is some truth in his stricture Chopin seldom exuberantly cheerful is morbidly sad and complaining in many of the nocturnes The most admired of his compositions with the exception of the valses they are in several instances his weakest Yet he ennobled the form originated by Field giving it dramatic breadth passion and even grandeur Set against Field s naive and idyllic specimens Chopin s efforts are often too bejewelled for true simplicity too lugubrious too tropical Asiatic is a better word and they have the exotic savor of the heated conservatory and not the fresh scent of the flowers reared in the open by the less poetic Irishman And then Chopin is so desperately sentimental in some of these compositions They are not altogether to the taste of this generation they seem to be suffering from anaemia However there are a few noble nocturnes and methods of performance may have much to answer for the sentimentalizing of some others More vigor a quickening of the time pulse and a less languishing touch will rescue them from lush sentiment Chopin loved the night and its soft mysteries as much as did Robert Louis Stevenson and his nocturnes are true night pieces some with agitated remorseful countenance others seen in profile only while many are whisperings at dusk Most of them are called feminine a term psychologically false The poetic side of men of genius is feminine and in Chopin the feminine note was over emphasized at times it was almost hysterical particularly in these nocturnes The Scotch have a proverb She wove her shroud and wore it in her lifetime In the nocturnes the shroud is not far away Chopin wove his to the day of his death and he wore it sometimes but not always as many think One of the most elegiac of his nocturnes is the first in B flat minor It is one of three op nine dedicated to Mme Camille Pleyel Of far more significance than its two companions it is for some reason neglected While I am far from agreeing with those who hold that in the early Chopin all his genius was completely revealed yet this nocturne is as striking as the last for it is at once sensuous and dramatic melancholy and lovely Emphatically a mood it is best heard on a gray day of the soul when the times are out of joint its silken tones will bring a triste content as they pour out upon one s hearing The second section in octaves is of exceeding charm As a melody it has all the lurking voluptuousness and mystic crooning of its composer There is flux and reflux throughout passion peeping out in the coda The E flat nocturne is graceful shallow of content but if it is played with purity of touch and freedom from sentimentality it is not nearly so banal as it usually seems It is Field like therefore play it as did Rubinstein in a Field like fashion Hadow calls attention to the remote and recondite modulations in the twelfth bar the chromatic double notes For him they only are one real modulation the rest of the passage is an iridescent play of color an effect of superficies not an effect of substance It was the E flat nocturne that unloosed Rellstab s critical wrath in the Iris Of it he wrote Where Field smiles Chopin makes a grinning grimace where Field sighs Chopin groans where Field shrugs his shoulders Chopin twists his whole body where Field puts some seasoning into the food Chopin empties a handful of cayenne pepper In short if one holds Field s charming romances before a distorting concave mirror so that every delicate impression becomes a coarse one one gets Chopin s work We implore mister Chopin to return to nature Rellstab might have added that while Field was often commonplace Chopin never was Rather is to be preferred the sound judgment of J W Davison the English critic and husband of the pianist Arabella Goddard Of the early works he wrote Commonplace is instinctively avoided in all the works of Chopin a stale cadence or a trite progression a hum drum subject or a worn out passage a vulgar twist of the melody or a hackneyed sequence a meagre harmony or an unskilful counterpoint may in vain be looked for throughout the entire range of his compositions the prevailing characteristics of which are a feeling as uncommon as beautiful a treatment as original as felicitous a melody and a harmony as new fresh vigorous and striking as they are utterly unexpected and out of the original track In taking up one of the works of Chopin you are entering as it were a fairyland untrodden by human footsteps a path hitherto unfrequented but by the great composer himself Gracious even coquettish is the first part of the B major Nocturne of this opus Well knit the passionate intermezzo has the true dramatic Chopin ring It should be taken alla breve The ending is quite effective I do not care much for the F major Nocturne op fifteen No I The opus is dedicated to Ferdinand Hiller Ehlert speaks of the ornament in triplets with which he brushes the theme as with the gentle wings of a butterfly and then discusses the artistic value of the ornament which may be so profitably studied in the Chopin music From its nature the ornament can only beautify the beautiful Music like Chopin s with its predominating elegance could not forego ornament But he surely did not purchase it of a jeweller he designed it himself with a delicate hand He was the first to surround a note with diamond facets and to weave the rushing floods of his emotions with the silver beams of the moonlight In his nocturnes there is a glimmering as of distant stars From these dreamy heavenly gems he has borrowed many a line The Chopin nocturne is a dramatized ornament And why may not Art speak for once in such symbols In the much admired F sharp major Nocturne the principal theme makes its appearance so richly decorated that one cannot avoid imagining that his fancy confined itself to the Arabesque form for the expression of its poetical sentiments Even the middle part borders upon what I should call the tragic style of ornament The ground thought is hidden behind a dense veil but a veil too can be an ornament In another place Ehlert thinks that the F sharp major Nocturne seems inseparable from champagne and truffles It is certainly more elegant and dramatic than the one in F major which precedes it That with the exception of the middle part in F minor is weak although rather pretty and confiding The F sharp Nocturne is popular The doppio movemento is extremely striking and the entire piece is saturated with young life love and feelings of good will to men Read Kleczynski The third nocturne of the three is in G minor and contains some fine picturesque writing Kullak does not find in it aught of the fantastic The languid earth weary voice of the opening and the churchly refrain of the chorale is not this fantastic contrast This nocturne contains in solution all that Chopin developed later in a nocturne of the same key But I think the first stronger its lines are simpler more primitive its coloring less complicated yet quite as rich and gloomy Of it Chopin said After Hamlet but changed his mind Let them guess for themselves was his sensible conclusion Kullak s programme has a conventional ring It is the lament for the beloved one the lost Lenore with the consolation of religion thrown in The bell tones of the plain chant bring to my mind little that consoles although the piece ends in the major mode It is like Poe s Ulalume A complete and tiny tone poem Rubinstein made much of it In the fourth bar and for three bars there is a held note F and I heard the Russian virtuoso by some miraculous means keep this tone prolonged The tempo is abnormally slow and the tone is not in a position where the sustaining pedal can sensibly help it Yet under Rubinstein s fingers it swelled and diminished and went singing into D as if the instrument were an organ I suspected the inaudible changing of fingers on the note or a sustaining pedal It was wonderfully done The next nocturne op twenty seven No I brings us before a masterpiece With the possible exception of the C minor Nocturne this one in the sombre key of C sharp minor is the great essay in the form Kleczynski finds it a description of a calm night at Venice where after a scene of murder the sea closes over a corpse and continues to serve as a mirror to the moonlight This is melodramatic Willeby analyzes it at length with the scholarly fervor of an English organist He finds the accompaniment to be mostly on a double pedal and remarks that higher art than this one could not have if simplicity of means be a factor of high art The wide meshed figure of the left hand supports a morbid persistent melody that grates on the nerves From the piu mosso the agitation increases and here let me call to your notice the Beethoven ish quality of these bars which continue until the change of signature There is a surprising climax followed by sunshine and favor in the D flat part then after mounting dissonances a bold succession of octaves returns to the feverish plaint of the opening Kullak speaks of a resemblance to Meyerbeer s song Le Moine The composition reaches exalted states Its psychological tension is so great at times as to border on a pathological condition There is unhealthy power in this nocturne which is seldom interpreted with sinister subtlety Henry T Finck rightfully thinks it embodies a greater variety of emotion and more genuine dramatic spirit on four pages than many operas on four hundred The companion picture in D flat op twenty seven No two has as Karasowski writes a profusion of delicate fioriture It really contains but one subject and is a song of the sweet summer of two souls for there is obvious meaning in the duality of voices Often heard in the concert room this nocturne gives us a surfeit of sixths and thirds of elaborate ornamentation and monotone of mood Yet it is a lovely imploring melody and harmonically most interesting A curious marking and usually overlooked by pianists is the crescendo and con forza of the cadenza This is obviously erroneous The theme which occurs three times should first be piano then pianissimo and lastly forte This opus is dedicated to the Comtesse d Appony The best part of the next nocturne B major op thirty two No I dedicated to Madame de Billing is the coda It is in the minor and is like the drum beat of tragedy The entire ending a stormy recitative is in stern contrast to the dreamy beginning Kullak in the first bar of the last line uses a G Fontana F sharp and Klindworth the same as Kullak The nocturne that follows in A flat is a reversion to the Field type the opening recalling that master s B flat Nocturne The F minor section of Chopin s broadens out to dramatic reaches but as an entirety this opus is a little tiresome Nor do I admire inordinately the Nocturne in G minor op thirty seven No one It has a complaining tone and the choral is not noteworthy This particular part so Chopin s pupil Gutmann declared is taken too slowly the composer having forgotten to mark the increased tempo But the Nocturne in G op thirty seven No two is charming Painted with Chopin s most ethereal brush without the cloying splendors of the one in D flat the double sixths fourths and thirds are magically euphonious The second subject I agree with Karasowski is the most beautiful melody Chopin ever wrote It is in true barcarolle vein and most subtle are the shifting harmonic hues Pianists usually take the first part too fast the second too slowly transforming this poetic composition into an etude As Schumann wrote of this opus The two nocturnes differ from his earlier ones chiefly through greater simplicity of decoration and more quiet grace We know Chopin s fondness in general for spangles gold trinkets and pearls He has already changed and grown older decoration he still loves but it is of a more judicious kind behind which the nobility of the poetry shimmers through with all the more loveliness indeed taste the finest must be granted him Both numbers of this opus are without dedication They are the offspring of the trip to Majorca Niecks writing of the G major Nocturne adjures us not to tarry too long in the treacherous atmosphere of this Capua it bewitches and unmans Kleczynski calls the one in G minor homesickness while the celebrated Nocturne in C minor is the tale of a still greater grief told in an agitated recitando celestial harps ah I hear the squeak of the old romantic machinery come to bring one ray of hope which is powerless in its endeavor to calm the wounded soul which sends forth to heaven a cry of deepest anguish It doubtless has its despairing movement this same Nocturne in C minor op forty eight No I but Karasowski is nearer right when he calls it broad and most imposing with its powerful intermediate movement a thorough departure from the nocturne style Willeby finds it sickly and labored and even Niecks does not think it should occupy a foremost place among its companions The ineluctable fact remains that this is the noblest nocturne of them all Biggest in conception it seems a miniature music drama It requires the grand manner to read it adequately and the doppio movemento is exciting to a dramatic degree I fully agree with Kullak that too strict adherence to the marking of this section produces the effect of an inartistic precipitation which robs the movement of clarity Kleczynski calls the work The Contrition of a Sinner and devotes several pages to its elucidation De Lenz chats most entertainingly with Tausig about it Indeed an imposing march of splendor is the second subject in C A fitting pendant is this work to the C sharp minor Nocturne Both have the heroic quality both are free from mawkishness and are of the greater Chopin the Chopin of the mode masculine Niecks makes a valuable suggestion In playing these nocturnes op forty eight there occurred to me a remark of Schumann s when he reviewed some nocturnes by Count Wielhorski He said that the quick middle movements which Chopin frequently introduced into his nocturnes are often weaker than his first conceptions meaning the first portions of his nocturnes Now although the middle part in the present instances are on the contrary slower movements yet the judgment holds good at least with respect to the first nocturne the middle part of which has nothing to recommend it but a full sonorous instrumentation if I may use this word in speaking of one instrument The middle part of the second D flat molto piu lento however is much finer in it we meet again as we did in some other nocturnes with soothing simple chord progressions When Gutmann studied the C sharp minor Nocturne with Chopin the master told him that the middle section the molto piu lento in D flat major should be played as a recitative A tyrant commands the first two chords he said and the other asks for mercy Of course Niecks means the F sharp minor not the C sharp minor Nocturne op forty eight No two dedicated with the C minor to Mlle L Duperre Opus fifty five two nocturnes in F minor and E flat major need not detain us long The first is familiar Kleczynski devotes a page or more to its execution He seeks to vary the return of the chief subject with nuances as would an artistic singer the couplets of a classic song There are cries of despair in it but at last a feeling of hope Kullak writes of the last measures Thank God the goal is reached It is the relief of a major key after prolonged wanderings in the minor It is a nice nocturne neat in its sorrow yet not epoch making The one following has the impression of an improvisation It has also the merit of being seldom heard These two nocturnes are dedicated to Mlle J W Stirling Opus sixty two brings us to a pair in B major and E major inscribed to Madame de Konneritz The first the Tuberose Nocturne is faint with a sick rich odor The climbing trellis of notes that so unexpectedly leads to the tonic is charming and the chief tune has charm a fruity charm It is highly ornate its harmonies dense the entire surface overrun with wild ornamentation and a profusion of trills The piece the third of its sort in the key of B is not easy Mertke gives the following explication of the famous chain trills Musical score excerpt Although this nocturne is luxuriant in style it deserves warmer praise than is accorded it Irregular as its outline is its troubled lyrism is appealing is melting and the A flat portion with its hesitating timid accents has great power of attraction The E major Nocturne has a bardic ring Its song is almost declamatory and not at all sentimental unless so distorted as Niecks would have us imagine The intermediate portion is wavering and passionate like the middle of the F sharp major Nocturne It shows no decrease in creative vigor or lyrical fancy The Klindworth version differs from the original as an examination of the following examples will show the upper being Chopin s Musical score excerpt The posthumous nocturne in E minor composed in eighteen twenty seven is weak and uninteresting Moreover it contains some very un Chopin like modulations The recently discovered nocturne in C sharp minor is hardly a treasure trove It is vague and reminiscent The following note was issued by its London publishers Ascherberg company The first question suggested by the announcement of a new posthumous composition of Chopin s will be What proof is there of its authenticity To musicians and amateurs who cannot recognize the beautiful Nocturne in C sharp minor as indeed the work of Chopin it may in the first place be pointed out that the original manuscript of which a facsimile is given on the title page is in Chopin s well known handwriting and secondly that the composition which is strikingly characteristic was at once accepted as the work of Chopin by the distinguished composer and pianist Balakireff who played it for the first time in public at the Chopin Commemoration Concert held in the autumn of eighteen ninety four at Zelazowa Wola and afterward at Warsaw This nocturne was addressed by Chopin to his sister Louise at Warsaw in a letter from Paris and was written soon after the production of the two lovely piano concertos when Chopin was still a very young man It contains a quotation from his most admired Concerto in F minor and a brief reference to the charming song known as the Maiden s Wish two of his sister s favorite melodies The manuscript of the nocturne was supposed to have been destroyed in the sacking of the Zamojski Palace at Warsaw toward the end of the insurrection of eighteen sixty three but it was discovered quite recently among papers of various kinds in the possession of a Polish gentleman a great collector whose son offered mister Polinski the privilege of selecting from such papers His choice was three manuscripts of Chopin s one of them being this nocturne A letter from mister Polinski on the subject of this nocturne is in the possession of Miss Janotha Is this the nocturne of which Tausig spoke to his pupil Joseffy as belonging to the Master s best period or did he refer to the one in E minor The Berceuse op fifty seven published June eighteen forty five and dedicated to Mlle Elise Gavard is the very sophistication of the art of musical ornamentation It is built on a tonic and dominant bass the triad of the tonic and the chord of the dominant seventh A rocking theme is set over this basso ostinato and the most enchanting effects are produced The rhythm never alters in the bass and against this background the monotone of a dark gray sky the composer arranges an astonishing variety of fireworks some florid some subdued but all delicate in tracery and design Modulations from pigeon egg blue to Nile green most misty and subtle modulations dissolve before one s eyes and for a moment the sky is peppered with tiny stars in doubles each independently tinted Within a small segment of the chromatic bow Chopin has imprisoned new strangely dissonant colors It is a miracle and after the drawn out chord of the dominant seventh and the rain of silvery fire ceases one realizes that the whole piece is a delicious illusion but an ululation in the key of D flat the apotheosis of pyrotechnical colorature Niecks quotes Alexandre Dumas fils who calls the Berceuse muted music but introduces a Turkish bath comparison which crushes the sentiment Mertke shows the original and Klindworth s reading of a certain part of the Berceuse adding a footnote to the examples Two musical score excerpts from Op fifty seven one from the original version one from Klindworth s edition Footnote Das tr flat der Originale Scholtz tr natural flat zeigt dass Ch den Triller mit Ganzton und nach Mikuli den Trilleranfang mit Hauptton wollte The Barcarolle op sixty published September eighteen forty six is another highly elaborated work Niecks must be quoted here One day Tausig the great piano virtuoso promised W de Lenz to play him Chopin s Barcarolle adding That is a performance which must not be undertaken before more than two persons I shall play you my own self I love the piece but take it rarely Lenz got the music but it did not please him it seemed to him a long movement in the nocturne style a Babel of figuration on a lightly laid foundation But he found that he had made a mistake and after hearing it played by Tausig confessed that the virtuoso had infused into the nine pages of enervating music of one and the same long breathed rhythm so much interest so much motion so much action that he regretted the long piece was not longer Tausig s conception of the barcarolle was this There are two persons concerned in the affair it is a love scene in a discrete gondola let us say this mise en scene is the symbol of a lover s meeting generally This is expressed in thirds and sixths the dualism of two notes persons is maintained throughout all is two voiced two souled In this modulation in C sharp major superscribed dolce sfogato there are kiss and embrace This is evident When after three bars of introduction the theme lightly rocking in the bass solo enters in the fourth this theme is nevertheless made use of throughout the whole fabric only as an accompaniment and ON this the cantilena in two parts is laid we have thus a continuous tender dialogue The Barcarolle is a nocturne painted on a large canvas with larger brushes It has Italian color in spots Schumann said that melodically Chopin sometimes leans over Germany into Italy and is a masterly one in sentiment pulsating with amorousness To me it sounds like a lament for the splendors now vanished of Venice the Queen In bars eight nine and ten counting backward Louis Ehlert finds obscurities in the middle voices It is dedicated to the Baronne de Stockhausen The nocturnes including the Berceuse and Barcarolle should seldom be played in public and not the public of a large hall Something of Chopin s delicate tender warmth and spiritual voice is lost in larger spaces In a small auditorium and from the fingers of a sympathetic pianist the nocturnes should be heard that their intimate night side may be revealed Many are like the music en sourdine of Paul Verlaine in his Chanson D Automne or Le Piano que Baise une Main Frele They are essentially for the twilight for solitary enclosures where their still mysterious tones silent thunder in the leaves as Yeats sings become eloquent and disclose the poetry and pain of their creator X THE BALLADES FAERY DRAMAS 
7316_10642_000002_000000	train-clean-360	W H Hadow has said some pertinent things about Chopin in Studies in Modern Music Yet we cannot accept unconditionally his statement that in structure Chopin is a child playing with a few simple types and almost helpless as soon as he advances beyond them in phraseology he is a master whose felicitous perfection of style is one of the abiding treasures of the art 
7316_10642_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Chopin then according to Hadow is no builder of the lofty rhyme but the poet of the single line the maker of the phrase exquisite This is hardly comprehensive 
7316_10642_000003_000001	train-clean-360	With the more complex classical types of the musical organism Chopin had little sympathy but he contrived nevertheless to write two movements of a piano sonata that are excellent the first half of the B flat minor Sonata 
7316_10642_000003_000002	train-clean-360	The idealized dance forms he preferred the Polonaise Mazurka and Valse were already there for him to handle but the Ballade was not 
7316_10642_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Here he is not imitator but creator 
none	none	Not loosely jointed but compact structures glowing with genius and presenting definite unity of form and expression are the ballades commonly written in six eight and six four time None of Chopin s compositions surpasses in masterliness of form and beauty and poetry of contents his ballades 
7316_10642_000003_000006	train-clean-360	In them he attains the acme of his power as an artist remarks Niecks

7316_10642_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It is the Odyssey of Chopin s soul 
7316_10642_000004_000002	train-clean-360	That cello like largo with its noiseless suspension stays us for a moment in the courtyard of Chopin s House Beautiful 
7316_10642_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Then told in his most dreamy tones the legend begins 
none	none	As in some fabulous tales of the Genii this Ballade discloses surprising and delicious things 
7316_10642_000004_000005	train-clean-360	There is the tall lily in the fountain that nods to the sun 
7316_10642_000004_000006	train-clean-360	It drips in cadenced monotone and its song is repeated on the lips of the slender hipped girl with the eyes of midnight and so might I weave for you a story of what I see in the Ballade and you would be aghast or puzzled 
none	none	With such a composition any programme could be sworn to even the silly story of the Englishman who haunted Chopin beseeching him to teach him this Ballade That Chopin had a programme a definite one there can be no doubt but he has wise artist left us no clue beyond Mickiewicz s the Polish bard Lithuanian poems In Leipzig Karasowski relates that when Schumann met Chopin the pianist confessed having been incited to the creation of the ballades by the poetry of his fellow countryman The true narrative tone is in this symmetrically constructed Ballade the most spirited most daring work of Chopin according to Schumann Louis Ehlert says of the four Ballades Each one differs entirely from the others and they have but one thing in common their romantic working out and the nobility of their motives Chopin relates in them not like one who communicates something really experienced it is as though he told what never took place but what has sprung up in his inmost soul the anticipation of something longed for They may contain a strong element of national woe much outwardly expressed and inwardly burning rage over the sufferings of his native land yet they do not carry with a positive reality like that which in a Beethoven Sonata will often call words to our lips Which means that Chopin was not such a realist as Beethoven Ehlert is one of the few sympathetic German Chopin commentators yet he did not always indicate the salient outlines of his art 
7316_10642_000004_000013	train-clean-360	Only the Slav may hope to understand Chopin thoroughly 
none	none	But these Ballades are more truly touched by the universal than any other of his works 
7316_10642_000004_000015	train-clean-360	They belong as much to the world as to Poland 
7316_10642_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The G minor Ballade after Konrad Wallenrod is a logical well knit and largely planned composition 
7316_10642_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The closest parallelism may be detected in its composition of themes 
7316_10642_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Its second theme in E flat is lovely in line color and sentiment 
7316_10642_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The return of the first theme in A minor and the quick answer in E of the second are evidences of Chopin s feeling for organic unity 
7316_10642_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Development as in strict cyclic forms there is not a little 
none	none	After the cadenza built on a figure of wavering tonality a valse like theme emerges and enjoys a capricious butterfly existence 
7316_10642_000005_000006	train-clean-360	It is fascinating 
none	none	Passage work of an etherealized character leads to the second subject now augmented and treated with a broad brush 
7316_10642_000005_000008	train-clean-360	The first questioning theme is heard again and with a perpendicular roar the presto comes upon us 
7316_10642_000005_000009	train-clean-360	For two pages the dynamic energy displayed by the composer is almost appalling 
7316_10642_000005_000010	train-clean-360	A whirlwind I have called it elsewhere 
7316_10642_000005_000011	train-clean-360	It is a storm of the emotions muscular in its virility 
7316_10642_000005_000012	train-clean-360	I remember de Pachmann a close interpreter of certain sides of Chopin playing this coda piano pianissimo and prestissimo The effect was strangely irritating to the nerves and reminded me of a tornado seen from the wrong end of an opera glass 
7316_10642_000005_000013	train-clean-360	According to his own lights the Russian virtuoso was right his strength was not equal to the task and so imitating Chopin he topsy turvied the shading

7316_10642_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This G minor Ballade was published in June eighteen thirty six and is dedicated to Baron Stockhausen

7316_10642_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Gutmann Mikuli and other pupils declare for the E flat Klindworth and Kullak use it 
7316_10642_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Xaver Scharwenka has seen fit to edit Klindworth and gives a D natural in the Augener edition 
7316_10642_000006_000004	train-clean-360	That he is wrong internal testimony abundantly proves 
7316_10642_000006_000005	train-clean-360	Even Willeby who personally prefers the D natural thinks Chopin intended the E flat and quotes a similar effect twenty eight bars later 
7316_10642_000006_000006	train-clean-360	He might have added that the entire composition contains examples look at the first bar of the valse episode in the bass 
7316_10642_000006_000007	train-clean-360	As Niecks thinks This dissonant E flat may be said to be the emotional keynote of the whole poem 
7316_10642_000006_000008	train-clean-360	It is a questioning thought that like a sudden pain shoots through mind and body

7316_10642_000008_000001	train-clean-360	On the third page third bar he uses F natural in the treble 
7316_10642_000008_000002	train-clean-360	So does Klindworth although F sharp may be found in some editions 
7316_10642_000008_000003	train-clean-360	On the last page second bar first line Kullak writes the passage beginning with E flat in eighth notes Klindworth in sixteenths 
7316_10642_000008_000004	train-clean-360	The close is very striking full of the splendors of glancing scales and shrill octave progressions 
none	none	It would inspire a poet to write words to it said Robert Schumann
7316_10642_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps the most touching of all that Chopin has written is the tale of the F major Ballade 
7316_10642_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I have witnessed children lay aside their games to listen thereto 
7316_10642_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It appears like some fairy tale that has become music 
7316_10642_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The four voiced part has such a clearness withal it seems as if warm spring breezes were waving the lithe leaves of the palm tree 
7316_10642_000009_000004	train-clean-360	How soft and sweet a breath steals over the senses and the heart 
7316_10642_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And how difficult it seems to be to write of Chopin except in terms of impassioned prose 
none	none	Louis Ehlert a romantic in feeling and a classicist in theory is the writer of the foregoing 
7316_10642_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The second Ballade although dedicated to Robert Schumann did not excite his warmest praise 
7316_10642_000010_000003	train-clean-360	 A less artistic work than the first he wrote but equally fantastic and intellectual 
7316_10642_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Its impassioned episodes seem to have been afterward inserted 
7316_10642_000010_000005	train-clean-360	I recollect very well that when Chopin played this Ballade for me it finished in F major it now closes in A minor Willeby gives its key as F minor 
7316_10642_000010_000006	train-clean-360	It is really in the keys of F major A minor Chopin s psychology was seldom at fault 
none	none	A major ending would have crushed this extraordinary tone poem written Chopin admits under the direct inspiration of Adam Mickiewicz s Le Lac de Willis Willeby accepts Schumann s dictum of the inferiority of this Ballade to its predecessor Niecks does not Niecks is quite justified in asking how two such wholly dissimilar things can be compared and weighed in this fashion 
7316_10642_000011_000000	train-clean-360	In truth they cannot 
7316_10642_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 The second Ballade possesses beauties in no way inferior to those of the first he continues 
7316_10642_000011_000002	train-clean-360	 What can be finer than the simple strains of the opening section 
7316_10642_000011_000003	train-clean-360	They sound as if they had been drawn from the people s store house of song 
7316_10642_000011_000004	train-clean-360	The entrance of the presto surprises and seems out of keeping with what precedes but what we hear after the return of tempo primo the development of those simple strains or rather the cogitations on them justifies the presence of the presto 
7316_10642_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The second appearance of the latter leads to an urging restless coda in A minor which closes in the same key and pianissimo with a few bars of the simple serene now veiled first strain 
7316_10642_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Rubinstein bore great love for this second Ballade 
none	none	This is what it meant for him Is it possible that the interpreter does not feel the necessity of representing to his audience a field flower caught by a gust of wind a caressing of the flower by the wind the resistance of the flower the stormy struggle of the wind the entreaty of the flower which at last lies there broken and paraphrased the field flower a rustic maiden the wind a knight 
7316_10642_000013_000000	train-clean-360	I can find no lack of affinity between the andantino and presto 
none	none	The surprise is a dramatic one withal rudely vigorous 
7316_10642_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Chopin s robust treatment of the first theme results in a strong piece of craftmanship The episodical nature of this Ballade is the fruit of the esoteric moods of its composer 
7316_10642_000013_000003	train-clean-360	It follows a hidden story and has the quality as the second Impromptu in F sharp of great unpremeditated art 
7316_10642_000013_000004	train-clean-360	It shocks one by its abrupt but by no means fantastic transitions The key color is changeful and the fluctuating themes are well contrasted 
none	none	It was written at Majorca while the composer was only too noticeably disturbed in body and soul 
7316_10642_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Presto con fuoco Chopin marks the second section 
7316_10642_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Kullak gives eighty four to the quarter and for the opening sixty six to the quarter 
7316_10642_000014_000002	train-clean-360	He also wisely marks crescendos in the bass at the first thematic development 
7316_10642_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He prefers the E as does Klindworth nine bars before the return of the presto 
7316_10642_000014_000004	train-clean-360	At the eighth bar after this return Kullak adheres to the E instead of F at the beginning of the bar treble clef 
7316_10642_000014_000005	train-clean-360	Klindworth indicates both 
none	none	Nor does Kullak follow Mikuli in using a D in the coda He prefers a D sharp instead of a natural I wish the second Ballade were played oftener in public It is quite neglected for the third in A flat which as Ehlert says has the voice of the people This Ballade the Undine of Mickiewicz published November eighteen forty one and dedicated to Mlle P de Noailles is too well known to analyze 
7316_10642_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It is the schoolgirls delight who familiarly toy with its demon seeing only favor and prettiness in its elegant measures 
none	none	In it the refined gifted Pole who is accustomed to move in the most distinguished circles of the French capital is pre eminently to be recognized Thus Schumann 
7316_10642_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Forsooth it is aristocratic gay graceful piquant and also something more 
none	none	Even in its playful moments there is delicate irony a spiritual sporting with graver and more passionate emotions Those broken octaves which usher in each time the second theme with its fascinating infectious rhythmical lilt what an ironically joyous fillip they give the imagination
7316_10642_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 A coquettish grace if we accept by this expression that half unconscious toying with the power that charms and fires that follows up confession with reluctance seems the very essence of Chopin s being 
7316_10642_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 It becomes a difficult task to transcribe the easy transitions full of an irresistible charm with which he portrays Love s game 
7316_10642_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Who will not recall the memorable passage in the A flat Ballade where the right hand alone takes up the dotted eighths after the sustained chord of the sixth of A flat 
7316_10642_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Could a lover s confusion be more deliciously enhanced by silence and hesitation Ehlert above evidently sees a ballroom picture of brilliancy with the regulation tender avowal 
7316_10642_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The episodes of this Ballade are so attenuated of any grosser elements that none but psychical meanings should be read into them 
7316_10642_000018_000000	train-clean-360	The disputed passage is on the fifth page of the Kullak edition after the trills 
none	none	A measure is missing in Kullak who like Klindworth gives it in a footnote 
7316_10642_000018_000002	train-clean-360	To my mind this repetition adds emphasis although it is a formal blur 
7316_10642_000018_000003	train-clean-360	And what an irresistible moment it is this delightful territory before the darker mood of the C sharp minor part is reached 
7316_10642_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Niecks becomes enthusiastic over the insinuation and persuasion of this composition the composer showing himself in a fundamentally caressing mood The ease with which the entire work is floated proves that Chopin in mental health was not daunted by larger forms 
7316_10642_000018_000005	train-clean-360	There is moonlight in this music and some sunlight too 
none	none	The prevailing moods are coquetry and sweet contentment 
7316_10642_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Contrapuntal skill is shown in the working out section 
7316_10642_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Chopin always wears his learning lightly it does not oppress us 
7316_10642_000019_000002	train-clean-360	The inverted dominant pedal in the C sharp minor episode reveals with the massive coda a great master 
7316_10642_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Kullak suggests some variants 
7316_10642_000019_000004	train-clean-360	He uses the transient shake in the third bar instead of the appoggiatura which Klindworth prefers 
7316_10642_000019_000005	train-clean-360	Klindworth attacks the trill on the second page with the upper tone A flat

none	none	Of the fourth and glorious Ballade in F minor dedicated to Baronne C de Rothschild I could write a volume 
7316_10642_000023_000001	train-clean-360	It is Chopin in his most reflective yet lyric mood 
7316_10642_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Lyrism is the keynote of the work a passionate lyrism with a note of self absorption suppressed feeling truly Slavic this shyness and a concentration that is remarkable even for Chopin 
7316_10642_000023_000003	train-clean-360	The narrative tone is missing after the first page a rather moody and melancholic pondering usurping its place 
7316_10642_000023_000004	train-clean-360	It is the mood of a man who examines with morbid curious insistence the malady that is devouring his soul 
7316_10642_000023_000005	train-clean-360	This Ballade is the companion of the Fantaisie Polonaise but as a Ballade fully worthy of its sisters to quote Niecks 
7316_10642_000023_000006	train-clean-360	It was published December eighteen forty three 
7316_10642_000023_000007	train-clean-360	The theme in F minor has the elusive charm of a slow mournful valse that returns twice bejewelled yet never overladen 
7316_10642_000023_000008	train-clean-360	Here is the very apotheosis of the ornament the figuration sets off the idea in dazzling relief 
none	none	There are episodes transitional passage work distinguished by novelty and the finest art At no place is there display for display s sake The cadenza in A is a pause for breath rather a sigh before the rigorously logical imitations which presage the re entrance of the theme 
7316_10642_000023_000012	train-clean-360	How wonderfully the introduction comes in for its share of thoughtful treatment 
7316_10642_000023_000013	train-clean-360	What a harmonist 
none	none	And consider the D flat scale runs in the left hand how suave how satisfying is this page 
7316_10642_000023_000015	train-clean-360	I select for especial admiration this modulatory passage 
none	none	Musical score excerpt 
7316_10642_000025_000000	train-clean-360	And what could be more evocative of dramatic suspense than the sixteen bars before the mad terrifying coda 
7316_10642_000025_000001	train-clean-360	How the solemn splendors of the half notes weave an atmosphere of mystic tragedy 
7316_10642_000025_000002	train-clean-360	This soul suspension recalls Maeterlinck 
7316_10642_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Here is the episode 
none	none	Musical score excerpt 
7316_10642_000027_000000	train-clean-360	A story of de Lenz that lends itself to quotation is about this piece 
none	none	Tausig impressed me deeply in his interpretation of Chopin s Ballade in F minor 
7316_10642_000028_000001	train-clean-360	It has three requirements The comprehension of the programme as a whole for Chopin writes according to a programme to the situations in life best known to and understood by himself and in an adequate manner the conquest of the stupendous difficulties in complicated figures winding harmonies and formidable passages 
none	none	Tausig fulfilled these requirements presenting an embodiment of the signification and the feeling of the work 
7316_10642_000029_000001	train-clean-360	The Ballade andante con moto six eighths begins in the major key of the dominant the seventh measure comes to a stand before a fermata on C major 
none	none	The easy handling of these seven measures Tausig interpreted thus The piece has not yet begun in his firmer nobly expressive exposition of the principal theme free from sentimentality to which one might easily yield the grand style found due scope An essential requirement in an instrumental virtuoso is that he should understand how to breathe and how to allow his hearers to take breath giving them opportunity to arrive at a better understanding By this I mean a well chosen incision the cesura and a lingering letting in air Tausig cleverly called it which in no way impairs rhythm and time but rather brings them into stronger relief a LINGERING which our signs of notation cannot adequately express because it is made up of atomic time values 
7316_10642_000029_000005	train-clean-360	Rub the bloom from a peach or from a butterfly what remains will belong to the kitchen to natural history 
none	none	It is not otherwise with Chopin the bloom consisted in Tausig s treatment of the Ballade He came to the first passage the motive among blossoms and leaves a figurated recurrence to the principal theme is in the inner parts its polyphonic variant 
7316_10642_000030_000001	train-clean-360	A little thread connects this with the chorale like introduction of the second theme 
none	none	The theme is strongly and abruptly modulated perhaps a little too much so Tausig tied the little thread to a doppio movimento in two four time but thereby resulted sextolets which threw the chorale into still bolder relief 
7316_10642_000030_000004	train-clean-360	Then followed a passage a tempo in which the principal theme played hide and seek 
none	none	How clear it all became as Tausig played it 
7316_10642_000030_000006	train-clean-360	Of technical difficulties he knew literally nothing the intricate and evasive parts were as easy as the easiest I might say easier 
7316_10642_000031_000000	train-clean-360	I admired the short trills in the left hand which were trilled out quite independently as if by a second player the gliding ease of the cadence marked dolcissimo 
7316_10642_000031_000001	train-clean-360	It swung itself into the higher register where it came to a stop before A major just as the introduction stopped before C major 
none	none	Then after the theme has once more presented itself in a modified form variant it comes under the pestle of an extremely figurate coda which demands the study of an artist the strength of a robust man the most vigorous pianistic health in a word Tausig overcame this threatening group of terrific difficulties whose appearance in the piece is well explained by the programme without the slightest effect 
7316_10642_000031_000004	train-clean-360	The coda in modulated harp tones came to a stop before a fermata which corresponded to those before mentioned in order to cast anchor in the haven of the dominant finishing with a witches dance of triplets doubled in thirds 
7316_10642_000031_000005	train-clean-360	This piece winds up with extreme bravura 
7316_10642_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The lingering mentioned by de Lenz is tempo rubato so fatally misunderstood by most Chopin players 
7316_10642_000032_000001	train-clean-360	De Lenz in a note quotes Meyerbeer as saying Meyerbeer who quarrelled with Chopin about the rhythm of a mazurka Can one reduce women to notation 
7316_10642_000032_000002	train-clean-360	They would breed mischief were they emancipated from the measure 
7316_10642_000033_000000	train-clean-360	There is passion refined and swelling in the curves of this most eloquent composition 
7316_10642_000033_000001	train-clean-360	It is Chopin at the supreme summit of his art an art alembicated personal and intoxicating 
7316_10642_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I know of nothing in music like the F minor Ballade 
none	none	Bach in the Chromatic Fantasia be not deceived by its classical contours it is music hot from the soul Beethoven in the first movement of the C sharp minor Sonata the arioso of the Sonata op one hundred ten and possibly Schumann in the opening of his C major Fantaisie are as intimate as personal as the F minor Ballade which is as subtly distinctive as the hands and smile of Lisa Gioconda 
7316_10642_000033_000005	train-clean-360	Its inaccessible position preserves it from rude and irreverent treatment 
none	none	Its witchery is irresistible XI CLASSICAL CURRENTS Guy de Maupassant put before us a widely diverse number of novels in a famous essay attached to the definitive edition of his masterpiece Pierre et Jean and puzzlingly demanded the real form of the novel If Don Quixote is one how can Madame Bovary be another If Les Miserables is included in the list what are we to say to Huysmans La Bas Just such a question I should like to propound substituting sonata for novel If Scarlatti wrote sonatas what is the Appassionata If the A flat Weber is one can the F minor Brahms be called a sonata Is the Haydn form orthodox and the Schumann heterodox These be enigmas to make weary the formalists Come let us confess and in the open air there is a great amount of hypocrisy and cant in this matter We can as can any conservatory student give the recipe for turning out a smug specimen of the form but when we study the great examples it is just the subtle eluding of hard and fast rules that distinguishes the efforts of the masters from the machine work of apprentices and academic monsters Because it is no servile copy of the Mozart Sonata the F sharp minor of Brahms is a piece of original art Beethoven at first trod in the well blazed path of Haydn but study his second period and it sounds the big Beethoven note There is no final court of appeal in the matter of musical form and there is none in the matter of literary style The history of the sonata is the history of musical evolution Every great composer Schubert included added to the form filed here chipped away there introduced lawlessness where reigned prim order witness the Schumann F sharp minor Sonata and then came Chopin The Chopin sonata has caused almost as much warfare as the Wagner music drama It is all the more ludicrous for Chopin never wrote but one piano sonata that has a classical complexion in C minor op four and it was composed as early as eighteen twenty eight Not published until July eighteen fifty one it demonstrates without a possibility of doubt that the composer had no sympathy with the form He tried so hard and failed so dismally that it is a relief when the second and third sonatas are reached for in them there are only traces of formal beauty and organic unity But then there is much Chopin while little of his precious essence is to be tasted in the first sonata Chopin wrote of the C minor Sonata As a pupil I dedicated it to Elsner and oh the irony of criticism it was praised by the critics because not so revolutionary as the Variations op two This too despite the larghetto in five four time The first movement is wheezing and all but lifeless One asks in astonishment what Chopin is doing in this gallery And it is technically difficult The menuetto is excellent its trio being a faint approach to Beethoven in color The unaccustomed rhythm of the slow movement is irritating Our young Chopin does not move about as freely as Benjamin Godard in the scherzo of his violin and piano sonata in the same bizarre rhythm Niecks sees naught but barren waste in the finale I disagree with him There is the breath of a stirring spirit an imitative attempt that is more diverting than the other movements Above all there is movement and the close is vigorous though banal The sonata is the dullest music penned by Chopin but as a whole it hangs together as a sonata better than its two successors So much for an attempt at strict devotion to scholastic form From this schoolroom we are transported in op thirty five to the theatre of larger life and passion The B flat minor Sonata was published May eighteen forty Two movements are masterpieces the funeral march that forms the third movement is one of the Pole s most popular compositions while the finale has no parallel in piano music Schumann says that Chopin here bound together four of his maddest children and he is not astray He thinks the march does not belong to the work It certainly was written before its companion movements As much as Hadow admires the first two movements he groans at the last pair though they are admirable when considered separately These four movements have no common life Chopin says he intended the strange finale as a gossiping commentary on the march The left hand unisono with the right hand are gossiping after the march Perhaps the last two movements do hold together but what have they in common with the first two Tonality proves nothing Notwithstanding the grandeur and beauty of the grave the power and passion of the scherzo this Sonata in B flat minor is not more a sonata than it is a sequence of ballades and scherzi And again we are at the de Maupassant crux The work never could be spared it is Chopin mounted for action and in the thick of the fight The doppio movimento is pulse stirring a strong curt and characteristic theme for treatment Here is power and in the expanding prologue flashes more than a hint of the tragic The D flat Melody is soothing charged with magnetism and urged to a splendid fever of climax The working out section is too short and dissonantal but there is development perhaps more technical than logical I mean by this more pianistic than intellectually musical and we mount with the composer until the B flat version of the second subject is reached for the first subject strange to say does not return From that on to the firm chords of the close there is no misstep no faltering or obscurity Noble pages have been read and the scherzo is approached with eagerness Again there is no disappointment On numerous occasions I have testified my regard for this movement in warm and uncritical terms It is simply unapproachable and has no equal for lucidity brevity and polish among the works of Chopin except the Scherzo in C sharp minor but there is less irony more muscularity and more native sweetness in this E flat minor Scherzo I like the way Kullak marks the first B flat octave It is a pregnant beginning The second bar I have never heard from any pianist save Rubinstein given with the proper crescendo No one else seems to get it explosive enough within the walls of one bar It is a true Rossin ian crescendo And in what a wild country we are landed when the F sharp minor is crashed out Stormy chromatic double notes chords of the sixth rush on with incredible fury and the scherzo ends on the very apex of passion A Trio in G flat is the song of songs its swaying rhythms and phrase echoings investing a melody at once sensuous and chaste The second part and the return to the scherzo are proofs of the composer s sense of balance and knowledge of the mysteries of anticipation The closest parallelisms are noticeable the technique so admirable that the scherzo floats in mid air Flaubert s ideal of a miraculous style And then follows that deadly Marche Funebre Ernest Newman in his remarkable Study of Wagner speaks of the fundamental difference between the two orders of imagination as exemplified by Beethoven and Chopin on the one side Wagner on the other This regarding the funeral marches of the three Newman finds Wagner s the more concrete imagination the inward picture of Beethoven and Chopin much vaguer and more diffused Yet Chopin is seldom so realistic here are the bell like basses the morbid coloring Schumann found it contained much that is repulsive and Liszt raves rhapsodically over it for Karasowski it was the pain and grief of an entire nation while Ehlert thinks it owes its renown to the wonderful effect of two triads which in their combination possess a highly tragical element The middle movement is not at all characteristic Why could it not at least have worn second mourning After so much black crepe drapery one should not at least at once display white lingerie This is cruel The D flat Trio is a logical relief after the booming and glooming of the opening That it is a rapturous gaze into the beatific regions of a beyond as Niecks writes I am not prepared to say We do know however that the march when isolated has a much more profound effect than in its normal sequence The presto is too wonderful for words Rubinstein or was it originally Tausig who named it Night winds sweeping over the churchyard graves Its agitated whirring unharmonized triplets are strangely disquieting and can never be mistaken for mere etude passage work The movement is too sombre its curves too full of half suppressed meanings its rush and sub human growling too expressive of something that defies definition Schumann compares it to a sphinx with a mocking smile To Henri Barbadette C est Lazare grattant de ses ongles la pierre de son tombeau or like Mendelssohn one may abhor it yet it cannot be ignored It has Asiatic coloring and to me seems like the wavering outlines of light tipped hills seen sharply en silhouette behind which rises and falls a faint infernal glow This art paints as many differing pictures as there are imaginations for its sonorous background not alone the universal solvent as Henry James thinks it bridges the vast silent gulfs between human souls with its humming eloquence This sonata is not dedicated The third Sonata in B minor op fifty eight has more of that undefinable organic unity yet withal it is not so powerful so pathos breeding or so compact of thematic interest as its forerunner The first page to the chromatic chords of the sixth promises much There is a clear statement a sound theme for developing purposes the crisp march of chord progressions and then the edifice goes up in smoke After wreathings and curlings of passage work and on the rim of despair we witness the exquisite budding of the melody in D It is an aubade a nocturne of the morn if the contradictory phrase be allowed There is morning freshness in its hue and scent and when it bursts a parterre of roses The close of the section is inimitable All the more sorrow at what follows wild disorder and the luxuriance called tropical When B major is compassed we sigh for it augurs us a return of delight The ending is not that of a sonata but a love lyric For Chopin is not the cool breadth and marmoreal majesty of blank verse He sonnets to perfection but the epical air does not fill his nostrils Vivacious charming light as a harebell in the soft breeze is the Scherzo in E flat It has a clear ring of the scherzo and harks back to Weber in its impersonal amiable hurry The largo is tranquilly beautiful rich in its reverie lovely in its tune The trio is reserved and hypnotic The last movement with its brilliancy and force is a favorite but it lacks weight and the entire sonata is as Niecks writes affiliated but not cognate It was published June eighteen forty five and is dedicated to Comtesse E de Perthuis So these sonatas of Chopin are not sonatas at all but throwing titles to the dogs would we forego the sensations that two of them evoke There is still another the Sonata in G minor op sixty five for piano and cello It is dedicated to Chopin s friend August Franchomme the violoncellist Now while I by no means share Finck s exalted impression of this work yet I fancy the critics have dealt too harshly with it Robbed of its title of sonata though sedulously aping this form it contains much pretty music And it is grateful for the cello There is not an abundant literature for this kingly instrument in conjunction with the piano so why flaunt Chopin s contribution I will admit that he walks stiffly encased in his borrowed garb but there is the andante short as it is an effective scherzo and a carefully made allegro and finale Tonal monotony is the worst charge to be brought against this work The trio also in G minor op eight is more alluring It was published March eighteen thirty three and dedicated to Prince Anton Radziwill Chopin later in speaking of it to a pupil admitted that he saw things he would like to change He regretted not making it for viola instead of violin cello and piano It was worked over a long time the first movement being ready in eighteen thirty three When it appeared it won philistine praise for its form more nearly approximates the sonata than any of his efforts in the cyclical order excepting op four In it the piano receives better treatment than the other instruments there are many virtuoso passages but again key changes are not frequent or disparate enough to avoid a monotone Chopin s imagination refuses to become excited when working in the open spaces of the sonata form Like creatures that remain drab of hue in unsympathetic or dangerous environment his music is transformed to a bewildering bouquet of color when he breathes native air Compare the wildly modulating Chopin of the ballades to the tame pacing Chopin of the sonatas trio and concertos The trio opens with fire the scherzo is fanciful and the adagio charming while the finale is cheerful to loveliness It might figure occasionally on the programmes of our chamber music concerts despite its youthful puerility There remain the two concertos which I do not intend discussing fully Not Chopin at his very best the E minor and F minor concertos are frequently heard because of the chances afforded the solo player I have written elsewhere at length of the Klindworth Tausig and Burmeister versions of the two concertos As time passes I see no reason for amending my views on this troublous subject Edgar S Kelly holds a potent brief for the original orchestration contending that it suits the character of the piano part Rosenthal puts this belief into practice by playing the older version of the E minor with the first long tutti curtailed But he is not consistent for he uses the Tausig octaves at the close of the rondo While I admire the Tausig orchestration these particlar octaves are hideously cacaphonic The original triplet unisons are so much more graceful and musical The chronology of the concertos has given rise to controversy The trouble arose from the F minor Concerto it being numbered op twenty one although composed before the one in E minor The former was published April eighteen thirty six the latter September eighteen thirty three The slow movement of the F minor Concerto was composed by Chopin during his passion for Constantia Gladowska She was the ideal he mentions in his letters the adagio of this concerto This larghetto in A flat is a trifle too ornamental for my taste mellifluous and serene as it is The recitative is finely outlined I think I like best the romanze of the E minor Concerto It is less flowery The C sharp minor part is imperious in its beauty while the murmuring mystery of the close mounts to the imagination The rondo is frolicksome tricky genial and genuine piano music It is true the first movement is too long too much in one set of keys and the working out section too much in the nature of a technical study The first movement of the F minor far transcends it in breadth passion and musical feeling but it is short and there is no coda Richard Burmeister has supplied the latter deficiency in a capitally made cadenza which Paderewski plays It is a complete summing up of the movement The mazurka like finale is very graceful and full of pure sweet melody This concerto is altogether more human than the E minor Both derive from Hummel and Field The passage work is superior in design to that of the earlier masters the general character episodical but episodes of rare worth and originality As Ehlert says Noblesse oblige and thus Chopin felt himself compelled to satisfy all demands exacted of a pianist and wrote the unavoidable piano concerto It was not consistent with his nature to express himself in broad terms His lungs were too weak for the pace in seven league boots so often required in a score The trio and cello sonata were also tasks for whose accomplishment Nature did not design him He must touch the keys by himself without being called upon to heed the players sitting next him He is at his best when without formal restraint he can create out of his inmost soul He must touch the keys by himself There you have summed up in a phrase the reason Chopin never succeeded in impressing his individuality upon the sonata form and his playing upon the masses His was the lonely soul George Sand knew this when she wrote He made an instrument speak the language of the infinite Often in ten lines that a child might play he has introduced poems of unequalled elevation dramas unrivalled in force and energy He did not need the great material methods to find expression for his genius Neither saxophone nor ophicleide was necessary for him to fill the soul with awe Without church organ or human voice he inspired faith and enthusiasm It might be remarked here that Beethoven too aroused a wondering and worshipping world without the aid of saxophone or ophicleide But it is needless cruelty to pick at Madame Sand s criticisms She had no technical education and so little appreciation of Chopin s peculiar genius for the piano that she could write The day will come when his music will be arranged for orchestra without change of the piano score which is disaster breeding nonsense We have sounded Chopin s weakness when writing for any instrument but his own when writing in any form but his own The E minor Concerto is dedicated to Frederick Kalkbrenner the F minor to the Comtesse Deiphine Potocka The latter dedication demonstrates that he could forget his only ideal in the presence of the charming Potocka Ah these vibratile and versatile Poles Robert Schumann it is related shook his head wearily when his early work was mentioned Dreary stuff said the composer whose critical sense did not fail him even in so personal a question What Chopin thought of his youthful music may be discovered in his scanty correspondence To suppose that the young Chopin sprang into the arena a fully equipped warrior is one of those nonsensical notions which gains currency among persons unfamiliar with the law of musical evolution Chopin s musical ancestry is easily traced as Poe had his Holley Chivers Chopin had his Field The germs of his second period are all there from op one to opus twenty two virtuosity for virtuosity s sake is very evident Liszt has said that in every young artist there is the virtuoso fever and Chopin being a pianist did not escape the fever of the footlights He was composing too at a time when piano music was well nigh strangled by excess of ornament when acrobats were kings when the Bach Fugue and Beethoven Sonata lurked neglected and dusty in the memories of the few Little wonder then we find this individual youthful Pole not timidly treading in the path of popular composition but bravely carrying his banner spangled glittering and fanciful and outstripping at their own game all the virtuosi of Europe His originality in this bejewelled work caused Hummel to admire and Kalkbrenner to wonder The supple fingers of the young man from Warsaw made quick work of existing technical difficulties He needs must invent some of his own and when Schumann saw the pages of op two he uttered his historical cry Today we wonder somewhat at his enthusiasm It is the old story a generation seeks to know a generation comprehends and enjoys and a generation discards Opus one a Rondo in C minor dedicated to Madame de Linde saw the light in eighteen twenty five but it was preceded by two polonaises a set of variations and two mazurkas in G and B flat major Schumann declared that Chopin s first published work was his tenth and that between op one and two there lay two years and twenty works Be this as it may one cannot help liking the C minor Rondo In the A flat section we detect traces of his F minor Concerto There is lightness joy in creation which contrast with the heavy dour quality of the C minor Sonata op four Loosely constructed in a formal sense and too exuberant for his strict confines this op one is remarkable much more remarkable than Schumann s Abegg variations The Rondo a la Mazur in F is a further advance It is dedicated to Comtesse Moriolles and was published in eighteen twenty seven Schumann reviewed it in eighteen thirty six It is sprightly Polish in feeling and rhythmic life and a glance at any of its pages gives us the familiar Chopin impression florid passage work chords in extensions and chromatic progressions The Concert Rondo op fourteen in F called Krakowiak is built on a national dance in two four time which originated in Cracovia It is to quote Niecks a modified polonaise danced by the peasants with lusty abandon Its accentual life is usually manifested on an unaccented part of the bar especially at the end of a section or phrase Chopin s very Slavic version is spirited but the virtuoso predominates There is lushness in ornamentation and a bold merry spirit informs every page The orchestral accompaniment is thin Dedicated to the Princesse Czartoryska it was published June eighteen thirty four The Rondo op sixteen with an Introduction is in great favor at the conservatories and is neat rather than poetical although the introduction has dramatic touches It is to this brilliant piece with its Weber ish affinities that Richard Burmeister has supplied an orchestral accompaniment The remaining Rondo posthumously published as op seventy three and composed in eighteen twenty eight was originally intended so Chopin writes in eighteen twenty eight for one piano It is full of fire but the ornamentation runs mad and no traces of the poetical Chopin are present He is preoccupied with the brilliant surfaces of the life about him His youthful expansiveness finds a fair field in these variations rondos and fantasias Schumann s enthusiasm over the variations on La ci darem la mano seems to us a little overdone Chopin had not much gift for variation in the sense that we now understand variation Beethoven Schumann and Brahms one must include Mendelssohn s Serious Variations are masters of a form that is by no means structurally simple or a reversion to mere spielerei as Finck fancies Chopin plays with his themes prettily but it is all surface display all heat lightning He never smites as does Brahms with his Thor hammer the subject full in the middle cleaving it to its core Chopin is slightly effeminate in his variations and they are true specimens of spielerei despite the cleverness of design in the arabesques their brilliancy and euphony Op two has its dazzling moments but its musical worth is inferior It is written to split the ears of the groundlings or rather to astonish and confuse them for the Chopin dynamics in the early music are never very rude The indisputable superiority to Herz and the rest of the shallow pated variationists caused Schumann s passionate admiration It has however given us an interesting page of music criticism Rellstab grumpy old fellow was near right when he wrote of these variations that the composer runs down the theme with roulades and throttles and hangs it with chains of shakes The skip makes its appearance in the fourth variation and there is no gainsaying the brilliancy and piquant spirit of the Alla Polacca Op two is orchestrally accompanied an accompaniment that may be gladly dispensed with and dedicated by Chopin to the friend of his youth Titus Woyciechowski Je Vends des Scapulaires is a tune in Herold and Halevy s Ludovic Chopin varied it in his op twelve This rondo in B flat is the weakest of Chopin s muse It is Chopin and water and Gallic eau sucree at that The piece is written tastefully is not difficult but woefully artificial Published in eighteen thirty three it was dedicated to Miss Emma Horsford In May eighteen fifty one appeared the Variations in E without an opus number They are not worth the trouble Evidently composed before Chopin s op one and before eighteen thirty they are musically light waisted although written by one who already knew the keyboard The last a valse is the brightest of the set The theme is German The Fantaisie op thirteen in A on Polish airs preceded by an introduction in F sharp minor is dedicated to the pianist J P Pixis It was published in April eighteen thirty four It is Chopin brilliant Its orchestral background does not count for much but the energy the color and Polish character of the piece endeared it to the composer He played it often and as Kleczynski asks Are these brilliant passages these cascades of pearly notes these bold leaps the sadness and the despair of which we hear Is it not rather youth exuberant with intensity and life Is it not happiness gayety love for the world and men The melancholy notes are there to bring out to enforce the principal ideas For instance in the Fantaisie op thirteen the theme of Kurpinski moves and saddens us but the composer does not give time for this impression to become durable he suspends it by means of a long trill and then suddenly by a few chords and with a brilliant prelude leads us to a popular dance which makes us mingle with the peasant couples of Mazovia Does the finale indicate by its minor key the gayety of a man devoid of hope as the Germans say Kleczynski then tells us that a Polish proverb A fig for misery is the keynote of a nation that dances furiously to music in the minor key Elevated beauty not sepulchral gayety is the character of Polish of Chopin s music This is a valuable hint There are variations in the Fantaisie which end with a merry and vivacious Kujawiak The F minor Fantaisie will be considered later Neither by its magnificent content construction nor opus number forty nine does it fall into this chapter The Allegro de Concert in A op forty six was published in November eighteen forty one and dedicated to Mlle Friederike Muller a pupil of Chopin It has all the characteristics of a concerto and is indeed a truncated one much more so than Schumann s F minor Sonata called Concert Sans Orchestre There are tutti in the Chopin work the solo part not really beginning until the eighty seventh bar But it must not be supposed that these long introductory passages are ineffective for the player The Allegro is one of Chopin s most difficult works It abounds in risky skips ambuscades of dangerous double notes and the principal themes are bold and expressive The color note is strikingly adapted for public performance and perhaps Schumann was correct in believing that Chopin had originally sketched this for piano and orchestra Niecks asks if this is not the fragment of a concerto for two pianos which Chopin in a letter written at Vienna December twenty one eighteen thirty said he would play in public with his friend Nidecki if he succeeded in writing it to his satisfaction And is there any significance in the fact that Chopin when sending this manuscript to Fontana probably in the summer of eighteen forty one calls it a concerto While it adds little to Chopin s reputation it has the potentialities of a powerful and more manly composition than either of the two concertos Jean Louis Nicode has given it an orchestral garb besides arranging it for two pianos He has added a developing section of seventy bars This version was first played in New York a decade ago by Marie Geselschap a Dutch pianist under the direction of the late Anton Seidl The original it must be acknowledged is preferable The Bolero op nineteen has a Polonaise flavor There is but little Spanish in its ingredients It is merely a memorandum of Chopin s early essays in dance forms It was published in eighteen thirty four four years before Chopin s visit to Spain Niecks thinks it an early work That it can be made effective was proven by Emil Sauer It is for fleet fingered pianists and the principal theme has the rhythmical ring of the Polonaise although the most Iberian in character It is dedicated to Comtesse E de Flahault In the key of A minor its coda ends in A major Willeby says it is in C major The Tarantella is in A flat and is numbered op forty three It was published in eighteen forty one and bears no dedication Composed at Nohant it is as little Italian as the Bolero is Spanish Chopin s visit to Italy was of too short a duration to affect him at least in the style of dance It is without the necessary ophidian tang and far inferior to Heller and Liszt s efforts in the constricted form One finds little of the frenzy ascribed to it by Schumann in his review It breathes of the North not the South and ranks far below the A flat Impromptu in geniality and grace The C minor Funeral March composed according to Fontana in eighteen twenty nine sounds like Mendelssohn The trio has the processional quality of a Parisian funeral cortege It is modest and in no wise remarkable The three Ecossaises published as op seventy three No three are little dances schottisches nothing more No two in G is highly popular in girls boarding schools The Grand Duo Concertant for cello and piano is jointly composed by Chopin and Franchomme on themes from Robert le Diable It begins in E and ends in A major and is without opus number Schumann thinks Chopin sketched the whole of it and that Franchomme said Yes to everything It is for the salon of eighteen thirty three when it was published It is empty tiresome and only slightly superior to compositions of the same sort by De Beriot and Osborne Full of rapid elegancies and shallow passage work this duo is certainly a piece d occasion the occasion probably being the need of ready money The seventeen Polish songs were composed between eighteen twenty four and eighteen forty four In the psychology of the Lied Chopin was not happy Karasowski writes that many of the songs were lost and some of them are still sung in Poland their origin being hazy The Third of May is cited as one of these Chopin had a habit of playing songs for his friends but neglected putting some of them on paper The collected songs are under the opus head seventy four The words are by his friends Stephen Witwicki Adam Mickiewicz Bogdan Zaleski and Sigismond Krasinski The first in the key of A the familiar Maiden s Wish has been brilliantly paraphrased by Liszt This pretty mazurka is charmingly sung and played by Marcella Sembrich in the singing lesson of The Barber of Seville There are several mazurkas in the list Most of these songs are mediocre Poland s Dirge is an exception and so is Horsemen Before the Battle Was ein junges Madchen liebt has a short introduction in which the reminiscence hunter may find a true bit of Meistersinger color Simple in structure and sentiment the Chopin lieder seem almost rudimentary compared to essays in this form by Schubert Schumann Franz Brahms and Tschaikowsky A word of recommendation may not be amiss here regarding the technical study of Chopin Kleczynski in his two books gives many valuable hints and Isidor Philipp has published a set of Exercises Quotidiens made up of specimens in double notes octaves and passages taken from the works Here skeletonized are the special technical problems In these Daily Studies and his edition of the Etudes are numerous examples dealt with practically For a study of Chopin s ornaments Mertke has discussed at length the various editorial procedure in the matter of attacking the trill in single and double notes also the easiest method of executing the flying scud and vapors of the fioriture This may be found in No one hundred seventy nine of the Edition Steingraber Philipp s collection is published in Paris by J Hamelle and is prefixed by some interesting remarks of Georges Mathias Chopin s portrait in eighteen thirty three after Vigneron is included One composition more is to be considered In eighteen thirty seven Chopin contributed the sixth variation of the march from I Puritani These variations were published under the title Hexameron Morceau de Concert Grandes Variations de bravoure sur la marche des Puritans de Bellini composees pour le concert de Madame la Princesse Belgiojoso au benefice des pauvres par MM Liszt Thalberg Pixis H Herz Czerny et Chopin Liszt wrote an orchestral accompaniment never published His pupil Moriz Rosenthal is the only modern virtuoso who plays the Hexameron in his concerts and play it he does with overwhelming splendor Chopin s contribution in E major is in his sentimental salon mood Musically it is the most impressive of this extraordinary mastodonic survival of the pianistic past The newly published Fugue or fugato in A minor in two voices is from a manuscript in the possession of Natalie Janotha who probably got it from the late Princess Czartoryska a pupil of the composer The composition is ineffective and in spots ugly particularly in the stretta and is no doubt an exercise during the working years with Elsner The fact that in the coda the very suspicious octave pedal point and trills may be omitted so the editorial note urns leads one to suspect that out of a fragment Janotha has evolved Cuvier like an entire composition Chopin as fugue maker does not appear in a brilliant light Is the Polish composer to become a musical Hugh Conway Why all these disjecta membra of a sketch book In these youthful works may be found the beginnings of the greater Chopin but not his vast subjugation of the purely technical to the poetic and spiritual That came later To the devout Chopinist the first compositions are so many proofs of the joyful victorious spirit of the man whose spleen and pessimism have been wrongfully compared to Leopardi s and Baudelaire s Chopin was gay fairly healthy and bubbling over with a pretty malice His first period shows this it also shows how thorough and painful the processes by which he evolved his final style XII THE POLONAISES HEROIC HYMNS OF BATTLE

7155-10644-0008	train-other-500	There is no doubt he idealized his country and her wrongs
none	none	 until the theme grew out of all proportion 
7155-10644-0009	train-other-500	Politically the Poles and Celts rub shoulders Niecks points out that if Chopin was a flattering idealist as a national poet as a personal poet he was an uncompromising realist So in the polonaises we find two distinct groups
7155-10644-0010	train-other-500	in one the objective martial side predominates in the other is Chopin the moody mournful and morose But in all the Polish element pervades Barring the mazurkas these dances are the most Polish of his works

7155-10644-0017	train-other-500	is in three four time with the accent on the second beat of the bar In simple binary form ternary if a trio is added this dance has feminine endings to all the principal cadences The rhythmical cast of the bass is seldom changed

none	none	 it was called Polonais 
7155-10644-0019	train-other-500	Liszt wrote of it In this form the noblest traditional feelings of ancient Poland are represented The Polonaise is the true and purest type of Polish national character as in the course of centuries it was developed partly through the political position of the kingdom toward east and west
7155-10644-0020	train-other-500	partly through an undefinable peculiar inborn disposition of the entire race In the development of the Polonaise everything company operated which specifically distinguished the nation from others In the Poles of departed times manly resolution was united
7155-10644-0021	train-other-500	with glowing devotion to the object of their love Their knightly heroism was sanctioned by high soaring dignity and even the laws of gallantry and the national costume exerted an influence over the turns of this dance
7155-10644-0022	train-other-500	The Polonaises are the keystone in the development of this form They belong to the most beautiful of Chopin inspirations With their energetic rhythm they electrify to the point of excited demonstration even the sleepiest indifferentism
7155-10644-0023	train-other-500	Chopin was born too late and left his native hearth too early to be initiated into the original character of the Polonaise as danced through his own observation But what others imparted to him in regard to it was supplemented by his fancy and his nationality
7155-10644-0024	train-other-500	Chopin wrote fifteen Polonaises the authenticity of one in G flat major being doubted by Niecks

7155-10644-0031	train-other-500	It was practically a novelty to New York when Rafael Joseffy played it here superlatively well in eighteen seventy nine The orchestral part seems wholly superfluous for the scoring is not particularly effective

7155-10644-0046	train-other-500	Chopin in the dreary watches of the night was surprised terrified is a better word by the opening of his door and the entrance of a long train of Polish nobles and ladies richly robed who moved slowly by him

7155-10644-0052	train-other-500	The opening is very impressive the nerve pulp being harassed by the gradually swelling prelude There is defiant power in the first theme and the constant reference to it betrays the composer s exasperated mental condition
7155-10644-0053	train-other-500	This tendency to return upon himself a tormenting introspection certainly signifies a grave state But consider the musical weight of the work the recklessly bold outpourings of a mind almost distraught
7155-10644-0054	train-other-500	There is no greater test for the poet pianist than the F sharp minor Polonaise It is profoundly ironical what else means the introduction of that lovely mazurka a flower between two abysses
7155-10644-0055	train-other-500	This strange dance is ushered in by two of the most enigmatic pages of Chopin
none	none	 The A major intermezzo with its booming cannons and reverberating overtones 
7155-10644-0056	train-other-500	is not easily defensible on the score of form yet it unmistakably fits in the picture The mazurka is full of interrogation and emotional nuanciren The return of the tempest is not long delayed
7155-10644-0057	train-other-500	It bursts wanes and with the coda comes sad yearning then the savage drama passes tremblingly into the night after fluid and wavering affirmations a roar in F sharp
7155-10644-0058	train-other-500	and finally a silence that marks the cessation of an agitating nightmare No sabre dance this but a confession from the dark depths of a self tortured soul

7155-10644-0062	train-other-500	It is dedicated to A Leo This is the one Karasowski calls the story of Chopin s vision of the antique dead in an isolated tower of Madame Sand s chateau at Nohant
7155-10644-0063	train-other-500	We have seen this legend disproved by one who knows This Polonaise is not as feverish and as exalted as the previous one It is as Kleczynski writes the type of a war song

7155-10644-0064	train-other-500	and silver spur There is imaginative splendor in this thrilling work with its thunder of horses hoofs and fierce challengings What fire what sword thrusts and smoke and clash of mortal conflict
7155-10644-0065	train-other-500	Here is no psychical presentation but an objective picture of battle of concrete contours and with a cleaving brilliancy that excites the blood to boiling pitch That Chopin ever played it as intended is incredible
7155-10644-0066	train-other-500	none but the heroes of the keyboard may grasp its dense chordal masses its fiery projectiles of tone But there is something disturbing even ghostly in the strange intermezzo that separates the trio from the polonaise Both mist and starlight are in it
7155-10644-0067	train-other-500	Yet the work is played too fast and has been nicknamed the Drum Polonaise losing in majesty and force because of the vanity of virtuosi The octaves in E major are spun out as if speed were the sole idea of this episode
7155-10644-0068	train-other-500	Follow Kleczynski s advice and do not sacrifice the Polonaise to the octaves Karl Tausig so Joseffy and de Lenz assert played this Polonaise in an unapproachable manner Powerful battle tableau as it is
7155-10644-0069	train-other-500	it may still be presented so as not to shock one s sense of the euphonious of the limitations of the instrument This work becomes vapid and unheroic when transferred to the orchestra

7155-10644-0070	train-other-500	given to the world September eighteen forty six is dedicated to Madame A Veyret One of three great Polonaises it is just beginning to be understood having been derided as amorphous febrile
7155-10644-0071	train-other-500	of little musical moment even Liszt declaring that such pictures possess but little real value to art Deplorable visions which the artist should admit with extreme circumspection within the graceful circle of his charmed realm
7155-10644-0072	train-other-500	This was written in the old fashioned days when art was aristocratic and excluded the baser and more painful emotions For a generation accustomed to the realism of Richard Strauss the Fantaisie Polonaise seems vaporous and idealistic withal new
none	none	 It recalls one of those enchanted flasks of the magii from which on opening smoke exhales that gradually shapes itself into fantastic and fearsome figures 
7155-10644-0073	train-other-500	This Polonaise at no time exhibits the solidity of its two predecessors its plasticity defies the imprint of the conventional Polonaise though we ever feel its rhythms It may be full of monologues interspersed cadenzas
7155-10644-0074	train-other-500	improvised preludes and short phrases as Kullak suggests yet there is unity in the composition the units of structure and style It was music of the future when Chopin composed it is now music of the present as much as Richard Wagner s
none	none	 But the realism is a trifle clouded 
7155-10644-0075	train-other-500	Here is the duality of Chopin the suffering man and Chopin the prophet of Poland Undimmed is his poetic vision Poland will be free undaunted his soul though oppressed by a suffering body
7155-10644-0076	train-other-500	There are in the work throes of agony blended with the trumpet notes of triumph And what puzzled our fathers the shifting lights and shadows the restless tonalities are welcome for at the beginning of this new century the chromatic is king
7155-10644-0077	train-other-500	The ending of this Polonaise is triumphant recalling in key and climaxing the A flat Ballade Chopin is still the captain of his soul and Poland will be free

7155-10644-0093	train-other-500	There are traces of the master throughout particularly in the E flat minor Trio but there are some vile progressions and an air of vulgarity surely not Chopin s This dance form since the death of the great composer has been chiefly developed on the virtuoso side

none	none	 But they are more Hungarian than Polish XIII MAZURKAS DANCES OF THE SOUL I Coquetries vanities fantasies inclinations elegies vague emotions passions conquests struggles upon which the safety or favors of others depend all all meet in this dance Thus Liszt De Lenz further quotes him Of the Mazurkas one must harness a new pianist of the first rank to each of them Yet Liszt told Niecks he did not care much for Chopin s Mazurkas One often meets in them with bars which might just as well be in another place But as Chopin puts them perhaps nobody could have put them Liszt despite the rhapsodical praise of his friend is not always to be relied upon Capricious as Chopin he had days when he disliked not only the Mazurkas but all music He confessed to Niecks that when he played a half hour for amusement it was Chopin he took up There is no more brilliant chapter than this Hungarian s on the dancing of the Mazurka by the Poles It is a companion to his equally sensational description of the Polonaise He gives a wild whirling highly colored narrative of the Mazurka with a coda of extravagant praise of the beauty and fascination of Polish women Angel through love demon through fantasy as Balzac called her In none of the piano rhapsodies are there such striking passages to be met as in Liszt s overwrought cadenced prose prose modelled after Chateaubriand Niema iak Polki nothing equals the Polish women and their divine coquetries the Mazurka is their dance it is the feminine complement to the heroic and masculine Polonaise An English writer describes the dancing of the Mazurka in contemporary Russia In the salons of saint Petersburg for instance the guests actually dance they do not merely shamble to and fro in a crowd crumpling their clothes and ruffling their tempers and call it a set of quadrilles They have ample space for the sweeping movements and complicated figures of all the orthodox ball dances and are generally gifted with sufficient plastic grace to carry them out in style They carefully cultivate dances calling for a kind of grace which is almost beyond the reach of art The mazurka is one of the finest of these and it is quite a favorite at balls on the banks of the Neva It needs a good deal of room one or more spurred officers and grace grace and grace The dash with which the partners rush forward the clinking and clattering of spurs as heel clashes with heel in mid air punctuating the staccato of the music the loud thud of boots striking the ground followed by their sibilant slide along the polished floor then the swift springs and sudden bounds the whirling gyrations and dizzy evolutions the graceful genuflections and quick embraces and all the other intricate and maddening movements to the accompaniment of one of Glinka s or Tschaikowsky s masterpieces awaken and mobilize all the antique heroism mediaeval chivalry and wild romance that lie dormant in the depths of men s being There is more genuine pleasure in being the spectator of a soul thrilling dance like that than in taking an active part in the lifeless make believes performed at society balls in many of the more Western countries of Europe Absolutely Slavonic though a local dance of the province of Mazovia the Mazurek or Mazurka is written in three four time with the usual displaced accent in music of Eastern origin Brodzinski is quoted as saying that in its primitive form the Mazurek is only a kind of Krakowiak less lively less sautillant At its best it is a dancing anecdote a story told in a charming variety of steps and gestures It is intoxicating rude humorous poetic above all melancholy When he is happiest he sings his saddest does the Pole Hence his predilection for minor modes The Mazurka is in three four or three eight time Sometimes the accent is dotted but this is by no means absolute Here is the rhythm most frequently encountered although Chopin employs variants and modifications The first part of the bar has usually the quicker notes The scale is a mixture of major and minor melodies are encountered that grew out of a scale shorn of a degree Occasionally the augmented second the Hungarian is encountered and skips of a third are of frequent occurrence This with progressions of augmented fourths and major sevenths gives to the Mazurkas of Chopin an exotic character apart from their novel and original content As was the case with the Polonaise Chopin took the framework of the national dance developed it enlarged it and hung upon it his choicest melodies his most piquant harmonies He breaks and varies the conventionalized rhythm in a half hundred ways lifting to the plane of a poem the heavy hoofed peasant dance But in this idealization he never robs it altogether of the flavor of the soil It is in all its wayward disguises the Polish Mazurka and is with the Polonaise according to Rubinstein the only Polish reflective music he has made although in all of his compositions we hear him relate rejoicingly of Poland s vanished greatness singing mourning weeping over Poland s downfall and all that in the most beautiful the most musical way Besides the hard inartistic modulations the startling progressions and abrupt changes of mood that jarred on the old fashioned Moscheles and dipped in vitriol the pen of Rellstab there is in the Mazurkas the greatest stumbling block of all the much exploited rubato Berlioz swore that Chopin could not play in time which was not true and later we shall see that Meyerbeer thought the same What to the sensitive critic is a charming wavering and swaying in the measure Chopin leans about freely within his bars wrote an English critic for the classicists was a rank departure from the time beat According to Liszt s description of the rubato a wind plays in the leaves Life unfolds and develops beneath them but the tree remains the same that is the Chopin rubato Elsewhere a tempo agitated broken interrupted a movement flexible yet at the same time abrupt and languishing and vacillating as the fluctuating breath by which it is agitated Chopin was more commonplace in his definition Supposing he explained that a piece lasts a given number of minutes it may take just so long to perform the whole but in detail deviations may differ The tempo rubato is probably as old as music itself It is in Bach it was practised by the old Italian singers Mikuli says that no matter how free Chopin was in his treatment of the right hand in melody or arabesque the left kept strict time Mozart and not Chopin it was who first said Let your left hand be your conductor and always keep time Halle the pianist once asserted that he proved Chopin to be playing four four instead of three four measure in a mazurka Chopin laughingly admitted that it was a national trait Halle was bewildered when he first heard Chopin play for he did not believe such music could be represented by musical signs Still he holds that this style has been woefully exaggerated by pupils and imitators If a Beethoven symphony or a Bach fugue be played with metronomical rigidity it loses its quintessential flavor Is it not time the ridiculous falsehoods about the Chopin rubato be exposed Naturally abhorring anything that would do violence to the structural part of his compositions Chopin was a very martinet with his pupils if too much license of tempo was taken His music needs the greatest lucidity in presentation and naturally a certain elasticity of phrasing Rhythms need not be distorted nor need there be absurd and vulgar haltings silly and explosive dynamics Chopin sentimentalized is Chopin butchered He loathed false sentiment and a man whose taste was formed by Bach and Mozart who was nurtured by the music of these two giants could never have indulged in exaggerated jerky tempi in meaningless expression Come let us be done with this fetish of stolen time of the wonderful and so seldom comprehended rubato If you wish to play Chopin play him in curves let there be no angularities of surface of measure but in the name of the Beautiful do not deliver his exquisitely balanced phrases with the jolting balky eloquence of a cafe chantant singer The very balance and symmetry of the Chopin phraseology are internal it must be delivered in a flowing waving manner never square or hard yet with every accent showing like the supple muscles of an athlete beneath his skin Without the skeleton a musical composition is flaccid shapeless weak and without character Chopin s music needs a rhythmic sense that to us fed upon the few simple forms of the West seems almost abnormal The Chopin rubato is rhythm liberated from its scholastic bonds but it does not mean anarchy disorder What makes this popular misconception all the more singular is the freedom with which the classics are now being interpreted A Beethoven and even a Mozart symphony no longer means a rigorous execution in which the measure is ruthlessly hammered out by the conductor but the melodic and emotional curve is followed and the tempo fluctuates Why then is Chopin singled out as the evil and solitary representative of a vicious time beat Play him as you play Mendelssohn and your Chopin has evaporated Again play him lawlessly with his accentual life topsy turvied and he is no longer Chopin his caricature only Pianists of Slavic descent alone understand the secret of the tempo rubato I have read in a recently started German periodical that to make the performance of Chopin s works pleasing it is sufficient to play them with less precision of rhythm than the music of other composers I on the contrary do not know a single phrase of Chopin s works including even the freest among them in which the balloon of inspiration as it moves through the air is not checked by an anchor of rhythm and symmetry Such passages as occur in the F minor Ballade the B flat minor Scherzo the middle part the F minor Prelude and even the A flat Impromptu are not devoid of rhythm The most crooked recitative of the F minor Concerto as can be easily proved has a fundamental rhythm not at all fantastic and which cannot be dispensed with when playing with orchestra Chopin never overdoes fantasy and is always restrained by a pronounced aesthetical instinct Everywhere the simplicity of his poetical inspiration and his sobriety saves us from extravagance and false pathos Kleczynski has this in his second volume for he enjoyed the invaluable prompting of Chopin s pupil the late Princess Marceline Czartoryska Niecks quotes Mme Friederike Stretcher nee Muller a pupil who wrote of her master He required adherence to the strictest rhythm hated all lingering and lagging misplaced rubatos as well as exaggerated ritardandos Je vous prie de vous asseoir he said on such an occasion with gentle mockery And it is just in this respect that people make such terrible mistakes in the execution of his works And now to the Mazurkas which de Lenz said were Heinrich Heine s songs on the piano Chopin was a phoenix of intimacy with the piano In his nocturnes and mazurkas he is unrivalled downright fabulous No compositions are so Chopin ish as the Mazurkas Ironical sad sweet joyous morbid sour sane and dreamy they illustrate what was said of their composer his heart is sad his mind is gay That subtle quality for an Occidental enigmatic which the Poles call Zal is in some of them in others the fun is almost rough and roaring Zal a poisonous word is a baleful compound of pain sadness secret rancor revolt It is a Polish quality and is in the Celtic peoples Oppressed nations with a tendency to mad lyrism develop this mental secretion of the spleen Liszt writes that the Zal colors with a reflection now argent now ardent the whole of Chopin s works This sorrow is the very soil of Chopin s nature He so confessed when questioned by Comtesse d Agoult Liszt further explains that the strange word includes in its meanings for it seems packed with them all the tenderness all the humility of a regret borne with resignation and without a murmur it also signifies excitement agitation rancor revolt full of reproach premeditated vengeance menace never ceasing to threaten if retaliation should ever become possible feeding itself meanwhile with a bitter if sterile hatred Sterile indeed must be such a consuming passion Even where his patriotism became a lyric cry this Zal tainted the source of Chopin s joy It made him irascible and with his powers of repression this smouldering smothered rage must have well nigh suffocated him and in the end proved harmful alike to his person and to his art As in certain phases of disease it heightened the beauty of his later work unhealthy feverish yet beauty without doubt The pearl is said to be a morbid secretion so the spiritual ferment called Zal gave to Chopin s music its morbid beauty It is in the B minor Scherzo but not in the A flat Ballade The F minor Ballade overflows with it and so does the F sharp minor Polonaise but not the first Impromptu Its dark introspection colors many of the preludes and mazurkas and in the C sharp minor Scherzo it is in acrid flowering truly fleurs du mal Heine and Baudelaire two poets far removed from the Slavic show traces of the terrible drowsy Zal in their poetry It is the collective sorrow and tribal wrath of a down trodden nation and the mazurkas for that reason have ethnic value As concise even as curt as the Preludes they are for the most part highly polished They are dancing preludes and often tiny single poems of great poetic intensity and passionate plaint Chopin published during his lifetime forty one Mazurkas in eleven cahiers of three four and five numbers Op six four Mazurkas and op seven five Mazurkas were published December eighteen thirty two Op six is dedicated to Comtesse Pauline Plater op seven to mister Johns Op seventeen four Mazurkas May four dedicated to Madame Lina Freppa op twenty four four Mazurkas November eighteen thirty five dedicated to Comte de Perthuis op thirty four Mazurkas December eighteen thirty seven dedicated to Princesse Czartoryska op thirty three four Mazurkas October eighteen thirty eight dedicated to Comtesse Mostowska op forty one four Mazurkas December eighteen forty dedicated to E Witwicki op fifty three Mazurkas November eighteen forty one dedicated to Leon Szmitkowski op fifty six three Mazurkas August eighteen forty four dedicated to Mile C Maberly op fifty nine three Mazurkas April eighteen forty six no dedication and op sixty three three Mazurkas September eighteen forty seven dedicated to Comtesse Czosnowska Besides there are op sixty seven and sixty eight published by Fontana after Chopin s death consisting of eight Mazurkas and there are a miscellaneous number two in A minor both in the Kullak Klindworth and Mikuli editions one in F sharp major said to be written by Charles Mayer in Klindworth s and four others in G B flat D and C major This makes in all fifty six to be grouped and analyzed Niecks thinks there is a well defined difference between the Mazurkas as far as op forty one and those that follow In the latter he misses savage beauties and spontaneity As Chopin gripped the form as he felt more suffered more and knew more his Mazurkas grew broader revealed more Weltschmerz became elaborate and at times impersonal but seldom lost the racial snap and hue They are sonnets in their well rounded mecanisme and as Schumann says something new is to be found in each Toward the last a few are blithe and jocund but they are the exceptions In the larger ones the universal quality is felt but to the detriment of the intimate Polish characteristics These Mazurkas are just what they are called only some dance with the heart others with the heels Comprising a large and original portion of Chopin s compositions they are the least known Perhaps when they wander from the map of Poland they lose some of their native fragrance Like hardy simple wild flowers they are mostly for the open air the only out of doors music Chopin ever made But even in the open under the moon the note of self torture of sophisticated sadness is not absent Do not accuse Chopin for this is the sign manual of his race The Pole suffers in song the joy of his sorrow II The F sharp minor Mazurka of op six begins with the characteristic triplet that plays such a role in the dance Here we find a Chopin fuller fledged than in the nocturnes and variations and probably because of the form This Mazurka first in publication is melodious slightly mournful but of a delightful freshness The third section with the appoggiaturas realizes a vivid vision of country couples dancing determinedly Who plays No two of this set It too has the native wood note wild with its dominant pedal bass its slight twang and its sweet sad melody in C sharp minor There is hearty delight in the major and how natural it seems No three in E is still on the village green and the boys and girls are romping in the dance We hear a drone bass a favorite device of Chopin and the chatter of the gossips the bustle of a rural festival The harmonization is rich the rhythmic life vital But in the following one in E flat minor a different note is sounded Its harmonies are closer and there is sorrow abroad The incessant circling around one idea as if obsessed by fixed grief is used here for the first but not for the last time by the composer Opus seven drew attention to Chopin It was the set that brought down the thunders of Rellstab who wrote If mister Chopin had shown this composition to a master the latter would it is to be hoped have torn it and thrown it at his feet which we hereby do symbolically Criticism had its amenities in eighteen thirty three In a later number of The Iris in which a caustic notice appeared of the studies op ten Rellstab printed a letter signed Chopin the authenticity of which is extremely doubtful In it Chopin is made to call the critic really a very bad man Niecks demonstrates that the Polish pianist was not the writer It reads like the effusion of some indignant well meaning female friend The B flat major Mazurka which opens op seven is the best known of these dances There is an expansive swing a laissez aller to this piece with its air of elegance that are very alluring The rubato flourishes and at the close we hear the footing of the peasant A jolly reckless composition that makes one happy to be alive and dancing The next which begins in A minor is as if one danced upon one s grave a change to major does not deceive it is too heavy hearted No three in F minor with its rhythmic pronouncement at the start brings us back to earth The triplet that sets off the phrase has great significance Guitar like is the bass in its snapping resolution The section that begins on the dominant of D flat is full of vigor and imagination the left hand is given a solo This Mazurka has the true ring The following one in A flat is a sequence of moods Its assertiveness soon melts into tenderer hues and in an episode in A we find much to ponder No five in C consists of three lines It is a sort of coda to the opus and full of the echoes of lusty happiness A silhouette with a marked profile Opus seventeen No one in B flat is bold chivalric and I fancy I hear the swish of the warrior s sabre The peasant has vanished or else gapes through the open window while his master goes through the paces of a courtlier dance We encounter sequential chords of the seventh and their use rhythmically framed as they are gives a line of sternness to the dance Niecks thinks that the second Mazurka might be called The Request so pathetic playful and persuasive is it It is in E minor and has a plaintive appealing quality The G major part is very pretty In the last lines the passion mounts but is never shrill Kullak notes that in the fifth and sixth bars there is no slur in certain editions Klindworth employs it but marks the B sforzando A slur on two notes of the same pitch with Chopin does not always mean a tie The A flat Mazurka No three is pessimistic threatening and irritable Though in the key of E major the trio displays a relentless sort of humor The return does not mend matters A dark page In A minor the fourth is called by Szulc the Little Jew Szulc who wrote anecdotes of Chopin and collected them with the title of Fryderyk Szopen told the story to Kleczynski It is this Chopin did not care for programme music though more than one of his compositions full of expression and character may be included under that name Who does not know the A minor Mazurka of op seventeen dedicated to Lena Freppa Itwas already known in our country as the Little Jew before the departure of our artist abroad It is one of the works of Chopin which are characterized by distinct humor A Jew in slippers and a long robe comes out of his inn and seeing an unfortunate peasant his customer intoxicated tumbling about the road and uttering complaints exclaims from his threshold What is this Then as if by way of contrast to this scene the gay wedding party of a rich burgess comes along on its way from church with shouts of various kinds accompanied in a lively manner by violins and bagpipes The train passes by the tipsy peasant renews his complaints the complaints of a man who had tried to drown his misery in the glass The Jew returns indoors shaking his head and again asking What was this The story strikes one as being both childish and commonplace The Mazurka is rather doleful and there is a little triplet of interrogation standing sentinel at the fourth bar It is also the last phrase But what of that I too can build you a programme as lofty or lowly as you please but it will not be Chopin s Niecks for example finds this very dance bleak and joyless of intimate emotional experience and with jarring tones that strike in and pitilessly wake the dreamer So there is no predicating the content of music except in a general way the mood key may be struck but in Chopin s case this is by no means infallible If I write with confidence it is that begot of desperation for I know full well that my version of the story will not be yours The A minor Mazurka for me is full of hectic despair whatever that may mean and its serpentining chromatics and apparently suspended close on the chord of the sixth gives an impression of morbid irresolution modulating into a sort of desperate gayety Its tonality accounts for the moods evoked being indeterminate and restless Opus twenty four begins with the G minor Mazurka a favorite because of its comparative freedom from technical difficulties Although in the minor mode there is mental strength in the piece with its exotic scale of the augmented second and its trio is hearty In the next in C we find besides the curious content a mixture of tonalities Lydian and mediaeval church modes Here the trio is occidental The entire piece leaves a vague impression of discontent and the refrain recalls the Russian bargemen s songs utilized at various times by Tschaikowsky Klindworth uses variants There is also some editorial differences in the metronomic markings Mikuli being according to Kullak too slow Mention has not been made as in the studies and preludes of the tempi of the Mazurkas These compositions are so capricious so varied that Chopin I am sure did not play any one of them twice alike They are creatures of moods melodic air plants swinging to the rhythms of any vagrant breeze The metronome is for the student but metronome and rubato are as de Lenz would have said mutually exclusive The third Mazurka of op twenty four is in A flat It is pleasing not deep a real dance with an ornamental coda But the next Ah here is a gem a beautiful and exquisitely colored poem In B flat minor it sends out prehensile filaments that entwine and draw us into the centre of a wondrous melody laden with rich odors odors that almost intoxicate The figuration is tropical and when the major is reached and those glancing thirty seconds so coyly assail us we realize the seductive charm of Chopin The reprise is still more festooned and it is almost a relief when the little tender unison begins with its positive chord assertions closing the period Then follows a fascinating cadenced step with lights and shades sweet melancholy driving before it joy and being routed itself until the annunciation of the first theme and the dying away of the dance dancers and the solid globe itself as if earth had committed suicide for loss of the sun The last two bars could have been written only by Chopin They are ineffable sighs And now the chorus of praise begins to mount in burning octaves The C minor Mazurka op thirty is another of those wonderful heartfelt melodies of the master What can I say of the deepening feeling at the con anima It stabs with its pathos Here is the poet Chopin the poet who with Burns interprets the simple strains of the folk who blinds us with color and rich romanticism like Keats and lifts us Shelley wise to transcendental azure And his only apparatus a keyboard As Schumann wrote Chopin did not make his appearance by an orchestral army as a great genius is accustomed to do he only possesses a small cohort but every soul belongs to him to the last hero Eight lines is this dance yet its meanings are almost endless No two in B minor is called The Cuckoo by Kleczynski It is sprightly and with the lilt notwithstanding its subtle progressions of Mazovia No three in D flat is all animation brightness and a determination to stay out the dance The alternate major minor of the theme is truly Polish The graceful trio and canorous brilliancy of this dance make it a favored number The ending is epigrammatic It comes so suddenly upon us our cortical cells pealing with the minor that its very abruptness is witty One can see Chopin making a mocking moue as he wrote it Tschaikowsky borrowed the effect for the conclusion of the Chinoise in a miniature orchestral suite The fourth of this opus is in C sharp minor Again I feel like letting loose the dogs of enthusiasm The sharp rhythms and solid build of this ample work give it a massive character It is one of the big Mazurkas and the ending raw as it is consecutive bare faced fifths and sevenths compasses its intended meaning Opus thirty three is a popular set It begins with one in G sharp minor which is curt and rather depressing The relief in B major is less real than it seems on paper Moody withal a tender hearted Mazurka No two in D is bustling graceful and full of unrestrained vitality Bright and not particularly profound it was successfully arranged for voice by Viardot Garcia The third of the opus in C is the one described by de Lenz as almost precipitating a violent row between Chopin and Meyerbeer He had christened it the Epitaph of the Idea Two four said Meyerbeer after de Lenz played it Three four answered Chopin flushing angrily Let me have it for a ballet in my new opera and I ll show you retorted Meyerbeer It s three four scolded Chopin and played it himself De Lenz says they parted coolly each holding to his opinion Later in saint Petersburg Meyerbeer met this gossip and told him that he loved Chopin I know no pianist no composer for the piano like him Meyerbeer was wrong in his idea of the tempo Though Chopin slurs the last beat it is there nevertheless This Mazurka is only four lines long and is charming as charming as the brief specimen in the Preludes The next Mazurka is another famous warhorse In B minor it is full of veiled coquetries hazardous mood transitions growling recitatives and smothered plaints The continual return to the theme gives rise to all manner of fanciful programmes One of the most characteristic is by the Polish poet Zelenski who so Kleczynski relates wrote a humorous poem on this mazurka For him it is a domestic comedy in which a drunken peasant and his much abused wife enact a little scene Returning home the worse for wear he sings Oj ta dana Oh dear me and rumbles in the bass in a figure that answers the treble His wife reproaching him he strikes her Here we are in B flat She laments her fate in B major Then her husband shouts Be quiet old vixen This is given in the octaves a genuine dialogue the wife tartly answering Shan t be quiet The gruff grumbling in the bass is heard an imitation of the above when suddenly the man cries out the last eight bars of the composition Kitty Kitty come do come here I forgive you which is decidedly masculine in its magnanimity If one does not care for the rather coarse realism of this reading Kleczynski offers the poem of Ujejeski called The Dragoon A soldier flatters a girl at the inn She flies from him and her lover believing she has deceived him despairingly drowns himself The ending with its Ring ring ring the bell there Horses carry me to the depths has more poetic contour than the other Without grafting any libretto on it this Mazurka is a beautiful tone piece in itself Its theme is delicately mournful and the subject in B major simply entrancing in its broad flowing melody In C sharp minor op forty one is a Mazurka that is beloved of me Its scale is exotic its rhythm convincing its tune a little saddened by life but courage never fails This theme sounds persistently in the middle voices in the bass and at the close in full harmonies unisons giving it a startling effect Octaves take it up in profile until it vanishes Here is the very apotheosis of rhythm No two in E minor is not very resolute of heart It was composed so Niecks avers at Palma when Chopin s health fully accounts for the depressed character of the piece for it is sad to the point of tears Of op forty one he wrote to Fontana from Nohant in eighteen thirty nine You know I have four new Mazurkas one from Palma in E minor three from here in B major A flat major and C sharp minor They seem to me pretty as the youngest children usually do when the parents grow old No three is a vigorous sonorous dance No four over which the editors deviate on the serious matter of text in A flat is for the concert room and is allied to several of his gracious Valses Playful and decorative but not profound in feeling Opus fifty the first in G major is healthy and vivacious Good humor predominates Kullak notes that in some editions it closes pianissimo which seems a little out of drawing No two is charming In A flat it is a perfect specimen of the aristocratic Mazurka The D flat Trio the answering episode in B flat minor and the grace of the return make this one to be studied and treasured De Lenz finds Bach ian influences in the following in C sharp minor It begins as though written for the organ and ends in an exclusive salon it does him credit and is worked out more fully than the others Chopin was much pleased when I told him that in the construction of this Mazurka the passage from E major to F major was the same as that in the Agatha aria in Freischutz De Lenz refers to the opening Bach like mutations The texture of this dance is closer and finer spun than any we have encountered Perhaps spontaneity is impaired mais que voulez vous Chopin was bound to develop and his Mazurkas fragile and constricted as is the form were sure to show a like record of spiritual and intellectual growth Opus fifty six in B major is elaborate even in its beginning There is decoration in the ritornelle in E flat and one feels the absence of a compensating emotion despite the display of contrapuntal skill Very virtuoso like but not so intimate as some of the others Karasowski selects No two in C as an illustration It is as though the composer had sought for the moment to divert himself with narcotic intoxication only to fall back the more deeply into his original gloom There is the peasant in the first bars in C but the A minor and what follows soon disturb the air of bonhomie Theoretical ease is in the imitative passages Chopin is now master of his tools The third Mazurka of op fifty six is in C minor It is quite long and does not give the impression of a whole With the exception of a short break in B major it is composed with the head not the heart nor yet the heels Not unlike in its sturdy affirmation the one in C sharp minor op forty one is the next Mazurka in A minor op fifty nine That Chopin did not repeat himself is an artistic miracle A subtle turn takes us off the familiar road to some strange glade wherein the flowers are rare in scent and odor This Mazurka like the one that follows has a dim resemblance to others yet there is always a novel point of departure a fresh harmony a sudden melody or an unexpected ending Hadow for example thinks the A flat of this opus the most beautiful of them all In it he finds legitimately used the repetition in various shapes of a single phrase To me this Mazurka seems but an amplification an elaboration of the lovely one in the same key op fifty No two The double sixths and more complicated phraseology do not render the later superior to the early Mazurka yet there is no gainsaying the fact that this is a noble composition But the next in F sharp minor despite its rather saturnine gaze is stronger in interest if not in workmanship While it lacks Niecks beautes sauvages is it not far loftier in conception and execution than op six in F sharp minor The inevitable triplet appears in the third bar and is a hero throughout Oh here is charm for you Read the close of the section in F sharp major In the major it ends the triplet fading away at last a mere shadow a turn on D sharp but victor to the last Chopin is at the summit of his invention Time and tune that wait for no man are now his bond slaves Pathos delicacy boldness a measured melancholy and the art of euphonious presentiment of all these and many factors more stamp this Mazurka a masterpiece Niecks believes there is a return of the early freshness and poetry in the last three Mazurkas op sixty three They are indeed teeming with interesting matter he writes Looked at from the musician s point of view how much do we not see novel and strange beautiful and fascinating withal Sharp dissonances chromatic passing notes suspensions and anticipations displacement of accent progressions of perfect fifths the horror of schoolmen sudden turns and unexpected digressions that are so unaccountable so out of the line of logical sequence that one s following the composer is beset with difficulties But all this is a means to an end the expression of an individuality with its intimate experiences The emotional content of many of these trifles trifles if considered only by their size is really stupendous Spoken like a brave man and not a pedant Full of vitality is the first number of op sixty three In B major it is sufficiently various in figuration and rhythmical life to single it from its fellows The next in F minor has a more elegiac ring Brief and not difficult of matter or manner is this dance The third of winning beauty is in C sharp minor surely a pendant to the C sharp minor Valse I defy anyone to withstand the pleading eloquent voice of this Mazurka Slender in technical configuration yet it impressed Louis Ehlert so much that he was impelled to write A more perfect canon in the octave could not have been written by one who had grown gray in the learned arts The four Mazurkas published posthumously in eighteen fifty five that comprise op sixty seven were composed by Chopin at various dates To the first in G Klindworth affixes eighteen forty nine as the year of composition Niecks gives a much earlier date eighteen thirty five I fancy the latter is correct as the piece sounds like one of Chopin s more youthful efforts It is jolly and rather superficial The next in G minor is familiar It is very pretty and its date is set down by Niecks as eighteen forty nine while Klindworth gives eighteen thirty five Here again Niecks is correct although I suspect that Klindworth transposed his figures accidentally No three in C was composed in eighteen thirty five On this both biographer and editor agree It is certainly an early effusion of no great value although a good dancing tune No four A minor of this opus composed in eighteen forty six is more mature but in no wise remarkable Opus sixty eight the second of the Fontana set was composed in eighteen thirty The first in C is commonplace the one in A minor composed in eighteen twenty seven is much better being lighter and well made the third in F major eighteen thirty weak and trivial and the fourth in F minor eighteen forty nine interesting because it is said by Julius Fontana to be Chopin s last composition He put it on paper a short time before his death but was too ill to try it at the piano It is certainly morbid in its sick insistence in phrase repetition close harmonies and wild departure in A from the first figure But it completes the gloomy and sardonic loop and we wish after playing this veritable song of the tomb that we had parted from Chopin in health not disease This page is full of the premonitions of decay Too weak and faltering to be febrile Chopin is here a debile prematurely exhausted young man There are a few accents of a forced gayety but they are swallowed up in the mists of dissolution the dissolution of one of the most sensitive brains ever wrought by nature Here we may echo without any savor of Liszt s condescension or de Lenz s irony Pauvre Frederic Klindworth and Kullak have different ideas concerning the end of this Mazurka Both are correct Kullak Klindworth and Mikuli include in their editions two Mazurkas in A minor Neither is impressive One the date of composition unknown is dedicated a son ami Emile Gaillard the other first appeared in a musical publication of Schotts about eighteen forty two or eighteen forty three according to Niecks Of this set I prefer the former it abounds in octaves and ends with a long trill There is in the Klindworth edition a Mazurka the last in the set in the key of F sharp It is so un Chopinish and artificial that the doubts of the pianist Ernst Pauer were aroused as to its authenticity On inquiry Niecks quotes from the London monthly Musical Record July one eighteen eighty two Pauer discovered that the piece was identical with a Mazurka by Charles Mayer Gotthard being the publisher of the alleged Chopin Mazurka declared he bought the manuscript from a Polish countess possibly one of the fifty in whose arms Chopin died and that the lady parted with Chopin s autograph because of her dire poverty It is of course a clear case of forgery Of the four early Mazurkas in G major and B flat major dating from eighteen twenty five D major composed in eighteen twenty nine thirty but remodelled in eighteen thirty two and C major of eighteen thirty three the latter is the most characteristic The G major is of slight worth As Niecks remarks it contains a harmonic error The one in B flat starts out with a phrase that recalls the A minor Mazurka numbered forty five in the Breitkopf Hartel edition This B flat Mazurka early as it was composed is nevertheless pretty There are breadth and decision in the C major Mazurka The recasting improves the D major Mazurka Its trio is lifted an octave and the doubling of notes throughout gives more weight and richness In the minor key laughs and cries dances and mourns the Slav says doctor J Schucht in his monograph on Chopin Chopin here reveals not only his nationality but his own fascinating and enigmatic individuality Within the tremulous spaces of this immature dance is enacted the play of a human soul a soul that voices the sorrow and revolt of a dying race of a dying poet They are epigrammatic fluctuating crazy and tender these Mazurkas and some of them have a soft melancholy light as if shining through alabaster true corpse light leading to a morass of doubt and terror But a fantastic dishevelled debonair spirit is the guide and to him we abandon ourselves in these precise and vertiginous dances XIV CHOPIN THE CONQUEROR The Scherzi of Chopin are of his own creation the type as illustrated by Beethoven and Mendelssohn had no meaning for him Whether in earnest or serious jest Chopin pitched on a title that is widely misleading when the content is considered The Beethoven Scherzo is full of a robust sort of humor In it he is seldom poetical frequently given to gossip and at times he hints at the mystery of life The demoniacal element the fierce jollity that mocks itself the almost titanic anger of Chopin would not have been regarded by the composer of the Eroica Symphony as adapted to the form The Pole practically built up a new musical structure boldly called it a Scherzo and as in the case of the Ballades poured into its elastic mould most disturbing and incomparable music Chopin seldom compasses sublimity His arrows are tipped with fire yet they do not fly far But in some of his music he skirts the regions where abide the gods In at least one Scherzo in one Ballade in the F minor Fantaisie in the first two movements of the B flat minor Sonata in several of the Eludes and in one of the Preludes he compasses grandeur Individuality of utterance beauty of utterance and the eloquence we call divine are his criticism then bows its questioning brows before this anointed one In the Scherzi Chopin is often prophet as well as poet He fumes and frets but upon his countenance is the precious fury of the sibyls We see the soul that suffers from secret convulsions but forgive the writhing for the music made These four Scherzi are psychical records confessions committed to paper of outpourings that never could have passed the lips From these alone we may almost reconstruct the real Chopin the inner Chopin whose conventional exterior so ill prepared the world for the tragic issues of his music The first Scherzo is a fair model There are a few bars of introduction the porch as Niecks would call it a principal subject a trio a short working out section a skilful return to the opening theme and an elaborate coda This edifice not architecturally flawless is better adapted to the florid beauties of Byzantine treatment than to the severe Hellenic line Yet Chopin gave it dignity largeness and a classic massiveness The interior is romantic is modern personal but the facade shows gleaming minarets the strangely builded shapes of the Orient This B minor Scherzo has the acid note of sorrow and revolt yet the complex figuration never wavers The walls stand firm despite the hurricane blowing through and around them Ehlert finds this Scherzo tornadic It is gusty and the hurry and over emphasis do not endear it to the pianist The first pages are filled with wrathful sounds there is much tossing of hands and cries to heaven calling down its fire and brimstone A climax mounts to a fine frenzy until the lyric intermezzo in B is reached Here love chants with honeyed tongues The widely dispersed figure of the melody has an entrancing tenderness But peace does not long prevail against the powers of Eblis and infernal is the Wilde Jagd of the finale After shrillest of dissonances a chromatic uproar pilots the doomed one across this desperate Styx What Chopin s programme was we can but guess He may have outlined the composition in a moment of great ebullition a time of soul laceration arising from a cat scratch or a quarrel with Maurice Sand in the garden over the possession of the goat cart The Klindworth edition is preferable Kullak follows his example in using the double note stems in the B major part He gives the A sharp in the bass six bars before the return of the first motif Klindworth and other editions prescribe A natural which is not so effective This Scherzo might profit by being played without the repeats The chromatic interlocked octaves at the close are very striking I find at times as my mood changes something almost repellant in the B minor Scherzo It does not present the frank physiognomy of the second Scherzo op thirty one in B flat minor Ehlert cries that it was composed in a blessed hour although de Lenz quotes Chopin as saying of the opening It must be a charnel house The defiant challenge of the beginning has no savor of the scorn and drastic mockery of its fore runner We are conscious that tragedy impends that after the prologue may follow fast catastrophe Yet it is not feared with all the portentous thunder of its index Nor are we deceived A melody of winning distinction unrolls before us It has a noble tone is of a noble type Without relaxing pace it passes and drops like a thunderbolt into the bowels of the earth Again the story is told and tarrying not at all we are led to a most delectable spot in the key of A major This trio is marked by genius Can anything be more bewitching than the episode in C sharp minor merging into E major with the overflow at the close The fantasy is notable for variety of tonality freedom in rhythmical incidents and genuine power The coda is dizzy and overwhelming For Schumann this Scherzo is Byronic in tenderness and boldness Karasowski speaks of its Shakespearian humor and indeed it is a very human and lovable piece of art It holds richer warmer redder blood than the other three and like the A flat Ballade is beloved of the public But then it is easier to understand Opus thirty nine the third Scherzo in C sharp minor was composed or finished at Majorca and is the most dramatic of the set I confess to see no littleness in the polished phrases though irony lurks in its bars and there is fever in its glance a glance full of enigmatic and luring scorn I heartily agree with Hadow who finds the work clear cut and of exact balance And noting that Chopin founded whole paragraphs either on a single phrase repeated in similar shapes or on two phrases in alternation a primitive practice in Polish folksongs he asserts that Beethoven does not attain the lucidity of his style by such parallelism of phraseology but admits that Chopin s methods made for clearness and precision may be regarded as characteristic of the national manner A thoroughly personal characteristic too There is virile clangor in the firmly struck octaves of the opening pages No hesitating morbid view of life but rank harsh assertiveness not untinged with splenetic anger The chorale of the trio is admirably devised and carried out Its piety is a bit of liturgical make believe The contrasts here are most artistic sonorous harmonies set off by broken chords that deliciously tinkle There is a coda of frenetic movement and the end is in major a surprising conclusion when considering all that has gone before Never to become the property of the profane the C sharp minor Scherzo notwithstanding its marked asperities and agitated moments is a great work of art Without the inner freedom of its predecessor it is more sober and self contained than the B minor Scherzo The fourth Scherzo op fifty four is in the key of E Built up by a series of cunning touches and climaxes and without the mood depth or variety of its brethren it is more truly a Scherzo than any of them It has tripping lightness and there is sunshine imprisoned behind its open bars Of it Schumann could not ask How is gravity to clothe itself if jest goes about in dark veils Here then is intellectual refinement and jesting of a superior sort Niecks thinks it fragmentary I find the fairy like measures delightful after the doleful mutterings of some of the other Scherzi There is the same spirit of opposition but of arrogance none The C sharp minor theme is of lyric beauty the coda with its scales brilliant It seems to be banned by classicists and Chopin worshippers alike The agnostic attitude is not yet dead in the piano playing world Rubinstein most admired the first two Scherzi The B minor has been criticised for being too much in the etude vein But with all their shortcomings these compositions are without peer in the literature of the piano They were published and dedicated as follows Op twenty February eighteen thirty five to M T Albrecht op thirty one December eighteen thirty seven Comtesse de Furstenstein op thirty nine October eighteen forty Adolph Gutmann and op fifty four December eighteen forty three Mile de Caraman De Lenz relates that Chopin dedicated the C sharp minor Scherzo to his pupil Gutmann because this giant with a prize fighter s fist could knock a hole in the table with a certain chord for the left hand sixth measure from the beginning and adds quite naively Nothing more was ever heard of this Gutmann he was a discovery of Chopin s Chopin died in this same Gutmann s arms and despite de Lenz Gutmann was in evidence until his death as a favorite pupil And now we have reached the grandest oh banal and abused word of Chopin s compositions the Fantaisie in F minor op forty nine Robert Schumann after remarking that the cosmopolitan must sacrifice the small interests of the soil on which he was born notices that Chopin s later works begin to lose something of their especial Sarmatian physiognomy to approach partly more nearly the universal ideal cultivated by the divine Greeks which we find again in Mozart The F minor Fantaisie has hardly the Mozartian serenity but parades a formal beauty not disfigured by an excess of violence either personal or patriotic and its melodies if restless by melancholy are of surprising nobility and dramatic grandeur Without including the Beethoven Sonatas not strictly born of the instrument I do not fear to maintain that this Fantaisie is one of the greatest of piano pieces Never properly appreciated by pianists critics or public it is after more than a half century of neglect being understood at last It was published November eighteen forty three and probably composed at Nohant as a letter of the composer indicates The dedication is to Princesse C de Souzzo these interminable countesses and princesses of Chopin For Niecks who could not at first discern its worth it suggests a Titan in commotion It is Titanic the torso of some Faust like dream it is Chopin s Faust A macabre march containing some dangerous dissonances gravely ushers us to ascending staircases of triplets only to precipitate us to the very abysses of the piano That first subject is it not almost as ethically puissant and passionate as Beethoven in his F minor Sonata Chopin s lack of tenaciousness is visible here Beethoven would have built a cathedral on such a foundational scheme but Chopin ever prodigal in his melody making dashes impetuously to the A flat episode that heroic love chant erroneously marked dolce and played with the effeminacies of a salon Three times does it resound in this strange Hall of Glancing Mirrors yet not once should it be caressed The bronze fingers of a Tausig are needed Now are arching the triplets to the great thrilling song beginning in C minor and then the octaves in contrary motion split wide asunder the very earth After terrific chordal reverberations there is the rapid retreat of vague armies and once again is begun the ascent of the rolling triplets to inaccessible heights and the first theme sounds in C minor The modulation lifts to G flat only to drop to abysmal depths What mighty desperate cause is being espoused When peace is presaged in the key of B is this the prize for which strive these agonized hosts Is some forlorn princess locked behind these solemn inaccessible bars For a few moments there is contentment beyond all price Then the warring tribe of triplets recommence after clamorous G flat octaves reeling from the stars to the sea of the first theme Another rush into D flat ensues the song of C minor reappears in F minor and the miracle is repeated Oracular octaves quake the cellarage of the palace the warriors hurry by their measured tramp is audible after they vanish and the triplets obscure their retreat with chromatic vapors Then an adagio in this fantastic old world tale the curtain prepares to descend a faint sweet voice sings a short appealing cadenza and after billowing A flat arpeggios soft great hummocks of tone two giant chords are sounded and the Ballade of Love and War is over Who conquers Is the Lady with the Green Eyes and Moon White Face rescued Or is all this a De Quincey s Dream Fugue translated into tone a sonorous awesome vision Like De Quincey it suggests the apparition of the empire of fear the fear that is secretly felt with dreams wherein the spirit expands to the drummings of infinite space Alas for the validity of subjective criticism Franz Liszt told Vladimir de Pachmann the programme of the Fantaisie as related to him by Chopin At the close of one desperate immemorial day the pianist was crooning at the piano his spirits vastly depressed Suddenly came a knocking at his door a Poe like sinister tapping which he at once rhythmically echoed upon the keyboard his phono motor centre being unusually sensitive The first two bars of the Fantaisie describe these rappings just as the third and fourth stand for Chopin s musical invitation entrez entrez This is all repeated until the doors wide open swinging admit Liszt George Sand Madame Camille Pleyel nee Mock and others To the solemn measures of the march they enter and range themselves about Chopin who after the agitated triplets begins his complaint in the mysterious song in F minor But Sand with whom he has quarrelled falls before him on her knees and pleads for pardon Straightway the chant merges into the appealing A flat section this sends skyward my theory of its interpretation and from C minor the current becomes more tempestuous until the climax is reached and to the second march the intruders rapidly vanish The remainder of the work with the exception of the Lento Sostenuto in B where it is to be hoped Chopin s perturbed soul finds momentary peace is largely repetition and development This far from ideal reading is an authoritative one coming as it does from Chopin by way of Liszt I console myself for its rather commonplace character with the notion that perhaps in the re telling the story has caught some personal cadenzas of the two historians In any case I shall cling to my own version The F minor Fantaisie will mean many things to many people Chopin has never before maintained so artistically so free from delirium such a level of strong passion mental power and exalted euphony It is his largest canvas and though there are no long breathed periods such as in the B flat minor Scherzo the phraseology is amply broad without padding of paragraphs The rapt interest is not relaxed until the final bar This transcendental work more nearly approaches Beethoven in its unity its formal rectitude and its brave economy of thematic material While few men have dared to unlock their hearts thus Chopin is not so intimate here as in the mazurkas But the pulse beats ardently in the tissues of this composition As art for art it is less perfect the gain is on the human side Nearing his end Chopin discerned with ever widening ever brighter vision the great heart throb of the universe Master of his material if not of his mortal tenement he passionately strove to shape his dreams into abiding sounds He did not always succeed but his victories are the precious prizes of mankind One is loath to believe that the echo of Chopin s magic music can ever fall upon unheeding ears He may become old fashioned but like Mozart he will remain eternally beautiful BIBLIOGRAPHY Frederic Chopin as a Man and Musician by Frederick Niecks London Novello Ewer company Frederic Chopin

you know that Iconoclasts is the only book of high and universal critical worth that we have had for years to be precise since Georg Brandes It is at once strong and fine supple and firm indulgent and sure The Evening Post of June ten nineteen fifteen wrote of mister Huneker s The New Cosmopolis The region of Bohemia mister James Huneker found long ago is within us At twenty he says he discovered that there is no such enchanted spot as the Latin Quarter but that every generation sets back the mythical land into the golden age of the Commune or of eighteen forty eight or the days of Hernani It is the same with New York s East Side the fabulous East Side as mister Huneker calls it in his collection of international urban studies The New Cosmopolis If one judged externals by grime by poverty by sanded back rooms with long haired visionaries assailing the social order then the East Side of the early eighties has gone down before the mad rush of settlement workers impertinent reformers sociological cranks self advertising politicians billionaire socialists and the reporters To day the sentimental traveller feels a heart pang to see the order the cleanliness the wide streets the playgrounds the big boulevards the absence of indigence that have spoiled the most interesting part of New York City But apparently this is only a first impression for mister Huneker had no trouble in discovering in one cafe a patriarchal figure quite of the type beloved of the local color hunters of twenty years ago a prophet though speaking a modern language and concerned with things of the day So that we owe to mister Huneker the discovery of a notable truth namely that Bohemia is not only a creation of the sentimental memory but being psychological may be located in clean and prosperous quarters The tendency has always been to place it in a golden age but a tattered and unswept age Bohemia is now shown to exist amidst model tenements and sanitary drinking cups IVORY APES AND PEACOCKS
