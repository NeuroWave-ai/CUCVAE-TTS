none	none	 IYA THE CAMP EATER MANSTIN THE RABBIT THE WARLIKE SEVEN OLD INDIAN LEGENDS IKTOMI AND THE DUCKS IKTOMI is a spider fairy He wears brown deerskin leggins with long soft fringes on either side and tiny beaded moccasins on his feet His long black hair is parted in the middle and wrapped with red red bands Each round braid hangs over a small brown ear and falls forward over his shoulders He even paints his funny face with red and yellow and draws big black rings around his eyes He wears a deerskin jacket with bright colored beads sewed tightly on it Iktomi dresses like a real Dakota brave In truth his paint and deerskins are the best part of him if ever dress is part of man or fairy Iktomi is a wily fellow His hands are always kept in mischief He prefers to spread a snare rather than to earn the smallest thing with honest hunting Why he laughs outright with wide open mouth when some simple folk are caught in a trap sure and fast He never dreams another lives so bright as he Often his own conceit leads him hard against the common sense of simpler people Poor Iktomi cannot help being a little imp And so long as he is a naughty fairy he cannot find a single friend No one helps him when he is in trouble No one really loves him Those who come to admire his handsome beaded jacket and long fringed leggins soon go away sick and tired of his vain vain words and heartless laughter Thus Iktomi lives alone in a cone shaped wigwam upon the plain One day he sat hungry within his teepee Suddenly he rushed out dragging after him his blanket Quickly spreading it on the ground he tore up dry tall grass with both his hands and tossed it fast into the blanket Tying all the four corners together in a knot he threw the light bundle of grass over his shoulder Snatching up a slender willow stick with his free left hand he started off with a hop and a leap From side to side bounced the bundle on his back as he ran light footed over the uneven ground Soon he came to the edge of the great level land On the hilltop he paused for breath With wicked smacks of his dry parched lips as if tasting some tender meat he looked straight into space toward the marshy river bottom With a thin palm shading his eyes from the western sun he peered far away into the lowlands munching his own cheeks all the while Ah ha grunted he satisfied with what he saw A group of wild ducks were dancing and feasting in the marshes With wings outspread tip to tip they moved up and down in a large circle Within the ring around a small drum sat the chosen singers nodding their heads and blinking their eyes They sang in unison a merry dance song and beat a lively tattoo on the drum Following a winding footpath near by came a bent figure of a Dakota brave He bore on his back a very large bundle With a willow cane he propped himself up as he staggered along beneath his burden Ho who is there called out a curious old duck still bobbing up and down in the circular dance Hereupon the drummers stretched their necks till they strangled their song for a look at the stranger passing by Ho Iktomi Old fellow pray tell us what you carry in your blanket Do not hurry off Stop halt urged one of the singers Stop stay Show us what is in your blanket cried out other voices My friends I must not spoil your dance Oh you would not care to see if you only knew what is in my blanket Sing on dance on I must not show you what I carry on my back answered Iktomi nudging his own sides with his elbows This reply broke up the ring entirely Now all the ducks crowded about Iktomi We must see what you carry We must know what is in your blanket they shouted in both his ears Some even brushed their wings against the mysterious bundle Nudging himself again wily Iktomi said My friends t is only a pack of songs I carry in my blanket Oh then let us hear your songs cried the curious ducks At length Iktomi consented to sing his songs With delight all the ducks flapped their wings and cried together Hoye hoye Iktomi with great care laid down his bundle on the ground I will build first a round straw house for I never sing my songs in the open air said he Quickly he bent green willow sticks planting both ends of each pole into the earth These he covered thick with reeds and grasses Soon the straw hut was ready One by one the fat ducks waddled in through a small opening which was the only entrance way Beside the door Iktomi stood smiling as the ducks eyeing his bundle of songs strutted into the hut In a strange low voice Iktomi began his queer old tunes All the ducks sat round eyed in a circle about the mysterious singer It was dim in that straw hut for Iktomi had not forgot to cover up the small entrance way All of a sudden his song burst into full voice As the startled ducks sat uneasily on the ground Iktomi changed his tune into a minor strain These were the words he sang Istokmus wacipo tuwayatunwanpi kinhan ista nisasapi kta which is With eyes closed you must dance He who dares to open his eyes forever red eyes shall have Up rose the circle of seated ducks and holding their wings close against their sides began to dance to the rhythm of Iktomi s song and drum With eyes closed they did dance Iktomi ceased to beat his drum He began to sing louder and faster He seemed to be moving about in the center of the ring No duck dared blink a wink Each one shut his eyes very tight and danced even harder Up and down Shifting to the right of them they hopped round and round in that blind dance It was a difficult dance for the curious folk At length one of the dancers could close his eyes no longer It was a Skiska who peeped the least tiny blink at Iktomi within the center of the circle Oh oh squawked he in awful terror Run fly Iktomi is twisting your heads and breaking your necks Run out and fly fly he cried Hereupon the ducks opened their eyes There beside Iktomi s bundle of songs lay half of their crowd flat on their backs Out they flew through the opening Skiska had made as he rushed forth with his alarm But as they soared high into the blue sky they cried to one another Oh your eyes are red red And yours are red red For the warning words of the magic minor strain had proven true Ah ha laughed Iktomi untying the four corners of his blanket I shall sit no more hungry within my dwelling Homeward he trudged along with nice fat ducks in his blanket He left the little straw hut for the rains and winds to pull down Having reached his own teepee on the high level lands Iktomi kindled a large fire out of doors He planted sharp pointed sticks around the leaping flames On each stake he fastened a duck to roast A few he buried under the ashes to bake Disappearing within his teepee he came out again with some huge seashells These were his dishes Placing one under each roasting duck he muttered The sweet fat oozing out will taste well with the hard cooked breasts Heaping more willows upon the fire Iktomi sat down on the ground with crossed shins A long chin between his knees pointed toward the red flames while his eyes were on the browning ducks Just above his ankles he clasped and unclasped his long bony fingers Now and then he sniffed impatiently the savory odor The brisk wind which stirred the fire also played with a squeaky old tree beside Iktomi s wigwam From side to side the tree was swaying and crying in an old man s voice Help I ll break I ll fall Iktomi shrugged his great shoulders but did not once take his eyes from the ducks The dripping of amber oil into pearly dishes drop by drop pleased his hungry eyes Still the old tree man called for help He What sound is it that makes my ear ache exclaimed Iktomi holding a hand on his ear He rose and looked around The squeaking came from the tree Then he began climbing the tree to find the disagreeable sound He placed his foot right on a cracked limb without seeing it Just then a whiff of wind came rushing by and pressed together the broken edges There in a strong wooden hand Iktomi s foot was caught Oh my foot is crushed he howled like a coward In vain he pulled and puffed to free himself While sitting a prisoner on the tree he spied through his tears a pack of gray wolves roaming over the level lands Waving his hands toward them he called in his loudest voice He Gray wolves Don t you come here I m caught fast in the tree so that my duck feast is getting cold Don t you come to eat up my meal The leader of the pack upon hearing Iktomi s words turned to his comrades and said Ah hear the foolish fellow He says he has a duck feast to be eaten Let us hurry there for our share Away bounded the wolves toward Iktomi s lodge From the tree Iktomi watched the hungry wolves eat up his nicely browned fat ducks His foot pained him more and more He heard them crack the small round bones with their strong long teeth and eat out the oily marrow Now severe pains shot up from his foot through his whole body Hin hin hin sobbed Iktomi Real tears washed brown streaks across his red painted cheeks Smacking their lips the wolves began to leave the place when Iktomi cried out like a pouting child At least you have left my baking under the ashes Ho Po shouted the mischievous wolves he says more ducks are to be found under the ashes Come Let us have our fill this once Running back to the dead fire they pawed out the ducks with such rude haste that a cloud of ashes rose like gray smoke over them Hin hin hin moaned Iktomi when the wolves had scampered off All too late the sturdy breeze returned and passing by pulled apart the broken edges of the tree Iktomi was released But alas he had no duck feast IKTOMI S BLANKET ALONE within his teepee sat Iktomi The sun was but a handsbreadth from the western edge of land Those bad bad gray wolves They ate up all my nice fat ducks muttered he rocking his body to and fro He was cuddling the evil memory he bore those hungry wolves At last he ceased to sway his body backward and forward but sat still and stiff as a stone image Oh I ll go to Inyan the great grandfather and pray for food he exclaimed At once he hurried forth from his teepee and with his blanket over one shoulder drew nigh to a huge rock on a hillside With half crouching half running strides he fell upon Inyan with outspread hands Grandfather pity me I am hungry I am starving Give me food Great grandfather give me meat to eat he cried All the while he stroked and caressed the face of the great stone god The all powerful Great Spirit who makes the trees and grass can hear the voice of those who pray in many varied ways The hearing of Inyan the large hard stone was the one most sought after He was the great grandfather for he had sat upon the hillside many many seasons He had seen the prairie put on a snow white blanket and then change it for a bright green robe more than a thousand times Still unaffected by the myriad moons he rested on the everlasting hill listening to the prayers of Indian warriors Before the finding of the magic arrow he had sat there Now as Iktomi prayed and wept before the great grandfather the sky in the west was red like a glowing face The sunset poured a soft mellow light upon the huge gray stone and the solitary figure beside it It was the smile of the Great Spirit upon the grandfather and the wayward child The prayer was heard Iktomi knew it Now grandfather accept my offering tis all I have said Iktomi as he spread his half worn blanket upon Inyan s cold shoulders Then Iktomi happy with the smile of the sunset sky followed a footpath leading toward a thicketed ravine He had not gone many paces into the shrubbery when before him lay a freshly wounded deer This is the answer from the red western sky cried Iktomi with hands uplifted Slipping a long thin blade from out his belt he cut large chunks of choice meat Sharpening some willow sticks he planted them around a wood pile he had ready to kindle On these stakes he meant to roast the venison While he was rubbing briskly two long sticks to start a fire the sun in the west fell out of the sky below the edge of land Twilight was over all Iktomi felt the cold night air upon his bare neck and shoulders Ough he shivered as he wiped his knife on the grass Tucking it in a beaded case hanging from his belt Iktomi stood erect looking about He shivered again Ough Ah I am cold I wish I had my blanket whispered he hovering over the pile of dry sticks and the sharp stakes round about it Suddenly he paused and dropped his hands at his sides The old great grandfather does not feel the cold as I do He does not need my old blanket as I do I wish I had not given it to him Oh I think I ll run up there and take it back said he pointing his long chin toward the large gray stone Iktomi in the warm sunshine had no need of his blanket and it had been very easy to part with a thing which he could not miss But the chilly night wind quite froze his ardent thank offering Thus running up the hillside his teeth chattering all the way he drew near to Inyan the sacred symbol Seizing one corner of the half worn blanket Iktomi pulled it off with a jerk Give my blanket back old grandfather You do not need it I do This was very wrong yet Iktomi did it for his wit was not wisdom Drawing the blanket tight over his shoulders he descended the hill with hurrying feet He was soon upon the edge of the ravine A young moon like a bright bent bow climbed up from the southwest horizon a little way into the sky In this pale light Iktomi stood motionless as a ghost amid the thicket His woodpile was not yet kindled His pointed stakes were still bare as he had left them But where was the deer the venison he had felt warm in his hands a moment ago It was gone Only the dry rib bones lay on the ground like giant fingers from an open grave Iktomi was troubled At length stooping over the white dried bones he took hold of one and shook it The bones loose in their sockets rattled together at his touch Iktomi let go his hold He sprang back amazed And though he wore a blanket his teeth chattered more than ever Then his blunted sense will surprise you little reader for instead of being grieved that he had taken back his blanket he cried aloud Hin hin hin If only I had eaten the venison before going for my blanket Those tears no longer moved the hand of the Generous Giver They were selfish tears The Great Spirit does not heed them ever IKTOMI AND THE MUSKRAT BESIDE a white lake beneath a large grown willow tree sat Iktomi on the bare ground The heap of smouldering ashes told of a recent open fire With ankles crossed together around a pot of soup Iktomi bent over some delicious boiled fish Fast he dipped his black horn spoon into the soup for he was ravenous Iktomi had no regular meal times Often when he was hungry he went without food Well hid between the lake and the wild rice he looked nowhere save into the pot of fish Not knowing when the next meal would be he meant to eat enough now to last some time How how my friend said a voice out of the wild rice Iktomi started He almost choked with his soup He peered through the long reeds from where he sat with his long horn spoon in mid air How my friend said the voice again this time close at his side Iktomi turned and there stood a dripping muskrat who had just come out of the lake Oh it is my friend who startled me I wondered if among the wild rice some spirit voice was talking How how my friend said Iktomi The muskrat stood smiling On his lips hung a ready Yes my friend when Iktomi would ask My friend will you sit down beside me and share my food That was the custom of the plains people Yet Iktomi sat silent He hummed an old dance song and beat gently on the edge of the pot with his buffalo horn spoon The muskrat began to feel awkward before such lack of hospitality and wished himself under water After many heart throbs Iktomi stopped drumming with his horn ladle and looking upward into the muskrat s face he said My friend let us run a race to see who shall win this pot of fish If I win I shall not need to share it with you If you win you shall have half of it Springing to his feet Iktomi began at once to tighten the belt about his waist My friend Ikto I cannot run a race with you I am not a swift runner and you are nimble as a deer We shall not run any race together answered the hungry muskrat For a moment Iktomi stood with a hand on his long protruding chin His eyes were fixed upon something in the air The muskrat looked out of the corners of his eyes without moving his head He watched the wily Iktomi concocting a plot Yes yes said Iktomi suddenly turning his gaze upon the unwelcome visitor I shall carry a large stone on my back That will slacken my usual speed and the race will be a fair one Saying this he laid a firm hand upon the muskrat s shoulder and started off along the edge of the lake When they reached the opposite side Iktomi pried about in search of a heavy stone He found one half buried in the shallow water Pulling it out upon dry land he wrapped it in his blanket Now my friend you shall run on the left side of the lake I on the other The race is for the boiled fish in yonder kettle said Iktomi The muskrat helped to lift the heavy stone upon Iktomi s back Then they parted Each took a narrow path through the tall reeds fringing the shore Iktomi found his load a heavy one Perspiration hung like beads on his brow His chest heaved hard and fast He looked across the lake to see how far the muskrat had gone but nowhere did he see any sign of him Well he is running low under the wild rice said he Yet as he scanned the tall grasses on the lake shore he saw not one stir as if to make way for the runner Ah has he gone so fast ahead that the disturbed grasses in his trail have quieted again exclaimed Iktomi With that thought he quickly dropped the heavy stone No more of this said he patting his chest with both hands Off with a springing bound he ran swiftly toward the goal Tufts of reeds and grass fell flat under his feet Hardly had they raised their heads when Iktomi was many paces gone Soon he reached the heap of cold ashes Iktomi halted stiff as if he had struck an invisible cliff His black eyes showed a ring of white about them as he stared at the empty ground There was no pot of boiled fish There was no water man in sight Oh if only I had shared my food like a real Dakota I would not have lost it all Why did I not know the muskrat would run through the water He swims faster than I could ever run That is what he has done He has laughed at me for carrying a weight on my back while he shot hither like an arrow Crying thus to himself Iktomi stepped to the water s brink He stooped forward with a hand on each bent knee and peeped far into the deep water There he exclaimed I see you my friend sitting with your ankles wound around my little pot of fish My friend I am hungry Give me a bone Ha ha ha laughed the water man the muskrat The sound did not rise up out of the lake for it came down from overhead With his hands still on his knees Iktomi turned his face upward into the great willow tree Opening wide his mouth he begged My friend my friend give me a bone to gnaw Ha ha laughed the muskrat and leaning over the limb he sat upon he let fall a small sharp bone which dropped right into Iktomi s throat Iktomi almost choked to death before he could get it out In the tree the muskrat sat laughing loud Next time say to a visiting friend Be seated beside me my friend Let me share with you my food IKTOMI AND THE COYOTE AFAR off upon a large level land a summer sun was shining bright Here and there over the rolling green were tall bunches of coarse gray weeds Iktomi in his fringed buckskins walked alone across the prairie with a black bare head glossy in the sunlight He walked through the grass without following any well worn footpath From one large bunch of coarse weeds to another he wound his way about the great plain He lifted his foot lightly and placed it gently forward like a wildcat prowling noiselessly through the thick grass He stopped a few steps away from a very large bunch of wild sage From shoulder to shoulder he tilted his head Still farther he bent from side to side first low over one hip and then over the other Far forward he stooped stretching his long thin neck like a duck to see what lay under a fur coat beyond the bunch of coarse grass A sleek gray faced prairie wolf his pointed black nose tucked in between his four feet drawn snugly together his handsome bushy tail wound over his nose and feet a coyote fast asleep in the shadow of a bunch of grass this is what Iktomi spied Carefully he raised one foot and cautiously reached out with his toes Gently gently he lifted the foot behind and placed it before the other Thus he came nearer and nearer to the round fur ball lying motionless under the sage grass Now Iktomi stood beside it looking at the closed eyelids that did not quiver the least bit Pressing his lips into straight lines and nodding his head slowly he bent over the wolf He held his ear close to the coyote s nose but not a breath of air stirred from it Dead said he at last Dead but not long since he ran over these plains See there in his paw is caught a fresh feather He is nice fat meat Taking hold of the paw with the bird feather fast on it he exclaimed Why he is still warm I ll carry him to my dwelling and have a roast for my evening meal Ah ha he laughed as he seized the coyote by its two fore paws and its two hind feet and swung him over head across his shoulders The wolf was large and the teepee was far across the prairie Iktomi trudged along with his burden smacking his hungry lips together He blinked his eyes hard to keep out the salty perspiration streaming down his face All the while the coyote on his back lay gazing into the sky with wide open eyes His long white teeth fairly gleamed as he smiled and smiled To ride on one s own feet is tiresome but to be carried like a warrior from a brave fight is great fun said the coyote in his heart He had never been borne on any one s back before and the new experience delighted him He lay there lazily on Iktomi s shoulders now and then blinking blue winks Did you never see a birdie blink a blue wink This is how it first became a saying among the plains people When a bird stands aloof watching your strange ways a thin bluish white tissue slips quickly over his eyes and as quickly off again so quick that you think it was only a mysterious blue wink Sometimes when children grow drowsy they blink blue winks while others who are too proud to look with friendly eyes upon people blink in this cold bird manner The coyote was affected by both sleepiness and pride His winks were almost as blue as the sky In the midst of his new pleasure the swaying motion ceased Iktomi had reached his dwelling place The coyote felt drowsy no longer for in the next instant he was slipping out of Iktomi s hands He was falling falling through space and then he struck the ground with such a bump he did not wish to breathe for a while He wondered what Iktomi would do thus he lay still where he fell Humming a dance song one from his bundle of mystery songs Iktomi hopped and darted about at an imaginary dance and feast He gathered dry willow sticks and broke them in two against his knee He built a large fire out of doors The flames leaped up high in red and yellow streaks Now Iktomi returned to the coyote who had been looking on through his eyelashes Taking him again by his paws and hind feet he swung him to and fro Then as the wolf swung toward the red flames Iktomi let him go Once again the coyote fell through space Hot air smote his nostrils He saw red dancing fire and now he struck a bed of cracking embers With a quick turn he leaped out of the flames From his heels were scattered a shower of red coals upon Iktomi s bare arms and shoulders Dumbfounded Iktomi thought he saw a spirit walk out of his fire His jaws fell apart He thrust a palm to his face hard over his mouth He could scarce keep from shrieking Rolling over and over on the grass and rubbing the sides of his head against the ground the coyote soon put out the fire on his fur Iktomi s eyes were almost ready to jump out of his head as he stood cooling a burn on his brown arm with his breath Sitting on his haunches on the opposite side of the fire from where Iktomi stood the coyote began to laugh at him Another day my friend do not take too much for granted Make sure the enemy is stone dead before you make a fire Then off he ran so swiftly that his long bushy tail hung out in a straight line with his back IKTOMI AND THE FAWN IN one of his wanderings through the wooded lands Iktomi saw a rare bird sitting high in a tree top Its long fan like tail feathers had caught all the beautiful colors of the rainbow Handsome in the glistening summer sun sat the bird of rainbow plumage Iktomi hurried hither with his eyes fast on the bird He stood beneath the tree looking long and wistfully at the peacock s bright feathers At length he heaved a sigh and began Oh I wish I had such pretty feathers How I wish I were not I If only I were a handsome feathered creature how happy I would be I d be so glad to sit upon a very high tree and bask in the summer sun like you said he suddenly pointing his bony finger up toward the peacock who was eyeing the stranger below turning his head from side to side I beg of you make me into a bird with green and purple feathers like yours implored Iktomi tired now of playing the brave in beaded buckskins The peacock then spoke to Iktomi I have a magic power My touch will change you in a moment into the most beautiful peacock if you can keep one condition Yes yes shouted Iktomi jumping up and down patting his lips with his palm which caused his voice to vibrate in a peculiar fashion Yes yes I could keep ten conditions if only you would change me into a bird with long bright tail feathers Oh I am so ugly I am so tired of being myself Change me Do Hereupon the peacock spread out both his wings and scarce moving them he sailed slowly down upon the ground Right beside Iktomi he alighted Very low in Iktomi s ear the peacock whispered Are you willing to keep one condition though hard it be Yes yes I ve told you ten of them if need be exclaimed Iktomi with some impatience Then I pronounce you a handsome feathered bird No longer are you Iktomi the mischief maker Saying this the peacock touched Iktomi with the tips of his wings Iktomi vanished at the touch There stood beneath the tree two handsome peacocks While one of the pair strutted about with a head turned aside as if dazzled by his own bright tinted tail feathers the other bird soared slowly upward He sat quiet and unconscious of his gay plumage He seemed content to perch there on a large limb in the warm sunshine After a little while the vain peacock dizzy with his bright colors spread out his wings and lit on the same branch with the elder bird Oh he exclaimed how hard to fly Brightly tinted feathers are handsome but I wish they were light enough to fly Just there the elder bird interrupted him That is the one condition Never try to fly like other birds Upon the day you try to fly you shall be changed into your former self Oh what a shame that bright feathers cannot fly into the sky cried the peacock Already he grew restless He longed to soar through space He yearned to fly above the trees high upward to the sun Oh there I see a flock of birds flying thither Oh oh said he flapping his wings I must try my wings I am tired of bright tail feathers I want to try my wings No no clucked the elder bird The flock of chattering birds flew by with whirring wings Oop oop called some to their mates Possessed by an irrepressible impulse the Iktomi peacock called out He I want to come Wait for me and with that he gave a lunge into the air The flock of flying feathers wheeled about and lowered over the tree whence came the peacock s cry Only one rare bird sat on the tree and beneath on the ground stood a brave in brown buckskins I am my old self again groaned Iktomi in a sad voice Make me over pretty bird Try me this once again he pleaded in vain Old Iktomi wants to fly Ah We cannot wait for him sang the birds as they flew away Muttering unhappy vows to himself Iktomi had not gone far when he chanced upon a bunch of long slender arrows One by one they rose in the air and shot a straight line over the prairie Others shot up into the blue sky and were soon lost to sight Only one was left He was making ready for his flight when Iktomi rushed upon him and wailed I want to be an arrow Make me into an arrow I want to pierce the blue Blue overhead I want to strike yonder summer sun in its center Make me into an arrow Can you keep a condition One condition though hard it be the arrow turned to ask Yes Yes shouted Iktomi delighted Hereupon the slender arrow tapped him gently with his sharp flint beak There was no Iktomi but two arrows stood ready to fly Now young arrow this is the one condition Your flight must always be in a straight line Never turn a curve nor jump about like a young fawn said the arrow magician He spoke slowly and sternly At once he set about to teach the new arrow how to shoot in a long straight line This is the way to pierce the Blue overhead said he and off he spun high into the sky While he was gone a herd of deer came trotting by Behind them played the young fawns together They frolicked about like kittens They bounced on all fours like balls Then they pitched forward kicking their heels in the air The Iktomi arrow watched them so happy on the ground Looking quickly up into the sky he said in his heart The magician is out of sight I ll just romp and frolic with these fawns until he returns Fawns Friends

none	none	me I want to jump and leap with you I long to be happy as you are said he The young fawns stopped with stiff legs and stared at the speaking arrow with large brown wondering eyes See I can jump as well as you went on Iktomi He gave one tiny leap like a fawn All of a sudden the fawns snorted with extended nostrils at what they beheld There among them stood Iktomi in brown buckskins and the strange talking arrow was gone Oh I am myself My old self cried Iktomi pinching himself and plucking imaginary pieces out of his jacket Hin hin hin I wanted to fly The real arrow now returned to the earth He alighted very near Iktomi From the high sky he had seen the fawns playing on the green He had seen Iktomi make his one leap and the charm was broken Iktomi became his former self Arrow my friend change me once more begged Iktomi No no more replied the arrow Then away he shot through the air in the direction his comrades had flown By this time the fawns gathered close around Iktomi They poked their noses at him trying to know who he was Iktomi s tears were like a spring shower A new desire dried them quickly away Stepping boldly to the largest fawn he looked closely at the little brown spots all over the furry face Oh fawn What beautiful brown spots on your face Fawn dear little fawn can you tell me how those brown spots were made on your face Yes said the fawn When I was very very small my

none	none	marked them on my face with a red hot fire She dug a large hole in the ground and made a soft bed of grass and twigs in it Then she placed me gently there She covered me over with dry sweet grass and piled dry cedars on top From a neighbor s fire she brought hither a red red ember This she tucked carefully in at my head This is how the brown spots were made on my face Now fawn my friend will you do the same for me Won t you mark my face with brown brown spots just like yours asked Iktomi always eager to be like other people Yes I can dig the ground and fill it with dry grass and sticks If you will jump into the pit I ll cover you with sweet smelling grass and cedar wood answered the fawn Say interrupted Ikto will you be sure to cover me with a great deal of dry grass and twigs You will make sure that the spots will be as brown as those you wear Oh yes I ll pile up grass and willows once oftener than my mother did Now let us dig the hole pull the grass and gather sticks cried Iktomi in glee Thus with his own hands he aids in making his grave After the hole was dug and cushioned with grass Iktomi muttering something about brown spots leaped down into it Lengthwise flat on his back he lay While the fawn covered him over with cedars a far away voice came up through them Brown brown spots to wear forever A red ember was tucked under the dry grass Off scampered the fawns after their mothers and when a great distance away they looked backward They saw a blue smoke rising writhing upward till it vanished in the blue ether Is that Iktomi s spirit asked one fawn of another No I think he would jump out before he could burn into smoke and cinders answered his comrade THE BADGER AND THE BEAR ON the edge of a forest there lived a large family of badgers In the ground their dwelling was made Its walls and roof were covered with rocks and straw Old father badger was a great hunter He knew well how to track the deer and buffalo Every day he came home carrying on his back some wild game This kept mother badger very busy and the baby badgers very chubby While the well fed children played about digging little make believe dwellings their mother hung thin sliced meats upon long willow racks As fast as the meats were dried and seasoned by sun and wind she packed them carefully away in a large thick bag This bag was like a huge stiff envelope but far more beautiful to see for it was painted all over with many bright colors These firmly tied bags of dried meat were laid upon the rocks in the walls of the dwelling In this way they were both useful and decorative One day father badger did not go off for a hunt He stayed at home making new arrows His children sat about him on the ground floor Their small black eyes danced with delight as they watched the gay colors painted upon the arrows All of a sudden there was heard a heavy footfall near the entrance way The oval shaped door frame was pushed aside In stepped a large black foot with great big claws Then the other clumsy foot came next All the while the baby badgers stared hard at the unexpected comer After the second foot in peeped the head of a big black bear His black nose was dry and parched Silently he entered the dwelling and sat down on the ground by the doorway His black eyes never left the painted bags on the rocky walls He guessed what was in them He was a very hungry bear Seeing the racks of red meat hanging in the yard he had come to visit the badger family Though he was a stranger and his strong paws and jaws frightened the small badgers the father said How how friend Your lips and nose look feverish and hungry Will you eat with us Yes my friend said the bear I am starved I saw your racks of red fresh meat and knowing your heart is kind I came hither Give me meat to eat my friend Hereupon the mother badger took long strides across the room and as she had to pass in front of the strange visitor she said Ah han Allow me to pass which was an apology How how replied the bear drawing himself closer to the wall and crossing his shins together Mother badger chose the most tender red meat and soon over a bed of coals she broiled the venison That day the bear had all he could eat At nightfall he rose and smacking his lips together that is the noisy way of saying the food was very good he left the badger dwelling The baby badgers peeping through the door flap after the shaggy bear saw him disappear into the woods near by Day after day the crackling of twigs in the forest told of heavy footsteps Out would come the same black bear He never lifted the door flap but thrusting it aside entered slowly in Always in the same place by the entrance way he sat down with crossed shins His daily visits were so regular that mother badger placed a fur rug in his place She did not wish a guest in her dwelling to sit upon the bare hard ground At last one time when the bear returned his nose was bright and black His coat was glossy He had grown fat upon the badger s hospitality As he entered the dwelling a pair of wicked gleams shot out of his shaggy head Surprised by the strange behavior of the guest who remained standing upon the rug leaning his round back against the wall father badger queried How my friend What The bear took one stride forward and shook his paw in the badger s face He said I am strong very strong Yes yes so you are replied the badger From the farther end of the room mother badger muttered over her bead work Yes you grew strong from our well filled bowls The bear smiled showing a row of large sharp teeth I have no dwelling I have no bags of dried meat I have no arrows All these I have found here on this spot said he stamping his heavy foot I want them See I am strong repeated he lifting both his terrible paws Quietly the father badger spoke I fed you I called you friend though you came here a stranger and a beggar For the sake of my little ones leave us in peace Mother badger in her excited way had pierced hard through the buckskin and stuck her fingers repeatedly with her sharp awl until she had laid aside her work Now while her husband was talking to the bear she motioned with her hands to the children On tiptoe they hastened to her side For reply came a low growl It grew louder and more fierce Wa ough he roared and by force hurled the badgers out First the father badger then the mother The little badgers he tossed by pairs He threw them hard upon the ground Standing in the entrance way and showing his ugly teeth he snarled Be gone The father and mother badger having gained their feet picked up their kicking little babes and wailing aloud drew the air into their flattened lungs till they could stand alone upon their feet No sooner had the baby badgers caught their breath than they howled and shrieked with pain and fright Ah what a dismal cry was theirs as the whole badger family went forth wailing from out their own dwelling A little distance away from their stolen house the father badger built a small round hut He made it of bent willows and covered it with dry grass and twigs This was shelter for the night but alas it was empty of food and arrows All day father badger prowled through the forest but without his arrows he could not get food for his children Upon his return the cry of the little ones for meat the sad quiet of the mother with bowed head hurt him like a poisoned arrow wound I ll beg meat for you said he in an unsteady voice Covering his head and entire body in a long loose robe he halted beside the big black bear The bear was slicing red meat to hang upon the rack He did not pause for a look at the comer As the badger stood there unrecognized he saw that the bear had brought with him his whole family Little cubs played under the high hanging new meats They laughed and pointed with their wee noses upward at the thin sliced meats upon the poles Have you no heart Black Bear My children are starving Give me a small piece of meat for them begged the badger Wa ough growled the angry bear and pounced upon the badger Be gone said he and with his big hind foot he sent father badger sprawling on the ground All the little ruffian bears hooted and shouted ha ha to see the beggar fall upon his face There was one however who did not even smile He was the youngest cub His fur coat was not as black and glossy as those his elders wore The hair was dry and dingy It looked much more like kinky wool He was the ugly cub Poor little baby bear he had always been laughed at by his older brothers He could not help being himself He could not change the differences between himself and his brothers Thus again though the rest laughed aloud at the badger s fall he did not see the joke His face was long and earnest In his heart he was sad to see the badgers crying and starving In his breast spread a burning desire to share his food with them I shall not ask my father for meat to give away He would say No Then my brothers would laugh at me said the ugly baby bear to himself In an instant as if his good intention had passed from him he was singing happily and skipping around his father at work Singing in his small high voice and dragging his feet in long strides after him as if a prankish spirit oozed out from his heels he strayed off through the tall grass He was ambling toward the small round hut When directly in front of the entrance way he made a quick side kick with his left hind leg Lo there fell into the badger s hut a piece of fresh meat It was tough meat full of sinews yet it was the only piece he could take without his father s notice Thus having given meat to the hungry badgers the ugly baby bear ran quickly away to his father again On the following day the father badger came back once more He stood watching the big bear cutting thin slices of meat Give he began when the bear turning upon him with a growl thrust him cruelly aside The badger fell on his hands He fell where the grass was wet with the blood of the newly carved buffalo His keen starving eyes caught sight of a little red clot lying bright upon the green Looking fearfully toward the bear and seeing his head was turned away he snatched up the small thick blood Underneath his girdled blanket he hid it in his hand On his return to his family he said within himself I ll pray the Great Spirit to bless it Thus he built a small round lodge Sprinkling water upon the heated heap of sacred stones within he made ready to purge his body The buffalo blood too must be purified before I ask a blessing upon it thought the badger He carried it into the sacred vapor lodge After placing it near the sacred stones he sat down beside it After a long silence he muttered Great Spirit bless this little buffalo blood Then he arose and with a quiet dignity stepped out of the lodge Close behind him some one followed The badger turned to look over his shoulder and to his great joy he beheld a Dakota brave in handsome buckskins In his hand he carried a magic arrow Across his back dangled a long fringed quiver In answer to the badger s prayer the avenger had sprung from out the red globules My son exclaimed the badger with extended right hand How father replied the brave I am your avenger Immediately the badger told the sad story of his hungry little ones and the stingy bear Listening closely the young man stood looking steadily upon the ground At length the father badger moved away Where queried the avenger My son we have no food I am going again to beg for meat answered the badger Then I go with you replied the young brave This made the old badger happy He was proud of his son He was delighted to be called father by the first human creature The bear saw the badger coming in the distance He narrowed his eyes at the tall stranger walking beside him He spied the arrow At once he guessed it was the avenger of whom he had heard long long ago As they approached the bear stood erect with a hand on his thigh He smiled upon them How badger my friend Here is my knife Cut your favorite pieces from the deer said he holding out a long thin blade How said the badger eagerly He wondered what had inspired the big bear to such a generous deed The young avenger waited till the badger took the long knife in his hand Gazing full into the black bear s face he said I come to do justice You have returned only a knife to my poor father Now return to him his dwelling His voice was deep and powerful In his black eyes burned a steady fire The long strong teeth of the bear rattled against each other and his shaggy body shook with fear Ahow cried he as if he had been shot Running into the dwelling he gasped breathless and trembling Come out all of you This is the badger s dwelling We must flee to the forest for fear of the avenger who carries the magic arrow Out they hurried all the bears and disappeared into the woods Singing and laughing the badgers returned to their own dwelling Then the avenger left them I go said he in parting over the earth THE TREE BOUND IT was a clear summer day The blue blue sky dropped low over the edge of the green level land A large yellow sun hung directly overhead The singing of birds filled the summer space between earth and sky with sweet music Again and again sang a yellow breasted birdie Koda Ni Dakota He insisted upon it Koda Ni Dakota which was Friend you re a Dakota Friend you re a Dakota Perchance the birdie meant the avenger with the magic arrow for there across the plain he strode He was handsome in his paint and feathers proud with his great buckskin quiver on his back and a long bow in his hand Afar to an eastern camp of cone shaped teepees he was going There over the Indian village hovered a large red eagle threatening the safety of the people Every morning rose this terrible red bird out of a high chalk bluff and spreading out his gigantic wings soared slowly over the round camp ground Then it was that the people terror stricken ran screaming into their lodges Covering their heads with their blankets they sat trembling with fear No one dared to venture out till the red eagle had disappeared beyond the west where meet the blue and green In vain tried the chieftain of the tribe to find among his warriors a powerful marksman who could send a death arrow to the man hungry bird At last to urge his men to their utmost skill he bade his crier proclaim a new reward Of the chieftain s two beautiful daughters he would have his choice who brought the dreaded red eagle with an arrow in its breast Upon hearing these words the men of the village both young and old both heroes and cowards trimmed new arrows for the contest At gray dawn there stood indistinct under the shadow of the bluff many human figures silent as ghosts and wrapped in robes girdled tight about their waists they waited with chosen bow and arrow Some cunning old warriors stayed not with the group They crouched low upon the open ground But all eyes alike were fixed upon the top of the high bluff Breathless they watched for the soaring of the red eagle From within the dwellings many eyes peeped through the small holes in the front lapels of the teepee With shaking knees and hard set teeth the women peered out upon the Dakota men prowling about with bows and arrows At length when the morning sun also peeped over the eastern horizon at the armed Dakotas the red eagle walked out upon the edge of the cliff Pluming his gorgeous feathers he ruffled his neck and flapped his strong wings together Then he dived into the air Slowly he winged his way over the round camp ground over the men with their strong bows and arrows In an instant the long bows were bent Strong straight arrows with red feathered tips sped upward to the blue sky Ah slowly moved those indifferent wings untouched by the poison beaked arrows Off to the west beyond the reach of arrow beyond the reach of eye the red eagle flew away A sudden clamor of high pitched voices broke the deadly stillness of the dawn The women talked excitedly about the invulnerable red of the eagle s feathers while the would be heroes sulked within their wigwams He he he groaned the chieftain On the evening of the same day sat a group of hunters around a bright burning fire They were talking of a strange young man whom they spied while out upon a hunt for deer beyond the bluffs They saw the stranger taking aim Following the point of his arrow with their eyes they beheld a herd of buffalo The arrow sprang from the bow It darted into the skull of the foremost buffalo But unlike other arrows it pierced through the head of the creature and spinning in the air lit into the next buffalo head One by one the buffalo fell upon the sweet grass they were grazing With straight quivering limbs they lay on their sides The young man stood calmly by counting on his fingers the buffalo as they dropped dead to the ground When the last one fell he ran thither and picking up his magic arrow wiped it carefully on the soft grass He slipped it into his long fringed quiver He is going to make a feast for some hungry tribe of men or beasts cried the hunters among themselves as they hastened away They were afraid of the stranger with the sacred arrow When the hunter s tale of the stranger s arrow reached the ears of the chieftain his face brightened with a smile He sent forth fleet horsemen to learn of him his birth his name and his deeds If he is the avenger with the magic arrow sprung up from the earth out of a clot of buffalo blood bid him come hither Let him kill the red eagle with his magic arrow Let him win for himself one of my beautiful daughters he had said to his messengers for the old story of the badger s man son was known all over the level lands After four days and nights the braves returned He is coming they said We have seen him He is straight and tall handsome in face with large black eyes He paints his round cheeks with bright red and wears the penciled lines of red over his temples like our men of honored rank He carries on his back a long fringed quiver in which he keeps his magic arrow His bow is long and strong He is coming now to kill the big red eagle All around the camp ground from mouth to ear passed those words of the returned messengers Now it chanced that immortal Iktomi fully recovered from the brown burnt spots overheard the people talking At once he was filled with a new desire If only I had the magic arrow I would kill the red eagle and win the chieftain s daughter for a wife said he in his heart Back to his lonely wigwam he hastened Beneath the tree in front of his teepee he sat upon the ground with chin between his drawn up knees His keen eyes scanned the wide plain He was watching for the avenger He is coming said the people muttered old Iktomi All of a sudden he raised an open palm to his brow and peered afar into the west The summer sun hung bright in the middle of a cloudless sky There across the green prairie was a man walking bareheaded toward the east Ha ha tis he the man with the magic arrow laughed Iktomi And when the bird with the yellow breast sang loud again Koda Ni Dakota Friend you re a Dakota Iktomi put his hand over his mouth as he threw his head far backward laughing at both the bird and man He is your friend but his arrow will kill one of your kind He is a Dakota but soon he ll grow into the bark on this tree Ha ha ha he laughed again The young avenger walked with swaying strides nearer and nearer toward the lonely wigwam and tree Iktomi heard the swish swish of the stranger s feet through the tall grass He was passing now beyond the tree when Iktomi springing to his feet called out How how my friend I see you are dressed in handsome deerskins and have red paint on your cheeks You are going to some feast or dance may I ask Seeing the young man only smiled Iktomi went on I have not had a mouthful of food this day Have pity on me young brave and shoot yonder bird for me With these words Iktomi pointed toward the tree top where sat a bird on the highest branch The young avenger always ready to help those in distress sent an arrow upward and the bird fell In the next branch it was caught between the forked prongs My friend climb the tree and get the bird I cannot climb so high I would get dizzy and fall pleaded Iktomi The avenger began to scale the tree when Iktomi cried to him My friend your beaded buckskins may be torn by the branches Leave them safe upon the grass till you are down again You are right replied the young man quickly slipping off his long fringed quiver Together with his dangling pouches and tinkling ornaments he placed it on the ground Now he climbed the tree unhindered Soon from the top he took the bird My friend toss to me your arrow that I may have the honor of wiping it clean on soft deerskin exclaimed Iktomi How said the brave and threw the bird and arrow to the ground At once Iktomi seized the arrow Rubbing it first on the grass and then on a piece of deerskin he muttered indistinct words all the while The young man stepping downward from limb to limb hearing the low muttering said Iktomi I cannot hear what you say Oh my friend I was only talking of your big heart Again stooping over the arrow Iktomi continued his repetition of charm words Grow fast grow fast to the bark of the tree he whispered Still the young man moved slowly downward Suddenly dropping the arrow and standing erect Iktomi said aloud Grow fast to the bark of the tree Before the brave could leap from the tree he became tight grown to the bark Ah ha laughed the bad Iktomi I have the magic arrow I have the beaded buckskins of the great avenger Hooting and dancing beneath the tree he said I shall kill the red eagle I shall wed the chieftain s beautiful daughter Oh Iktomi set me free begged the tree bound Dakota brave But Iktomi s ears were like the fungus on a tree He did not hear with them Wearing the handsome buckskins and carrying proudly the magic arrow in his right hand he started off eastward Imitating the swaying strides of the avenger he walked away with a face turned slightly skyward Oh set me free I am glued to the tree like its own bark Cut me loose moaned the prisoner A young woman carrying on her strong back a bundle of tightly bound willow sticks passed near by the lonely teepee She heard the wailing man s voice She paused to listen to the sad words Looking around she saw nowhere a human creature It may be a spirit thought she Oh cut me loose set me free Iktomi has played me false He has made me bark of his tree cried the voice again The young woman dropped her pack of firewood to the ground With her stone axe she hurried to the tree There before her astonished eyes clung a young brave close to the tree Too shy for words yet too kind hearted to leave the stranger tree bound she cut loose the whole bark Like an open jacket she drew it to the ground With it came the young man also Free once more he started away Looking backward a few paces from the young woman he waved his hand upward and downward before her face This was a sign of gratitude used when words failed to interpret strong emotion When the bewildered woman reached her dwelling she mounted a pony and rode swiftly across the rolling land To the camp ground in the east to the chieftain troubled by the red eagle she carried her story SHOOTING OF THE RED EAGLE A MAN in buckskins sat upon the top of a little hillock The setting sun shone bright upon a strong bow in his hand His face was turned toward the round camp ground at the foot of the hill He had walked a long journey hither He was waiting for the chieftain s men to spy him Soon four strong men ran forth from the center wigwam toward the hillock where sat the man with the long bow He is the avenger come to shoot the red eagle cried the runners to each other as they bent forward swinging their elbows together They reached the side of the stranger but he did not heed them Proud and silent he gazed upon the cone shaped wigwams beneath him Spreading a handsomely decorated buffalo robe before the man two of the warriors lifted him by each shoulder and placed him gently on it Then the four men took each a corner of the blanket and carried the stranger with long proud steps toward the chieftain s teepee Ready to greet the stranger the tall chieftain stood at the entrance way How you are the avenger with the magic arrow said he extending to him a smooth soft hand How great chieftain replied the man holding long the chieftain s hand Entering the teepee the chieftain motioned the young man to the right side of the doorway while he sat down opposite him with a center fire burning between them Wordless like a bashful Indian maid the avenger ate in silence the food set before him on the ground in front of his crossed shins When he had finished his meal he handed the empty bowl to the chieftain s wife saying Mother in law here is your dish Han my son answered the woman taking the bowl With the magic arrow in his quiver the stranger felt not in the least too presuming in addressing the woman as his mother in law Complaining of fatigue he covered his face with his blanket and soon within the chieftain s teepee he lay fast asleep The young man is not handsome after all whispered the woman in her husband s ear Ah but after he has killed the red eagle he will seem handsome enough answered the chieftain That night the star men in their burial procession in the sky reached the low northern horizon before the center fires within the teepees had flickered out The ringing laughter which had floated up through the smoke lapels was now hushed and only the distant howling of wolves broke the quiet of the village But the lull between midnight and dawn was short indeed Very early the oval shaped door flaps were thrust aside and many brown faces peered out of the wigwams toward the top of the highest bluff Now the sun rose up out of the east The red painted avenger stood ready within the camp ground for the flying of the red eagle He appeared that terrible bird He hovered over the round village as if he could pounce down upon it and devour the whole tribe When the first arrow shot up into the sky the anxious watchers thrust a hand quickly over their half uttered

none	none	The second and the third arrows flew upward but missed by a wide space the red eagle soaring with lazy indifference over the little man with the long bow All his arrows he spent in vain Ah my blanket brushed my elbow and shifted the course of my arrow said the stranger as the people gathered around him During this happening a woman on horseback halted her pony at the chieftain s teepee It was no other than the young woman who cut loose the tree bound captive While she told the story the chieftain listened with downcast face I passed him on my way He is near she ended Indignant at the bold impostor the wrathful eyes of the chieftain snapped fire like red cinders in the night time His lips were closed At length to the woman he said How you have done me a good deed Then with quick decision he gave command to a fleet horseman to meet the avenger Clothe him in these my best buckskins said he pointing to a bundle within the wigwam In the meanwhile strong men seized Iktomi and dragged him by his long hair to the hilltop There upon a mock pillared grave they bound him hand and feet Grown ups and children sneered and hooted at Iktomi s disgrace For a half day he lay there the laughing stock of the people Upon the arrival of the real avenger Iktomi was released and chased away beyond the outer limits of the camp ground On the following morning at daybreak peeped the people out of half open door flaps There again in the midst of the large camp ground was a man in beaded buckskins In his hand was a strong bow and red tipped arrow Again the big red eagle appeared on the edge of the bluff He plumed his feathers and flapped his huge wings The young man crouched low to the ground He placed the arrow on the bow drawing a poisoned flint for the eagle The bird rose into the air He moved his outspread wings one two three times and lo the eagle tumbled from the great height and fell heavily to the earth An arrow stuck in his breast He was dead So quick was the hand of the avenger so sure his sight that no one had seen the arrow fly from his long bent bow In awe and amazement the village was dumb And when the avenger plucking a red eagle feather placed it in his black hair a loud shout of the people went up to the sky Then hither and thither ran singing men and women making a great feast for the avenger Thus he won the beautiful Indian princess who never tired of telling to her children the story of the big red eagle IKTOMI AND THE TURTLE THE huntsman Patkasa turtle stood bent over a newly slain deer The red tipped arrow he drew from the wounded deer was unlike the arrows in his own quiver Another s stray shot had killed the deer Patkasa had hunted all the morning without so much as spying an ordinary blackbird At last returning homeward tired and heavy hearted that he had no meat for the hungry mouths in his wigwam he walked slowly with downcast eyes Kind ghosts pitied the unhappy hunter and led him to the newly slain deer that his children should not cry for food When Patkasa stumbled upon the deer in his path he exclaimed Good spirits have pushed me hither Thus he leaned long over the gift of the friendly ghosts How my friend said a voice behind his ear and a hand fell on his shoulder It was not a spirit this time It was old Iktomi How Iktomi answered Patkasa still stooping over the deer My friend you are a skilled hunter began Iktomi smiling a thin smile which spread from one ear to the other Suddenly raising up his head Patkasa s black eyes twinkled as he asked Oh you really say so Yes my friend you are a skillful fellow Now let us have a little contest Let us see who can jump over the deer without touching a hair on his hide suggested Iktomi Oh I fear I cannot do it cried Patkasa rubbing his funny thick palms together Have no coward s doubt Patkasa I say you are a skillful fellow who finds nothing hard to do With these words Iktomi led Patkasa a short distance away In little puffs Patkasa laughed uneasily Now you may jump first said Iktomi Patkasa with doubled fists swung his fat arms to and fro all the while biting hard his under lip Just before the run and leap Iktomi put in Let the winner have the deer to eat It was too late now to say no Patkasa was more afraid of being called a coward than of losing the deer Ho wo he replied still working his short arms At length he started off on the run So quick and small were his steps that he seemed to be kicking the ground only Then the leap But Patkasa tripped upon a stick and fell hard against the side of the deer He he he exclaimed Iktomi pretending disappointment that his friend had fallen Lifting him to his feet he said Now it is my turn to try the high jump Hardly was the last word spoken than Iktomi gave a leap high above the deer The game is mine laughed he patting the sullen Patkasa on the back My friend watch the deer while I go to bring my children said Iktomi darting lightly through the tall grass Patkasa was always ready to believe the words of scheming people and to do the little favors any one asked of him However on this occasion he did not answer Yes my friend He realized that Iktomi s flattering tongue had made him foolish He turned up his nose at Iktomi now almost out of sight as much as to say Oh no Ikto I do not hear your words Soon there came a murmur of voices The sound of laughter grew louder and louder All of a sudden it became hushed Old Iktomi led his young Iktomi brood to the place where he had left the turtle but it was vacant Nowhere was there any sign of Patkasa or the deer Then the babes did howl Be still said father Iktomi to his children I know where Patkasa lives Follow me I shall take you to the turtle s dwelling He ran along a narrow footpath toward the creek near by Close upon his heels came his children with tear streaked faces There said Iktomi in a loud whisper as he gathered his little ones on the bank There is Patkasa broiling venison There is his teepee and the savory fire is in his front yard The young Iktomis stretched their necks and rolled their round black eyes like newly hatched birds They peered into the water Now I will cool Patkasa s fire I shall bring you the broiled venison Watch closely When you see the black coals rise to the surface of the water clap your hands and shout aloud for soon after that sign I shall return to you with some tender meat Thus saying Iktomi plunged into the creek Splash splash the water leaped upward into spray Scarcely had it become leveled and smooth than there bubbled up many black spots The creek was seething with the dancing of round black things The cooled fire The coals laughed the brood of Iktomis Clapping together their little hands they chased one another along the edge of the creek They shouted and hooted with great glee Ahas said a gruff voice across the water It was Patkasa In a large willow tree leaning far over the water he sat upon a large limb On the very same branch was a bright burning fire over which Patkasa broiled the venison By this time the water was calm again No more danced those black spots on its surface for they were the toes of old Iktomi He was drowned The Iktomi children hurried away from the creek crying and calling for their water dead father DANCE IN A BUFFALO SKULL IT was night upon the prairie Overhead the stars were twinkling bright their red and yellow lights The moon was young A silvery thread among the stars it soon drifted low beneath the horizon Upon the ground the land was pitchy black There are night people on the plain who love the dark Amid the black level land they meet to frolic under the stars Then when their sharp ears hear any strange footfalls nigh they scamper away into the deep shadows of night There they are safely hid from all dangers they think Thus it was that one very black night afar off from the edge of the level land out of the wooded river bottom glided forth two balls of fire They came farther and farther into the level land They grew larger and brighter The dark hid the body of the creature with those fiery eyes They came on and on just over the tops of the prairie grass It might have been a wildcat prowling low on soft stealthy feet Slowly but surely the terrible eyes drew nearer and nearer to the heart of the level land There in a huge old buffalo skull was a gay feast and dance Tiny little field mice were singing and dancing in a circle to the boom boom of a wee wee drum They were laughing and talking among themselves while their chosen singers sang loud a merry tune They built a small open fire within the center of their queer dance house The light streamed out of the buffalo skull through all the curious sockets and holes A light on the plain in the middle of the night was an unusual thing But so merry were the mice they did not hear the king king of sleepy birds disturbed by the unaccustomed fire A pack of wolves fearing to come nigh this night fire stood together a little distance away and turning their pointed noses to the stars howled and yelped most dismally Even the cry of the wolves was unheeded by the mice within the lighted buffalo skull They were feasting and dancing they were singing and laughing those funny little furry fellows All the while across the dark from out the low river bottom came that pair of fiery eyes Now closer and more swift now fiercer and glaring the eyes moved toward the buffalo skull All unconscious of those fearful eyes the happy mice nibbled at dried roots and venison The singers had started another song The drummers beat the time turning their heads from side to side in rhythm In a ring around the fire hopped the mice each bouncing hard on his two hind feet Some carried their tails over their arms while others trailed them proudly along Ah very near are those round yellow eyes Very low to the ground they seem to creep creep toward the buffalo skull All of a sudden they slide into the eye sockets of the old skull Spirit of the buffalo squeaked a frightened mouse as he jumped out from a hole in the back part of the skull A cat a cat cried other mice as they scrambled out of holes both large and snug Noiseless they ran away into the dark THE TOAD AND THE BOY THE water fowls were flying over the marshy lakes It was now the hunting season Indian men with bows and arrows were wading waist deep amid the wild rice Near by within their wigwams the wives were roasting wild duck and making down pillows

none	none	From some far distance was also the sound of the father s voice singing a sad song 
1535_141642_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Thus ten summers and as many winters have come and gone since the strange disappearance of the little child 
1535_141642_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Every autumn with the hunters came the unhappy parents of the lost baby to search again for him 
1535_141642_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Toward the latter part of the tenth season when one by one the teepees were folded and the families went away from the lake region the mother walked again along the lake shore weeping 
1535_141642_000017_000001	train-clean-360	One evening across the lake from where the crying woman stood a pair of bright black eyes peered at her through the tall reeds and wild rice 
none	none	A little wild boy stopped his play among the tall grasses 
1535_141642_000017_000003	train-clean-360	His long loose hair hanging down his brown back and shoulders was carelessly tossed from his round face 
1535_141642_000017_000004	train-clean-360	He wore a loin cloth of woven sweet grass 
1535_141642_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Crouching low to the marshy ground he listened to the wailing voice 
none	none	As the voice grew hoarse and only sobs shook the slender figure of the woman the eyes of the wild boy grew dim and wet 
1535_141642_000018_000000	train-clean-360	At length when the moaning ceased he sprang to his feet and ran like a nymph with swift outstretched toes 
1535_141642_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He rushed into a small hut of reeds and grasses 
none	none	Mother Mother Tell me what voice it was I heard which pleased my ears but made my eyes grow wet said he breathless Han my son grunted a big ugly toad
1535_141642_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 It was the voice of a weeping woman you heard 
1535_141642_000020_000002	train-clean-360	My son do not say you like it 
1535_141642_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Do not tell me it brought tears to your eyes 
1535_141642_000020_000004	train-clean-360	You have never heard me weep 
1535_141642_000020_000005	train-clean-360	I can please your ear and break your heart 
1535_141642_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Listen replied the great old toad 
1535_141642_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Stepping outside she stood by the entrance way 
1535_141642_000021_000001	train-clean-360	She was old and badly puffed out 
1535_141642_000021_000002	train-clean-360	She had reared a large family of little toads but none of them had aroused her love nor ever grieved her 
none	none	She had heard the wailing human voice and marveled at the throat which produced the strange sound 
1535_141642_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Now in her great desire to keep the stolen boy awhile longer she ventured to cry as the Dakota woman does 
1535_141642_000021_000005	train-clean-360	In a gruff coarse voice she broke forth 
none	none	Hin hin doe skin Hin hin Ermine Ermine 
1535_141642_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Hin hin red blanket with white border 
1535_141642_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Not knowing that the syllables of a Dakota s cry are the names of loved ones gone the ugly toad mother sought to please the boy s ear with the names of valuable articles 
1535_141642_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Having shrieked in a torturing voice and mouthed extravagant names the old toad rolled her tearless eyes with great satisfaction 
none	none	Hopping back into her dwelling she asked
1535_141642_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 My son did my voice bring tears to your eyes 
none	none	Did my words bring gladness to your ears 
1535_141642_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Do you not like my wailing better 
1535_141642_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 No no pouted the boy with some impatience 
1535_141642_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I want to hear the woman s voice 
1535_141642_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Tell me mother why the human voice stirs all my feelings 
none	none	The toad mother said within her breast The human child has heard and seen his real mother 
1535_141642_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I cannot keep him longer I fear 
1535_141642_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Oh no I cannot give away the pretty creature I have taught to call me mother all these many winters 
1535_141642_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Mother went on the child voice tell me one thing 
none	none	Tell me why my little brothers and sisters are all unlike me 
1535_141642_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The big ugly toad looking at her pudgy children said The eldest is always best 
1535_141642_000029_000000	train-clean-360	This reply quieted the boy for a while 
1535_141642_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Very closely watched the old toad mother her stolen human son 
1535_141642_000029_000002	train-clean-360	When by chance he started off alone she shoved out one of her own children after him saying Do not come back without your big brother 
none	none	Thus the wild boy with the long loose hair sits every day on a marshy island hid among the tall reeds But he is not alone 
1535_141642_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Always at his feet hops a little toad brother 
1535_141642_000030_000003	train-clean-360	One day an Indian hunter wading in the deep waters spied the boy 
1535_141642_000030_000004	train-clean-360	He had heard of the baby stolen long ago 
1535_141642_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 This is he murmured the hunter to himself as he ran to his wigwam 
1535_141642_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 I saw among the tall reeds a black haired boy at play shouted he to the people 
1535_141642_000032_000000	train-clean-360	At once the unhappy father and mother cried out Tis he our boy Quickly he led them to the lake 
1535_141642_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Peeping through the wild rice he pointed with unsteady finger toward the boy playing all unawares 
none	none	Tis he tis he cried the mother for she knew him In silence the hunter stood aside while the happy father and mother caressed their baby boy grown tall IYA THE CAMP EATER FROM the tall grass came the voice of a crying babe The huntsmen who were passing nigh heard and halted The tallest one among them hastened toward the high grass with long cautious strides He waded through the growth of green with just a head above it all Suddenly exclaiming Hunhe he dropped out of sight In another instant he held up in both his hands a tiny little baby wrapped in soft brown buckskins Oh ho a wood child cried the men for they were hunting along the wooded river bottom where this babe was found While the hunters were questioning whether or no they should carry it home the wee Indian baby kept up his little howl His voice is strong said one At times it sounds like an old man s voice whispered a superstitious fellow who feared some bad spirit hid in the small child to cheat them by and by Let us take it to our wise chieftain at length they said and the moment they started toward the camp ground the strange wood child ceased to cry Beside the chieftain s teepee waited the hunters while the tall man entered with the child How how nodded the kind faced chieftain listening to the queer story Then rising he took the infant in his strong arms gently he laid the black eyed babe in his daughter s lap This is to be your little son said he smiling Yes father she replied Pleased with the child she smoothed the long black hair fringing his round brown face Tell the people that I give a feast and dance this day for the naming of my daughter s little son bade the chieftain In the meanwhile among the men waiting by the entrance way one said in a low voice I have heard that bad spirits come as little children into a camp which they mean to destroy No no Let us not be overcautious It would be cowardly to leave a baby in the wild wood where prowl the hungry wolves answered an elderly man The tall man now came out of the chieftain s teepee With a word he sent them to their dwellings half running with joy A feast a dance for the naming of the chieftain s grandchild cried he in a loud voice to the village people What what asked they in great surprise holding a hand to the ear to catch the words of the crier There was a momentary silence among the people while they listened to the ringing voice of the man walking in the center ground Then broke forth a rippling laughing babble among the cone shaped teepees All were glad to hear of the chieftain s grandson They were happy to attend the feast and dance for its naming With excited fingers they twisted their hair into glossy braids and painted their cheeks with bright red paint To and fro hurried the women handsome in their gala day dress Men in loose deerskins with long tinkling metal fringes strode in small numbers toward the center of the round camp ground Here underneath a temporary shade house of green leaves they were to dance and feast The children in deerskins and paints just like their elders were jolly little men and women Beside their eager parents they skipped along toward the green dance house Here seated in a large circle the people were assembled the proud chieftain rose with the little baby in his arms The noisy hum of voices was hushed Not a tinkling of a metal fringe broke the silence The crier came forward to greet the chieftain then bent attentively over the small babe listening to the words of the chieftain When he paused the crier spoke aloud to the people This woodland child is adopted by the chieftain s eldest daughter His name is Chaske He wears the title of the eldest son In honor of Chaske the chieftain gives this feast and dance These are the words of him you see holding a baby in his arms Yes Yes Hinnu How came from the circle At once the drummers beat softly and slowly their drum while the chosen singers hummed together to find the common pitch The beat of the drum grew louder and faster The singers burst forth in a lively tune Then the drumbeats subsided and faintly marked the rhythm of the singing Here and there bounced up men and women both young and old They danced and sang with merry light hearts Then came the hour of feasting Late into the night the air of the camp ground was alive with the laughing voices of women and the singing in unison of young men Within her father s teepee sat the chieftain s daughter Proud of her little one she watched over him asleep in her lap Gradually a deep quiet stole over the camp ground as one by one the people fell into pleasant dreams Now all the village was still Alone sat the beautiful young mother watching the babe in her lap asleep with a gaping little mouth Amid the quiet of the night her ear heard the far off hum of many voices The faint sound of murmuring people was in the air Upward she glanced at the smoke hole of the wigwam and saw a bright star peeping down upon her Spirits in the air above she wondered Yet there was no sign to tell her of their nearness The fine small sound of voices grew larger and nearer Father rise I hear the coming of some tribe Hostile or friendly I cannot tell Rise and see whispered the young woman Yes my daughter answered the chieftain springing to his feet Though asleep his ear was ever alert Thus rushing out into the open he listened for strange sounds With an eagle eye he scanned the camp ground for some sign Returning he said My daughter I hear nothing and see no sign of evil nigh Oh the sound of many voices comes up from the earth about me exclaimed the young mother Bending low over her babe she gave ear to the ground Horrified was she to find the mysterious sound came out of the open mouth of her sleeping child Why so unlike other babes she cried within her heart as she slipped him gently from her lap to the ground Mother listen and tell me if this child is an evil spirit come to destroy our camp she whispered loud Placing an ear close to the open baby mouth the chieftain and his wife each in turn heard the voices of a great camp The singing of men and women the beating of the drum the rattling of deer hoofs strung like bells on a string these were the sounds they heard We must go away said the chieftain leading them into the night Out in the open he whispered to the frightened young woman Iya the camp eater has come in the guise of a babe Had you gone to sleep he would have jumped out into his own shape and would have devoured our camp He is a giant with spindling legs He cannot fight for he cannot run He is powerful only in the night with his tricks We are safe as soon as day breaks Then moving closer to the woman he whispered If he wakes now he will swallow the whole tribe with one hideous gulp Come we must flee with our people Thus creeping from teepee to teepee a secret alarm signal was given At midnight the teepees were gone and there was left no sign of the village save heaps of dead ashes So quietly had the people folded their wigwams and bundled their tent poles that they slipped away unheard by the sleeping Iya babe When the morning sun arose the babe awoke Seeing himself deserted he threw off his baby form in a hot rage Wearing his own ugly shape his huge body toppled to and fro from side to side on a pair of thin legs far too small for their burden Though with every move he came dangerously nigh to falling he followed in the trail of the fleeing people I shall eat you in the sight of a noon day sun cried Iya in his vain rage when he spied them encamped beyond a river By some unknown cunning he swam the river and sought his way toward the teepees Hin hin he grunted and growled With perspiration beading his brow he strove to wiggle his slender legs beneath his giant form Ha ha laughed all the village people to see Iya made foolish with anger Such spindle legs cannot stand to fight by daylight shouted the brave ones who were terror struck the night before by the name Iya Warriors with long knives rushed forth and slew the camp eater Lo there rose out of the giant a whole Indian tribe their camp ground their teepees in a large circle and the people laughing and dancing We are glad to be free said these strange people Thus Iya was killed and no more are the camp grounds in danger of being swallowed up in a single night time MANSTIN THE RABBIT MANSTIN was an adventurous brave but very kind hearted Stamping a moccasined foot as he drew on his buckskin leggins he said Grandmother beware of Iktomi Do not let him lure you into some cunning trap 
1535_141644_000003_000003	train-clean-360	I am going to the North country on a long hunt 
1535_141644_000004_000000	train-clean-360	With these words of caution to the bent old rabbit grandmother with whom he had lived since he was a tiny babe Manstin started off toward the north 
1535_141644_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He was scarce over the great high hills when he heard the shrieking of a human child 
none	none	Wan he ejaculated pointing his long ears toward the direction of the sound Wan that is the work of cruel Double Face 
1535_141644_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Shameless coward 
1535_141644_000005_000002	train-clean-360	he delights in torturing helpless creatures 
1535_141644_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Muttering indistinct words Manstin ran up the last hill and lo in the ravine beyond stood the terrible monster with a face in front and one in the back of his head 
1535_141644_000007_000000	train-clean-360	This brown giant was without clothes save for a wild cat skin about his loins 
none	none	With a wicked gleaming eye he watched the little black haired baby he held in his strong arm 
1535_141644_000007_000002	train-clean-360	In a laughing voice he hummed an Indian mother s lullaby A boo 
1535_141644_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Aboo and at the same time he switched the naked baby with a thorny wild rose bush 
none	none	Quickly Manstin jumped behind a large sage bush on the brow of the hill He bent his bow and the sinewy string twanged 
1535_141644_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Now an arrow stuck above the ear of Double Face 
1535_141644_000008_000002	train-clean-360	It was a poisoned arrow and the giant fell dead 
none	none	Then Manstin took the little brown baby and hurried away from the ravine 
1535_141644_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Soon he came to a teepee from whence loud wailing voices broke 
1535_141644_000008_000005	train-clean-360	It was the teepee of the stolen baby and the mourners were its heart broken parents 
1535_141644_000009_000000	train-clean-360	When gallant Manstin returned the child to the eager arms of the mother there came a sudden terror into the eyes of both the Dakotas 
none	none	They feared lest it was Double Face come in a new guise to torture them The rabbit understood their fear and said I am Manstin the kind hearted Manstin the noted huntsman I am your friend Do not fear 
1535_141644_000010_000000	train-clean-360	That night a strange thing happened 
none	none	While the father and mother slept Manstin took the wee baby 
1535_141644_000010_000002	train-clean-360	With his feet placed gently yet firmly upon the tiny toes of the little child he drew upward by each small hand the sleeping child till he was a full grown man 
none	none	With a forefinger he traced a slit in the upper lip and when on the morrow the man and woman awoke they could not distinguish their own son from Manstin so much alike were the braves
1535_141644_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Henceforth we are friends to help each other said Manstin shaking a right hand in farewell 
none	none	The earth is our common ear to carry from its uttermost extremes one s slightest wish for the other
1535_141644_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Ho Be it so answered the newly made man 
none	none	Upon leaving his friend Manstin hurried away toward the North country whither he was bound for a long hunt Suddenly he came upon the edge of a wide brook 
1535_141644_000013_000002	train-clean-360	His alert eye caught sight of a rawhide rope staked to the water s brink which led away toward a small round hut in the distance The ground was trodden into a deep groove beneath the loosely drawn rawhide rope 
1535_141644_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Hun he exclaimed Manstin bending over the freshly made footprints in the moist bank of the brook 
none	none	A man s footprints he said to himself A blind man lives in yonder hut 
1535_141644_000014_000002	train-clean-360	This rope is his guide by which he comes for his daily water surmised Manstin who knew all the peculiar contrivances of the people 
1535_141644_000014_000003	train-clean-360	At once his eyes became fixed upon the solitary dwelling and hither he followed his curiosity a real blind man s rope 
1535_141644_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Quietly he lifted the door flap and entered in 
1535_141644_000015_000001	train-clean-360	An old toothless grandfather blind and shaky with age sat upon the ground 
1535_141644_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He was not deaf however 
none	none	He heard the entrance and felt the presence of some stranger
1535_141644_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 How grandchild he mumbled for he was old enough to be grandparent to every living thing how 
1535_141644_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I cannot see you 
1535_141644_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Pray speak your name 
1535_141644_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Grandfather I am Manstin answered the rabbit all the while looking with curious eyes about the wigwam 
1535_141644_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Grandfather what is it so tightly packed in all these buckskin bags placed against the tent poles he asked 
none	none	My grandchild those are dried buffalo meat and venison 
1535_141644_000019_000001	train-clean-360	These are magic bags which never grow empty 
none	none	I am blind and cannot go on a hunt Hence a kind Maker has given me these magic bags of choicest foods Then the old bent man pulled at a rope which lay by his right hand This leads me to the brook where I drink and this said he turning to the one on his left and this takes me into the forest where I feel about for dry sticks for my fire
1535_141644_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Grandfather I wish I lived in such sure luxury 
none	none	I would lean back against a tent pole and with crossed feet I would smoke sweet willow bark the rest of my days sighed Manstin
1535_141644_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 My grandchild your eyes are your luxury you would be unhappy without them the old man replied 
1535_141644_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Grandfather I would give you my two eyes for your place cried Manstin 
1535_141644_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 How you have said it 
1535_141644_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Arise 
none	none	Take out your eyes and give them to me Henceforth you are at home here in my stead At once Manstin took out both his eyes and the old man put them on Rejoicing the old grandfather started away with his young eyes while the blind rabbit filled his dream pipe leaning lazily against the tent pole 
1535_141644_000025_000001	train-clean-360	For a short time it was a most pleasant pastime to smoke willow bark and to eat from the magic bags 
1535_141644_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Manstin grew thirsty but there was no water in the small dwelling Taking one of the rawhide ropes he started toward the brook to quench his thirst 
1535_141644_000026_000001	train-clean-360	He was young and unwilling to trudge slowly in the old man s footpath 
1535_141644_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He was full of glee for it had been many long moons since he had tasted such good food 
1535_141644_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Thus he skipped confidently along jerking the old weather eaten rawhide spasmodically till all of a sudden it gave way and Manstin fell headlong into the water 
none	none	En En he grunted kicking frantically amid stream 
1535_141644_000027_000001	train-clean-360	All along the slippery bank he vainly tried to climb till at last he chanced upon the old stake and the deeply worn footpath 
1535_141644_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Exhausted and inwardly disgusted with his mishaps he crawled more cautiously on all fours to his wigwam door 
1535_141644_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Dripping with his recent plunge he sat with chattering teeth within his unfired wigwam 
none	none	The sun had set and the night air was chilly but there was no fire wood in the dwelling Hin murmured Manstin and bravely tried the other rope
1535_141644_000028_000002	train-clean-360	 I go for some fire wood he said following the rawhide rope which led into the forest 
1535_141644_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Soon he stumbled upon thickly strewn dry willow sticks 
1535_141644_000028_000004	train-clean-360	Eagerly with both hands he gathered the wood into his outspread blanket 
1535_141644_000028_000005	train-clean-360	Manstin was naturally an energetic fellow 
none	none	When he had a large heap he tied two opposite ends of blanket together and lifted the bundle of wood upon his back but alas he had unconsciously dropped the end of the rope and now he was lost in the wood Hin hin he groaned Then pausing a moment he set his fan like ears to catch any sound of approaching footsteps There was none 
1535_141644_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Not even a night bird twittered to help him out of his predicament 
1535_141644_000031_000000	train-clean-360	With a bold face he made a start at random 
none	none	He fell into some tangled wood where he was held fast 
1535_141644_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Manstin let go his bundle and began to lament having given away his two eyes 
none	none	Friend my friend I have need of you 
1535_141644_000033_000001	train-clean-360	The old oak tree grandfather has gone off with my eyes and I am lost in the woods he cried with his lips close to the earth 
1535_141644_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Scarcely had he spoken when the sound of voices was audible on the outer edge of the forest 
1535_141644_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Nearer and louder grew the voices one was the clear flute tones of a young brave and the other the tremulous squeaks of an old grandfather 
1535_141644_000035_000000	train-clean-360	It was Manstin s friend with the Earth Ear and the old grandfather Here Manstin take back your eyes said the old man I knew you would not be content in my stead but I wanted you to learn your lesson

1535_141644_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The old grandfather crept into his wigwam which is often mistaken for a mere oak tree by little Indian girls and boys 
none	none	Manstin with his own bright eyes fitted into his head again went on happily to hunt in the North country THE WARLIKE SEVEN ONCE seven people went out to make war the Ashes the Fire the Bladder the Grasshopper the Dragon Fly the Fish and the Turtle As they were talking excitedly waving their fists in violent gestures a wind came and blew the Ashes away Ho cried the others he could not fight this one The six went on running to make war more quickly They descended a deep valley the Fire going foremost until they came to a river The Fire said Hsss tchu and was gone Ho hooted the others he could not fight this one Therefore the five went on the more quickly to make war They came to a great wood While they were going through it the Bladder was heard to sneer and to say He you should rise above these brothers With these words he went upward among the tree tops and the thorn apple pricked him He fell through the branches and was nothing You see this said the four this one could not fight Still the remaining warriors would not turn back The four went boldly on to make war The Grasshopper with his cousin the Dragon Fly went foremost They reached a marshy place and the mire was very deep As they waded through the mud the Grasshopper s legs stuck and he pulled them off He crawled upon a log and wept You see me brothers I cannot go The Dragon Fly went on weeping for his cousin He would not be comforted for he loved his cousin dearly The more he grieved the louder he cried till his body shook with great violence He blew his red swollen nose with a loud noise so that his head came off his slender neck and he was fallen upon the grass You see how it is said the Fish lashing his tail impatiently these people were not warriors Come he said let us go on to make war Thus the Fish and the Turtle came to a large camp ground Ho exclaimed the people of this round village of teepees Who are these little ones What do they seek Neither of the warriors carried weapons with them and their unimposing stature misled the curious people The Fish was spokesman With a peculiar omission of syllables he said Shu hi pi Wan what what clamored eager voices of men and women Again the Fish said Shu hi pi Everywhere stood young and old with a palm to an ear Still no one guessed what the Fish had mumbled From the bewildered crowd witty old Iktomi came forward He listen he shouted rubbing his mischievous palms together for where there was any trouble brewing he was always in the midst of it This little strange man says Zuya unhipi We come to make war Uun resented the people suddenly stricken glum Let us kill the silly pair They can do nothing They do not know the meaning of the phrase Let us build a fire and boil them both If you put us on to boil said the Fish there will be trouble Ho ho laughed the village folk We shall see And so they made a fire I have never been so angered said the Fish The Turtle in a whispered reply said We shall die When a pair of strong hands lifted the Fish over the sputtering water he put his mouth downward Whssh he said He blew the water all over the people so that many were burned and could not see Screaming with pain they ran away Oh what shall we do with these dreadful ones they said Others exclaimed Let us carry them to the lake of muddy water and drown them Instantly they ran with them They threw the Fish and the Turtle into the lake Toward the center of the large lake the Turtle dived There he peeped up out of the water and waving a hand at the crowd sang out This is where I live The Fish swam hither and thither with such frolicsome darts that his back fin made the water fly E han whooped the Fish this is where I live Oh what have we done said the frightened people this will be our undoing Then a wise chief said Iya the Eater shall come and swallow the lake So one went running He brought Iya the Eater and Iya drank all day at the lake till his belly was like the earth Then the Fish and the Turtle dived into the mud and Iya said They are not in me Hearing this the people cried greatly Iktomi wading in the lake had been swallowed like a gnat in the water Within the great Iya he was looking skyward So deep was the water in the Eater s stomach that the surface of the swallowed lake almost touched the sky I will go that way said Iktomi looking at the concave within arm s reach He struck his knife upward in the Eater s stomach and the water falling out drowned those people of the village Now when the great water fell into its own bed the Fish and the Turtle came to the shore
