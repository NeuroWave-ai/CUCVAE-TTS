27_124992_000093_000001	train-clean-100	But if there be no offence of this people in the sight of their God we cannot resist them because their God will defend them and we shall be a reproach to the whole earth

none	none	 Holofernes in great rage sendeth Achior to Bethulia there to be slain with the Israelites six one And it came to pass when they had left off speaking that Holofernes being in a violent passion said to Achior six two Because thou hast prophesied unto us saying That the nation of Israel is defended by their God to shew thee that there is no God but Nabuchodonosor six three When we shall slay them all as one man then thou also shalt die with them by the sword of the Assyrians and all Israel shall perish with thee six four And thou shalt find that Nabuchodonosor is lord of the whole earth and then the sword of my soldiers shall pass through thy sides and thou shalt be stabbed and fall among the wounded of Israel and thou shalt breathe no more till thou be destroyed with them six five But if thou think thy prophecy true let not thy countenance sink and let the paleness that is in thy face depart from thee if thou imaginest these my words cannot be accomplished six six

none	none	seven eight But the children of Ammon and Moab came to Holofernes saying The children of Israel trust not in their spears nor in their arrows but the mountains are their defence and the steep hills and precipices guard them seven nine Wherefore that thou mayst overcome them without joining battle set guards at the springs that they may not draw water out of them and thou shalt destroy them without sword or at least being wearied out they will yield up their city which they suppose because it is situate in the mountains to be impregnable seven ten And these words pleased Holofernes and his officers and he placed all round about a hundred men at every spring seven eleven And when they had kept this watch for full twenty days the cisterns and the reserve of waters failed among all the inhabitants of Bethulia so that there was not within the city enough to satisfy them no not for one day for water was daily given out to the people by measure seven twelve Then all the men and women young men and children gathering themselves together to Ozias all together with one voice seven thirteen Said God be judge between us and thee for thou hast done evil against us in that thou wouldst not speak peaceably with the Assyrians and for this cause God hath sold us into their hands seven fourteen And therefore there is no one to help us while we are cast down before their eyes in thirst and sad destruction seven fifteen And now assemble ye all that are in the city that we may of our own accord yield ourselves all up to the people of Holofernes seven sixteen For it is better that being captives we should live and bless the Lord than that we should die and be a reproach to all flesh after we have seen our wives and our infants die before our eyes seven seventeen We call to witness this day heaven and earth and the God of our fathers who taketh vengeance upon us according to our sins conjuring you to deliver now the city into the hand of the army of Holofernes that our end may be short by the edge of the sword which is made longer by the drought of thirst seven eighteen And when they had said these things there was great weeping and lamentation of all in the assembly and for many hours with one voice they cried to God saying seven nineteen

undertaking nine one And when they were gone Judith went into her oratory and putting on haircloth laid ashes on her head and falling down prostrate before the Lord she cried to the Lord saying nine two Lord God of my father Simeon who gavest him a sword to execute vengeance against strangers who had defiled by their uncleanness and uncovered the virgin unto confusion Gavest him a sword et cetera The justice of God is here praised in punishing by the sword of Simeon the crime of the Sichemites and not the act of Simeon which was justly condemned by his father general forty nine point five Though even with regard to this act we may distinguish between his zeal against the crime committed by the ravishers of his sister which zeal may be considered just and the manner of his punishing that crime which was irregular and excessive nine three And who gavest their wives to be made a prey and their daughters into captivity and all their spoils to be divided to the servants who were zealous with thy zeal assist I beseech thee O Lord God me a widow nine four For thou hast done the things of old and hast devised one thing after another and what thou hast designed hath been done nine five For all thy ways are prepared and in thy providence thou hast placed thy judgments nine six Look upon the camp of the Assyrians now as thou wast pleased to look upon the camp of the Egyptians when they pursued armed after thy servants trusting in their chariots and in their horsemen and in a multitude of warriors nine seven But thou lookedst over their camp and darkness wearied them nine eight The deep held their feet and the waters overwhelmed them nine nine So may it be with these also O Lord who trust in their multitude and in their chariots and in their pikes and in their shields and in their arrows and glory in their spears nine ten And know not that thou art our God who destroyest wars from the beginning and the Lord is thy name nine eleven Lift up thy arm as from the beginning and crush their power with thy power let their power fall in their wrath who promise themselves to violate thy sanctuary and defile the dwelling place of thy name and to beat down with their sword the horn of thy altar nine twelve Bring to pass O Lord that his pride may be cut off with his own sword nine thirteen Let him be caught in the net of his own eyes in my regard and do thou strike him by the graces of the words of my lips nine fourteen Give me constancy in my mind that I may despise him and fortitude that I may overthrow him nine fifteen For this will be a glorious monument for thy name when he shall fall by the hand of a woman nine sixteen For thy power O Lord is not in a multitude nor is thy pleasure in the strength of horses nor from the beginning have the proud been acceptable to thee but the prayer of the humble and the meek hath always pleased thee nine seventeen O God of the heavens creator of the waters and Lord of the whole creation hear me a poor wretch making supplication to thee and presuming of thy mercy nine eighteen Remember O Lord thy covenant and put thou words in my mouth and strengthen the resolution in my heart that thy house may continue in thy holiness nine nineteen And all nations may acknowledge that thou art God and there is no other besides thee Judith Chapter ten Judith goeth out towards the camp and is taken and brought to Holofernes ten one And it came to pass when she had ceased to cry to the Lord that she rose from the place wherein she lay prostrate before the Lord ten two And she called her maid and going down into her house she took off her haircloth and put away the garments of her widowhood ten three And she washed her body and anointed herself with the best ointment and plaited the hair of her head and put a bonnet upon her head and clothed herself with the garments of her gladness and put sandals on her feet and took her bracelets and lilies and earlets and rings and adorned herself with all her ornaments ten four And the Lord also gave her more beauty because all this dressing up did not proceed from sensuality but from virtue and therefore the Lord increased this her beauty so that she appeared to all men s eyes incomparably lovely ten five And she gave to her maid a bottle of wine to carry and a vessel of oil and parched corn and dry figs and bread and cheese and went out ten six And when they came to the gate of the city they found Ozias and the ancients of the city waiting ten seven And when they saw her they were astonished and admired her beauty exceedingly ten eight But they asked her no question only they let her pass saying The God of our fathers give thee grace and may he strengthen all the counsel of thy heart with his power that Jerusalem may glory in thee and thy name may be in the number of the holy and just ten nine And they that were there said all with one voice So be it so be it ten ten But Judith praying to the Lord passed through the gates she and her maid ten eleven And it came to pass when she went down the hill about break of day that the watchmen of the Assyrians met her and stopped her saying Whence comest thou or whither goest thou ten twelve And she answered I am a daughter of the Hebrews and I am fled from them because I knew they would be made a prey to you because they despised you and would not of their own accord yield themselves that they might find mercy in your sight Because I knew et cetera In this and the following chapter some things are related to have been said by Judith which seem hard to reconcile with truth But all that is related in scripture of the servants of God is not approved by the scripture and even the saints in their good enterprises may sometimes slip into venial sins ten thirteen For this reason I thought with myself saying I will go to the presence of the prince Holofernes that I may tell him their secrets and shew him by what way he may take them without the loss of one man of his army ten fourteen And when the men had heard her words they beheld her face and their eyes were amazed for they wondered exceedingly at her beauty ten fifteen And they said to her Thou hast saved thy life by taking this resolution to come down to our lord ten sixteen And be assured of this that when thou shalt stand before him he will treat thee well and thou wilt be most acceptable to his heart And they brought her to the tent of Holofernes telling him of her ten seventeen And when she was come into his presence forthwith Holofernes was caught by his eyes ten eighteen And his officers said to him Who can despise the people of the Hebrews who have such beautiful women that we should not think it worth our while for their sakes to fight against them ten nineteen And Judith seeing Holofernes sitting under a canopy which was woven of purple and gold with emeralds and precious stones ten twenty After she had looked on his face bowed down to him prostrating herself to the ground And the servants of Holofernes lifted her up by the command of their master Judith Chapter eleven Judith s speech to Holofernes eleven one Then Holofernes said to her Be of good comfort and fear not in thy heart for I have never hurt a man that was willing to serve Nabuchodonosor the king eleven two And if thy people had not despised me I would never have lifted up my spear against them eleven three But now tell me for what cause hast thou left them and why it hath pleased thee to come to us eleven four And Judith said to him Receive the words of thy handmaid for if thou wilt follow the words of thy handmaid the Lord will do with thee a perfect thing eleven five For as Nabuchodonosor the king of the earth liveth and his power liveth which is in thee for chastising of all straying souls not only men serve him through thee but also the beasts of the field obey him eleven six For the industry of thy mind is spoken of among all nations and it is told through the whole world that thou only art excellent and mighty in all his kingdom and thy discipline is cried up in all provinces eleven seven It is known also what Achior said nor are we ignorant of what thou hast commanded to be done to him eleven eight For it is certain that our God is so offended with sins that he hath sent word by his prophets to the people that he will deliver them up for their sins eleven nine And because the children of Israel know they have offended their God thy dread is upon them eleven ten Moreover also a famine hath come upon them and for drought of water they are already to be counted among the dead eleven eleven And they have a design even to kill their cattle and to drink the blood of them eleven twelve And the consecrated things of the Lord their God which God forbade them to touch in corn wine and oil these have they purposed to make use of and they design to consume the things which they ought not to touch with their hands therefore because they do these things it is certain they will be given up to destruction eleven thirteen And I thy handmaid knowing this am fled from them and the Lord hath sent me to tell thee these very things eleven fourteen For I thy handmaid worship God even now that I am with thee and thy handmaid will go out and I will pray to God eleven fifteen And he will tell me when he will repay them for their sins and I will come and tell thee so that I may bring thee through the midst of Jerusalem and thou shalt have all the people of Israel as sheep that have no shepherd and there shall not so much as one dog bark against thee eleven sixteen Because these things are told me by the providence of God eleven seventeen And because God is angry with them I am sent to tell these very things to thee eleven eighteen And all these words pleased Holofernes and his servants and they admired her wisdom and they said one to another eleven nineteen There is not such another woman upon earth in look in beauty and in sense of words eleven twenty And Holofernes said to her God hath done well who sent thee before the people that thou mightest give them into our hands eleven twenty one And because thy promise is good if thy God shall do this for me he shall also be my God and thou shalt be great in the house of Nabuchodonosor and thy name shall be renowned through all the earth Judith Chapter twelve Judith goeth out in the night to pray she is invited to a banquet with Holofernes twelve one Then he ordered that she should go in where his treasures were laid up and bade her tarry there and he appointed what should be given her from his own table twelve two And Judith answered him and said Now I cannot eat of these things which thou commandest to be given me lest sin come upon me but I will eat of the things which I have brought twelve three And Holofernes said to her If these things which thou hast brought with thee fail thee what shall we do for thee twelve four And Judith said As thy soul liveth my lord thy handmaid shall not spend all these things till God do by my hand that which I have purposed And his servants brought her into the tent which he had commanded twelve five And when she was going in she desired that she might have liberty to go out at night and before day to prayer and to beseech the Lord twelve six And he commanded his chamberlains that she might go out and in to adore her God as she pleased for three days twelve seven And she went out in the nights into the valley of Bethulia and washed herself in a fountain of water twelve eight And as she came up she prayed to the Lord the God of Israel that he would direct her way to the deliverance of his people twelve nine And going in she remained pure in the tent until she took her own meat in the evening twelve ten And it came to pass on the fourth day that Holofernes made a supper for his servants and said to Vagao his eunuch Go and persuade that Hebrew woman to consent of her own accord to dwell with me twelve eleven For it is looked upon as shameful among the Assyrians if a woman mock a man by doing so as to pass free from him twelve twelve Then Vagao went in to Judith and said Let not my good maid be afraid to go in to my lord that she may be honoured before his face that she may eat with him and drink wine and be merry twelve thirteen And Judith answered him Who am I that I should gainsay my lord twelve fourteen All that shall be good and best before his eyes I will do And whatsoever shall please him that shall be best to me all the days of my life twelve fifteen And she arose and dressed herself out with her garments and going in she stood before his face twelve sixteen And the heart of Holofernes was smitten for he was burning with the desire of her twelve seventeen And Holofernes said to her Drink now and sit down and be merry for thou hast found favour before me twelve eighteen And Judith said I will drink my lord because my life is magnified this day above all my days twelve nineteen And she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had prepared for her twelve twenty And Holofernes was made merry on her occasion and drank exceeding much wine so much as he had never drunk in his life Judith Chapter thirteen Judith cutteth off the head of Holofernes and returneth to Bethulia thirteen one And when it was grown late his servants made haste to their lodgings and Vagao shut the chamber doors and went his way thirteen two And they were all overcharged with wine thirteen three And Judith was alone in the chamber thirteen four But Holofernes lay on his bed fast asleep being exceedingly drunk thirteen five And Judith spoke to her maid to stand without before the chamber and to watch thirteen six And Judith stood before the bed praying with tears and the motion of her lips in silence thirteen seven Saying Strengthen me O Lord God of Israel and in this hour look on the works of my hands that as thou hast promised thou mayst raise up Jerusalem thy city and that I may bring to pass that which I have purposed having a belief that it might be done by thee thirteen eight And when she had said this she went to the pillar that was at his bed s head and loosed his sword that hung tied upon it thirteen nine And when she had drawn it out she took him by the hair of his head and said Strengthen me O Lord God at this hour thirteen ten And she struck twice upon his neck and cut off his head and took off his canopy from the pillars and rolled away his headless body thirteen eleven And after a while she went out and delivered the head of Holofernes to her maid and bade her put it into her wallet thirteen twelve And they two went out according to their custom as it were to prayer and they passed the camp and having compassed the valley they came to the gate of the city thirteen thirteen And Judith from afar off cried to the watchmen upon the walls Open the gates for God is with us who hath shewn his power in Israel thirteen fourteen And it came to pass when the men had heard her voice that they called the ancients of the city thirteen fifteen And all ran to meet her from the least to the greatest for they now had no hopes that she would come thirteen sixteen And lighting up lights they all gathered round about her and she went up to a higher place and commanded silence to be made And when all had held their peace thirteen seventeen Judith said Praise ye the Lord our God who hath not forsaken them that hope in him thirteen eighteen And by me his handmaid he hath fulfilled his mercy which he promised to the house of Israel and he hath killed the enemy of his people by my hand this night thirteen nineteen Then she brought forth the head of Holofernes out of the wallet and shewed it them saying Behold the head of Holofernes the general of the army of the Assyrians and behold his canopy wherein he lay in his drunkenness where the Lord our God slew him by the hand of a woman thirteen twenty But as the same Lord liveth his angel hath been my keeper both going hence and abiding there and returning from thence hither and the Lord hath not suffered me his handmaid to be defiled but hath brought me back to you without pollution of sin rejoicing for his victory for my escape and for your deliverance thirteen twenty one Give all of you glory to him because he is good because his mercy endureth for ever thirteen twenty two And they all adored the Lord and said to her The Lord hath blessed thee by his power because by thee he hath brought our enemies to nought thirteen twenty three And Ozias the prince of the people of Israel said to her Blessed art thou O daughter by the Lord the most high God above all women upon the earth thirteen twenty four Blessed be the Lord who made heaven and earth who hath directed thee to the cutting off the head of the prince of our enemies thirteen twenty five Because he hath so magnified thy name this day that thy praise shall not depart out of the mouth of men who shall be mindful of the power of the Lord for ever for that thou hast not spared thy life by reason of the distress and tribulation of thy people but hast prevented our ruin in the presence of our God thirteen twenty six And all the people said So be it so be it thirteen twenty seven And Achior being called for came and Judith said to him The God of Israel to whom thou gavest testimony that he revengeth himself of his enemies he hath cut off the head of all the unbelievers this night by my hand thirteen twenty eight And that thou mayst find that it is so behold the head of Holofernes who in the contempt of his pride despised the God of Israel and threatened them with death saying When the people of Israel shall be taken I will command thy sides to be pierced with a sword thirteen twenty nine Then Achior seeing the head of Holofernes being seized with a great fear he fell on his face upon the earth and his soul swooned away thirteen thirty But after he had recovered his spirits he fell down at her feet and reverenced her and said thirteen thirty one Blessed art thou by thy God in every tabernacle of Jacob for in every nation which shall hear thy name the God of Israel shall be magnified on occasion of thee Judith Chapter fourteen The Israelites assault the Assyrians who finding their general slain are seized with a panic fear fourteen one And Judith said to all the people Hear me my brethren hang ye up this head upon our walls fourteen two And as soon as the sun shall rise let every man take his arms and rush ye out not as going down beneath but as making an assault fourteen three Then the watchmen must needs run to awake their prince for the battle fourteen four And when the captains of them shall run to the tent of Holofernes and shall find him without his head wallowing in his blood fear shall fall upon them fourteen five And when you shall know that they are fleeing go after them securely for the Lord will destroy them under your feet fourteen six Then Achior seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought leaving the religion of the Gentiles he believed God and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin and was joined to the people of Israel with all the succession of his kindred until this present day fourteen seven And immediately at break of day they hung up the head of Holofernes upon the walls and every man took his arms and they went out with a great noise and shouting fourteen eight And the watchmen seeing this ran to the tent of Holofernes fourteen nine And they that were in the tent came and made a noise before the door of the chamber to awake him endeavouring by art to break his rest that Holofernes might awake not by their calling him but by their noise fourteen ten For no man durst knock or open and go into the chamber of the general of the Assyrians fourteen eleven But when his captains and tribunes were come and all the chiefs of the army of the king of the Assyrians they said to the chamberlains fourteen twelve Go in and awake him for the mice coming out of their holes have presumed to challenge us to fight fourteen thirteen Then Vagao going into his chamber stood before the curtain and made a clapping with his hands for he thought that he was sleeping with Judith fourteen fourteen But when with hearkening he perceived no motion of one lying he came near to the curtain and lifting it up and seeing the body of Holofernes lying upon the ground without the head weltering in his blood he cried out with a loud voice with weeping and rent his garments fourteen fifteen And he went into the tent of Judith and not finding her he ran out to the people fourteen sixteen And said One Hebrew woman hath made confusion in the house of king Nabuchodonosor for behold Holofernes lieth upon the ground and his head is not upon him fourteen seventeen Now when the chiefs of the army of the Assyrians had heard this they all rent their garments and an intolerable fear and dread fell upon them and their minds were troubled exceedingly fourteen eighteen And there was a very great cry in the midst of their camp Judith Chapter fifteen The Assyrians flee the Hebrews pursue after them and are enriched by their spoils fifteen one And when all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded courage and counsel fled from them and being seized with trembling and fear they thought only to save themselves by flight fifteen two So that no one spoke to his neighbour but hanging down the head leaving all things behind they made haste to escape from the Hebrews who as they heard were coming armed upon them and fled by the ways of the fields and the paths of the hills fifteen three So the children of Israel seeing them fleeing followed after them And they went down sounding with trumpets and shouting after them fifteen four And because the Assyrians were not united together they went without order in their flight but the children of Israel pursuing in one body defeated all that they could find fifteen five And Ozias sent messengers through all the cities and countries of Israel fifteen six And every country and every city sent their chosen young men armed after them and they pursued them with the edge of the sword until they came to the extremities of their confines fifteen seven And the rest that were in Bethulia went into the camp of the Assyrians and took away the spoils which the Assyrians in their flight had left behind them and they were laden exceedingly fifteen eight But they that returned conquerors to Bethulia brought with them all things that were theirs so that there was no numbering of their cattle and beasts and all their moveables insomuch that from the least to the greatest all were made rich by their spoils fifteen nine And Joachim the high priest came from Jerusalem to Bethulia with all his ancients to see Judith fifteen ten And when she was come out to him they all blessed her with one voice saying Thou art the glory of Jerusalem thou art the joy of Israel thou art the honour of our people fifteen eleven For thou hast done manfully and thy heart has been strengthened because thou hast loved chastity and after thy husband hast not known any other therefore also the hand of the Lord hath strengthened thee and therefore thou shalt be blessed for ever fifteen twelve And all the people said So be it so be it fifteen thirteen And thirty days were scarce sufficient for the people of Israel to gather up the spoils of the Assyrians fifteen fourteen But all those things that were proved to be the peculiar goods of Holofernes they gave to Judith in gold and silver and garments and precious stones and all household stuff and they all were delivered to her by the people fifteen fifteen And all the people rejoiced with the women and virgins and young men playing on instruments and harps Judith Chapter sixteen The canticle of Judith her virtuous life and death sixteen one Then Judith sung this canticle to the Lord saying sixteen two Begin ye to the Lord with timbrels sing ye to the Lord with cymbals tune unto him a new psalm extol and call upon his name sixteen three The Lord putteth an end to wars the Lord is his name sixteen four He hath set his camp in the midst of his people to deliver us from the hand of all our enemies sixteen five The Assyrian came out of the mountains from the north in the multitude of his strength his multitude stopped up the torrents and their horses covered the valleys sixteen six He bragged that he would set my borders on fire and kill my young men with the sword to make my infants a prey and my virgins captives sixteen seven But the almighty Lord hath struck him and hath delivered him into the hands of a woman and hath slain him sixteen eight For their mighty one did not fall by young men neither did the sons of Titan strike him nor tall giants oppose themselves to him but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beauty of her face sixteen nine For she put off her the garments of widowhood and put on her the garments of joy to give joy to the children of Israel sixteen ten She anointed her face with ointment and bound up her locks with a crown she took a new robe to deceive him sixteen eleven Her sandals ravished his eyes her beauty made his soul her captive with a sword she cut off his head sixteen twelve The Persians quaked at her constancy and the Medes at her boldness sixteen thirteen Then the camp of the Assyrians howled when my lowly ones appeared parched with thirst sixteen fourteen The sons of the damsels have pierced them through and they have killed them like children fleeing away they perished in battle before the face of the Lord my God sixteen fifteen Let us sing a hymn to the Lord let us sing a new hymn to our God sixteen sixteen O Adonai Lord great art thou and glorious in thy power and no one can overcome thee sixteen seventeen Let all thy creatures serve thee because thou hast spoken and they were made thou didst send forth thy spirit and they were created and there is no one that can resist thy voice sixteen eighteen The mountains shall be moved from the foundations with the waters the rocks shall melt as wax before thy face sixteen nineteen But they that fear thee shall be great with thee in all things sixteen twenty Woe be to the nation that riseth up against my people for the Lord almighty will take revenge on them in the day of judgment he will visit them sixteen twenty one For he will give fire and worms into their flesh that they may burn and may feel for ever sixteen twenty two And it came to pass after these things that all the people after the victory came to Jerusalem to adore the Lord and as soon as they were purified they all offered holocausts and vows and their promises sixteen twenty three And Judith offered for an anathema of oblivion all the arms of Holofernes which the people gave her and the canopy that she had taken away out of his chamber An anathema of oblivion That is a gift or offering made to God by way of an everlasting monument to prevent the oblivion or forgetting so great a benefit sixteen twenty four And the people were joyful in the sight of the sanctuary and for three months the joy of this victory was celebrated with Judith sixteen twenty five And after those days every man returned to his house and Judith was made great in Bethulia and she was most renowned in all the land of Israel sixteen twenty six And chastity was joined to her virtue so that she knew no man all the days of her life after the death of Manasses her husband sixteen twenty seven And on festival days she came forth with great glory sixteen twenty eight And she abode in her husband s house a hundred and five years and made her handmaid free and she died and was buried with her husband in Bethulia sixteen twenty nine And all the people mourned for seven days sixteen thirty And all the time of her life there was none that troubled Israel nor many years after her death sixteen thirty one But the day of the festivity of this victory is received by the Hebrews in the number of holy days and is religiously observed by the Jews from that time until this day END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BIBLE DOUAY RHEIMS
