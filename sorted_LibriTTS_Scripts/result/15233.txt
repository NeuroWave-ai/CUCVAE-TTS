START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON E text prepared by Steven Gibbs and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team AUTHENTIC NARRATIVE OF THE DEATH OF LORD NELSON WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES PRECEDING ATTENDING AND SUBSEQUENT TO THAT EVENT THE PROFESSIONAL REPORT ON HIS LORDSHIP S WOUND AND SEVERAL INTERESTING ANECDOTES BY WILLIAM BEATTY M D Surgeon to the Victory in the Battle of Trafalgar and now Physician to the Fleet under the Command of the Earl of saint Vincent K B c c c London Printed By T Davison White Friars For T Cadell and W Davies in the Strand eighteen oh seven TO THE PUBLIC The Surgeon of the late illustrious Lord NELSON feels himself called upon from the responsible situation which he held on the eventful day of the twenty first of October eighteen oh five to lay before the British Nation the following Narrative It contains an account of the most interesting incidents which occurred on board the Victory Lord NELSON s flag ship from the time of her sailing from England in the month of September till the day of battle inclusively with a detail of the particulars of HIS LORDSHIP S Death the mode adopted for preserving his revered Remains during the subsequent long passage of the Victory to England and the condition of the Body when it was deposited in Greenwich Hospital This short statement of facts is deemed a small but necessary tribute of respect to the memory of the departed Hero as well as a professional document which the Public had a right to expect from the man who had the melancholy honour of being his principal medical attendant on that occasion and is presumed to be not unappropriately concluded by observations on the state of HIS LORDSHIP S health for some time previous to his fall with his habits of life and other circumstances strongly proving that few men had a greater prospect of attaining longevity on which account his premature death is the more to be deplored by his Country It was originally intended that this Narrative should be published in the LIFE OF LORD NELSON undertaken by the reverend J S CLARKE and J M ARTHUR esquire and it will still form a part of that Work but from the length of time which must necessarily elapse before so extensive and magnificent a Publication can be completed the Author has been induced to print it in a separate form Narrative Lord NELSON sailed from saint Helen s in the Victory with the Euryalus frigate on the morning of the fifteenth of September eighteen oh five to take the command of the British Fleet cruizing before Cadiz On the eighteenth he appeared off Plymouth where he was joined by his Majesty s ships Thunderer and Ajax with which he proceeded for his destined station On the twentieth he communicated by private signal with the squadron under the command of Rear Admiral STIRLING which passed within a few miles of the Victory and the same day at noon spoke his Majesty s ship Le Decade having on board Rear Admiral Sir RICHARD BICKERTON who was on his return to England for the recovery of his health Some bad weather and adverse winds were experienced by the Victory in crossing the Bay of Biscay and on the twenty seventh Cape saint Vincent was seen Lord NELSON had dispatched the Euryalus ahead on the preceding day to acquaint Admiral COLLINGWOOD with his approach and to direct that no salute should take place nor any public compliments be paid to his flag on his assuming the command as he wished the Enemy to be kept ignorant of a reinforcement being received by the British Fleet In the evening of the twenty eighth the Victory joined the Fleet now consisting of twenty seven ships of the line including the Victory Ajax and Thunderer the city of Cadiz was seen distant about fifteen miles with the Combined Fleets at anchor and Admiral LOUIS with five or six ships under his command close in shore watching the motions of the Enemy On the twenty ninth prompt and decisive measures were adopted to prevent the Enemy from receiving any supplies of provisions by sea which His LORDSHIP was informed they were very much distressed for cruizers were stationed off the Capes saint Vincent saint Mary s and Trafalgar and the frigates Euryalus and Hydra were ordered to keep off the entrance of Cadiz His LORDSHIP now retired with the Fleet to the vicinity of Cape saint Mary s about fifty or sixty miles westward of Cadiz keeping up a constant communication with the frigates in shore by means of three or four ships of the line placed at convenient intervals for distinguishing the signals of each other This distance from the Enemy s port was preserved by His LORDSHIP to prevent them from being speedily acquainted with the force of the Fleet under his command and that he might avoid the necessity of bearing up in bad weather and running with the Fleet through the Straits of Gibraltar when the westerly gales prevailed as the inconvenience of being forced into the Mediterranean had been felt by former Commanders in Chief and would now have afforded a favourable opportunity to the Enemy of effecting their escape from Cadiz or at all events have rendered their obtaining supplies less difficult On the first of October Admiral LOUIS joined the Fleet with a part of his squadron the Canopus Spencer and Tigre from before Cadiz and departed the next day with those ships the Queen and the Zealous for Gibraltar to procure a supply of provisions stores and water which they were much in want of On the fourth he rejoined with his squadron having received intelligence from the Euryalus by telegraph that the French ships in Cadiz were embarking their troops and preparing to sail Lord NELSON however conceived this to be merely intended as a stratagem to draw him nearer to Cadiz for the purpose of obtaining a knowledge of his force and therefore directed Admiral LOUIS to proceed in the execution of the orders before delivered to him Between the seventh and the thirteenth His LORDSHIP was reinforced by the Royal Sovereign Belleisle Defiance Agamemnon and Africa from England and the Leviathan from Gibraltar The Agamemnon Sir EDWARD BERRY joined on the thirteenth one with intelligence that she had been chased on the coast of Portugal a few days before by an Enemy s squadron consisting of six sail of the line On the thirteenth in the evening Sir ROBERT CALDER in his Majesty s ship the Prince of Wales parted company with the Fleet on his return to England His departure Lord NELSON had some days before evinced an anxious wish to procrastinate and was heard that very day to declare his firm belief that the Combined Fleets would be at sea in the course of ten days or a fortnight two On the eighteenth the Donegal Captain MALCOLM left the Fleet for Gibraltar On the nineteenth his Majesty s ships the Colossus Mars Defence and Agamemnon formed the cordon of communication with the frigates in shore the Fleet was lying to About half past nine in the morning the Mars being one of the ships nearest to the Fleet repeated the signal from the ships further in shore that the Enemy were coming out of port Lord NELSON immediately ordered the general signal to be made with two guns for a chace in the south east quarter The wind was now very light and the breezes partial mostly from the south south west The Fleet made all possible sail and about two o clock the Colossus and Mars repeated signals from the ships in shore communicating the welcome intelligence of the Enemy being at sea This cheered the minds of all on board with the prospect of realizing those hopes of meeting the Enemy which had been so long and so sanguinely entertained It was well known to His LORDSHIP that all the Enemy s ships had the iron hoops on their masts painted black whereas the British ships with the exception of the Belleisle and Polyphemus had theirs painted yellow and as he considered that this would serve for a very good mark of distinction in the heat of battle he made known this circumstance to the Fleet and ordered the Belleisle and Polyphemus to paint their hoops yellow but the evening being far advanced when the signal was made to them for this purpose His LORDSHIP fearing that it might not be distinctly understood sent the Entreprenante cutter to them to communicate the order During the night the Fleet continued steering to the south east under all sail in expectation of seeing the Enemy and at day break on the twentieth found itself in the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar but nothing of the Enemy to be discovered The Fleet now wore and made sail to the north west and at seven in the morning the Phoebe was seen making signals for the Enemy bearing north At eight o clock the Victory hove to and Admiral COLLINGWOOD with the Captains of the Mars Colossus and Defence came on board to receive instructions from His LORDSHIP at eleven minutes past nine they returned to their respective ships and the Fleet made sail again to the northward In the afternoon the wind increased and blew fresh from the south west which excited much apprehension on board the Victory lest the Enemy might be forced to return to port The look out ships however made several signals for seeing them and to report their force and bearings His LORDSHIP was at this time on the poop and turning round and observing a group of Midshipmen assembled together he said to them with a smile This day or to morrow will be a fortunate one for you young men alluding to their being promoted in the event of a victory A little before sunset the Euryalus communicated intelligence by telegraph that the Enemy appeared determined to go to the westward His LORDSHIP upon this ordered it to be signified to Captain BLACKWOOD of that ship by signal that he depended on the Euryalus for keeping sight of the Enemy during the night The night signals were so clearly and distinctly arranged by His LORDSHIP and so well understood by the respective Captains that the Enemy s motions continued to be made known to him with the greatest facility throughout the night a certain number of guns with false fires and blue lights announced their altering their course wearing and making or shortening sail and signals communicating such changes were repeated by the look out ships from the Euryalus to the Victory The Enemy wore twice during the night which evolution was considered by His LORDSHIP as shewing an intention on their part of keeping the port of Cadiz open and made him apprehend that on seeing the British Fleet they would effect their retreat thither before he could bring them to a general action He was therefore very careful not to approach their Fleet near enough to be seen by them before morning The British Fleet wore about two o clock in the morning and stood on the larboard tack with their heads to the northward carrying their topsails and foresails and anxiously expecting the dawn of day When that period arrived the Combined Fleets were distinctly seen from the Victory s deck formed in a close line of battle ahead on the starboard tack standing to the south and about twelve miles to leeward They consisted of thirty three ships of the line four of which were three deckers and one of seventy guns the strength of the British Fleet was twenty seven ships of the line seven of which were three deckers and three of sixty four guns Lord NELSON had on the tenth issued written Instructions to the Admirals and Captains of the Fleet individually pointing out his intended mode of attack in the event of meeting the Enemy three and now previously to appearing himself on deck he directed Captain HARDY to make the necessary signals for the order and disposition of the Fleet accordingly HIS LORDSHIP came upon deck soon after day light he was dressed as usual in his Admiral s frock coat bearing on the left breast four stars of different orders which he always wore with his common apparel four He displayed excellent spirits and expressed his pleasure at the prospect of giving a fatal blow to the naval power of France and Spain and spoke with confidence of obtaining a signal victory notwithstanding the inferiority of the British Fleet declaring to Captain HARDY that he would not be contented with capturing less than twenty sail of the line He afterwards pleasantly observed that the twenty first of October was the happiest day in the year among his family but did not assign the reason of this five His LORDSHIP had previously entertained a strong presentiment that this would prove the auspicious day and had several times said to Captain HARDY and Doctor SCOTT Chaplain of the ship and Foreign Secretary to the Commander in Chief whose intimate friendship he enjoyed The twenty first of October will be our day The wind was now from the west but the breezes were very light with a long heavy swell running The signal being made for bearing down upon the Enemy in two lines the British Fleet set all possible sail The lee line consisting of thirteen ships was led by Admiral COLLINGWOOD in the Royal Sovereign and the weather line composed of fourteen ships by the Commander in Chief in the Victory HIS LORDSHIP had ascended the poop to have a better view of both lines of the British Fleet and while there gave particular directions for taking down from his cabin the different fixtures and for being very careful in removing the portrait of Lady HAMILTON Take care of my Guardian Angel said he addressing himself to the persons to be employed in this business Immediately after this he quitted the poop and retired to his cabin for a few minutes where he committed to paper the following short but devout and fervent ejaculation which must be universally admired as truly characteristic of the Christian hero and the codicil to his will which follows it MAY the great GOD whom I worship grant to my Country and for the benefit of Europe in general a great and glorious victory and may no misconduct in any one tarnish it and may humanity after victory be the predominant feature in the British Fleet For myself individually I commit my life to Him that made me and may His blessing alight on my endeavours for serving my Country faithfully To Him I resign myself and the just cause which is entrusted to me to defend Amen Amen Amen OCTOBER twenty first eighteen oh five Then in sight of the Combined Fleets of France and Spain distant about ten miles WHEREAS the eminent services of EMMA HAMILTON widow of the Right Honourable Sir WILLIAM HAMILTON have been of the very greatest service to my King and Country to my knowledge without ever receiving any reward from either our King or Country First that she obtained the King of Spain s letter in seventeen ninety six to his brother the King of Naples acquainting him of his intention to declare war against England from which letter the ministry sent out orders to the then Sir JOHN JERVIS to strike a stroke if opportunity offered against either the arsenals of Spain or her fleets that neither of these was done is not the fault of Lady HAMILTON the opportunity might have been offered six Secondly the British Fleet under my command could never have returned the second time to Egypt had not Lady HAMILTON S influence with the Queen of Naples caused letters to be wrote to the Governor of Syracuse that he was to encourage the Fleet s being supplied with every thing should they put into any port in Sicily We put into Syracuse and received every supply went to Egypt and destroyed the French Fleet Could I have rewarded these services I would not now call upon my Country but as that has not been in my power I leave EMMA Lady HAMILTON therefore a legacy to my King and Country that they will give her an ample provision to maintain her rank in life I also leave to the beneficence of my Country my adopted Daughter HORATIA NELSON THOMPSON and I desire she will use in future the name of NELSON only These are the only favours I ask of my King and Country at this moment when I am going to fight their battle May GOD bless my King and Country and all those I hold dear My Relations it is needless to mention they will of course be amply provided for NELSON and BRONTE Witness Weather line British Lee line Enemy s line The divisions of the British Fleet will be brought nearly within gun shot of the Enemy s centre The signal will be made for the lee line to bear up together to set all their sail even studding sails
