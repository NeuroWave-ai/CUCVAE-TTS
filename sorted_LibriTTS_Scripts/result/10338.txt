6798-77736-0000	train-other-500	while Poland suffers and dreams of liberation while Serbia is waiting for redemption there is a little country the soul of which is torn to pieces a little country that is so remote so remote that her ardent sighs cannot be heard
none	none	 It is the country of perpetual sacrifice 
6798-77736-0001	train-other-500	the country that saw Abraham build the altar upon which he was ready to immolate his only son the country that Moses saw from a distance stretching in beauty and loveliness a land of promise never to be attained the country
6798-77736-0002	train-other-500	that gave the world its symbols of soul and spirit Palestine No war correspondents no Red Cross or relief committees have gone to Palestine because no actual fighting has taken place there
6798-77736-0003	train-other-500	and yet hundreds of thousands are suffering there that worst of agonies the agony of the spirit Those who have devoted their lives to show the world that Palestine can be made again a country flowing with milk and honey
6798-77736-0004	train-other-500	those who have dreamed of reviving the spirit of the prophets and the great teachers are hanged and persecuted and exiled their dreams shattered their holy places profaned their work ruined
6798-77736-0005	train-other-500	Cut off from the world with no bread to sustain the starving body
none	none	 the heavy boot 
6798-77736-0006	train-other-500	of a barbarian soldiery trampling their very soul the dreamers of Palestine refuse to surrender and amidst the clash of guns and swords they are battling for the spirit with the weapons of the spirit
6798-77736-0007	train-other-500	The time has not yet come to write the record of these battles
none	none	 nor even to attempt to render justice to the sublime heroes of Palestine This book is merely the story of some of the personal experiences of one who has done less and suffered less than thousands of his comrades ALEXANDER AARONSOHN WITH THE TURKS IN PALESTINE CHAPTER I ZICRON JACOB Thirty five years ago the impulse which has since been organized as the Zionist Movement led my parents to leave their homes in Roumania and emigrate to Palestine where they joined a number of other Jewish pioneers in founding Zicron Jacob a little village lying just south of Mount Carmel 
6798-77736-0008	train-other-500	in that fertile coastal region close to the ancient Plains of Armageddon
none	none	 Here 
6798-77736-0009	train-other-500	I was born my childhood was passed here in the peace and harmony of this little agricultural community
none	none	 with its whitewashed stone houses huddled close together for protection 
6798-77736-0010	train-other-500	against the native Arabs who at first menaced the life of the new colony The village was far more suggestive of Switzerland than of the conventional slovenly villages of the East mud built and filthy
6798-77736-0011	train-other-500	for while it was the purpose of our people in returning to the Holy Land to foster the Jewish language
none	none	 and the social conditions of the Old Testament as far as possible there was nothing retrograde in this movement No time was lost in introducing progressive methods of agriculture and the climatological experiments of other countries were observed and made use of in developing the ample natural resources of the land ILLUSTRATION THE CEMETERY OF ZICRON JACOB Eucalyptus imported from Australia soon gave the shade of its cool healthful foliage where previously no trees had grown In the course of time 
6798-77736-0012	train-other-500	dry farming which some people consider a recent discovery
none	none	 but which in reality is as old as the Old Testament 
6798-77736-0013	train-other-500	was introduced and extended with American agricultural implements blooded cattle were imported and poultry raising on a large scale was undertaken with the aid of incubators to the disgust of the Arabs who look
none	none	 on such usurpation of the hen s functions 
6798-77736-0014	train-other-500	as against nature and sinful Our people replaced the wretched native trails with good roads bordered by hedges of thorny acacia which in season were covered with downy little yellow blossoms
6798-77736-0015	train-other-500	that smelled sweeter than honey when the sun was on them
none	none	 More important than all these a communistic village government was established in which both sexes enjoyed equal rights including that of suffrage strange as this may seem to persons who when they think of the matter at all form vague conceptions of all the women folk of Palestine 
6798-77736-0016	train-other-500	as shut up in harems A short experience with Turkish courts and Turkish justice taught our people that they would have to establish a legal system of their own
none	none	 two collaborating judges were therefore appointed 
6798-77736-0017	train-other-500	one to interpret the Mosaic law another
none	none	 to temper it with modern jurisprudence 
6798-77736-0018	train-other-500	All Jewish disputes were settled by this court Its effectiveness may be judged by the fact that the Arabs
none	none	 weary of Turkish venality as open and shameless as anywhere in the world 
6798-77736-0019	train-other-500	began in increasing numbers to bring their difficulties to our tribunal Jews
none	none	 are law abiding people and life in those Palestine colonies tended to bring out the fraternal qualities of our race but it is interesting to note that in over thirty years not one Jewish criminal case was reported from forty five villages Zicron Jacob was a little town of one hundred and thirty fires so we call it 
6798-77736-0021	train-other-500	when in nineteen ten on the advice of my elder brother
none	none	 who was head of the Jewish Experiment Station 
6798-77736-0022	train-other-500	at Athlit an ancient town of the Crusaders I left for America to enter the service of the United States in the Department of Agriculture A few days after reaching this country
6798-77736-0023	train-other-500	I took out my first naturalization papers and proceeded to Washington where I became part of that great government service whose beneficent activity is too little known by Americans
none	none	 Here I remained until June nineteen thirteen when I returned to Palestine with the object of taking motion pictures 
6798-77736-0024	train-other-500	and stereopticon views These I intended to use in a lecturing tour
none	none	 for spreading the Zionist propaganda in the United States 
6798-77736-0025	train-other-500	During the years of my residence in America I was able to appreciate and judge in their right value
none	none	 the beauty and inspiration of the life 
6798-77736-0026	train-other-500	which my people led in the Holy Land From a distance too I saw better the need for organization among our communities
none	none	 and I determined to build up a fraternal union of the young Jewish men 
6798-77736-0027	train-other-500	all over the country Two months after my return from America an event occurred which gave impetus to these projects The physician of our village an old man who had devoted his entire life to serving
6798-77736-0028	train-other-500	and healing the people of Palestine without distinction of race or religion was driving home one evening in his carriage from a neighboring settlement With him was a young girl of sixteen In a deserted place
6798-77736-0029	train-other-500	they were set upon by four armed Arabs who beat the old man to unconsciousness as he tried in vain to defend the girl from the terrible fate which awaited her Night came on
none	none	 Alarmed by the absence of the physician we young men rode out in search of him We finally discovered what had happened and then and there in the serene moonlight of that Eastern night 
6798-77736-0030	train-other-500	with tragedy close at hand I made my comrades take oath on the honor of their sisters to organize themselves into a strong society for the defense of the life and honor of our villagers and
6798-77736-0031	train-other-500	of our people at large These details
none	none	 are perhaps useful for the better understanding 
6798-77736-0032	train-other-500	of the disturbances that came thick and fast when in August nineteen fourteen
none	none	 the war madness broke out among the nations of Europe The repercussion 
6798-77736-0033	train-other-500	was at once felt even in our remote corner of the earth Soon after the German invasion of Belgium the Turkish army was mobilized and all citizens of the Empire between nineteen and forty five years
none	none	 were called to the colors As the Young Turk Constitution of nineteen oh nine provided that all Christians and Jews were equally liable to military service 
6798-77736-0035	train-other-500	our young men knew that they too would be called upon to make the common sacrifice For the most part they were not unwilling to sustain the Turkish Government While the Constitution imposed on them the burden of militarism
6798-77736-0036	train-other-500	it had brought with it the compensation of freedom of religion and equal rights and we could not forget that for six hundred years Turkey
none	none	 has held her gates wide open to the Jews who fled from the Spanish Inquisition 
6798-77736-0037	train-other-500	and similar ministrations of other civilized countries Of course we never dreamed that Turkey would do anything but remain neutral
none	none	 If we had had any idea of the turn 
6798-77736-0038	train-other-500	things were ultimately to take we should have given a different greeting to the mouchtar or sheriff who came to our village with the list of mobilizable men to be called on for service My own position was a curious one
6798-77736-0039	train-other-500	I had every intention of completing the process of becoming an American citizen which I had begun by taking out first papers In the eyes of the law however I was still a Turkish subject with no claim to American protection
none	none	 This was sneeringly pointed out to me 
6798-77736-0040	train-other-500	by the American Consul at Haifa who happens to be a German
none	none	 so there was no other course but to surrender myself to the Turkish Government CHAPTER II PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE 
6798-77737-0000	train-other-500	There was no question as to my eligibility for service I was young and strong and healthy and even if I had not been the physical examination of Turkish recruits is a farce
6798-77737-0001	train-other-500	The enlisting officers have a theory of their own that no man is really unfit for the army a theory
none	none	 which has been fostered by the ingenious devices of the Arabs to avoid conscription 
6798-77737-0002	train-other-500	To these wild people the protracted discipline of military training is simply a purgatory and for weeks before the recruiting officers are due
none	none	 they dose themselves with powerful herbs and physics and fast 
6798-77737-0003	train-other-500	and nurse sores into being until they are in a really deplorable condition Some of them go so far as to cut off a finger or two The officers however have learned to see beyond these little tricks
6798-77737-0004	train-other-500	and few Arabs succeed in wriggling through their drag net I have watched dozens of Arabs being brought in to the recruiting office on camels or horses so weak were they and welcomed into the service with a severe beating
6798-77737-0005	train-other-500	the sick and the shammers sharing the same fate Thus it often happens that some of the new recruits die after their first day of garrison life Together with twenty of my comrades
none	none	 I presented myself at the recruiting station at Acco the saint Jean d Acre of history 
6798-77737-0006	train-other-500	We had been given to understand that once our names were registered we should be allowed to return home to provide ourselves with money suitable clothing
none	none	 and food 
6798-77737-0007	train-other-500	as well as to bid our families good bye
none	none	 To our astonishment however 
6798-77737-0008	train-other-500	we were marched off to the Han or caravanserai
none	none	 and locked into the great courtyard with hundreds of dirty Arabs Hour after hour passed 
6798-77737-0009	train-other-500	darkness came and finally we had to stretch ourselves on the ground and make the best of a bad situation It was a night of horrors Few of us had closed an eye when at dawn an officer appeared and ordered us out of the Han
none	none	 From our total number about three hundred including four young men from our village and myself were picked out and told to make ready to start at once for Saffed a town in the hills of northern Galilee near the Sea of Tiberias 
6798-77737-0010	train-other-500	where our garrison was to be located
none	none	 No attention was paid to our requests that we be allowed to return to our homes for a final visit That same morning we were on our way to Saffed a motley disgruntled crew ILLUSTRATION SAFFED It was a four days march 
6798-77737-0011	train-other-500	four days of heat and dust and physical suffering The September sun smote us mercilessly as we straggled along the miserable native trail full of gullies and loose stones It would not have been so bad
6798-77737-0012	train-other-500	if we had been adequately shod or clothed but soon we found ourselves envying the ragged Arabs as they trudged along barefoot paying no heed to the jagged flints
none	none	 Shoes to the Arab are articles for ceremonious indoor use when any serious walking is to be done he takes them off slings them over his shoulder and trusts to the horny soles of his feet 
6798-77737-0013	train-other-500	To add to our troubles the Turkish officers with characteristic fatalism had made no commissary provision for us whatever Any food we ate had to be purchased by the roadside from our own funds
6798-77737-0014	train-other-500	which were scant enough to start with The Arabs were in a terrible plight Most of them were penniless and as the pangs of hunger set in they began pillaging right and left from the little farms by the wayside
6798-77737-0015	train-other-500	From modest beginnings poultry and vegetables they progressed to larger game unhindered by the officers Houses were entered women insulted time and again
none	none	 I saw a stray horse grazing by the roadside 
6798-77737-0016	train-other-500	seized by a crowd of grinning Arabs who piled on the poor beast s back until he was almost crushed to earth and rode off triumphantly while their comrades held back the weeping owner The result of this sort of requisitioning
6798-77737-0017	train-other-500	was that our band of recruits was followed by an increasing throng of farmers imploring threatening trying by hook or by crook to win back the stolen goods Little satisfaction did they get
none	none	 although some of them went with us as far as Saffed 
6798-77737-0018	train-other-500	Our garrison town is not an inviting place nor has it an inviting reputation Lord Kitchener himself had good reason to remember it
none	none	 As a young lieutenant of twenty three 
6798-77737-0019	train-other-500	in the Royal Engineering Corps
none	none	 he was nearly killed there by a band of fanatical Arabs while surveying for the Palestine Exploration Fund 
6798-77737-0020	train-other-500	Kitchener had a narrow escape of it one of his fellow officers was shot dead close by him but he went calmly ahead and completed his maps splendid large scale affairs which have never since been equaled
6798-77737-0021	train-other-500	and which are now in use by the Turkish and German armies
none	none	 However though Saffed combines most of the unpleasant characteristics of Palestine native towns we welcomed the sight of it for we were used up by the march An old deserted mosque was given us for barracks 
6798-77737-0022	train-other-500	there on the bare stone floor in close packed promiscuity
none	none	 too tired to react to filth and vermin 
6798-77737-0023	train-other-500	we spent our first night as soldiers of the Sultan while the milky moonlight streamed in through every chink and aperture
none	none	 and bats flitted round the vaulting 
6798-77737-0024	train-other-500	above the snoring carcasses of the recruits Next morning we were routed out at five The black depths of the well in the center of the mosque courtyard provided doubtful water for washing bathing and drinking then came breakfast
6798-77737-0025	train-other-500	our first government meal consisting simply enough of boiled rice which was ladled out into tin wash basins holding rations for ten men In true Eastern fashion we squatted down round the basin
6798-77737-0026	train-other-500	and dug into the rice with our fingers At first I was rather upset by this sort of table manners
none	none	 and for some time I ate with my eyes fixed on my own portion to 
6798-77737-0027	train-other-500	avoid seeing the Arabs who fill the palms of their hands with rice pat it into a ball and cram it into their mouths just so the bolus making a great lump in their lean throats as it reluctantly descends
6798-77737-0028	train-other-500	In the course of that same morning we were allotted our uniforms
none	none	 The Turkish uniform under indirect German influence has been greatly modified during the past five years 
6798-77737-0029	train-other-500	It is of khaki a greener khaki than that of the British army and of conventional European cut Spiral puttees and good boots are provided the only peculiar feature is the headgear
none	none	 a curious uncouth looking combination of the turban and the German helmet devised by Enver Pasha to combine religion and practicality and called in his honor enverieh 
6798-77737-0030	train-other-500	With commendable thrift Enver patented his invention and it is rumored that he has drawn a comfortable fortune from its sale An excellent uniform it is on the whole but to our disgust we found
6798-77737-0031	train-other-500	that in the great olive drab pile to which we were led there was not a single new one
none	none	 All were old discarded and dirty and the mere thought of putting on the clothes of some unknown Arab legionary who perhaps had died of cholera at Mecca or Yemen 
6798-77737-0032	train-other-500	made me shudder After some indecision
none	none	 my friends and I finally went up to one of the officers and offered to buy new uniforms 
6798-77737-0033	train-other-500	with the money we expected daily from our families
none	none	 The officer scenting the chance for a little private profit 
6798-77737-0034	train-other-500	gave his consent The days and weeks following were busy ones From morning till night it was drill drill and again drill
6798-77737-0035	train-other-500	We were divided into groups of fifty each of which was put in charge of a young non commissioned officer
none	none	 from the Military School of Constantinople 
6798-77737-0036	train-other-500	or Damascus or of some Arab who had seen several years service These instructors had a hard time of it
none	none	 the German military system which had only recently been introduced was too much for them 
6798-77737-0037	train-other-500	They kept mixing up the old and the new methods of training with the result that it was often hopeless to try and make out their orders
none	none	 Whole weeks were spent in grinding into the Arabs 
6798-77737-0038	train-other-500	the names of the different parts of the rifle weeks more went to teaching them to clean it although it must be said that once they had mastered these technicalities they were excellent shots Their efficiency would have been considerably greater
none	none	 if there had been more target shooting 
6798-77737-0039	train-other-500	From the very first however we felt that there was a scarcity of ammunition This shortage the drill masters in a spirit of compensation attempted to make up by abundant severity
none	none	 The whip of soft flexible stinging leather which seldom leaves the Turkish officer s hand was never idle This was not surprising for the Arab is a cunning fellow whose only respect is for brute force 
6798-77737-0040	train-other-500	He exercises it himself on every possible victim
none	none	 and expects the same treatment from his superiors 
6798-77737-0041	train-other-500	So far as my comrades and I were concerned I must admit that we were generally treated kindly We knew most of the drill exercises from the gymnastic training we had practiced since childhood
none	none	 and the officers realized that we were educated and came from respectable families The same was also true with regard to the native Christians most of whom can read and write and are of a better class than the Mohammedans of the country 
6798-77737-0042	train-other-500	When Turkey threw in her lot with the Germanic powers the attitude toward the Jews and Christians changed radically but of this I shall speak later
none	none	 It was a hard life we led while in training at Saffed 
6798-77737-0043	train-other-500	evening would find us dead tired and little disposed for anything but rest As the tremendous light play of the Eastern sunsets faded away we would gather in little groups in the courtyard
none	none	 of our mosque its minaret towering black against a turquoise sky 
6798-77737-0044	train-other-500	and talk fitfully of the little happenings of the day while the Arabs murmured gutturally around us Occasionally one of them would burst into a quavering hot blooded tribal love song It happened that I was fairly well known among these natives
6798-77737-0045	train-other-500	through my horse Kochba of pure Maneghi
none	none	 Sbeli blood 
6798-77737-0046	train-other-500	which I had purchased from some
none	none	 Anazzi Bedouins who were encamped not far from Aleppo a swift and intelligent animal he was winner of many races and in a land where a horse is considerably more valuable than a wife his ownership cast quite a glamour over me ILLUSTRATION THE AUTHOR ON HIS HORSE KOCHBA In the evenings then the Arabs would come up to chat As they speak seldom of their children of their women folk never the conversation was limited to generalities about the crops and the weather or to the recitation of never ending tales of Abou Zeid the famous hero of the Beni Hilal 
6798-77737-0047	train-other-500	or of Antar the glorious Politics of which they have amazing ideas also came in for discussion Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen Victoria are still living figures to them but significantly enough
6798-77737-0048	train-other-500	they considered the Kaiser king
none	none	 of all the kings of this world 
6798-77737-0049	train-other-500	with the exception of the Sultan whom they admitted to equality Seldom did an evening pass without a dance As darkness fell the Arabs would gather in a great circle around one of their comrades
6798-77737-0050	train-other-500	who squatted on the ground with a bamboo flute to a weird minor music they would begin swaying and moving about while some self chosen poet among them would sing impromptu verses to the flute obbligato As a rule the themes were homely
none	none	 To morrow we shall eat rice and meat the singer would wail Yaha lili amali my endeavor be granted came the full throated response of 
6798-77737-0051	train-other-500	all the others The chorus was tremendously effective
none	none	 Sometimes the singer would indulge in pointed personalities with answering roars of laughter 
6798-77737-0052	train-other-500	These dances lasted for hours and as they progressed the men gradually worked themselves up into a frenzy I never failed to wonder at these people who without the aid of alcohol
none	none	 could reproduce the various stages of intoxication As I lay by and watched the moon riding serenely above these frantic men and their twisting black shadows 
6798-77737-0053	train-other-500	I reflected that they were just in the condition when one word from a holy man would suffice
none	none	 to send them off to wholesale murder and rapine It was my good fortune soon to be released from the noise and dirt of the mosque 
6798-77737-0054	train-other-500	I had had experience with corruptible Turkish officers and one day when barrack conditions became unendurable I went to the officer commanding our division an old Arab from Latakieh
none	none	 who had been called from retirement at the time of the mobilization 
6798-77737-0055	train-other-500	He lived in a little tent near the mosque where I found him squatting on the floor nodding drowsily over his comfortable paunch As he was an officer of the old regime I entered boldly squatted beside him
6798-77737-0056	train-other-500	and told him my troubles The answer came with an enormous shrug of the shoulders You are serving the Sultan Hardship should be sweet I should be more fit to serve him if I got more sleep and rest
6798-77737-0057	train-other-500	He waved a fat hand about the tent Look at me
none	none	 Here I am an officer of rank and shooting a knowing look at me 
6798-77737-0058	train-other-500	I have not even a nice blanket A crime A crime I interrupted To think of it when I a humble soldier have dozens of them at home
none	none	 I should be honored if you would allow me 
6798-77737-0059	train-other-500	My voice trailed off suggestively How could you get one he asked
none	none	 Oh I have friends here in Saffed but 
6798-77737-0060	train-other-500	I must be able to sleep in a nice place Of course certainly What would you suggest That hotel kept by the Jewish widow might do I replied
none	none	 More amenities were exchanged the upshot of which 
6798-77737-0061	train-other-500	was that my four friends and I were given permission to sleep at the inn a humble place but infinitely better than the mosque
none	none	 It was all perfectly simple ILLUSTRATION SOLDIERS TENTS IN SAMARIA CHAPTER III THE GERMAN PROPAGANDA So passed the days of our training swiftly monotonously until the fateful December morning when the news came like a thunderbolt that Turkey was about to join hands with Germany We had had reports of the war of a kind Copies of telegrams from Constantinople printed in Arabic were circulated among us giving accounts of endless German victories These however we had laughed at as fabrications of a Prussophile press agency and in our skepticism we had failed to give the Teutons credit for the successes they had actually won To us born and bred in the East as we were the success of German propaganda in the Turkish Empire could not come as an overwhelming surprise but its fullness amazed us It may be of timely interest to say a few words here regarding this propaganda as I have seen it in Palestine spreading under strong and efficient organization for twenty years In order to realize her imperialistic dreams Germany absolutely needed Palestine It was the key to the whole Oriental situation No mere coincidence brought the Kaiser to Damascus in November eighteen ninety eight the same month that Kitchener in London was hailed as Gordon s avenger when he uttered his famous phrase at the tomb of Saladin Tell the three hundred million Moslems of the world that I am their friend We have all seen photographs of the imperial figure draped in an amazing burnous of his own designing above which the Prussian Pickelhaube rises supreme as he moved from point to point in this portentous visit we may also have seen Caran d Ache s celebrated cartoon a subject of diplomatic correspondence representing this same imperial figure in its Oriental toggery riding into Jerusalem on an ass The nations of Europe laughed at this visit and its transparent purpose but it was all part of the scheme which won for the Germans the concessions for the Konia Bagdad Railway and made them owners of the double valley of the Euphrates and Tigris Through branch lines projected through the firman they are practically in control of both the Syrian routes toward the Cypriotic Mediterranean and the Lebanon valleys They also control the three Armenian routes of Cappadocia the Black Sea and the trans Caucasian branch of Urfa Marach and Mardine The fall of Erzerum has altered conditions respecting this last They dominate the Persian routes toward Tauris and Teheran as well and last but not least the Gulf branch of Zobeir These railways delivered into German hands the control of Persia whence the road to India may be made easy through Syria lies the route to the Suez Canal and Egypt which was used in February nineteen fifteen and will probably be used again this year To make this Oriental dream a reality the Germans have not relied on their railway concessions alone Their Government has done everything in its power to encourage German colonization in Palestine Scattered all over the country are German mills that half of the time have nothing to grind German hotels have been opened in places seldom frequented by tourists German engineers appeared in force surveying sounding noting All these colonists held gatherings in the Arab villages when the ignorant natives were told of the greatness of Germany of her good intentions and of the evil machinations of other powers What I state here can be corroborated by any one who knows Palestine and has lived in it About the time when we first knew that Turkey would join the Germanic powers came the news that the Capitulations had been revoked As is generally known foreigners formerly enjoyed the protection of their respective consuls The Turkish Government under the terms of the so called Capitulations or agreements had no jurisdiction over an American for instance or a Frenchman who could not be arrested without the consent of his consul In the Ottoman Empire where law and justice are not at a premium such protection was a wholesome and necessary policy The revoking of the Capitulations was a terrible blow to all the Europeans meaning as it did the practical abolition of all their rights Upon the Arabs it acted like an intoxicant Every boot black or boatman felt that he was the equal of the accursed Frank who now had no consul to protect him and abuses began immediately Moreover as if by magic the whole country became Germanized In all the mosques Friday prayers were ended with an invocation for the welfare of the Sultan and Hadji Wilhelm The significance of this lies in the fact that the title Hadji can be properly applied only to a Moslem who has made the pilgrimage to Mecca and kissed the sacred stone of the Kaaba Instant death is the penalty paid by any Christian who is found within that enclosure yet Wilhelm II head of the Lutheran faith stepped forward as Hadji Wilhelm His pictures were sold everywhere German officers appeared and it seemed as if a wind of brutal mastery were blowing The dominant figure of this movement in Palestine was without doubt the German Consul at Haifa Leutweld von Hardegg He traveled about the country making speeches and distributing pamphlets in Arabic in which it was elaborately proved that Germans are not Christians like the French or English but that they are descendants of the prophet Mohammed Passages from the Koran were quoted prophesying the coming of the Kaiser as the Savior of Islam CHAPTER IV ROAD MAKING AND DISCHARGE The news of the actual declaration of war by Turkey caused a tremendous stir in our regiment The prevailing feeling was one of great restlessness and discontent The Arabs made many bitter remarks against Germany 
6798-77739-0000	train-other-500	Why didn t she help us against the Italians during the war for Tripoli they said Now that she is in trouble she is drawing us into the fight Their opinions however soon underwent a change In the first place
6798-77739-0001	train-other-500	they came to realize that Turkey had taken up arms against Russia and Russia is considered first and foremost the arch enemy
none	none	 German reports of German successes 
6798-77739-0002	train-other-500	also had a powerful effect on them They began to grow boastful arrogant
none	none	 and the sight of the plundering of Europeans Jews 
6798-77739-0003	train-other-500	and Christians convinced them that a very desirable regime was setting in
none	none	 Saffed has a large Jewish colony 
6798-77739-0004	train-other-500	and it was torment for me to have to witness the outrages that my people suffered in the name of requisitioning The final blow came one morning when all the Jewish and Christian soldiers of our regiment were called out and told that henceforth
none	none	 they were to serve 
6798-77739-0005	train-other-500	in the taboor amlieh or working corps The object of this action plainly enough was to conciliate and flatter the Mohammedan population and at the same time to put the Jews and Christians
none	none	 who for the most part favored the cause of the Allies in a position where they would be least dangerous We were disarmed our uniforms were taken away 
6798-77739-0006	train-other-500	and we became hard driven gangsters I shall never forget the humiliation of that day when we who after all were the best disciplined troops of the lot were first herded to our work of pushing wheelbarrows and handling spades
6798-77739-0007	train-other-500	by grinning Arabs rifle on shoulder
none	none	 We were set to building the road between Saffed and Tiberias 
6798-77739-0008	train-other-500	on the Sea of Galilee a link in the military highway from Damascus to the coast which would be used for the movement of troops in case the railroad should be cut off
6798-77739-0009	train-other-500	It had no immediate strategic bearing on the attack against Suez however From six in the morning till seven at night we were hard at it except for one hour s rest at noon
6798-77739-0010	train-other-500	While we had money it was possible to get some slight relief by bribing our taskmasters but this soon came to an end
none	none	 and we had to endure their brutality as best we could 
6798-77739-0011	train-other-500	The wheelbarrows we used were the property of a French company
none	none	 which before the war was undertaking a highway to Beirut 
6798-77739-0012	train-other-500	No grease was provided for the wheels so that there was a maddening squeaking and squealing in addition to the difficulty of pushing the barrows One day I suggested to an inspection officer
none	none	 that if the wheels were not greased the axles would be burned out 
6798-77739-0013	train-other-500	He agreed with me and issued an order that the men were to provide their own oil to lubricate the wheels I shall not dwell on the physical sufferings we underwent while working on this road
6798-77739-0014	train-other-500	for the reason that the conditions I have described were prevalent over the whole country and later when I had the opportunity to visit some construction camps in Samaria and Judaea found that in comparison our lot had been a happy one
6798-77739-0015	train-other-500	While we were breaking stones and trundling squeaking wheelbarrows however the most disquieting rumors began to drift in to us from our home villages Plundering had been going on in the name of requisitioning
6798-77739-0016	train-other-500	the country was full of soldiery whose capacity for mischief making was well known to us and it was torture to think of what might be happening in our peaceful homes where so few men had been left for protection
6798-77739-0017	train-other-500	All the barbed wire fences we heard had been torn up
none	none	 and sent north for the construction of barricades 
6798-77739-0018	train-other-500	In a wild land like Palestine where the native has no respect for property where fields and crops are always at the mercy of marauders the barbed wire fence has been a tremendous factor for civilization
6798-77739-0019	train-other-500	and with these gone the Arabs were once more free to sweep across the country unhindered stealing and destroying The situation grew more and more unbearable One day a little Christian soldier
none	none	 a Nazarene 
6798-77739-0020	train-other-500	disappeared from the ranks We never saw him again but we learned that his sister a very young girl had been forcibly taken by a Turkish officer of the Nazareth garrison In Palestine the dishonor of a girl can be redeemed by blood alone
none	none	 The young soldier had hunted for his sister found her in the barracks and shot her 
6798-77739-0021	train-other-500	he then surrendered himself to the military authorities who undoubtedly put him to death
none	none	 He had not dared to kill the real criminal the officer 
6798-77739-0022	train-other-500	for he knew that this would not only bring death to his family
none	none	 but would call down terrible suffering on all the Christians of Nazareth ILLUSTRATION NAZARETH FROM THE NORTHEAST When I learned of this tragedy 
6798-77739-0023	train-other-500	I determined to get out of the army and return to my village at all costs Nine Turkish officers out of ten can be bought
none	none	 and I had reason to know that the officer in command at Saffed was not that tenth man 
6798-77739-0024	train-other-500	Now according to the law of the country
none	none	 a man has the right to purchase exemption from military service for a sum equivalent to two hundred dollars My case was different for I was already enrolled 
6798-77739-0025	train-other-500	but everything is possible in Turkey I set to work and in less than two weeks I had bought half a dozen officers ranging from corporal to captain and had obtained consent of the higher authorities to my departure provided
6798-77739-0026	train-other-500	I could get a physician s certificate declaring me unfit for service This was arranged in short order although I am healthy looking and the doctor found some difficulty in hitting on an appropriate ailment Finally he decided that I had too much blood
6798-77739-0027	train-other-500	whatever that might mean With his certificate in hand I paid the regular price of two hundred dollars from funds which had been sent me by my family and walked out of the barracks a free man
6798-77739-0028	train-other-500	My happiness was mingled with sadness at the thought of leaving the comrades with whom I had suffered and hoped The four boys from my village were splendid They felt that I was right in going home
none	none	 to do what I could for the people 
6798-77739-0029	train-other-500	but when they kissed me good bye in the Eastern fashion the tears were running down their cheeks and they were all strong brave fellows On my way back to Zicron Jacob I passed through the town of Sheff amr
6798-77739-0030	train-other-500	where I got a foretaste of the conditions I was to find at home A Turkish soldier sauntering along the street helped himself to fruit from the basket of an old vender and went on without offering to pay a farthing When the old man ventured to protest
6798-77739-0031	train-other-500	the soldier turned like a flash and began beating him mercilessly knocking him down and battering him until he was bruised bleeding and covered with the mud of the street There was a hubbub a crowd formed through which a Turkish officer forced his way demanding explanations
none	none	 The soldier sketched the situation in a few words whereupon the officer turning to the old man said impressively If a soldier of the Sultan should choose to heap filth on your head it is for you to kiss his hand in gratitude CHAPTER V THE HIDDEN ARMS When I finally reached Zicron Jacob I found rather a sad state of affairs Military law had been declared No one was supposed to be seen in the streets after sundown 
6798-77740-0000	train-other-500	The village was full of soldiers and civilians had to put up with all kinds of ill treatment Moreover our people were in a state of great excitement because an order had recently come from the Turkish authorities bidding them surrender
6798-77740-0001	train-other-500	whatever fire arms or weapons they had in their possession A sinister command this we knew that similar measures had been taken before the terrible Armenian massacres
none	none	 and we felt that some such fate might be in preparation for our people With the arms gone the head men of the village knew that our last hold over the Arabs our last chance for defense against sudden violence would be gone 
6798-77740-0002	train-other-500	and they had refused to give them up A house to house search had been made fruitlessly for our little arsenal was safely cached in a field beneath growing grain It was a tense unpleasant situation
6798-77740-0003	train-other-500	At any time the Turks might decide to back up their demand by some of the violent methods of which they are past masters A family council was held in my home and it was decided to send my sister a girl of twenty three to some friends
6798-77740-0004	train-other-500	at the American Syrian Protestant College
none	none	 at Beirut 
6798-77740-0005	train-other-500	so that we might be able to move freely without the responsibility of having a girl at home in a country where as a matter of course the women folk are seized and carried off before a massacre
none	none	 At Beirut 
6798-77740-0006	train-other-500	we knew that there was an American Consul General who kept in continual touch with the battleship anchored in the harbor for the protection of American interests My sister got away none too soon One evening shortly after her departure
6798-77740-0007	train-other-500	when I was standing in the doorway of our house watching the ever fresh miracle of the Eastern sunset a Turkish officer came riding down the street with about thirty cavalrymen He called me out and ordered me to follow him to the little village inn where he dismounted
6798-77740-0008	train-other-500	and led me to one of the inner rooms his spurs jingling loudly as we passed along the stone corridor I never knew whether I had been selected for this attention because of my prominence as a leader of the Jewish young men
6798-77740-0009	train-other-500	or simply because I had been standing conveniently in the doorway The officer closed the door and came straight to the point by asking me where our store of arms was hidden He was a big fellow
6798-77740-0010	train-other-500	with the handsome cruel features usual enough in his class There was no open menace in his first question When I refused to tell him he began wheedling and offering all sorts of favors if I would betray my people Then all of a sudden
6798-77740-0011	train-other-500	he whipped out a revolver and stuck the muzzle right in my face I felt the blood leave my heart but I was able to control myself and refuse his demand
none	none	 The officer was not easily discouraged the hours I passed in that little room with its smoky kerosene lamp were terrible ones I realized however how tremendously important the question of the arms was and strength was given me to hold out until the officer gave up in disgust and let me go home ILLUSTRATION HOUSE OF THE AUTHOR S FATHER EPHRAIM FISHL AARONSOHN IN ZICRON JACOB My father an old man knew nothing of what had happened but the rest of my family were tremendously excited I made light of the whole affair 
6798-77740-0012	train-other-500	but I felt sure that this was only the beginning Sure enough next morning the Sabbath the same officer returned and put three of the leading elders of the village together with myself under arrest
6798-77740-0013	train-other-500	After another fruitless inquisition at the hotel we were handcuffed and started on foot toward the prison a day s journey away As our little procession passed my home
none	none	 my father who was aged and feeble 
6798-77740-0014	train-other-500	came tottering forward to say good bye to me A soldier pushed him roughly back
none	none	 he reeled 
6798-77740-0015	train-other-500	then fell full length in the street before my eyes It was a dismal departure We were driven through the streets shackled like criminals and the women and children came out of the houses and watched us in silence
6798-77740-0016	train-other-500	their heads bowed tears running down their cheeks They realized that for thirty five years these old men my comrades had been struggling and suffering for their ideal a regenerated Palestine
6798-77740-0017	train-other-500	now in the dusk of their life it seemed as if all their hopes and dreams were coming to ruin The oppressive tragedy of the situation settled down on me more and more heavily
6798-77740-0018	train-other-500	as the day wore on and heat and fatigue told on my companions
none	none	 My feelings must have been written large on my face for one of them a fine looking patriarch tried to give me comfort by reminding me 
6798-77740-0019	train-other-500	that we must not rely upon strength of arms and that our spirit could never be broken no matter how defenseless we were Thus he an old man was encouraging me instead of receiving help from my youth and enthusiasm
6798-77740-0020	train-other-500	At last we arrived at the prison
none	none	 and were locked into separate cells 
6798-77740-0021	train-other-500	That same night we were tortured with the falagy or bastinado The victim of this horrible punishment is trussed up arms and legs and thrown on his knees then on the bare soles of his feet a pliant green rod is brought down with
none	none	 all the force of a soldier s arm The pain is exquisite 
6798-77740-0022	train-other-500	blood leaps out at the first cut and strong men usually faint after thirty or forty strokes Strange to say the worst part of it is not the blow itself but the whistling of the rod through the air as it rushes to its mark
6798-77740-0023	train-other-500	The groans of my older comrades whose gasps and prayers I could hear through the walls of the cell helped me bear the agony until unconsciousness mercifully came to the rescue For several days more we were kept in the prison
6798-77740-0024	train-other-500	sick and broken with suffering The second night as I lay sleepless and desperate on the strip of dirty matting that served as bed I heard a scratch scratching at the grated slit of a window and presently a slender stick was inserted into the cell
none	none	 I went over and shook it 
6798-77740-0025	train-other-500	some one at the other end was holding it firm And then a curious whispering sound began to come from the end of the stick I put my ear down and caught the voice of one of the men from our village He had taken a long bamboo pole
6798-77740-0026	train-other-500	pierced the joints and crept up behind a broken old wall close beneath my window By means of this primitive telephone we talked as long as we dared I assured him that we were still enduring and
6798-77740-0027	train-other-500	urged him on no account to give up the arms to the Turkish authorities not even if we had to make the ultimate sacrifice Finally when it was found that torture and imprisonment would not make us yield our secret
6798-77740-0028	train-other-500	the Turks resorted to the final test the ordeal which we could not withstand
none	none	 They announced that on a certain date 
6798-77740-0029	train-other-500	a number of our young girls would be carried off and handed over to the officers to be kept until the arms were disclosed We knew that they were capable of carrying out this threat we knew exactly what it meant There was no alternative
none	none	 The people of our village had nothing to do but dig up the treasured arms and with broken hearts hand them over to the authorities And so the terrible news was brought to us one morning that we were free Personally I felt much happier on the day I was put in prison than when I was released 
6798-77740-0030	train-other-500	I had often wondered how our people had been able to bear the rack and thumbscrew of the Spanish Inquisition but when my turn and my comrades came for torture I realized that the same spirit that helped our ancestors was working in us also
6798-77740-0031	train-other-500	Now I knew that our suffering had been useless Whenever the Turkish authorities wished the horrors of the Armenian massacres would live again in Zicron Jacob and we should be powerless to raise a hand to protect ourselves
none	none	 As we came limping home through the streets of our village I caught sight of my own Smith Wesson revolver in the hands of a mere boy of fifteen the son of a well known Arab outlaw I realized then that the Turks had not only taken our weapons but had distributed them among the natives in order to complete our humiliation The blood rushed to my face I started forward to take the revolver away from the boy but one of the old men caught hold of my sleeve and held me back ILLUSTRATION IN A NATIVE CAFE SAFFED A LEMONADE SELLER OF DAMASCUS CHAPTER VI THE SUEZ CAMPAIGN I have already spoken of the so called requisitioning that took place among our people while I was working at Saffed This of course really amounted to wholesale pillage The hand of the Turkish looters had fallen particularly heavy on carts and draught animals As the Arabs know little or nothing of carting hauling or the management of horses and mules the Turks simply enough had requisitioned many of the owners middle aged or elderly men and forced them to go south to help along with the tremendous preparations that were being made for the attack on Suez Among these were a number of men from our village In the course of time their families began to get the most harrowing messages from them They were absolutely destitute no wages being paid them by the Turks their clothes were dropping off them in rags many were sick After much excited planning it was decided to send another man and myself down south on a sort of relief expedition with a substantial sum of money that had been raised with great difficulty by our people Through the influence of my brother at the Agricultural Experiment Station I got permission from the mouchtar to leave Zicron Jacob and about the middle of January nineteen fifteen I set out for Jerusalem To Western minds the idea of the Holy City serving as a base for modern military operations must be full of incongruities And as a matter of fact it was an amazing sight to see the streets packed with khaki clad soldiers and hear the brooding silence of ancient walls shattered by the crash of steel shod army boots Here for the first time I saw the German officers quantities of them Strangely out of place they looked with their pink and whiteness that no amount of hot sunshine could quite burn off They wore the regular German officer s uniform except that the Pickelhaube was replaced by a khaki sun helmet I was struck by the youthfulness of them many were nothing but boys and there were weak dissolute faces in plenty a fact that was later explained when I heard that Palestine had been the dumping ground for young men of high family whose parents were anxious to have them as far removed as possible from the danger zone Fast s Hotel was the great meeting place in Jerusalem for these young bloods Every evening thirty or forty would foregather there to drink and talk women and strategy I well remember the evening when one of them a slender young Prussian with no back to his head braceleted and monocled rose and announced in the decisive tones that go with a certain stage of intoxication What we ought to do is to hand over the organization of this campaign to Thomas Cook Sons However the German officers were by no means all incompetents They realized I soon found out that they had little hope of bringing a big army through the Egyptian desert and making a successful campaign there Their object was to immobilize a great force of British troops around the Canal to keep the Mohammedan population in Palestine impressed with Turkish power and to stir up religious unrest among the natives in Egypt It must be admitted that in the first two of these purposes they have been successful The Turks were less far sighted They believed firmly that they were going to sweep the English off the face of the earth and enter Cairo in triumph and preparations for the march on Suez went on with feverish enthusiasm The ideas of the common soldiers on this subject were amusing Some of them declared that the Canal was to be filled up by the sandbags which had been prepared in great quantities Others held that thousands of camels would be kept without water for many days preceding the attack then the thirsty animals when released would rush into the Canal in such numbers that the troops could march to victory over the packed masses of drowned bodies The army operating against Suez numbered about one hundred and fifty thousand men Of these about twenty thousand were Anatolian Turks trained soldiers splendid fighting material as was shown by their resistance at the Dardanelles The rest were Palestinian Arabs and very inferior troops they were The Arab as a soldier is at once stupid and cunning fierce when victory is on his side but unreliable when things go against him In command of the expedition was the famous Djemal Pasha a Young Turk general of tremendous energy but possessing small ability to see beyond details to the big broad concepts of strategy Although a great friend of Enver Pasha he looked with disfavor on the German officers and in particular on Bach Pasha the German Governor of Jerusalem with whom he had serious disagreements This dislike of the Germans was reflected among the lesser Turkish officers Many of these after long years of service found themselves subordinated to young foreigners who in addition to arbitrary promotion received much higher salaries than the Turks What is more they were paid in clinking gold whereas the Turks when paid at all got paper currency Beersheba a prosperous town of the ancient province of Idumea was the southern base of operations for the advance on Suez Some of our villagers had been sent to this district and in searching for them I had the opportunity of seeing at least the taking off place of the expedition Beyond this point no Jew or Christian was allowed to pass with the exception of the physicians all of whom were non Mohammedans who had been forced into the army Beersheba was swarming with troops They filled the town and overflowed on to the sands outside where a great tent city grew up And everywhere that the Turkish soldiers went disorganization and inefficiency followed them From all over the country the finest camels had been requisitioned and sent down to Beersheba until at the time I was there thousands and thousands of them were collected in the neighborhood Through the laziness and stupidity of the Turkish commissariat officers which no amount of German efficiency could counteract no adequate provision was made for feeding them and incredible numbers succumbed to starvation and neglect Their great carcasses dotted the sand in all directions it was only the wonderful antiseptic power of the Eastern sun that held pestilence in check The soldiers themselves suffered much hardship The crowding in the tents was unspeakable the water supply was almost as inadequate as the medical service which consisted chiefly of volunteer Red Crescent societies among them a unit of twenty German nurses sent by the American College at Beirut Medical supplies such as they were had been taken from the different mission hospitals and pharmacies of Palestine these requisitions being made by officers who knew nothing of medical requirements and simply scooped together everything in sight As a result one of the army physicians told me that in Beersheba he had opened some medical chests consigned to him and found to his horror that they were full of microscopes and gynecological instruments for the care of wounded soldiers in the desert Visits of British aeroplanes to Beersheba were common occurrences Long before the machine itself could be seen its whanging resonant hum would come floating out of the blazing sky seemingly from everywhere at once Soldiers rushed from their tents squinting up into the heavens until the speck was discovered swimming slowly through the air then followed wholesale firing at an impossible range until the officers forbade it True to the policy of avoiding all unnecessary harm to the natives these British aviators never dropped bombs on the town but what was more dangerous from the Turkish point of view they would unload packages of pamphlets printed in Arabic informing the natives that they were being deceived that the Allies were their only true friends that the Germans were merely making use of them to further their own schemes et cetera These cleverly worded little tracts came showering down out of the sky and at first they were eagerly picked up The Turkish commanders however soon announced that any one found carrying them would pay the death penalty After that when the little bundles dropped near them the natives would run as if from high explosive bombs All things considered it is wonderful that the Turkish demonstration against the Canal came as near to fulfillment as it did Twenty thousand soldiers actually crossed the desert in six days on scant rations and with them they took two big guns which they dragged by hand when the mules dropped from thirst and exhaustion They also carried pontoons to be used in crossing the Canal Guns and pontoons are now at rest in the Museum at Cairo Just what took place in the attack is known to very few The English have not seen fit to make public the details and there was little to be got from the demoralized soldiers who returned to Beersheba Piece by piece however I gathered that the attacking party had come up to the Canal at dawn Finding everything quiet they set about getting across and had even launched a pontoon when the British who were lying in wait opened a terrific fire from the farther bank backed by armored locomotives and aeroplanes It was as if the gates of Jehannum were opened and its fires turned loose upon us one soldier told me The Turks succeeded in getting their guns into action for a very short while One of the men of war in the Canal was hit several houses in Ismailia suffered damage but the invaders were soon driven away in confusion leaving perhaps two thousand prisoners in the hands of the English If the latter had chosen to do so they could have annihilated the Turkish forces then and there The ticklish state of mind of the Mohammedan population in Egypt however has led them to adopt a policy of leniency and of keeping to the defensive which subsequent developments have more than justified It is characteristic of England s faculty for holding her colonies that batteries manned by Egyptians did the finest work in defense of the Canal The reaction in Palestine after the defeat at Suez was tremendous Just before the attack Djemal Pasha had sent out a telegram announcing the overwhelming defeat of the British vanguard which had caused wild enthusiasm Another later telegram proclaimed that the Canal had been reached British men of war sunk the Englishmen routed with a loss to the Turks of five men and two camels which were afterwards recovered But added the telegram a terrible sand storm having arisen the glorious army takes it as the wish of Allah not to continue the attack and has therefore withdrawn in triumph These reports hoodwinked the ignorant natives for a little while but when the stream of haggard soldiers wounded and exhausted began pouring back from the south they guessed what had happened and a fierce revulsion against the Germano Turkish regime set in A few weeks before the advance on Suez I was in Jaffa where the enthusiasm and excitement had been at fever pitch Parades and celebrations of all kinds in anticipation of the triumphal march into Egypt were taking place and one day a camel a dog and a bull decorated respectively with the flags of Russia France and England were driven through the streets The poor animals were horribly maltreated by the natives who rained blows and flung filth upon them by way of giving concrete expression to their contempt for the Allies mister Glazebrook the American Consul at Jerusalem happened to be with me in Jaffa that day and never shall I forget the expression of pain and disgust on his face as he watched this melancholy little procession of scapegoats hurrying along the street Now however all was changed The Arabs who take defeat badly turned against the authorities who had got them into such trouble Rumors circulated that Djemal Pasha had been bought by the English and that the defeat at Suez had been planned by him and persons keeping an ear close to the ground began to hear mutterings of a general massacre of Germans In fact things came within an ace of a bloody outbreak I knew some Germans in Jaffa and Haifa who firmly believed that it was all over with them In the defeated army itself the Turkish officers gave vent to their hatred of the Germans Three German officers were shot by their Turkish comrades during the retreat and a fourth committed suicide However Djemal Pasha succeeded in keeping order by means of stern repressive methods and by the fear roused by his large body guard of faithful Anatolians ILLUSTRATION RAILROAD STATION SCENE BETWEEN HAIFA AND DAMASCUS CAMELS BRINGING IN NEWLY CUT TREES DAMASCUS We felt sure that the Turkish defeat would put a damper on the arrogance of the soldiery But even the Mohammedan population were hoping that the Allies would push their victory and land troops in Syria and Palestine for though they hated the infidel they loved the Turk not at all and the country was exhausted and the blockade of the Mediterranean by the Allies prevented the import and export of articles The oranges were rotting on the trees because the annual Liverpool market was closed to Palestine and other crops were in similar case The country was short too of petroleum sugar rice and other supplies and even of matches We had to go back to old customs and use flint and steel for fire and we seldom used our lamps Money was scarce too and Turkey having declared a moratorium cash was often unobtainable even by those who had money in the banks and much distress ensued As the defeated army was pouring in from the south I decided to leave Beersheba and go home The roads and the fields were covered with dead camels and horses and mules Hundreds of soldiers were straggling in disorder many of them on leave but many deserting Soon after the defeat at the Canal several thousand soldiers deserted but an amnesty was declared and they returned to their regiments When I arrived at Jerusalem I found the city filled with soldiers Djemal Pasha had just returned from the desert and his quarters were guarded by a battery of two field guns Nobody knew what to expect some thought that the country would have a little more freedom now that the soldiery had lost its braggadocio while others expected the lawlessness that attends disorganization I went to see Consul Glazebrook He is a true American a Southerner formerly a professor of theology at Princeton He was most earnest and devoted in behalf of the American citizens that came under his care rendering at Jerusalem the same sort of service that Ambassador Morgenthau has rendered at Constantinople He was practically the only man who stood up for the poor defenseless people of the city He received me kindly and I told him what I knew of conditions in the country what I had heard among the Arabs and of my own fears and apprehensions He was visibly impressed and he advised me to see Captain Decker of the U S S Tennessee who was then in Jaffa promising to write himself to the captain of my proposed visit I went to Jaffa the same day and after two days delay succeeded in seeing Captain Decker with the further help of mister Glazebrook who took me with him The police interfered and tried to keep me from going aboard the ship but after long discussions I was permitted to take my place in the launch that the captain had sent for the consul Captain Decker was interested in what I had to say and at his request I dictated my story to his stenographer What became of my report I do not know whether it was transmitted to the Department of State or whether Captain Decker communicated with Ambassador Morgenthau but at all events we soon began to see certain reforms inaugurated in parts of the country and these reforms could have been effected only through pressure from Constantinople The presence of the two American cruisers in the Mediterranean waters has without any doubt been instrumental in the saving of many lives CHAPTER VII FIGHTING THE LOCUSTS While I was traveling in the south another menace to our people s welfare had appeared the locusts From the Soudan they came in tremendous hosts black clouds of them that obscured the sun It seemed as if Nature had joined in the conspiracy against us These locusts were of the species known as the pilgrim or wandering locust for forty years they had not come to Palestine but now their visitation was like that of which the prophet Joel speaks in the Old Testament They came full grown ripe for breeding the ground was covered with the females digging in the soil and depositing their egg packets and we knew that when they hatched we should be overwhelmed for there was not a foot of ground in which these eggs were not to be found The menace was so great that even the military authorities were obliged to take notice of it They realized that if it were allowed to fulfill itself there would be famine in the land and the army would suffer with the rest Djemal Pasha summoned my brother the President of the Agricultural Experiment Station at Athlit and intrusted him with the organization of a campaign against the insects It was a hard enough task The Arabs are lazy and fatalistic besides they cannot understand why men should attempt to fight the Djesh Allah God s Army as they call the locusts In addition my brother was seriously handicapped by lack of petroleum galvanized iron and other articles which could not be obtained because of the Allies blockade In spite of these drawbacks however he attempted to work up a scientific campaign Djemal Pasha put some thousands of Arab soldiers at his disposition and these were set to work digging trenches into which the hatching locusts were driven and destroyed This is the only means of coping with the situation once the locusts get their wings nothing can be done with them It was a hopeless fight Nothing short of the cooeperation of every farmer in the country could have won the day and while the people of the progressive Jewish villages struggled on to the end men women and children working in the fields until they were exhausted the Arab farmers sat by with folded hands The threats of the military authorities only stirred them to half hearted efforts Finally after two months of toil the campaign was given up and the locusts broke in waves over the countryside destroying everything As the prophet Joel said The field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth The land is as the garden of Eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness Not only was every green leaf devoured but the very bark was peeled from the trees which stood out white and lifeless like skeletons The fields were stripped to the ground and the old men of our villages who had given their lives to cultivating these gardens and vineyards came out of the synagogues where they had been praying and wailing and looked on the ruin with dimmed eyes Nothing was spared The insects in their fierce hunger tried to engulf everything in their way I have seen Arab babies left by their mothers in the shade of some tree whose faces had been devoured by the oncoming swarms of locusts before their screams had been heard I have seen the carcasses of animals hidden from sight by the undulating rustling blanket of insects And in the face of such a menace the Arabs remained inert With their customary fatalism they accepted the locust plague as a necessary evil They could not understand why we were so frantic to fight it And as a matter of fact they really got a good deal out of the locusts for they loved to feast upon the female insects They gathered piles of them and threw them upon burning charcoal then squatting around the fire devoured the roasted insects with great gusto I saw a fourteen year old boy eat as many as a hundred at a sitting CHAPTER VIII THE LEBANON During the locust invasion my brother sent me on an inspection tour to investigate the ravages of the insect in Syria With an official boyouroulton passport in my pocket I was able to travel all over the country without being interfered with by the military authorities I had an excellent opportunity to see what was going on everywhere The locusts had destroyed everything from as far south as the Egyptian desert to the Lebanon Mountains on the north but the locust was not the only nor the worst plague that the people had to complain of The plundering under the name of military requisitions the despotic rule of the army officers and the general insecurity were even more desolating As I proceeded on my journey northward I hoped to find consolation and brighter prospects in the independent province of the Lebanon Few Americans know just what the Lebanon is From the repeated allusions in the Bible most people imagine it to be nothing but a mountain The truth is that a beautiful province of about four thousand square miles bears that name The population of the Lebanon consists of a Christian sect called Maronites and the Druses the latter a people with a secret religion the esoteric teachings of which are known only to the initiated and never divulged to outsiders Both these peoples are sturdy handsome folk Through the machinations of the Turks whose policy is always to divide and rule the Maronites were continually fighting against the Druses In eighteen sixty Turkish troops joined with the Druses and fell upon the Maronites with wholesale massacres that spread as far south as Damascus where ten thousand Christians were killed in two days ILLUSTRATION THE CHRISTIAN TOWN OF ZAHLEH IN THE LEBANON The European powers were moved at last Fifty warships were sent to Beirut and ten thousand French troops were landed in the Lebanon to create order Under the pressure of the European powers the Sublime Porte was forced to grant an autonomy for the province of the Lebanon The French English German Russian Austrian and a year later the Italian Governments were signing the guaranty of this autonomy Since then the Lebanon has had peace The Governor of the province must always be a Christian but the General Council of the Lebanon includes representatives of all the different races and religions of the population A wonderful development began with the liberation from Turkish oppression Macadamized roads were built all over the province agriculture was improved and there was complete safety for life and property There is a proverb now in Palestine and Syria which says In the Lebanon a virgin may travel alone at midnight and be safe and a purse of gold dropped in the road at midday will never be stolen And the proverb told the literal truth When one crossed the boundary from Turkish Palestine into the Lebanon province what a change met his eyes peaceful and prosperous villages schools filled with children immense plantations of mulberry trees and olives the slopes of the mountains terraced with beautiful vineyards a handsome and sturdy population police on every road to help the stranger and young girls and women with happy laugh and chatter working in the fields With a population of about six hundred thousand this province exported annually two million dollars worth of raw silk silkworm raising being a specialty of the Lebanon When autonomy was granted the Lebanon French influence became predominant among the Maronites and other Christians of the province French is spoken by almost all of them and love for France is a deep rooted sentiment of the people On the other hand the Druses feel the English influence For the last sixty years England has been the friend of the Druses and they have not forgotten it It may be worth while to tell in a few words the story of one man who accomplished wonders in spreading the influence of his country Sir Richard Wood was born in London a son of Catholic parents From his early boyhood he aspired to enter the diplomatic service The East attracted him strongly and in order to learn Arabic he went with another young Englishman to live in the Lebanon In Beirut they sought the hospitality of the Maronite patriarch For a few days they were treated with lavish hospitality and then the patriarch summoned them before him and told them that they must leave the city within twenty four hours The reason for their disgrace they discovered later Not suspecting that they were being put to the test they had eaten meat on a Friday and this made the patriarch think that they were not true Catholics but were there as spies Leaving Beirut in haste Wood and his friend sought shelter with the Druses who received them with open arms For two years Wood lived among the Druses in the village of Obey There he learned Arabic and became thoroughly acquainted with the country and with the ways of the Druses and there he conceived the idea of winning the Druses for England to counteract the influence of the French Maronites He went back to London where he succeeded in impressing his views upon the Foreign Office and he returned to Syria charged with a secret mission Before long he persuaded the Druse chieftains to address a petition to England asking for British protection British protection was granted and for over thirty years Richard Wood virtually single handed shaped the destiny of Syria It was he who broke the power of Ibrahim Pasha the son of Mehemet Ali it was he who guided Admiral Stopford in the bombardment of Beirut it was he again who brought about the landing of English troops in Syria in eighteen forty one we find him afterwards in Damascus as British Consul and wherever he went he was always busy spreading English power and prestige He understood the East thoroughly and felt that England must be strong in Syria if she wished to retain her imperial power It is very unfortunate that the policy of Sir Richard Wood was not carried out by his nation It was with high hopes and expectations that I approached the Lebanon I was looking forward to the moment when I should find myself among people who were free from the Turkish yoke in a country where I should be able to breathe freely for a few hours But how great was my consternation when on entering the Lebanon I found on all the roads Turkish soldiers who stopped me every minute to ask for my papers Even then I could not realize that the worst had happened Of course rumors of the Turkish occupation of the Lebanon had reached us a few weeks before but we had not believed it as we knew that Germany and Austria were among those who guaranteed the autonomy of the Lebanon It was true however the scrap of paper that guaranteed the freedom of the Lebanon had proved of no more value to the Lebanese than had that other scrap of paper to Belgium As I entered the beautiful village of Ed Damur one of the most prosperous and enchanting places on earth I saw entire regiments of Turkish troops encamped in and about the village While I was watering my horse I tried to ask questions from a few inhabitants My fair hair and complexion and my khaki costume made them take me for a German and they barely answered me but when I addressed them in French their faces lit up For the Lebanon for all it is thousands of miles away from France is nevertheless like a French province For fifty years the French language and French culture have taken hold of the Lebanon No Frenchman has more love for and faith in France than lie in the hearts of the Lebanese Christians They have never forgotten that when massacres were threatening to wipe out all the Christians of the Lebanon ten thousand French soldiers swept over the mountains to spread peace life and French gayety And when the poor people heard the language they loved and when they found out that I too was the son of an oppressed and ruined community all the sadness and bitterness of their hearts was told me how the Turkish soldiers had spread over the beloved mountains of Lebanon how the strong stalwart young Lebanese had been taken away from the mountains and forced into the Turkish army how the girls and women were hiding in their homes afraid to be seen by the soldiers and their officers how the chieftains were imprisoned and even hanged and how violence and pillage had spread over the peaceful country Footnote Since the above was written the American press has chronicled many atrocities committed in the Lebanon The execution of leaders and the complete blockade of the mountains by the Turkish authorities resulted in the starving of eighty thousand Lebanese The French Government has warned Turkey through the American Ambassador that the Turks will be held accountable for their deeds I could not help wondering at the mistakes of the Allies If they had understood the situation in Palestine and Syria how differently this war might have eventuated The Lebanon and Syria would have raised a hundred thousand picked men if the Allies had landed in Palestine The Lebanon would have fought for its independence as heroically as did the Belgians Even the Arab population would have welcomed the Allies as liberators But alas With a saddened heart I pursued my journey into Beirut My coming was a joyful surprise to my sister Many sad things had happened since she had last seen me During my imprisonment she had suffered tortures not knowing what would happen to me and now that she saw me alive she cried from happiness She told me how kindly she had been treated by President Bliss of the Syrian Protestant College and of all the good things the college had done What a blessing the college was for the people of Beirut Many unfortunate people were saved from prison and hardships through the intervention of President Bliss He never tired of rendering service wonderful personal service But alas even his influence and power began to wane The American prestige in the country was broken and the Turkish Government no longer respected the American flag An order issued from Constantinople demanded that the official language of the college be Turkish instead of English and Turkish officers even dared to enter the college premises to search for citizens belonging to the belligerent nations without troubling to ask permission from the American Consul ILLUSTRATION HAIFA CHAPTER IX A ROBBER BARON OF PALESTINE Beirut is a city of about two hundred thousand inhabitants half of whom are Christians and the rest Mohammedans and Jews The pinch of hunger was already felt there Bread was to be had only on tickets issued by the Government and prices in general were extremely high The population were discontented and turbulent and every day thousands of women came before the governor s residence to cry and protest against the scarcity of bread The Allies warships often passed near the town but the people were not afraid of them for it was known that the Allies had no intention of bombarding the cities Only once had a bombardment taken place Toward the end of March nineteen fifteen a French warship approached the bay of Haifa and landed an officer with a letter to the commandant of that town giving notice of his intention to bombard the German Consulate at three P M sharp This was in retaliation for the propaganda carried on by the consul Leutweld von Hardegg and chiefly because of his desecration of the grave of Bonaparte s soldiers The consul had time to pack up his archives and valuables and he left his house before three The bombardment began exactly at three Fifteen shells were fired with a wonderful precision Not one house in the neighborhood of the consulate was touched but the consulate itself was a heap of ruins after a few shells had struck it The population was exceedingly calm Only the German colony was panic stricken and on every German house an American flag was raised It was rather humorous to see all the Germans who were active in the Turkish army in one capacity or another seek safety by means of this trick This bombardment had a sobering effect upon the Mohammedan population They saw that the Allies were not wholly ignorant of what was going on in the country and that they could retaliate and safety for the non Mohammedans increased accordingly In general Beirut was a rather quiet and safe place The presence of an American cruiser in the port had much to do with that The American sailors were allowed to come ashore three times a week and they spent their money lavishly It was estimated that Beirut was getting more than five thousand dollars a week out of them But the natives were especially impressed by the manliness and quick action of the American boys Frequently a few sailors were involved in a street fight with scores of Arabs and they always held their own In a short time the Americans became feared which in the Orient is equivalent to saying they were respected The Beirut people are famous for their fighting spirit but this spirit was not manifested after a few weeks of intimate acquaintance with the American blue jackets My inspection of the devastation caused by the locusts completed I returned home The news that greeted me there was alarming I must narrate with some detail the events which finally decided me to leave the country About one hour s ride on horseback from our village lives a family of Turkish nobles the head of which was Sadik Pasha brother of the famous Kiamil Pasha several times Grand Vizier of the Empire Sadik who had been exiled from Constantinople came to Palestine and bought great tracts of land near my people After his death his sons good for nothing wild fellows were forced to sell most of the estate all except one Fewzi Bey who retained his part of the land and lived on it Here he collected a band of friends as worthless as himself and gradually commenced a career of plundering and frightfulness much like that of the robber barons of mediaeval Germany Before the outbreak of the war he confined his attentions chiefly to the Arabs whom he treated shamefully He raided cattle and crops and carried off girls and women in broad daylight On one occasion he stopped a wedding procession and carried off the young bride Then he seized the bridegroom against whom he bore a grudge and subjected the poor Bedouin to the bastinado until he consented to divorce his wife by pronouncing the words I divorce thee three times in the presence of witnesses according to Mohammedan custom This Bedouin was the grandson of the Sheikh Hilou a holy man of the region upon whose grave the Arabs are accustomed to make their prayers But we villagers of Zicron Jacob had never submitted to Fewzi Bey in any way our young men were organized and armed and after a few encounters he let us alone After the mobilization however and the taking away of our arms this outlaw saw that his chance had come He began to send his men and his camels into our fields to harvest our crops and carry them off This pillage continued until the locusts came Fewzi in the mean while becoming so bold that he would gallop through the streets of our village with his horsemen shooting right and left into the air and insulting old men and women He boasted apparently with reason that the authorities at Haifa were powerless to touch him ILLUSTRATION HAIFA AND THE BAY OF AKKA LOOKING EAST FROM MOUNT CARMEL There was one hope left Djemal Pasha had boasted that he had introduced law and order the country was under military rule it remained to see what he would say and do when the crimes of Fewzi Bey were brought to his notice Accordingly armed with my boyouroulton or passport of a locust inspector I rode to Jerusalem where I procured through my brother who was then in favor an interview with Djemal Pasha He received me on the very day of my arrival and listened attentively while for a whole hour I poured out the story of Fewzi Bey s outrages I put my whole heart into the plea and wound up by asking if it was to the credit of the progressive Young Turks to shelter feudal abuses of a bygone age Djemal seemed to be impressed He sprang from his chair began walking up and down the room then with a great dramatic gesture he exclaimed Justice shall be rendered and assured me that a commission of army officers would be sent at once to start an investigation I returned to Zicron Jacob with high hopes Sure enough a few days later Fewzi Bey was summoned to Jerusalem at the same time the commission which had dwindled to one single officer on secret mission put in an appearance and began to make inquiries among the natives He got little satisfaction at first for they lived in mortal terror of the outlaw they grew bolder however when they learned his purpose Complaints and testimonies came pouring in and in four days the officer had the names of hundreds of witnesses establishing no less than fifty two crimes of the most serious nature Fewzi s friends and relatives in the mean while were doing their utmost to stem the tide of accusations The Kaimakam lieutenant governor of Haifa came in person to our village and threatened the elders with all sorts of severities if they did not retract the charges they had made But they stood firm Had not Djemal Pasha commander in chief of the armies in Palestine given his word of honor that we should have redress We were soon shown the depth of our naivete in fancying that justice could be done in Turkey by a Turk Fewzi Bey came back from Jerusalem not in convict s clothes but in the uniform of a Turkish officer Djemal Pasha had commissioned him commandant of the Moujahaddeen religious militia of the entire region It was bad enough to stand him as an outlaw now we had to submit to him as an officer He came riding into our village daily ordering everybody about and picking me out for distinguished spitefulness My position soon became unbearable I was of course known as the organizer of the young men s union which for so long had put up a spirited resistance to Fewzi I was still looked upon as a leader of the younger spirits and I knew that sooner or later Fewzi would try to make good his threat often repeated that he would shoot me like a dog It was hardly likely that an open attempt on my life would be made When Ambassador Morgenthau visited Palestine he had stayed in our village and given my family the evidence of his sincere friendship These things count in the East and I soon got the reputation of having influential friends However there were other ways of disposing of me One evening about sunset while I was riding through a valley near our village my horse shied violently in passing a clump of bushes I gave him the spur and turned and rode toward the bushes just in time to see a horseman dash out wildly with a rifle across his saddle I kept the incident to myself but I was more cautious and kept my eyes open wherever I went One afternoon a fortnight later as I was riding to Hedera another Jewish village two hours ride away a shot was fired from behind a sand dune The bullet burned a hole in the lapel of my coat That night I had a long talk with my brother There was no doubt whatever in his mind that I should try to leave the country while I on the contrary could not bear to think of deserting my people at the crisis of their fortunes It was a beautiful night such a night I think as only Palestine can show a white serene moon bathed night The roar of the Mediterranean came out of the stillness as if to remind us that help and salvation could come only from the sea the sea upon which scores of the warships of the Allies were sailing back and forth We had argued into the small hours before I yielded to his persuasion ILLUSTRATION THE BAZAAR OF JAFFA ON A MARKET DAY CHAPTER X A RASH ADVENTURE It was all very well to decide to leave the country to get safely away was a different matter There were two ways out One of these the land route by Constantinople could not be considered The other way was to board one of the American cruisers which by order of Ambassador Morgenthau were empowered to assist citizens of neutral countries to leave the Ottoman Empire These cruisers had already done wonderful rescue work for the Russian Jews in Palestine who when war was declared were to have been sent to the Mesopotamian town of Urfa there to suffer massacre and outrage like the Armenians This was prevented by mister Morgenthau s strenuous representations with the result that these Russian Jews were gathered together as in a great drag net and herded to Jaffa amidst suffering unspeakable There they were met by the American cruisers which were to transport them to Egypt Up to the very moment when they set foot on the friendly warships they were robbed and horribly abused by the Jaffa boatmen The eternal curse of the Wandering Jew Driven from Russia they come to seek shelter in Turkey Turkey then casts them from her under pretext that they are loyal to Russia Truly the Jew lifts his eyes to the mountains asking the ancient and still unanswered question Whence shall come my help The Turkish Government later repented of its leniency in allowing these Russian Jews to escape and gave orders that only neutrals should leave the country and then only under certain conditions I was not a neutral my first papers of American citizenship were valueless to further my escape I had heard however that the United States cruiser Tennessee was to call at Jaffa and I determined to get aboard her by hook or by crook One evening as soon as darkness had fallen I bade a sorrowful farewell to my people and set off for Jaffa traveling only by night and taking out of the way paths to avoid the pickets for now that the locust campaign was over my boyouroulton was useless At dawn two days later I slipped into Jaffa by way of the sand dunes and went to the house of a friend whom I could trust to help me in every possible way and begged him to find me a passport for a neutral He set off in search and I waited all day at his house consumed with impatience and anxiety At last toward evening my friend returned but the news he brought was not cheering He had found a passport indeed but his report of the rigors of the inspection at the wharf was such as to make it clear that the chances of my getting through on a false passport were exceedingly slim since I was well known in Jaffa If I were caught in such an undertaking it might mean death for me and punishment for the friends who had helped me Evidently this plan was not feasible All that night I racked my brain for a solution Finally I decided to stake everything on what appeared to be my only chance The Tennessee was due on the next day but one early in the morning I gave my friend the name of a boatman who was under obligations to me and had sworn to be my friend for life or death Even under the circumstances I hesitated to trust a Mohammedan but it seemed the only thing to do I had no choice left My friend brought the boatman and I put my plan before him appealing to his daring and his sense of honor I wanted him to take me at midnight in his fishing boat from an isolated part of the coast and wait for the appearance of the Tennessee then on her arrival amid the scramble of boats full of refugees I was to jump aboard while he would return with the other boats The poor fellow tried to remonstrate pointing out the dangers and what he called rightly enough doubtless the folly of the plan I stuck to it however making it clear that his part would be well paid for and at last he consented and we arranged a meeting place behind the sand dunes by the shore I put a few personal belongings into a little suit case and had my friend give it to one of the refugees who was to sail on the Tennessee If I succeeded I was to recover it when we reached Egypt The only thing I took with me was the paper which declared my intention of becoming an American citizen the first paper From this document I was determined not to part I shall not tell how I kept it on me as the means I used may still be used by others in concealing such papers and a disclosure of the secret might bring disaster to them Suffice it to say that I had the paper with me and that no search would have brought it to light Arrived next morning at the appointed place I gave the signal agreed upon the whine of a jackal and after repeating it again and again I heard a very low and muffled answer My boatman was there I had some fear that he might have betrayed me and that I should presently see a soldier or policeman leap out of the little boat but my fears proved groundless the man was faithful ILLUSTRATION STORMY SEA BREAKING OVER ROCKS OFF JAFFA We rowed out quietly our boat a little nutshell on the tossing waves But I was relieved the elements did not frighten me on the contrary I felt secure and refreshed in the midst of the sea When morning began to dawn scores of little boats came out of the harbor and circled about waiting for the cruiser This was our chance I crouched in the bottom of our boat and to all appearances my boatman was engaged merely in fishing After I had lain there over an hour with my heart beating like a drum and with small hopes for the success of my undertaking I heard at last the whistle of the approaching cruiser followed by a Babel of mad shouting and cursing among the boatmen In the confusion I felt it safe to sit up No one paid the slightest attention to me All were engaged in a wild race to reach and mount the Tennessee s ladder I scrambled up with the rest and when on the deck an officer demanded my passport I put on a bold front and asked him to tell Captain Decker that mister Aaronsohn wished to see him Ten minutes later I stood in the captain s cabin There I unfolded my story and wound up by asking him if under the circumstances my first papers might not entitle me to protection As I spoke I could see the struggle that was going on within him When he answered it was to explain with the utmost kindness that if he took me aboard his ship it would be to forfeit his word of honor to the Turkish Government his pledge to take only citizens of neutral countries that he could not consider me an American on the strength of my first papers and that any such evasion might lead to serious complications for him and for his Government Well there was nothing for me to do but to withdraw and go back to Jaffa to face trial for an attempt to escape When I reached the deck again I found it swarming with refugees many of whom knew me and came up to congratulate me on getting away I could only shake my head and with death in my heart descend the Tennessee s ladder It did not matter now what boat I took Any boatman was eager enough to take me for a few cents As I sat in the boat every stroke of the oars bringing me nearer to the shore and to what I felt was inevitable captivity a great bitterness swelled my heart I was tired utterly tired of all the dangers and trials I had been going through for the last months From depression I sank into despair and out of despair came strange to say a great serenity the serenity of despair On the quay I ran into Hassan Bey commandant of the police who was superintending the embarkation of refugees I knew him and he knew me Half an hour later I was in police headquarters under examination by Hassan Bey I was desperate and answered him recklessly A seasick man is indifferent to shipwreck This was the substance of our conversation How did you get aboard the ship In a boat with some refugees A woman hid me with her skirts So you were trying to escape were you If I had been I shouldn t have come back Then what did you do on the cruiser I went to talk to the captain who is a friend of mine My life is in danger Fewzi Bey is after me and I wanted my friends in America to know how justice is done in Palestine Who are your friends in America Men who could break you in a minute Do you know to whom you are speaking Yes Hassan Bey I am sick of persecution I wish you would hang me with your own hands as you hanged the young Christian my friends would have your life for mine I wonder now how I dared to speak to him in this manner But the bluff carried Hassan Bey looked at me curiously for a moment then smiled and offered me a cigarette assuring me that he believed me a loyal citizen and declaring he felt deeply hurt that I had not come to him for permission to visit the cruiser We parted with a profusion of Eastern compliments and that evening I started back to Zicron Jacob ILLUSTRATION THE AUTHOR S SISTER ON HER HORSE TAYAR CHAPTER XI ESCAPE The failure of my attempt to leave the country only sharpened my desire to make another trial The danger of the enterprise tended to reconcile me to deserting my family and comrades and seeking safety for myself As I racked my brain for a promising plan a letter came from my sister in Beirut with two pieces of news which were responsible for my final escape The American College was shortly to close for the summer and the U S S Chester was to sail for Alexandria with refugees aboard Beirut is a four days trip from our village and roads are unsafe It was out of the question to permit my sister to come home alone and it was impossible for any of us to get leave to go after her nor did we want to have her at home in the unsettled condition of the country I began wondering if I could not possibly get to Beirut and get my sister aboard the Chester which offered perhaps the last opportunity to go out with the refugees It would be a difficult undertaking but it might be our only chance and I quickly made up my mind to carry it out if it were a possible thing I had to act immediately no time was to be lost for no one could tell how soon the Chester might sail My last adventure had been entered upon with forebodings but now I felt that I should succeed To us Orientals intuition speaks in very audible tones and we are trained from childhood to listen to its voice It was with a feeling of confidence in the outcome therefore that I bade this second good bye to my family and dearest friends Solemn hours they were these hours of farewell hours that needed few words Then once more I slipped out into the night to make my secret way to Beirut It was about midnight when I left home dressed in a soldier s uniform and driving a donkey before me I traveled only by night and spent each day in hiding in some cave or narrow valley where I could sleep with some measure of security For food I had brought bread dried figs and chocolate and water was always to be found in little springs and pools In these clear warm nights I used to think of David a fugitive and pursued by his enemies How well I could now understand his despairing cry How long wilt thou forget me O Lord for ever How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me Five nights I journeyed and at last one morning beautiful Beirut appeared in the distance and I found myself in the forest of pines that leads into the city The fresh dawn was filled with the balmy breath of the pines and all the odors of the Lebanon Driving my donkey before me I boldly approached the first picket house and saluted the non commissioned officer in military fashion He stopped me and asked whence I came and where I was going I smiled sweetly and replied that I was the orderly of a German officer who was surveying the country a few hours to the south and that I was going to Beirut for provisions Then I lighted a cigarette and sat down for a chat After discussing politics and the war for a few minutes I jumped up exclaiming that if I didn t hurry I should be late and so took my departure It was all so simple and it brought me safely to Beirut My donkey having served the purpose for which I had brought him was speedily abandoned and I hurried to a friend s house where I exchanged my uniform for the garb of a civilian My sister was the most surprised person on earth when she saw me walking into her room and when I told her that I wanted her to go with me on the Chester she thought me crazy for she knew that hundreds of persons were trying in vain to find means of leaving the country and it seemed to her impossible that we who were Turkish subjects could succeed in outwitting the authorities Even when I had explained my plans and she was willing to admit the possibility of success she still felt doubts as to whether it would be right for her to leave the country while her friends were left behind in danger I assured her however that our family would feel relieved to know that we were in safety and could come back fresh and strong after the war to help in rebuilding the country Having gained her consent I still had the difficult problem of ways and means before me The Chester had orders to take citizens of neutral countries only Passports had to be examined by the Turkish authorities and by the American Consul General who gave the final permission to board the cruiser How was I to pass this double scrutiny After long and arduous search with the assistance of several good friends I at last discovered a man who was willing to sell me the passports of a young couple belonging to a neutral nation I cannot go into particulars about this arrangement of course Suffice it to say that my sister was to travel as my wife and that we both had to disguise ourselves so as to answer the descriptions on the passports When I went to the American Consulate General to get the permit I found the building crowded with people of all nations Spanish and Greek and Dutch and Swiss all waiting for the precious little papers that should take them aboard the American cruiser that haven of liberty and safety The Chester was to take all these people to Alexandria and those who had the means were to be charged fifty cents a day for their food From behind my dark goggles I recognized many a person in disguise like myself and seeking escape We never betrayed recognition for fear of the spies who infested the place After securing my permit I ran downstairs and straight to my consul whose dragoman I took along with me to the seraya or government building Of course the dragoman was well tipped and he helped me considerably in hastening the examination I had to undergo at the hands of the Turkish officials All went well and I hurried back to my sister triumphant The Chester was to sail in two days but while we were waiting the alarming news came that the American Consul had been advised that the British Government refused to permit the landing of the refugees in Egypt and that the departure of the Chester was indefinitely postponed With a sinking at my heart I rushed up to the American Consulate for details and there learned that the U S S Des Moines was to sail in a few hours for Rhodes with Italian and Greek refugees and that I could go on her if I wished In a few minutes I had my permit changed for the trip on the Des Moines and I hurried home to my sister We hastily got together the few belongings we were to take with us jumped into a carriage and drove to the harbor We had still another ordeal to go through My sister was taken into a private room and thoroughly searched so was I Nobody could leave the country with more than twenty five dollars in cash on his person Our baggage was carefully overhauled No papers or books could be taken My sister s Bible was looked upon with much suspicion since it contained a map of ancient Canaan I explained that this was necessary for the orientation of our prayers and that without it we could not tell in which direction to turn our faces when praying This seemed plausible to the Moslem examiners and saved the Bible the only book we now possess as a souvenir from home Now our passports were examined again and several questions were asked My sister was brave and self possessed cool and unconcerned in manner and at last the final signature was affixed and we jumped into the little boat that was to take us out to the ship At this moment a man approached a dry goods dealer of whom my sister had made some purchases a few months before He seemed to recognize her and he asked her in German if she were not Miss Aaronsohn I felt my blood leave my face and looking him straight in the eye I whispered If you say one word more you will be a dead man so help me God He must have felt that I meant exactly what I said for he walked off mumbling unintelligibly At last the boat got away and five minutes later we were mounting the side of the Des Moines Throngs of refugees covered the decks of the cruiser Their faces showed tension and anxiety Their presence there seemed too good to be true and all awaited the moment when the ship should heave anchor A Filipino sailor showed us about and as he spoke Italian I told him I wanted to be hidden somewhere till the ship got under way I felt that even yet we were not entirely safe That my fears were justified I discovered shortly when from our hiding place I saw the shopkeeper approaching in a small boat with a Turkish officer They looked over all the refugees on the deck but searched for us in vain After a half hour more of uncomfortable tension the engines began to sputter the propellers revolved and we were safe ILLUSTRATION BEIRUT FROM THE DECK OF AN OUTGOING STEAMER The day was dying and a beautiful twilight softened the outlines of the Lebanon and the houses of Beirut The Mediterranean lay quiet and peaceful around us and the healthy sturdy American sailors gave a feeling of confidence As the cruiser drew out of the harbor a great cry of farewell arose from the refugees on board a cry in which was mingled the relief of being free anguish at leaving behind parents and friends fear and hope for the future A little later the sailors were lined up in arms to salute the American flag when it was lowered for the night Moved by a powerful instinct of love and respect all the refugees jumped to their feet the men bareheaded and the women with folded hands and in that moment I understood as I had never understood before the real sacred meaning of a flag To all those people standing in awe about that piece of cloth bearing the stars and stripes America was an incarnation of love universal of freedom and salvation The cool Syrian night our first night on the cruiser was spent in songs hymns and conversation We were all too excited to sleep Friends discovered friends and tales of woe were exchanged stories of hardship injustice oppression all of which ended with mutual congratulations on escaping from the clutches of the Turks THE END End of Project Gutenberg s With the Turks in Palestine by Alexander Aaronsohn END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WITH THE TURKS IN PALESTINE This file

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW
