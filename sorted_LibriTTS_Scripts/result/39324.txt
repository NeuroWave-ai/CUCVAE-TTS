MOON two hundred ninety nine THE LOVE OF ROMANCE three hundred nine THE LITERARY SENSE THE UNFAITHFUL LOVER SHE was going to meet her lover And the fact that she was to meet him at Cannon Street Station would almost she feared make the meeting itself banal sordid She would have liked to meet him in some green cool orchard where daffodils swung in the long grass and primroses stood on frail stiff little pink stalks in the wet scented moss of the hedgerow The time should have been May She herself should have been a poem a lyric in a white gown and green scarf coming to him through the long grass under the blossomed boughs Her hands should have been full of bluebells and she should have held them up to his face in maidenly defence as he sprang forward to take her in his arms You see that she knew exactly how a tryst is conducted in the pages of the standard poets and of the cheaper weekly journals She had to the full limit allowed of her reading and her environment the literary sense When she was a child she never could cry long because she always wanted to see herself cry in the glass and then of course the tears always stopped Now that she was a young woman she could never be happy long because she wanted to watch her heart s happiness and it used to stop then just as the tears had He had asked her to meet him at Cannon Street he had something to say to her and at home it was difficult to get a quiet half hour because of her little sisters And curiously enough she was hardly curious at all about what he might have to say She only wished for May and the orchard instead of January and the dingy dusty waiting room the plain faced preoccupied travellers the dim desolate weather The setting of the scene seemed to her all important Her dress was brown her jacket black and her hat was home trimmed Yet she looked entrancingly pretty to him as he came through the heavy swing doors He would hardly have known her in green and white muslin and an orchard for their love had been born and bred in town Highbury New Park to be exact He came towards her he was five minutes late She had grown anxious as the one who waits always does and she was extremely glad to see him but she knew that a late lover should be treated with a provoking coldness one can relent prettily later on so she gave him a limp hand and no greeting Let s go out he said Shall we walk along the Embankment or go somewhere on the Underground It was bitterly cold but the Embankment was more romantic than a railway carriage He ought to insist on the railway carriage he probably would So she said Oh the Embankment please and felt a sting of annoyance and disappointment when he acquiesced They did not speak again till they had gone through the little back streets past the police station and the mustard factory and were on the broad pavement of Queen Victoria Street He had been late he had offered no excuse no explanation She had done the proper thing she had awaited these with dignified reserve and now she was involved in the meshes of a silence that she could not break How easy it would have been in the orchard She could have snapped off a blossoming branch and and made play with it somehow Then he would have had to say something But here the only thing that occurred to her was to stop and look in one of the shops till he should ask her what she was looking at And how common and mean that would be compared with the blossoming bough and besides the shops they were passing had nothing in the windows except cheap pastry and models of steam engines Why on earth didn t he speak He had never been like this before She stole a glance at him and for the first time it occurred to her that his something to say was not a mere excuse for being alone with her He had something to say something that was trying to get itself said The keen wind thrust itself even inside the high collar of her jacket Her hands and feet were aching with cold How warm it would have been in the orchard I m freezing she said suddenly let s go and have some tea Of course if you like he said uncomfortably yet she could see he was glad that she had broken that desolate silence Seated at a marble table the place was nearly empty she furtively watched his face in the glass and what she saw there thrilled her Some great sorrow had come to him And she had been sulking The girl in the orchard would have known at a glance She would gently tenderly with infinite delicacy and the fine tact of a noble woman have drawn his secret from him She would have shared his sorrow and shown herself half wife half angel from heaven in this dark hour Well it was not too late She could begin now But how He had ordered the tea and her question was still unanswered Yet she must speak When she did her words did not fit the mouth of the girl in the orchard but then it would have been May there and this was January She said How frightfully cold it is

none	none	isn t it he said The fine tact of a noble woman seemed to have deserted her She resisted a little impulse to put her hand in his under the marble table and to say What is it dearest Tell me all about it I can t bear to see you looking so miserable and there was another silence The waitress brought the two thick cups of tea and looked at him with a tepid curiosity As soon as the two were alone again he leaned his elbows on the marble and spoke Look here darling I ve got something to tell you and I hope to God you ll forgive me and stand by me and try to understand that I love you just the same and whatever happens I shall always love you This preamble sent a shiver of dread down her spine What had he done a murder a bank robbery married someone else It was on the tip of her tongue to say that she would stand by him whatever he had done but if he had married someone else this would be improper so she only said Well and she said it coldly Well I went to the Simpsons dance on Tuesday oh why weren t you there Ethel and there was a girl in pink and I danced three or four times with her she was rather like you side face and then after supper in the conservatory I I talked nonsense but only a very little dear and she kept looking at me so as if she expected me to to and so I kissed her And yesterday I had a letter from her and she seems to expect to think and I thought I ought to tell you darling Oh Ethel do try to forgive me I haven t answered her letter Well she said

dear It was hateful of you and I wish you hadn t but I know you re sorry and I m sorry but I forgive you and we ll forget it and you ll never do it again But just in time she remembered that nice girls must not take these things too lightly What opinion would he form of the purity of her mind the innocence of her soul if an incident like this failed to shock her deeply He himself was evidently a prey to the most rending remorse He had told her of the thing as one tells of a crime As the confession of a crime she must receive it How should she know that he had only told her because he feared that she would anyhow hear it through the indiscretion of the girl in pink or of that other girl in blue who had seen and smiled How could she guess that he had tuned his confession to the key of what he believed would be an innocent girl s estimate of his misconduct Following the tingle of relief came a sharp sickening pinch of jealousy and mortification These inspired her I don t wonder you were afraid to tell me she began You don t love me you ve never loved me I was an idiot to believe you did You know I do he said it was hateful of me but I couldn t help it Those four true words wounded her more than all the rest Couldn t help it Then how can I ever trust you Even if we were married I could never be sure you weren t kissing some horrid girl or other No it s no use I can never never forgive you and it s all over And I believed in you so and trusted you I thought you were the soul of honour He could not say And so I am on the whole which was what he thought Her tears were falling hot and fast between face and veil for she had talked till she was very sorry indeed for herself Forgive me dear he said Then she rose to the occasion Never she said her eyes flashing through her tears You ve deceived me once you d do it again No it s all over you ve broken my heart and destroyed my faith in human nature I hope I shall never see you again Some day you ll understand what you ve done and be sorry Do you think I m not sorry now She wished that they were at home and not in this horrible tea shop under the curious eyes of the waitresses At home she could at least have buried her face in the sofa cushions and resisted all his pleading at last perhaps letting him take one cold passive hand and shower frantic kisses upon it He would come to morrow however and then At present the thing to compass was a dignified parting Good bye she said I m going home And it s good bye for ever No it s only painful for both of us There s no more to be said you ve betrayed me I didn t think a decent man could do such things She was pulling on her gloves Go home and gloat over it all And that poor girl you ve broken her heart too This really was a master stroke of nobility He stood up suddenly Do you mean it he said and his tone should have warned her Are you really going to throw me over for a thing like this The anger in his eyes frightened her and the misery of his face wrung her heart but how could she say No of course I m not I m only talking as I know good girls ought to talk So she said Yes Good bye He stood up suddenly Then good bye he said and may God forgive you as I do And he strode down between the marble tables and out by the swing door It was a very good exit At the corner he remembered that he had gone away without paying for the tea and his natural impulse was to go back and remedy that error And if he had they would certainly have made it up But how could he go back to say We are parting for ever but still I must insist on the sad pleasure of paying for our tea for the last time He checked the silly impulse What was tea and the price of tea in this cataclysmic overthrowing of the Universe So she waited for him in vain and at last paid for the tea herself and went home to wait there and there too in vain for he never came back to her He loved her with all his heart and he also had what she had never suspected in him the literary sense Therefore he never dreaming that the literary sense had inspired her too perceived that to the jilted lover two courses only are possible suicide or the front So he enlisted and went to South Africa and he never came home covered with medals and glory which was rather his idea to the few simple words of explanation that would have made all straight and repaid her and him for all the past Because Destiny is almost without the literary sense and Destiny carelessly decreed that he should die of enteric in a wretched hut without so much as hearing a gun fired Literary to the soul she has taken no other lover but mourns him faithfully to this hour Yet perhaps after all that is not because of the literary sense It may be because she loved him I think I have not mentioned before that she did love him ROUNDING OFF A SCENE A SOFT rain was falling Umbrellas swayed and gleamed in the light of the street lamps The brightness of the shop windows reflected itself in the muddy mirror of the wet pavements A miserable night a dreary night a night to tempt the wretched to the glimmering Embankment and thence to the river hardly wetter or cleaner than the gutters of the London streets Yet the sight of these same streets was like wine in the veins to a man who drove through them in a hansom piled with Gladstone bags and P and O trunks He leaned over the apron of the hansom and looked eagerly longingly lovingly at every sordid detail the crowd on the pavement its haste as intelligible to him as the rush of ants when their hill is disturbed by the spade the glory and glow of corner public houses the shifting dance of the gleaming wet umbrellas It was England it was London it was home and his heart swelled till he felt it in his throat After ten years the dream realised the longing appeased London and all was said His cab delayed by a red newspaper cart jammed in altercative contact with a dray full of brown barrels paused in Cannon Street The eyes that drank in the scene perceived a familiar face watching on the edge of the pavement for a chance to cross the road under the horses heads the face of one who ten years ago had been the slightest of acquaintances Now time and home longing juggled with memory till the face seemed that of a friend To meet a friend this did indeed round off the scene of the home coming The man in the cab threw back the doors and leapt out He crossed under the very nose bag of a stationed dray horse He wrung the friend last seen as an acquaintance by the hand The friend caught fire at the contact Any passer by who should have been spared a moment for observation by the cares of umbrella and top hat had surely said Damon and Pythias and gone onward smiling in sympathy with friends long severed and at last reunited The little scene ended in a cordial invitation from the impromptu Damon on the pavement to Pythias of the cab to a little dance that evening at Damon s house out Sydenham way Pythias accepted with enthusiasm though at his normal temperature he was no longer a dancing man The address was noted hands clasped again with strenuous cordiality and Pythias regained his hansom It set him down at the hotel from which ten years before he had taken cab to Fenchurch Street Station The menu of his dinner had been running in his head like a poem all through the wet shining streets He ordered therefore without hesitation Ox tail Soup Boiled Cod and Oyster Sauce Roast Beef and Horse radish Boiled Potatoes Brussels Sprouts Cabinet Pudding Stilton Celery The cabinet pudding was the waiter s suggestion Anything that called itself pudding would have pleased as well He dressed hurriedly and when the soup and the wine card appeared together before him he ordered draught bitter a pint And bring it in a tankard said he The drive to Sydenham was if possible a happier dream than had been the drive from Fenchurch Street to Charing Cross There were many definite reasons why he should have been glad to be in England glad to leave behind him the hard work of his Indian life and to settle down as a landed proprietor But he did not think definite thoughts The whole soul and body of the man were filled and suffused by the glow that transfuses the blood of the schoolboy at the end of the term The lights the striped awning the red carpet of the Sydenham house thrilled and charmed him Park Lane could have lent them no further grace Belgrave Square no more subtle witchery This was England England England He went in The house was pretty with lights and flowers There was music The soft carpeted stair seemed air as he trod it He met his host was led up to girls in blue and girls in pink girls in satin and girls in silk muslin wrote brief precis of their toilets on his programme Then he was brought face to face with a tall dark haired woman in white His host s voice buzzed in his ears and he caught only the last words old friends Then he was left staring straight into the eyes of the woman who ten years ago had been the light of his the woman who had jilted him his vain longing for whom had been the spur to drive him out of England May I have another was all he found to say after the bow the conventional request and the scrawling of two programmes Yes she said and he took two more The girls in pink and blue and silk and satin found him a good but silent dancer On the opening bars of the eighth waltz he stood before her Their steps went together like song and tune just as they had always done And the touch of her hand on his arm thrilled through him in just the old way He had indeed come home There were definite reasons why he should have pleaded a headache or influenza or any lie and have gone away before his second dance with her But the charm of the situation was too great The whole thing was so complete On his very first evening in England to meet her He did not go and half way through their second dance he led her into the little room soft curtained soft cushioned soft lighted at the bend of the staircase Here they sat silent and he fanned her and he assured himself once more that she was more beautiful than ever Her hair which he had known in short fluffy curls lay in soberly waved masses but it was still bright and dark like a chestnut fresh from the husk Her eyes were the same as of old and her hands Her mouth only had changed It was a sad mouth now in repose and he had known it so merry Yet he could not but see that its sadness added to its beauty The lower lip had been perhaps too full too flexible It was set now not in sternness but in a dignified self control He had left a Greuze girl he found a Madonna of Bellini Yet those were the lips he had kissed the eyes that The silence had grown to the point of embarrassment She broke it with his eyes on her Well she said tell me all about yourself There s nothing much to tell My cousin s dead and I m a full fledged squire with estates and things I ve done with the gorgeous East

none	none	But you tell me about yourself What shall I tell you She had taken the fan from him and was furling and unfurling it Tell me he repeated the words slowly tell me the truth It s all over nothing matters now But I ve always been well curious Tell me why you threw me over He yielded without even the form of a struggle to the impulse which he only half understood What he said was true he had been well curious But it was long since anything alive save vanity which is immortal had felt the sting of that curiosity But now sitting beside this beautiful woman who had been so much to him the desire to bridge over the years to be once more in relations with her outside the conventionalities of a ball room to take part with her in some scene discreet yet flavoured by the past with a delicate poignancy came upon him like a strong man armed It held him but through a veil and he did not see its face If he had seen it it would have shocked him very much Tell me he said softly tell me now at last Still she was silent Tell me he said again why did you do it How was it you found out so very suddenly and surely that we weren t suited to each other that was the phrase wasn t it Do you really want to know It s not very amusing is it raking out dead fires Yes I do want to know I ve wanted it every day since he said earnestly As you say it s all ancient history But you used not to be stupid Are you sure the real reason never occurred to you Never What was it Yes I know the next waltz is beginning Don t go Cut him whoever he is and stay here and tell me I think I have a right to ask that of you Oh rights she said But it s quite simple I threw you over as you call it because I found out you didn t care for me I not care for you Exactly But even so if you believed it but how could you Even so why not have told me why not have given me a chance His voice trembled Hers was firm I was giving you a chance and I wanted to make sure that you would take it If I d just said You don t care for me you d have said Oh yes I do And we should have been just where we were before Then it wasn t that you were tired of me Oh no she said sedately it wasn t that Then you did you really care for me still even when you sent back the ring and wouldn t see me and went to Germany and wouldn t open my letters and all the rest of it Oh yes she laughed lightly I loved you frightfully all that time It does seem odd now to look back on it doesn t it but I nearly broke my heart over you Then why the devil You mustn t swear she interrupted I never heard you do that before Is it the Indian climate Why did you send me away he repeated Don t I keep telling you Her tone was impatient I found out you didn t care and and I d always despised people who kept other people when they wanted to go And I knew you were too honourable generous soft hearted what shall I say to go for your own sake so I thought for your sake I would make you believe you were to go for mine So you lied to me Not exactly We weren t suited since you didn t love me I didn t love you he echoed again And somehow I d always wanted to do something really noble and I never had the chance So I thought if I set you free from a girl you didn t love and bore the blame myself it would be rather noble And so I did it And did the consciousness of your own nobility sustain you comfortably The sneer was well sneered Well not for long she admitted You see I began to doubt after a while whether it was really my nobleness after all It began to seem like some part in a play that I d learned and played don t you know that sort of dreams where you seem to be reading a book and acting the story in the book at the same time It was a little like that now and then and I got rather tired of myself and my nobleness and I wished I d just told you and had it all out with you and both of us spoken the truth and parted friends That was what I thought of doing at first But then it wouldn t have been noble And I really did want to be noble just as some people want to paint pictures or write poems or climb Alps Come take me back to the ball room It s cold here in the Past But how could he let the curtain be rung down on a scene half finished and so good a scene Ah no tell me he said laying his hand on hers why did you think I didn t love you I knew it Do you remember the last time you came to see me We quarrelled we were always quarrelling but we always made it up That day we made it up as usual but you were still a little bit angry when you went away And then I cried like a fool And then you came back and you remember Go on he said He had bridged the ten years and the scene was going splendidly Go on you must go on You came and knelt down by me she said cheerfully It was as good as a play you took me in your arms and told me you couldn t bear to leave me with the slightest cloud between us You called me your heart s dearest I remember a phrase you d never used before and you said such heaps of pretty things to me And at last when you had to go you swore we should never quarrel again and that came true didn t it Ah but why Well as you went out I saw you pick up your gloves off the table and I knew Knew what Why that it was the gloves you had come back for and not me only when you saw me crying you were sorry for me and determined to do your duty whatever it cost you Don t What s the matter He had caught her wrists in his hands and was scowling angrily at her Good God was that all I did come back for you I never thought of the damned gloves I don t remember them If I did pick them up it must have been mechanically and without noticing And you ruined my life for that He was genuinely angry he was back in the past where he had a right to be angry with her Her eyes grew soft Do you mean to say that I was wrong that it was all my fault that you did love me Love you he said roughly throwing her hands from him of course I loved you I shall always love you I ve never left off loving you It was you who didn t love me It was all your fault He leaned his elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands He was breathing quickly The scene had swept him along in its quickening flow He shut his eyes and tried to catch at something to steady himself some rope by which he could pull himself to land again Suddenly an arm was laid on his neck a face laid against his face Lips touched his hand and her voice incredibly softened and tuned to the key of their love s overture spoke Oh forgive me dear forgive me If you love me still it s too good to be true but if you do ah you do forgive me and we can forget it all Dear forgive me I love you so He was quite still quite silent Can t you forgive me she began again He suddenly stood up I m married he said He drew a long breath and went on hurriedly standing before her but not looking at her I can t ask you to forgive me I shall never forgive myself It doesn t matter she said and she laughed I I wasn t serious I saw you were trying to play the old comedy and I thought I had better play up to you If I d known you were married but it was only your glove and we re such old acquaintances There s another dance beginning Please go I ve no doubt my partner will find me He bowed gave her one glance and went Halfway down the stairs he turned and came back She was still sitting as he had left her The angry eyes she raised to him were full of tears She looked as she had looked ten years before when he had come back to her and the cursed gloves had spoiled everything He hated himself Why had he played with fire and raised this ghost to vex her It had been such pretty fire and such a beautiful ghost But she had been hurt he had hurt her She would blame herself now for that old past as for the new past so lately the present it would not bear thinking of The scene must be rounded off somehow He had let her wound her pride her self respect He must heal them The light touch would be best Look here he said I just wanted to tell you that I knew you weren t serious just now As you say it was nothing between two such old friends And and He sought about for some further consolation Ill inspired with the touch of her lips still on his hand he said And about the gloves Don t blame yourself about that It was not your fault You were

none	none	right It was the gloves I came back for He left her then and next day journeyed to Scotland to rejoin his wife of whom he was by habit moderately fond He still keeps the white glove she kissed and at first reproached himself whenever he looked at it But now he only sentimentalises over it now and then if he happens to be a little under the weather He feels that his foolish behaviour at that Sydenham dance was almost atoned for by the nobility with which he lied to spare her the light delicate touch with which he rounded off the scene He certainly did round it off By a few short easy words he accomplished three things He destroyed an ideal of himself which she had cherished for years he killed a pale bud of hope which she had loved to nurse the hope that perhaps in that old past it had been she who was to blame and not he whom she loved he trampled in the mud the living rose which would have bloomed her life long the belief that he had loved did love her the living rose that would have had magic to quench the fire of shame kindled by that unasked kiss a fire that frets for ever like hell fire burning but not consuming her self respect He did without doubt round off the scene THE OBVIOUS HE had the literary sense but he had it as an inverted instinct He had a keen perception of the dramatically fitting in art but no counteracting vision of the fitting in life Life and art indeed he found from his earliest years difficult to disentwine and later impossible to disentangle And to disentangle and disentwine them became at last the point of honour to him He first knew that he loved her on the occasion of her coming of age party His people and hers lived in the same sombre London square their Haslemere gardens were divided only by a sunk fence He had known her all his life Her coming of age succeeded but by a couple of days his return from three years of lazy philosophy study in Germany and the sight of her took his breath away In the time honoured cliche of the hurried novelist too hurried to turn a new phrase for an idea as old as the new life of spring he had left a child he found a woman She wore a soft satiny white gown that showed gleams of rose colour through its folds There were pink hollyhock blossoms in the bright brown of her hair Her eyes were shining with the excitement of this festival of which she was the goddess He lost his head danced with her five times and carried away a crumpled hollyhock bloom that had fallen from her hair during the last Lancers through which he had watched her All his dances with her had been waltzes It was not till alone again at his hotel he pulled out the hollyhock flower with his ball programme that he awoke to a complete sense of the insipid flatness of the new situation He had fallen in love was madly epris at any rate and the girl was the girl whose charms whose fortune whose general suitability as a match for him had been dinned into his ears ever since he was a callow boy at Oxford and she a long black silk legged short frocked tom boy of fourteen Everyone had always said that it was the obvious thing And now he had for once done exactly what was expected of him and his fine literary sense revolted The worst of all was that she seemed not quite to hate him Better a thousand times better that he should have loved and longed and never won a smile from her that he should have sacrificed something anything and gone his lonely way But she had smiled on him undoubtedly she had smiled and he did not want to play the part so long ago assigned to him by his people He wanted to be Sidney Carton Darnay s had always seemed to him the inferior role Yet he could not keep his thoughts from her and for what was left of the year his days and nights were a restless see saw of longing and repulsion advance and retreat His moods were reflected in hers but always an interview later that is to say if he were cold on Tuesday she on Thursday would be colder If on Thursday he grew earnest Sunday would find her kind But he by that time was frigid So that they never after the first wildly beautiful evening when their hearts went out to each other in a splendour of primitive frankness met in moods that chimed This safe guarded him It irritated her And it most successfully bewitched them both His people and her people looked on and were absolutely and sadly convinced that as her brother put it to his uncle it was no go Thereupon a

none	none	young old cotton broker appearing on the scene and bringing gifts with him her people began to put pressure on her She loathed the cotton broker and said so One afternoon everyone was by careful accident got out of the way and the cotton broker caught her alone That night there was a scene Her father talked a little too much of obedience and of duty her mother played the hysterical symphony with the loud pedal hard down and next morning the girl had vanished leaving the conventional note of farewell on the pincushion Now the two families being on all accounts close allies had bought jointly a piece of land near the Littlestone golf links and on it had built a bungalow occupied by members of either house in turn according to any friendly arrangement that happened to commend itself But at this time of the year folk were keeping Christmas season dismally in their town houses It was on the day when the cotton broker made his failure that the whole world seemed suddenly worthless to the man with the hollyhock bloom in his pocket book because he had met her at a dance and he had been tender but she reflecting his mood of their last meeting had been glacial So he lied roundly to his people and told them that he was going to spend a week or two with an old chum who was staying up for the vacation at Cambridge and instead he chose the opposite point of the compass and took train to New Romney and walked over to the squat one storied bungalow near the sea Here he let himself in with the family latch key and set to work with the help of a box from the stores borne behind him with his portmanteau on a hand cart to keep Christmas by himself This at least was not literary It was not in the least what a person in a book would do He lit a fire in the dining room and the chimney was damp and smoked abominably so that when he had fed full on tinned meats he was fain to let the fire go out and to sit in his fur lined overcoat by the be cindered grate now fast growing cold and smoke pipe after pipe of gloomy reflection He thought of it all The cursed countenance which his people were ready to give to the match that he couldn t make her maddening indecisions his own idiotic variableness He had lighted the lamp but it smelt vilely and he blew it out and did not light candles because it was too much trouble So the early winter dusk deepened into night and the bitter north wind had brought the snow and it drifted now in feather soft touches against the windows He thought of the good warm dining room in Russell Square of the gathering of aunts and uncles and cousins uncongenial perhaps but still human and he shivered in his fur lined coat and his icy solitude damning himself for the fool he knew he was And even as he damned his breath was stopped and his heart leaped at the sound faint but unmistakable of a key in the front door If a man exist not too remote from his hairy ancestors to have lost the habit of the pricking ear he was that man He pricked his ears so far as the modern man may and listened The key grated in the lock grated and turned the door was opened and banged again Something was set down in the little passage set down thumpingly and wholly without precaution He heard a hand move along the partition of match boarding He heard the latch of the kitchen door rise and fall and he heard the scrape and spurt of a struck match He sat still He would catch this burglar red handed Through the ill fitting partitions of the jerry built bungalow he could hear the intruder moving recklessly in the kitchen The legs of chairs and tables grated on the brick floor He took off his shoes rose and crept out through the passage towards the kitchen door It stood ajar A clear cut slice of light came from it Treading softly in his stockinged feet he came to it and looked in One candle stuck in a tea saucer burned on the table A weak blue and yellow glimmer came from some sticks in the bottom of the fireplace Kneeling in front of this breathless with the endeavour to blow the damp sticks to flame crouched the burglar A woman A girl She had laid aside hat and cloak The first sight of her was like a whirlwind sweeping over heart and brain For the bright brown hair that the candle light lingered in was like Her dear brown hair and when she rose suddenly and turned towards the door his heart stood still for it was She her very self She had not seen him He retreated in all the stillness his tortured nerves allowed and sat down again in the fur coat and the dining room She had not heard him He was for some moments absolutely stunned then he crept to the window In the poignant stillness of the place he could hear the heavy flakes of snow dabbing softly at the glass She was here She like him had fled to this refuge confident in its desertion at this season by both the families who shared a right to it She was there he was there Why had she fled The question did not wait to be answered it sank before the other question What was he to do The whole literary soul of the man cried out against either of the obvious courses of action I can go in he said and surprise her and tell her I love her and then walk out with dignified propriety and leave her alone here That s conventional and dramatic Or I can sneak off without her knowing I ve been here at all and leave her to spend the night unprotected in this infernal frozen dog hutch That s conventional enough heaven knows But what s the use of being a reasonable human being with free will if you can t do anything but the literarily and romantically obvious Here a sudden noise thrilled him Next moment he drew a long breath of relief She had but dropped a gridiron As it crashed and settled down with a rhythmic rattle on the kitchen flags the thought flowed through him like a river of Paradise If she did love me if I loved her what an hour and what a moment this would be Meantime she her hands helpless with cold was dropping clattering gridirons not five yards from him Suppose he went out to the kitchen and suddenly announced himself How flat how obvious Suppose he crept quietly away and went to the inn at New Romney How desperately flat How more than obvious Suppose he but the third course refused itself to the desperate clutch of his drowning imagination and left him clinging to the bare straw of a question What should he do Suddenly the really knightly and unconventional idea occurred to him an idea that would save him from the pit of the obvious yawning on each side There was a bicycle shed where also wood was stored and coal and lumber of all sorts He would pass the night there warm in his fur coat and his determination not to let his conduct be shaped by what people in books would have done And in the morning strong with the great renunciation of all the possibilities that this evening s meeting held he would come and knock at the front door just like anybody else and qui vivra verra At least he would be watching over her rest and would be able to protect the house from tramps Very gently and cautiously all in the dark he pushed his bag behind the sofa covered the stores box with a liberty cloth from a side table crept out softly and softly opened the front door it opened softly that is but it shut with an unmistakable click that stung in his ears as he stood on one foot on the snowy doorstep struggling with the knots of his shoe laces The bicycle shed was uncompromisingly dark and smelt of coal sacks and paraffin He found a corner between the coals and the wood and sat down on the floor Bother the fur coat was his answer to the doubt whether coal dust and broken twigs were a good down setting for that triumph of the Bond Street art There he sat full of a chastened joy at the thought that he watched over her that he sleepless untiring was on guard ready at an instant s warning to spring to her aid should she need protection The thought was mightily soothing The shed was cold The fur coat was warm In five minutes he was sleeping peacefully as any babe When he awoke it was with the light of a big horn lantern in his eyes and in his ears the snapping of wood She was there stooping beside the heaped faggots breaking off twigs to fill the lap of her up gathered blue gown the shimmery silk of her petticoat gleamed greenly He was partly hidden by a derelict bicycle and a watering can He hardly dared to draw breath Composedly she broke the twigs Then like a flash she turned towards him Who s there she said An inspiration came to him and this at least was not flat or obvious He writhed into the darkness behind a paraffin cask slipped out of his fur coat and plunged his hands in the dust of the coal Don t be ard on a pore cove mum he mumbled desperately rubbing the coal dust on to his face you wouldn t go for to turn a dawg out on a night like this let alone a pore chap outer work Even as he spoke he admired the courage of the girl Alone miles from any other house she met a tramp in an outhouse as calmly as though he had been a fly in the butter You ve no business here you know she said briskly What did you come for Shelter mum I won t take nothing as don t belong to me not so much as a lump of coal mum not if it was ever so She turned her head He almost thought she smiled But I can t have tramps sleeping here she said It s not as if I was a reg lar tramp he said warming to his part as he had often done on the stage in his A D C days I m a respectable working man mum as as seen better days Are you hungry she said I ll give you something to eat before you go if you ll come to the door in five minutes He could not refuse but when she was gone into the house he could bolt So he said Now may be the blessing It s starving I am mum and on Christmas Eve This time she did smile it was beyond a doubt He had always thought her smile charming She turned at the door and her glance followed the lantern s rays as they pierced the darkness where he crouched The moment he heard the house door shut he sprang up and lifted the fur coat gingerly to the wood block Flight instant flight Yet how could he present himself at New Romney with a fur coat and a face like a collier s He had drawn a bucket of water from the well earlier in the day some would be left it was close by the back door He tiptoed over the snow and washed and washed and washed He was drying face and hands with a pocket handkerchief that seemed strangely small and cold when the door opened suddenly and there close by him was she silhouetted against the warm glow of fire and candles Come in she said you can t possibly see to wash out there Before he knew it her hand was on his arm and she had drawn him to the warmth and light He looked at her but her eyes were on the fire I ll give you some warm water and you can wash at the sink she said closing the door and taking the kettle from the fire He caught sight of his face in the square of looking glass over the sink tap Was it worth while to go on pretending Yet his face was still very black And she evidently had not recognised him Perhaps surely she would have the good taste to retire while the tramp washed so that he could take his coat off Then he could take flight and the situation would be saved from absolute farce But when she had poured the hot water into a bowl she sat down in the Windsor chair by the fire and gazed into the hot coals He washed He washed till he was quite clean He dried face and hands on the rough towel He dried them till they were scarlet and shone But he dared not turn around There seemed no way out of this save by the valley of humiliation Still she sat looking into the fire As he washed he saw with half a retroverted eye the round table spread with china and glass and silver As I live it s set for two he told himself And in an instant jealousy answered once and for all the questions he had been asking himself since August Aren t you clean yet she said at last How could he speak Aren t you clean yet she repeated and called him by his name He turned then quickly enough She was leaning back in the chair laughing at him How did you know me he asked angrily Your tramp voice might have deceived me she said you did do it most awfully well But you see I d been looking at you for ages before you woke Then good night said he Good night said she but it s not seven yet You re expecting someone he said pointing dramatically to the table Oh that she said yes that was for for the poor man as had seen better days There s nothing but eggs but I couldn t turn a dog from my door on such a night till I d fed it Do you really mean Why not It s glorious It s a picnic But said he Oh well Go if you like said she It was not only eggs it was all sorts of things from that stores box They ate and they talked He told her that he had been bored in town and had sought relief in solitude That she told him was her case also He told her how he had heard her come in and how he had hated to take either the obvious course of following her to the kitchen saying How do you do and retiring to New Romney or the still more obvious course of sneaking away without asking her how she did And he told her how he had decided to keep watch over her from the bicycle shed And how the coal black inspiration had come to him And she laughed That was much more literary than anything else you could have thought of said she it was exactly like a book And oh you ve no idea how funny you looked They both laughed and there was a silence Do you know he said I can hardly believe that this is the first meal we ve ever had alone together It seems as though It is funny she said smiling hurriedly at him He did not smile He said I want you to tell me why you were so angel good why did you let me stay Why did you lay the pretty table for two Because we ve never been in the same mood at the same time she said desperately and somehow I thought we should be this evening What mood he asked inexorably Why jolly cheerful she said with the slightest possible hesitation I see There was another silence Then she said in a voice that fluttered a little My old governess Miss Pettingill you remember old Pet Well she s coming by the train that gets in at three I wired to her from town She ought to be here by now Ought she he cried pushing back his chair and coming towards her ought she Then by heaven before she comes I m going to tell you something No don t she cried You ll spoil everything Go and sit down again You shall I insist Let me tell you I always swore I would some day Why said he and sat down Because I knew you d never make up your mind to tell me To tell you what Anything for fear you should have to say it in the same way someone else had said it before Said what Anything Sit still Now I m going to tell you She came slowly round the table and knelt on one knee beside him her elbows on the arm of his chair You ve never had the courage to make up your mind to anything she began Is that what you were going to tell me he asked and looked in her eyes till she dropped their lids No yes no I haven t anything to tell you really Good night Aren t you going to tell me There isn t anything to tell she said Then I ll tell you said he She started up and the little brass knocker s urgent summons resounded through the bungalow Here she is she cried He also sprang to his feet And we haven t told each other anything he said Haven t we Ah no don t Let me go There she s knocking again You must let me go He let her slip through his arms At the door she paused to flash a soft queer smile at him It was I who told you after all she said Aren t you glad Because that wasn t a bit literary You didn t I told you he retorted Not you she said scornfully That would have been too obvious THE LIE ABSOLUTE THE tradesmen s books orderly spread lay on the rose wood writing table each adorned by its own just pile of gold and silver coin The books at the White House were paid weekly and paid in cash It had always been so The brown holland blinds were lowered half way The lace curtains almost met across the windows Thus while without July blazed on lawns and paths and borders in this room a cool twilight reigned A leisured quiet an ordered ease reigned there too as they had done for every day of Dorothea s thirty five years The White House was one of those to which no change comes None but Death and Death however he may have wrung the heart or stunted the soul of the living had been powerless to change outward seemings Dorothea had worn a black dress for a while and she best knew what tears she had wept and for what long months the light of life had gone out of all things But the tears had not blinded her eyes to the need of a mirror polish on the old mahogany furniture and all through those months there had been at least the light of duty The house must be kept as her dead mother had kept it The three prim maids and the gardener had been in the family since Dorothea was a girl of twenty a girl with hopes and dreams and fond imaginings that spreading bright wings wandered over a world far other than this dainty delicate self improving coldly charitable unchanging existence Well the dreams and the hopes and the fond imaginings had come home to roost He who had set them flying had gone away he had gone to see the world He had not come back He was seeing it still and all that was left of a girl s first romance was in certain neat packets of foreign letters in the drawer of the rose wood table and in the disciplined soul of the woman who sat before it doing the books Monday was the day for this Every day had its special duties every duty its special hour While the mother had stayed there had been love to give life to this life that was hardly life at all Now the mother was gone it sometimes seemed to Dorothea that she had not lived for these fifteen years and that even the life before had been less life than a dream of it She sighed I m old she said and I m growing silly She put her pen neatly in the inkstand tray it was an old silver pen and an old inkstand of Sevres porcelain Then she went out into the garden by the French window muffled in jasmine and found herself face to face with a stranger a straight well set up man of forty or thereabouts with iron grey hair and a white moustache Before his hand had time to reach the Panama hat she knew him and her heart leaped up and sank sick and trembling But she said To whom have I the pleasure The man caught her hands Why Dolly he said don t you know me I should have known you anywhere A rose flush deepened on her face It can t be Robert Can t it And how are you Dolly Everything s just the same By Jove the very same heliotropes and pansies in the very same border and the jasmine and the sundial and everything They tell me the trees have grown she said I like to think it s all the same Why didn t you tell me you were coming home Come in She led him through the hall with the barometer and the silver faced clock and the cases of stuffed birds

none	none	I wanted to surprise you and by George I ve surprised myself It s beautiful It s all just as it used to be Dolly The tears came into her eyes No one had called her Dolly since the mother went whose going had made everything for ever other than it used to be I ll tell them you re staying for lunch She got away on that and stood a moment in the hall before the stuffed fox with the duck in its mouth to catch strongly at her lost composure If anyone had had the right to ask the reason of her agitation and had asked it Dorothea would have said that the sudden happening of anything was enough to upset one in whose life nothing ever happened But no one had the right She went into the kitchen to give the necessary orders Not the mince she said or stay Yes that would do too You must cook the fowl that was for to night s dinner and Jane can go down to the village for something else for to night And salad and raspberries And I will put out some wine My cousin mister Courtenay has come home from India He will lunch with me Master Bob said the cook as the kitchen door closed well if I ever did He s a married man by this time with young folkses growing up around him I shouldn t wonder He never did look twice the same side of the road where she was Poor Miss Dolly Most of us are mercifully ignorant of the sympathy that surrounds us It s wonderful he said when she rejoined him in the drawing room I feel like the Prodigal Son When I think of the drawing rooms I ve seen The gim crack trumpery the curtains and the pictures and the furniture constantly shifted the silly chatter the obvious curios the commonplace rarities the inartistic art and the brainless empty chatter spiteful as often as not and all the time this has been going on beautifully quietly perfectly Dolly you re a lucky girl To her face the word brought a flush that almost justified it They talked and he told her how all these long years he had wearied for the sight of English fields and gardens of an English home like this till he almost believed that he was speaking the truth He looked at Dorothea with long restful hands quietly folded as she talked in the darkened drawing room at Dorothea with busy skilful hands among the old silver and the old glass and the old painted china at lunch He listened through the drowsy afternoon to Dorothea s gentle high bred low toned voice to the music of her soft rare laugh as they sat in the wicker chairs under the weeping ash on the lawn And he thought of other women a crowd of them with high shrill tones and constant foolish cackle of meaningless laughter of the atmosphere of paint powder furbelows flirtation empty gaiety feverish flippancy He thought too of women two and three whose faces stood out from the crowd and yet were of it And he looked at Dorothea s delicate worn face and her honest eyes with the faint lines round them As he went through the hush of the evening to his rooms at the Spotted Dog the thought of Dorothea of her house her garden her peaceful ordered life stirred him to a passion of appreciation Out of the waste and desert of his own life with its memories of the far country and the husks and the swine he seemed to be looking through a window at the peaceful life as a hungry lonely tramp may limp to a lamp lit window and peering in see father and mother and round faced children and the table spread whitely and the good sure food that to these people is a calm certainty like breathing or sleeping not a joyous accident or one of the great things that man was taught to pray for The tramp turns away with a curse or a groan according to his nature and goes on his way cursing or groaning or if the pinch be fierce he tries the back door or the unguarded window With Robert the pang of longing was keen and he was minded to try any door not to beg for the broken meats of cousinly kindness but to enter as master into that better place wherein Dorothea had found so little of Paradise It was no matter of worldly gain The Prodigal had not wasted his material substance on the cheap husks that cost so dear He had money enough and to spare it was in peace and the dignity of life that he now found himself to be bankrupt As for Dorothea when she brushed her long pale hair that night she found that her hands were not so steady as usual and in the morning she was quite shocked to note that she had laid her hair pins on the left hand side of the pin cushion instead of on the right a thing she had not done for years It was at the end of a week a week of long sunny days and dewy dark evenings spent in the atmosphere that had enslaved him Dinner was over Robert had smoked his cigar among the garden s lengthening shadows Now he and Dorothea were at the window watching the light of life die beautifully on the changing face of the sky They had talked as this week had taught them to talk with the intimacy of old friends and the mutual interest of new unexplored acquaintances This is the talk that does not weary the talk that can only be kept alive by the daring of revelation and the stronger courage of unconquerable reserve Now there came a silence with it seemed to come the moment Robert spoke Dorothea he said and her mind pricked its ears suspiciously because he had not called her Dolly Well I wonder if you understand what these days have been to me I was so tired of the world and its follies this is like some calm haven after a stormy sea The words seemed strangely familiar He had a grating sense of talking like a book and something within him sneered at the scruple and said that Dolly would not notice it But she said I m sure I ve read something like that in a school reading book but it s very touching of course Oh if you re going to mock my holiest sentiments he said lightly and withdrew from the attack The moment seemed to flutter near again when she said good night to him in the porch where the violet clematis swung against his head as he stood This time his opening was better inspired Dolly dear he said how am I ever to go away Her heart leaped against her side for his tone was tender But so may a cousin s tone be even a second cousin s and when one is thirty five she has little to fear from the pitying tenderness of her relations I am so glad you have liked being here she said sedately You must come again some time I don t want to go away at all he said Dolly won t you let me stay won t you marry me Almost as he took her hand she snatched it from him You must be mad she said Why on earth should you want to marry me Also she said I am old and plain and you don t love me But she said it to herself I do want it he said and I want it more than I want anything His tone was convincing But why but why An impulse of truth telling came to Robert Because it s all so beautiful he said with straightforward enthusiasm All your lovely quiet life and the house and these old gardens and the dainty delicate firm way you have of managing everything the whole thing s my ideal It s perfect I can t bear any other life I m afraid you ll have to she said with bitter decision I am not going to marry a man just because he admires my house and garden and is good enough to appreciate my methods of household management Good night She had shaken his hand coolly and shut the front door from within before he could find a word He found one as the latch clicked Fool he said to himself and stamped his foot Dorothea ran up the stairs two at a time to say the same word to herself in the stillness of her bedroom Fool fool fool she said Why couldn t I have said No quietly Why did I let him see I was angry Why should I be angry It s better to be wanted because you re a good manager than not to be wanted at all At least I suppose it is No it isn t it isn t it isn t And nothing s any use now It s all gone If he d wanted to marry me when I was young and pretty I could have made him love me And I was pretty I know I was I can remember it perfectly well Her quiet years had taken from her no least little touch of girlish sentiment The longing to be loved was as keen in her as it had been at twenty She cried herself to sleep and had a headache the next day Also her eyes looked smaller than usual and her nose was pink She went and sat in the black shade of a yew and trusted that in that deep shadow her eyes and nose would not make Robert feel glad that she had said No She wished him to be sorry She had put on the prettiest gown she had in the hope that he would be sorry then she was ashamed of the impulse also its pale clear greenness seemed to intensify the pinkness of her nose So she went back to the trailing grey gown Her wearing of her best Honiton lace collar seemed pardonable He would never notice it or know that real lace is more becoming than anything else She waited for him in the deep shadow and it was all the morning that she waited For he knew the value of suspense and he had not the generosity that disdains the use of the obvious weapon He was right so far that before he came she had had time to wonder whether it was her life s one chance of happiness that she had thrown away But he drove the knife home too far for when at last she heard the click of the gate and saw the gleam of flannels through the shrubbery the anxious questioning Will he come Have I offended him beyond recall changed at one heart beat to an almost perfect understanding of his reasons for delay She greeted him coldly That he expected But he saw or believed he saw the relief under the coldness and he brought up his forces for the attack Dear he said almost at once forgive me for last night It was true and if I had expressed it better you d have understood It isn t just the house and garden and the perfect life It s you Don t you understand what it is to come back from the world to all this and you you you the very centre of the star It s all very well she said but that wasn t what you said last night It s what I meant said he Dear don t you see how much I want you But I m old and plain and She looked at him with eyes still heavy from last night s tears and he experienced an unexpected impulse of genuine tenderness My dear he said when I first remember your mother she was about your age I used to think she was the most beautiful person in the world She seemed to shed happiness and peace around her like like a lamp sheds light And you are just like her Ah don t send me away Thank you she said struggling wildly with the cross currents of emotion set up by his words Thank you I have not lived single all these years to be married at last because I happen to be like my mother The words seemed a treason to the dead and the tears filled Dorothea s eyes He saw them he perceived that they ran in worn channels and the impulse of tenderness grew Till this moment he had spoken only the truth His eyes took in the sunny lawn beyond the yew shadow the still house the whir of the lawn mower was music at once pastoral and patriotic He heard the break in her voice he saw the girlish grace of her thin shape the pathetic charm of her wistful mouth And he lied with a good heart My dear he said with a tremble in his voice that sounded like passion my dear it s not for that I love you Dolly I think I must have loved you all my life And at the light that leaped into her eyes he suddenly felt that this lie was nearer truth than he had known I love you dear I love you he repeated and the words were oddly pleasant to say Won t you love me a little too She covered her face with her hands She could no more have doubted him than she could have doubted the God to whom she had prayed night and morning for all these lonely years Love you a little she said softly Ah Robert don t you know that I ve loved you all my life So a lie won what truth could not gain And the odd thing is that the lie has now grown quite true and he really believes that he has always loved her just as he certainly loves her now For some lies come true in the telling But most of them do not and it is not wise to try experiments THE GIRL WITH THE GUITAR THE last strains of the ill treated ill fated Intermezzo had died away and after them had died away also the rumbling of the wheels of the murderous barrel organ that had so gaily executed that along with the nine other tunes of its repertory to the admiration of the housemaid at the window of the house opposite and the crowing delight of the two babies next door The young man drew a deep breath of relief and lighted the wax candles in the solid silver candlesticks on his writing table for now the late summer dusk was falling and that organ please Heaven made full the measure of the day s appointed torture There had been five organs since dinner and seven in the afternoon one and all urgently thumping their heavy melodies into his brain to the confusion of the thoughts that waited there eager to marshal themselves orderly and firm into the phalanx of an article on The Decadence of Criticism He filled his pipe drew paper towards him dipped his pen and wrote his title on the blank page The silence came round him soothing as a beloved presence the scent of the may bushes in the suburban gardens stole in pleasantly through the open windows After all it was a quiet neighbourhood as the advertisement had said at any rate in the evening and in the evening a man s best efforts Thrum tum tum Thrum tum tum came the defiant strumming of a guitar close to the window He sprang to his feet this was indeed too much But before he could draw back the curtains and express himself to the intruder the humming of the guitar was dominated by the first words of a song Oh picerella del vieni al mare Nella barchetta veletto di fiore La biancha prora somiglia al altare Tutte le stelle favellan d amor and so forth The performer was evidently singing under her voice but the effect was charming He stood with his hand on the curtain listening and with a pleasure that astonished him The song came to an end with a chord in which all the strings twanged their best Then there was silence then a sigh and the sound of light moving feet on the gravel He threw back the curtain and leaned out of the window Here he called to the figure that moved slowly towards the gate She turned quickly and came back two steps She wore the dress of a Contadina a very smart dress indeed and her hands looked small and white Won t you sing again he asked She hesitated then struck a chord or two and began another of those little tuneful Italian songs all stars and flowers and hearts of gold And again he listened with a quiet pleasure I should like to hear her voice at its full strength he thought and now it was time to give the vagrant a few coppers and shutting the window to leave her to go on to the next front garden Never had any act seemed so impossible He had watched her through the singing of this last song and he had grown aware of the beauty of her face s oval of the fine poise of her head and of the grace of hands and arms Aren t you tired he said Wouldn t you like to sit down and rest There is a seat in the garden at the side of the house Again she hesitated Then she turned towards the quarter indicated and disappeared round the laurel bushes He was alone in the house his people and the servants were in the country the woman who came to do for him had left for the night He went into the dining room dark with mahogany and damask found wine and cake in the sideboard cupboard put them on a tray and took them out through the garden door and round to the corner where almost sheltered by laburnums and hawthorns from the view of the people next door the singer and her guitar rested on the iron seat I have brought you some wine will you have it Again that strange hesitation then quite suddenly the girl put her hands up to her face and began to cry Here I say you know don t he said Oh Lord This is awful I hardly know a word of Italian and apparently she has no English Here signorina ecco prendi vino gatto No gatto s a cat I was thinking of French Oh Lord The Contadina had pulled out a very small handkerchief and was drying her eyes with it She rose No don t go he said eagerly I can see you are tired out Sai fatiguee non e vero Io non parlate Italiano sed vino habet et cake ante vous partez She looked at him and spoke for the first time It serves me right she said in excellent yet unfamiliar English I don t understand a single word you say I might have known I couldn t do it though it s just what girls in books would do It would have turned out all right with them Let me go thank you very much I am sure you meant to be kind And then she began to cry again Look here he said this is all nonsense you know You are tired out and there s something wrong What is it Do drink this and then tell me Perhaps I can help you She drank obediently Then she said I have not had anything to eat since last night He hurriedly cut cake and pressed it upon her He had no time to think but he was aware that this was the most exciting adventure that had ever happened to him It s no use and it all sounds so silly Ah but do tell me His voice was kinder than he meant it to be Her eyes filled again with tears You don t know how horrid everyone has been Oh I never knew before what devils people are to you when you re poor Is it only that you re poor Why that s nothing I m poor too She laughed I m not poor not really What is it then You ve quarrelled with your friends and Ah tell me and let me try to help you You are kind but Well then it s like this My father brought me to England from the States a month ago he s made his pile it was in pork and I always wish he d made it of something else even canned fruit would be better but that doesn t matter We didn t know anyone here of course and directly we got here he was wired for business and he had to go home again But surely 
696_93314_000010_000001	train-clean-100	he didn t 
none	none	leave you without money Her little foot tapped the gravel impatiently I m coming to that she said Of course he didn t He told me to stay on at the hotel and I did and then one night when I was at the theatre my maid a horrid French thing we got in Paris packed up all my trunks and took all my money and paid the bill and went The hotel folks let her go I can t think how people can be so silly But they wouldn t let me stay and I wired to papa and there was no answer and I don t know whatever s the matter with him I know it all sounds as if I was making it up as I go along She stopped short and looked at him through the dusk He did not speak but whatever she saw in his face it satisfied her She said again You are kind Go on he said tell me all about it Well then I went into lodgings that wicked woman had left me one street suit and to day they turned me out because my money was all gone I had a little money in my purse and this dress had been ordered for a fancy ball it is smart isn t it and it came after that wretch had gone and the guitar too and I thought I could make a little money I really can sing though you mightn t think it And I ve been at it since five o clock and I ve only got one shilling and seven pence And no one but you has ever even thought of thinking whether I was tired or hungry or anything and papa always took such care of me I feel as if I had been beaten Let me think he said Oh how glad I am that you happened to come this way He reflected a moment Then he said I shall lock up all the doors and windows in the house and then I shall give you my latch key and you can let yourself in and stay the night here there is no one in the house I will catch the night train and bring my mother up to morrow Then we will see what can be done The only excuse for this rash young man is to be found in the fact that while he was feeding his strange guest with cake and wine she was feeding with her beauty the first fire of his first love Love at first sight is all nonsense we know we who have come to forty year but at twenty one one does not somehow recognise it for the nonsense it is But don t you know anyone in London he asked in a sensible postscript It was not yet so dark but that he could see the crimson flush on her face Not know she said Papa wouldn t like me to spoil my chances of knowing the right people with any foolishness like this There s no one I could let know You see papa s so very rich and at home they expect me to to get acquainted with dukes and things and She stopped American heiresses are expected to marry English dukes he said with a distinct physical pain at his heart It wasn t I who said that said the girl smiling but that s so anyhow And then she sighed So it s your destiny to marry a duke is it the young man spoke slowly All the same he added irrelevantly you shall have the latch key You are kind she said for the third time and reached her hand out to him He did not kiss it then only took it in his and felt how small and cold it was Then it was taken away He says that he only talked to her for half an hour but the neighbours from whose eyes suburban hawthorns and laburnums are powerless to conceal the least of our actions declare that he sat with the guitar player on the iron seat till well after midnight further that when 
696_93314_000038_000000	train-clean-100	they parted 
none	none	he kissed her hand and that she then put her hands on his shoulders quite shamelessly you know and kissed him lightly on both cheeks It is known that he passed the night prowling in our suburban lanes and caught the six point twenty five train in the morning to the place where his people were staying The lady and the guitar certainly passed the night at Hill View Villa but when his mother very angry and very frightened came up with him at about noon the house looked just as usual and no one was there but the charwoman An adventuress I told you so said his mother at once and the young man sat down at his study table and looked at the title of his article on The Decadence of Criticism It was surely a very long time ago that he had written that And he sat there thinking till his mother s voice roused him The silver is all right thank goodness she said but your banjo girl has taken a pair of your sister s silk stockings and those new shoes of hers with the silver buckles and she s left these She held out a pair of little patent leather shoes very worn and dusty the slender silken web of a black stocking brown with dust hung from her hand He answered nothing She spent the rest of that day in searching the house for further losses but all things were in their place except the silver handled button hook and that as even his sister owned had been missing for months Yet his family would never leave him to keep house alone again they said he is not to be trusted And perhaps they are right The half dozen pairs of embroidered silk stockings and the dainty French silver buckled shoes which arrived a month later addressed to Miss Hill View Villa only confirmed their distrust He must have had them sent that tambourine girl could never have afforded these why they were pure silk and the quality It was plain that his castanet girl his mother and sister took a pleasure in crediting her daily with some fresh and unpleasing instrument could have had neither taste money nor honesty to such a point as this As for the young man he bore it all very meekly only he was glad when his essays on the decadence of things in general led to a berth on the staff of a big daily and made it possible for him to take rooms in town because he had grown weary of living with his family and of hearing so constantly that She played the bones and the big drum and the concertina and that She was a twopenny adventuress who stole his sister s shoes and stockings He prefers to sit in his quiet room in the Temple and to remember that she played the guitar and sang sweetly that she had a mouth like a tired child s mouth that her eyes were like stars and that she kissed him on both cheeks and that he kissed her hand only as the scandalised suburb knows THE MAN WITH THE BOOTS A YOUNG man with a little genius a gift of literary expression and a distaste not only for dissipation but for the high toned social functions of his suburban acquaintances may go far once he has chosen journalism for a profession and has realised that to success in any profession a heart whole service is necessary A certain young man having been kissed in his own garden by a girl with a guitar ceased to care for evening parties and devoted himself steadily to work His relaxations were rowing down the Thames among the shipping and thinking of the girl In two years he was sent to Paris by the Thunderer to ferret out information about a certain financial naughtiness which threatened a trusting public in general and in particular a little band of blameless English shareholders The details of the scheme are impertinent to the present narrative The young man went to Paris and began to enjoy himself He had good introductions He had once done a similar piece of business before but then luck aided him As I said he enjoyed himself but he did not see his way to accomplishing his mission But his luck stood by him as you will see in a very remarkable manner At a masked ball he met a very charming Corsican lady She was dressed as a nun but the eyes that sparkled through her mask might have taxed the resources of the most competent abbess She spoke very agreeable English and she was very kind to the young man indicated the celebrities she seemed to know everyone whom she recognised quite easily in their carnival disguises and at last she did him the kindness to point out a stout cardinal and named the name of the very Jew who was pulling the strings of the very business which had brought the young man to Paris The young man s lucky star shone full on him and dazzled him to a seeming indiscretion He looks rather a beast he said The nun clapped her hands Oh he is she said If you knew all that I could tell you about him It was with the distinct idea of knowing all that the lady could tell about the Jew that our hero devoted himself to her throughout that evening and promised to call on her the next day He made himself very amiable indeed and if you think that he should not have done this I can only say that I am sorry but facts are facts When he put her into her carriage a very pretty little brougham he kissed her hand He did not do this because he desired to do it as in the case of the Girl with the Guitar but purely as a matter of business If you blame him here I can only say a la guerre comme a la guerre Next day he called on her She received him in a charming yellow silk boudoir and gave him tea and sweets Unmasked the lady was seen to be of uncommon beauty He did not make love to her but he was very nice and she asked him to come again It was at their third interview that his star shone again and again dazzled him to indiscreetness He told the beautiful lady exactly why he wanted to know all that she could tell him about the Jew financier The beautiful lady clapped her hands till all her gold bangles rattled musically and said But I will tell you all everything I felt that you wished to know but I thought however are you sure it will all be in your paper But yes Madame said he Then she folded her hands on the greeny satin lap of her tea gown and told him many things And as she spoke he pieced things together and was aware that she spoke the truth When she had finished speaking his mission was almost accomplished His luck had done all this for him The lady promised even documents and evidence Then he thanked her and she said No thanks please I suppose this will ruin him I m afraid it will said he She gave a little sigh of contentment But why he asked I don t mind somehow telling you anything she said and indeed as it seemed with some truth He he did me the honour to admire me and now he has behaved like the pig he is And so you have betrayed him told me the things he told you when he loved you She snapped her fingers and the opals and rubies of her rings shone like fire Love she said scornfully Then he began to be a little ashamed and sorry for his part in this adventure and he said so Ah don t be sorry she said softly I wanted to betray him I was simply longing to do it only I couldn t think of the right person to betray him to But you are the right person Monsieur I am indeed fortunate A little shiver ran through him But he had gone too far to retreat And the documents Madame I will give you them to morrow There is a ball at the American Embassy I can get you a card I have one He had indeed made it his first business to get one was not the Girl with the Guitar an American and could he dare to waste the least light chance of seeing her again Well be there at twelve and you shall have everything But she looked sidelong at him will Monsieur be very kind very attentive in short devote himself to me for this one evening He will be there He murmured something banal about the devotion of a lifetime and went away to his lodging in a remote suburb which he had chosen because he loved boating The next night at twelve saw him lounging a gloomy figure on a seat in an ante room at the Embassy He knew that the Lady was within yet he could not go to her He sat there despairingly trying to hope that even now something might happen to save him Yet as it seemed nothing short of a miracle could But his star shone and the miracle happened For as he sat a radiant vision all white lace and diamonds detached itself from the arm of a grey bearded gentleman and floated towards him It is you said the darling vision and the next moment his hands both hands were warmly clasped by little white gloved ones and he was standing looking into the eyes of the Girl I knew I should see you somewhere this continent is so tiny she said Come right along and be introduced to Papa that s him over there I I can t he answered in an agony I my pocket s been picked Do tell said the Girl laughing but Papa doesn t want tipping he s got all he wants come right along I can t he said hoarse with the misery of the degrading confession it wasn t my money it was my shoes I came up in boots brown boots distant suburb train my shoes were in my overcoat pocket I meant to change in the cab I must have dropped them or they were taken out And here I am in these things He looked down at his bright brown boots And all the shops are shut and my whole future depends on my getting into that room within the next half hour But never mind Why should you bother Besides what does it matter I ve seen you again You ll speak to me as you come back I ll wait all night for a word Don t be so silly said the Girl but she smiled very prettily and her dear eyes sparkled If it s really important I ll fix it for you But why does your future depend on it and all that I have to meet a lady said the wretched young man The one you were with at the masked ball The nun Yes I made Papa take me Is it that one Her tone was imperious but it was anxious too He looked imploringly at her Yes but You shall have the shoes all the same she interrupted and turned away before he could add a word A moment later the grey bearded gentleman was bowing to him My girl tells me you re in a corner for want of shoes Sir Mine are at your service we seem about of a size we can change behind that pillar But stammered the young man it s too much I can t It s nothing at all Sir said the man with the grey beard warmly nothing compared to the way you stood by my girl Shake John B Warner don t forget I can t thank you said the other when they had shaken hands If you will just for a short time I ll be back in half an hour He was back in two minutes The first face he saw when he had made his duty bows was the face of the Beautiful Lady She was radiant and beside her stood her Jew also radiant They had made it up And what is more though he never knew it they had made it up in that half hour of delay caused by the Boots The Lady passed our hero without a word or even a glance to acknowledge acquaintanceship and he saw that the game was absolutely up He swore under his breath But the next moment he laughed to himself with a free heart After all for any documents any evidence for any success in any walk of life how could he have borne to devote himself as he had promised to do to that Corsican lady while the Girl the Girl was in the room And he perceived now that he should not even use the information he already had It did not seem fitting that one to whom the Girl stooped to speak for ever so brief a moment should play the part of a spy in however good a cause Back already said the old gentleman Thank you my business is completed The young man resumed his brown boots Now Papa said the Girl just go right along and do your devoirs in there and I ll stay and talk to him The father went obediently Have you quarrelled with her then asked the Girl her eyes on the diamond buckles of her satin shoes He told her everything or nearly Well she said decisively I m glad you re out of it anyway Don t worry about it It s a nasty trade Papa ll find you a berth Come out to the States and edit one of his papers You told me he was a millionaire I suppose everything went all right He didn t lose his money or anything His tone was wistful Not he You don t know Papa said the Girl but say you re not going to be too proud to be acquainted with a self made man He didn t answer Say said she again I don t take so much stock in dukes as I used to She laid a hand on his arm Don t make a fool of me said the young man speaking very low I won t her voice was a caress but Papa shall make Something of you You don t know Papa He can make men s fortunes as easily as other folks make men s shoes And he always does what I tell him Aren t you glad to see me again And don t you remember said she looking at him so kindly that he lost his head and Ah haven t you forgotten said he That is about all there is of the story He is now a Something and he has married the Girl If you think that a young man of comparatively small income should not marry the girl he loves because her father happens to have made money in pork I can only remind you that your opinion is not shared by the bulk of our English aristocracy And they don t even bother about the love as often as not 
7556-93308-0000	train-other-500	THE SECOND BEST THE letter was brief and abrupt I am in London I have just come back from Jamaica Will you come and see me I can be in at any time you appoint There was no signature but he knew the handwriting well enough
7556-93308-0001	train-other-500	The letter came to him by the morning post sandwiched between his tailor s bill and a catalogue of Rare and Choice Editions He read it twice Then he got up from the breakfast table unlocked a drawer and took out a packet of letters and a photograph
7556-93308-0002	train-other-500	I ought to have burned them long ago he said I ll burn them now He did burn them but first he read them through and as he read them he sighed more than once
7556-93308-0003	train-other-500	They were passionate pretty letters the phrases simply turned the endearments delicately chosen They breathed of love and constancy and faith a faith that should move mountains a love that should shine like gold in the furnace of adversity
7556-93308-0004	train-other-500	a constancy that death itself should be powerless to shake And he sighed No later love had come to draw with soft lips the poison from this old wound She had married Benoliel
7556-93308-0005	train-other-500	the West Indian Jew It is a far cry from Jamaica to London but some whispers had reached her jilted lover The kindest of them said that Benoliel neglected his wife the harshest that he beat her He looked at the photograph
7556-93308-0006	train-other-500	It was two years since he had seen the living woman Yet still when he shut his eyes he could see the delicate tints the coral and rose and pearl and gold that went to the making up of her He could always see these
7556-93308-0007	train-other-500	And now he should see the reality Would the two years have dulled that bright hair withered at all that flower face For he never doubted that he must go to her He was a lawyer perhaps she wanted that sort of help from him
none	none	 wanted to know how to rid herself of the bitter bad bargain that she had made in marrying the Jew 
7556-93308-0008	train-other-500	Whatever he could do he would of course but He went out at once and sent a telegram to her Four to day And at four o clock he found himself on the doorstep of a house in Eaton Square
7556-93308-0009	train-other-500	He hated the wealthy look of the house the footman who opened the door and the thick carpets of the stairs up which he was led He hated the soft luxury of the room
none	none	 in which he was left to wait for her Everything spoke decorously and without shouting but with unmistakable distinctness of money Benoliel s money money that had been able to buy all these beautiful things and as one of them to buy her 
7556-93308-0010	train-other-500	She came in quietly Long simple folds of grey trailed after her she wore no ornament of any kind Her fingers were ringless every one He saw all this but before he saw anything else
7556-93308-0011	train-other-500	he saw that the two years had taken nothing from her charm had indeed but added a wistful patient look
none	none	 that made her seem more a child than when he had last seen her The meaningless contact of their hands was over and still neither had spoken She was looking at him questioningly The silence appeared silly there was and there could be 
7556-93308-0012	train-other-500	no emotion to justify to transfigure it He spoke How do you do he said She drew a deep breath
none	none	 and lifted her eyebrows slightly 
7556-93308-0013	train-other-500	Won t you sit down she said you are looking just like you used to She had the tiniest lisp once it had used to charm him You too are quite your old self he said Then there was a pause
7556-93308-0014	train-other-500	Aren t you going to say anything she said It was you who sent for me said he Yes Why did you I wanted to see you She opened her pretty child eyes at him
none	none	 and he noted only to bitterly resent the appeal in them He remembered that old appealing look too well No Madam he said inwardly not again You can t whistle the dog to heel at your will and pleasure I was a fool once but I m not fool enough to play the fool with Benoliel s wife Aloud he said smiling I suppose you did or you would not have written And now what can I do for you She leaned forward to look at him Then you really have forgotten 
7556-93308-0015	train-other-500	You didn t grieve for me long You used to say you would never leave off loving me as long as you lived My dear missus Benoliel he said if I ever said anything so thoughtless as that I certainly have forgotten it
7556-93308-0016	train-other-500	Very well she said then go This straight hitting embarrassed him mortally But he said I ve not forgotten that you and I were once friends for a little while
7556-93308-0017	train-other-500	and I do beg you to consider me as a friend Let me help you You must have some need of a friend s services or you would not have sent for me I assure you I am entirely at your commands Come tell me how I can help you
7556-93308-0018	train-other-500	You can t help me at all she said hopelessly nobody can now I ve heard I hope you ll forgive me for saying so I ve heard that your married life has been hasn t been My married life
7556-93308-0019	train-other-500	has been hell she said but I don t want to talk about that I deserved it all But my dear lady why not get a divorce or at least a separation My services anything I can do to advise or
7556-93308-0020	train-other-500	She sprang from her chair and knelt beside him Oh how could you think that of me How could you He s dead Benoliel s dead I thought you d understand
696_93314_000009_000004	train-clean-100	Oh how could you 
none	none	think that of me How could you He s dead Benoliel s dead I thought you d understand that by my sending to you Do you think I d ever have seen you again 
7556-93308-0021	train-other-500	as long as he was alive I m not a wicked woman dear I m only a fool She had caught the hand that lay on the arm of his chair her face was pressed on it and on it he could feel her tears and her kisses
7556-93308-0022	train-other-500	Don t he said harshly don t But he could not bring himself to draw his hand away otherwise than very gently and after a decent pause He stood up and held out his hand She put hers in it
7556-93308-0023	train-other-500	he raised her to her feet and put her back in her chair and artfully entrenching himself behind a little table sat down in a very stiff chair with a high seat and gilt legs She laughed Oh don t trouble
7556-93308-0024	train-other-500	You needn t barricade yourself like a besieged castle Don t be afraid of me You re really quite safe I m not so mad as you think Only you know all this time I ve never been able to get the idea out of my head
7556-93308-0025	train-other-500	He was afraid to ask what idea I always believed you meant it that you always would love me just as you said I was wrong that s all Now go Do go
7556-93308-0026	train-other-500	He was afraid to go No he said let s talk quietly and like the old friends we were before we Before we weren t Well He was now afraid to say anything
none	none	 Look here she said suddenly let me talk There are some things I do really want to say 
7556-93308-0027	train-other-500	since you won t let it go without saying
none	none	 One is that I know now you re not so much to blame as I thought and I do forgive you I mean it really not just pretending forgiveness I forgive you altogether You forgive me Yes didn t you understand that that was what I meant 
7556-93308-0028	train-other-500	I didn t want to say I forgive you and I thought if I sent for you you d understand
none	none	 You seem to have thought your sending for me a more 
7556-93308-0029	train-other-500	enlightening move than I found it Yes because you don t care now If you had you d have understood I really think I should like to understand What Exactly
7556-93308-0030	train-other-500	what it is you re kind enough to forgive Why your never coming to see me Benoliel told me before we d been married a month that he had got my aunt to stop your letters and mine
7556-93308-0031	train-other-500	so I don t blame you now as I did then But you might have come when you found I didn t write I did come The house was shut up and the caretaker could give no address
none	none	 Did you really And there was no address 
7556-93308-0032	train-other-500	I never thought of that I don t suppose you did he said savagely you never did think Oh I was a fool I was Yes
none	none	 But I have been punished Not you he said You got what you wanted money money money the only thing I couldn t give you If it comes to that why didn t you come and see me I hadn t gone away and left no address I never thought of it No of course not And besides you wouldn t have been there I I sat day after day waiting for a letter 
7556-93308-0033	train-other-500	I never thought of it she said again And again he said No of course you didn t you wouldn t you know Ah don t please don t Oh you don t know how sorry I ve been
none	none	 But why did you marry him To spite you to show you I didn t care because I was in a rage because I was a fool You might as well tell me at once that you re in love with someone else Must one always be in love then he sneered I thought men always were she said simply Please tell me No I m not in love with anybody I have had enough of that to last me for a year or two Then oh won t you try to like me again Nobody will ever love you so much as I do you said I looked just the same Yes but you aren t the same Yes I am I think really I m better than I used to be she said timidly You re not the same he went on growing angrier to feel that he had allowed himself to grow angry with her You were a girl and my sweetheart now you re a widow that man s widow 
7556-93308-0034	train-other-500	You re not the same The past can t be undone so easily I assure you Oh she cried clenching her hands I know there must be something I could say that you would listen to oh
none	none	 I wish I could think what I suppose as it is I m saying things no other woman ever would have said 
7556-93308-0035	train-other-500	but I don t care I won t be reserved and dignified and leave everything to you like girls in books I lost too much by that before I will say every single thing I can think of I will
7556-93308-0036	train-other-500	Dearest you said you would always love me
none	none	 you don t care for anyone else 
7556-93308-0037	train-other-500	I know you would love me again if you would only let yourself Won t you forgive me I can t he said briefly Have you never done anything that needed to be forgiven I would forgive you anything in the world
7556-93308-0038	train-other-500	Didn t you care for other people before you knew me And I m not angry about it And I never cared for him That only makes it worse he said She sprang to her feet
none	none	 It makes it worse for me But if you loved me it ought to make it better for you If you had loved me with your heart and mind you would be glad to think how little it was after all 
7556-93308-0039	train-other-500	that I did give to that man Sold not gave
none	none	 Oh don t spare me But there s no need to tell you not to spare me But I don t care what you say You ve loved other women I ve never loved anyone but you And yet you can t forgive me It s not the same he repeated dully I am the same 
7556-93308-0040	train-other-500	only I m more patient I hope and not so selfish But your pride is hurt and you think it s not quite the right thing to marry a rich man s widow And you want to go home and feel how strong and heroic you ve been
none	none	 and be proud of yourself because you haven t let me make a fool of you It was so nearly true that he denied it instantly I don t he said I could have forgiven you anything however wicked you d been but I can t forgive you 
7556-93308-0041	train-other-500	for having been Been a fool I can t forgive myself for that either My dear my dear you don t love anyone else you don t hate me Do you know that your eyes are quite changed from what they were when you came in
none	none	 And your voice and your face everything Think dear if I am not the same woman you loved I m still more like her than anyone else in the world And you did love me oh don t hate me for anything I ve said Don t you see 
7556-93308-0042	train-other-500	I m fighting for my life Look at me
none	none	 I am just like your old sweetheart 
7556-93308-0043	train-other-500	only I love you more and I can understand better now how not to make you unhappy Ah don t throw everything away without thinking I am more like the woman you loved than anyone else can ever be Oh my God
7556-93308-0044	train-other-500	my God what shall I say to him Oh God help me She had said enough The one phrase If I am not the same woman you loved still I am more like her than anyone else in the world
none	none	 had struck straight at his heart It was true What if this the second best were now the best life had to offer If he threw this away would any other woman be able to inspire him with any sentiment more like love than this passion of memory regret tenderness pity this desire to hold protect and comfort with which ever since her tears fell on his hand he had been fighting in fierce resentment He looked at the huddled grey figure 
7556-93308-0045	train-other-500	He must decide now at this moment he must decide for two lives But before he had time to decide anything he found that he had taken her in his arms My own my dear
7556-93308-0046	train-other-500	he was saying again and again I didn t mean it It wasn t true I love you better than anything Let s forget it all I don t care for anything now I have you again Then why Oh don t let s ask each other questions
7556-93308-0047	train-other-500	let s begin all over again at two years ago We ll forget all the rest my dear my own Of course neither has ever forgotten it but they always pretend to each other that they have
7556-93308-0048	train-other-500	Her defiance of the literary sense in him and in her was justified His literary sense or some deeper instinct prompted him to refuse to use Benoliel s money
none	none	 but her acquiescence in his decision reversed it And they live very comfortably on the money to this day The odd thing is that they are extremely happy Perhaps it is not after all such a bad thing to be quite sure before marriage that the second best happiness is all you are likely to get in this world A HOLIDAY THE month was June the street was Gower Street the room was an attic And in it a poet sat struggling with the rebellious third act of the poetic drama that was to set him in the immediate shadow of Shakespeare and on the level of those who ring Parnassus round just below the summit The attic roof sloped the furniture was vilely painted in grained yellow the arm chair s prickly horsehair had broken to let loose lumps of dark coloured flock The curtains were dark and damask and dusty The carpet was Kidderminster and sand coloured It had holes in it so had the Dutch hearthrug The poet s penholder was the kind at twopence the dozen The ink was in a penny bottle Outside on a blackened flowerless lilac a strayed thrush sang madly of spring and hope and joy and love The clear strong June sunshine streamed in through the window and turned the white of the poet s page to a dazzling silver splendour Hang it all he cried and he threw down the yellow brown penholder It s too much It s not to be borne It s not human He turned out his pockets Two and seven pence He could draw the price of an ode and a roundelay from the Spectator but not to day for this was a Bank Holiday Whit Monday in fact Then he thought of his tobacco jar Sure enough there lurked some halfpence among the mossy shag and oh wonder and joy and cursed carelessness for ever to be blessed a gleaming coy half sovereign In the ticket pocket of his overcoat a splendid unforeseen shilling a florin and a sixpence in the velveteen jacket he had not worn since last year Ten and two and one and two and sevenpence and sixpence sixteen shillings and a penny Enough more than enough to take him out of this world of burst horsehair chairs and greedy foolscap of arid authorship and burst bubbles of dreams to the real world where spring still laughing shrank from the kisses of summer where white may blossomed and thrushes sang I ll have a holiday he said who knows I may get an idea for a poem He cleaned his boots with ink they were not shiny after it but they were at least black He put on his last clean shirt and the greeny blue Liberty tie that his sister had sent him for his April birthday He brushed his soft hat counted his money again found for it a pocket still lacking holes and went out whistling The front door slammed behind him with a cheerful conclusive bang From the top of an omnibus he noted the town gilded with June sunlight And it was very good He bought food and had it packed in decent brown paper so that it looked like something superfluous from the stores And he caught the ten something train to Halstead He only just caught it He blundered into a third class carriage and nearly broke his neck over an umbrella which lay across the door like an amateur trap for undesired company By some extraordinary apotheosis of Bank Holiday mismanagement there was only one person in the carriage the owner of the trap umbrella A girl of course That was inevitable in this magic weather He had knocked her basket off the seat and had only just saved himself from buffeting her with his uncontrolled shoulder before he saw that she was a girl He took off his hat and apologised She smiled murmured and blushed He settled himself in his corner and unfolded the evening paper of yesterday which by the most fortunate chance happened to be in his pocket Over it he glanced at her She was pretty with a vague unawakened prettiness Her eyes and hair were dark Her hat seemed dowdy yet becoming Her gloves were rubbed at the fingers Her blouse was light and bright Her skirt obscure and severe He decided that she was not well off His eyes followed a dull leader on the question of the government of India But he did not want to read He wanted to talk On this June day when the life of full grown spring thrilled one to the finger tips how could one feed one s vitality one s over mastering joy of life with printer s ink and the greyest paper in London He glanced at her again She was looking out of the window at the sordid little Bermondsey houses where the red buds of the Virginia creeper were already waking to their green summer life work He spoke And no one would have guessed from his speech that he was a poet What a beautiful day he said Yes very said she and her tone gave no indication of any exuberant spring expansiveness to match his own He looked at her again No Yes Yes he would try the experiment he had long wanted to try had often in long silent tete a tete journeys dreamed of trying He would skip all the pitiful formalities of chance acquaintanceship He would speak as one human being to another would assume the sure bond of a common kinship He said It is such a beautiful day that I want to talk about it Mayn t I talk to you Don t you feel that you want to say how beautiful it is just as much as I do The girl looked at him A scared fold in her brow warned him of the idea that had seized her I m really not mad he said but it does seem so frightfully silly that we should travel all the way to to wherever you are going and not tell each other how good June weather is Well it is she owned He eagerly spoke he wanted to entangle her in talk before her conventional shrinking from chance acquaintanceship should shrivel her interest past hope I often think how silly people are he said not to talk in railway carriages One can t read without blinding oneself I ve seen women knit but that s unspeakable Many a time in frosty foggy weather when the South Eastern has taken two hours to get from Cannon Street to Blackheath I ve looked round the carriage and wanted to say Gentlemen seeing that we are thus delayed let us each contribute to the general hilarity by telling a story we might gather them into a Christmas number afterwards in the manner of the late mister Charles Dickens then I ve looked round the carriage full of city centred people and wondered how they d deal with the lunatic who ventured to suggest such an All the year round idea But nobody could be city centred on such a day and so early So let s talk She had laughed as he had meant her to laugh Now she seemed to throw away some scruple in the gesture with which she shrugged her shoulders and turned to him Very well she said and she was smiling Only I ve nothing to say Never mind I have he rejoined and proceeded to say it It seemed amusing to him as an experiment to talk to this girl this perfect stranger with a delicate candour that he would not have shown to his oldest friend It seemed interesting to lay bare save for a veiling of woven transparent impersonality his inmost mind It was interesting for the revelation drew her till they were talking together in a world where it seemed no more than natural for her to show him her soul and she had no skill to weave veils for it Such talk is rare so rare and so keen a pleasure indeed as to leave upon one s life if one be not a poet a mark strong and never to be effaced The slackening of the train at Halstead broke the spell which lay on both with a force equal in strength if diverse in kind Oh she said I get out here Good bye good bye He would not spoil the parting by banalities of hat raising amid the group of friends or relations who would doubtless meet her Good bye he said and his eyes made her take his offered hand Good bye I shall never forget you Never And then it seemed to him that the farewell lacked fire and he lifted her hand to his face He did not kiss it He laid it against his cheek sighed and dropped it The action was delicate and very effective It suggested the impulse almost irresistible yet resisted the well nigh overwhelming longing to kiss the hand kept in check by a respect that was almost devotion She should have torn her hand away She took it away gently and went Leisurely he got out of the train She had disappeared Well the bright little interlude was over Still it would give food for dreams among the ferny woods The first lines of a little song hummed themselves in his brain Eyes like stars in the night of life Seen but a moment and seen for ever He would finish them and send them to the Pall Mall Gazette That would be a guinea He wished the journey had been longer He would never see her again Perhaps it was just as well He crushed that last thought It would be good to dwell through the day on the thought of her the almost loved the wholly lost That could but have happened once And we missed it lost it for ever Her eyes were very pretty especially when they opened themselves so widely as she tried to express the thoughts that no one but he had ever cared to hear expressed The definite biography dead father ailing mother hard work hard life hard won post as High School Mistress were but as the hoarding on which was pasted the artistic poster of their meeting their parting He sighed as he walked along the platform The promise of June had fulfilled itself he was rich in a sorrow that did not hurt a regret that did not sting Poor little girl Poor pretty eyes Poor timid brave maiden soul Suddenly in his walk he stopped short Obliquely through the door of the booking office he saw her She was alone No troops of friends or relations had borne her off She was waiting for someone and someone had not come What was to be done He felt an odd chill If he had only not taken her hand in that silly way which had seemed at the time so artistically perfect The railway carriage talk might have been prolonged prettily indefinitely But that foolish contact had rung up the curtain on a transformation scene whose footlights needed at least a good make up for the facing of them She stood there looking down the road in every line of her figure was dejection hopelessness itself had drawn the line of her head s sideward droop His make up need be but of the simplest She had expected to meet someone and someone had not come His chivalric impulses leaping to meet the occasion s call bade him substitute a splendid replacement himself for the laggard tryst breaker Even though he knew that that touch of the hand must inaugurate the second volume of the day s romance He came behind her and spoke Hasn t he come He did not like himself for saying he but he said it It belonged to the second volume She turned with a start and a lighting of eyes and lips that almost taught him pity Not quite for the poet s nature is hard to teach He she said decently covering the light of lips and eyes as soon as might be It was a friend She was to come from Sevenoaks She ought to be here We were to have a little picnic together She glanced at her basket I didn t know you were getting out here Why The question died on trembling lips Why he repeated There was a pause And now what are you going to do he asked and his voice was full of tender raillery for her lost tryst with the girl friend and for her pretty helplessness I I don t know she said But I do he looked in her eyes You are going to be kind Life is so cruel You are going to help me to cheat Life and Destiny You are going to leave your friend to the waste desolation of this place if she comes by the next train but she won t she s kept at home by toothache or a broken heart or some little foolish ailment like that he prided himself on the light touch here and you are going to be adorably kind and sweet and generous and to let me drink the pure wine of life for this one day Her eyes drooped Fully inspired he struck a master chord in the lighter key You have a basket I have a brown paper parcel Let me carry both and we will share both We ll go to Chevening Park It will be fun Will you There was a pause he wondered whether by any least likely chance the chord had not rung true Then Yes she said half defiantly I don t see why I shouldn t Yes Then give me the basket he said and hey for the green wood The way led through green lanes through a green park where tall red sorrel and white daisies grew high among the grass that was up for hay The hawthorns were silvery the buttercups golden The gold sun shone the blue sky arched over a world of green and glory And so through Knockholt and up the narrow road to the meadow whose path leads to the steep wood way where Chevening Park begins They walked side by side and to both of them for he was now wholly lost in the delightful part for which this good summer world was the fitting stage to both of them it seemed that the green country was enchanted land and they under a spell that could never break They talked of all things under the sun he eager to impress her with that splendid self of his she anxious to show herself not wholly unworthy She too had read her Keats and her Shelley and her Browning and could cap and even overshadow his random quotations There is no one like you he said as they passed the stile above the wood no one in this beautiful world Her heart replied If there is anyone like you I have never met him and

none	none	that I have met you now Aloud she said There s a place under beech trees a sort of chalk plateau I used to have picnics there with my brothers when I was a little girl Shall we go there he asked Will you really take me to the place that your pretty memories haunt Ah how good you are to me As they went down the steep wood path she slipped stumbled he caught her Give me your hand he said This path s not safe for you It was not She gave him her hand and they went down into the wood together The picnic was gay as an August garden After a life of repression to meet someone to whom one might be oneself It was very good She said so That was when he did kiss her hand When lunch was over they sat on the sloped short turf and watched the rabbits in the warren below They sat there and they talked And to the end of her days no one will know her soul as he knew it that day and no one ever knew better than she that aspect of his soul which he chose that day to represent as its permanent form The hours went by and when the shadows began to lengthen and the sun to hide behind the wood they were sitting hand in hand All the entrenchments of her life s training her barriers of maidenly reserve had been swept away by the torrent of his caprice his indolently formed determination to drink the delicate sweet cup of this day to the full It was in silence that they went back along the wood path her hand in his as before Yet not as before for now he held it pressed against his heart Oh what a day what a day of days he murmured Was there ever such a day Could there ever have been Tell me tell me Could there And she answered turning aside a changed softened transfigured face You know you know So they reached the stile at the top of the wood and here when he had lent her his hand to climb it he paused still holding in his her hand Now or never should the third volume begin and end Should he Should he not Which would yield the more perfect memory the one kiss to crown the day or the kiss renounced the crown refused Her eyes beseeching deprecating fearing alluring decided the question He framed her soft face in his hands and kissed her full on the lips Then not so much for insurance against future entanglement as for the sound of the phrase which pleased him he was easily pleased at the moment he said A kiss for love for memory for despair It was almost in silence that they went through lanes still and dark across the widespread park lawns and down the narrow road to the station Her hand still lay against his heart The kiss still thrilled through them both They parted at the station He would not risk the lessening of the day s charming impression by a railway journey He could go to town by a later train He put her into a crowded carriage and murmured with the last hand pressure Thank God for this one day I shall never forget You will never forget This day is all our lives all that might have been I shall never forget she said In point of fact she never has forgotten She has remembered all even to the least light touch of his hand the slightest change in his soft kind voice That is why she has refused to marry the excellent solicitor who might have made her happy and faded and harassed still teaches to High School girls the Euclid and Algebra which they so deeply hate to learn As for him he went home in a beautiful dream and in the morning he wrote a song about her eyes which was so good that he sent it to the Athenaeum and got two guineas for it so that his holiday was really not altogether wasted THE FORCE OF HABIT FROM her very earliest teens every man she met had fallen at her feet Her father in paternal transports dignified and symbolic as the adoration of the Magi uncles in forced unwilling tribute cousins according to their kind even brothers resentful of their chains yet still enslaved lovers by the score persons disposed to marriage by the half dozen And she had smiled on them all because it was so nice to be loved and if one could make those who loved happy by smiling why smiles were cheap Not cheap like inferior soap but like the roses from a full June garden To one she gave something more than smiles herself to wit and behold her at twenty married to the one among her slaves to whom she had deigned to throw the handkerchief real Brussels be sure Behold her happy in the adoration of the one the only one among her adorers whom she herself could adore His name was John of course and it was a foregone conclusion that he should be a stock broker All the same he was nice which is something and she loved him which is everything The little new red brick Queen Anne villa was as the Garden of Eden to the man and the woman but the jerry builder is a reptile more cursed than the graceful serpent who in his handsome suit of green and gold pulled out the lynch pin from the wedding chariot of our first parents The new house Cloudesley its name was was damp as any cloud and the Paradise was shattered not by any romantic serpent and apple business but by plain honest every day rheumatism It was indeed as near rheumatic fever as one may go without tumbling over the grisly fence The doctor said Buxton John could not leave town There was a boom or a slump or something that required his personal supervision So her old nurse was called up from out of the mists of the grey past before he and she were hers and his and she went to Buxton in a specially reserved invalid carriage She went with half her dainty trousseau clothes a helpless invalid Now I don t want to advertise Buxton waters as a cure for rheumatism but I know for a fact that she had to be carried down to her first bath It was a marble bath and she felt like a Roman empress in it And before she had had ten days of marble baths she was almost her own man again and the youth in her danced like an imprisoned bottle imp But she was dull because there was no one to adore her She had always been fed on adoration and she missed her wonted food without the shadow of a guess that it was this she was missing It was perhaps unfortunate that her old nurse should have sprained a stout ankle in the very first of those walks on the moors which the Doctor recommended for the completion of the cure so magnificently inaugurated by the Marble Roman Empress baths She wrote to her John every day Long letters But when the letter was done what else was there left to do with what was left of the day She was very very bored One must obey one s doctor Else why pay him guineas So she walked out after pretty apologies to the nurse left lonely across the wonder wide moors She learned the springy gait of the true hill climber and drank in health and strength from the keen hill air The month was March She seemed to be the only person of her own dainty feather in Buxton So she walked the moors alone All her life joy had come to her in green elm and meadow land and this strange grey stone walled rocky country made her breathless with its austere challenge Yet life was good strength grew No longer she seemed to have a body to care for Soul and spirit were carried by something so strong as to delight in the burden A month her town doctor had said A fortnight taught her to wonder why he had said it Yet she felt lonely too small for those great hills The old nurse patient loving urged her lamb to go out in the fresh air and the lamb went It was on a grey day when the vast hill slopes seemed more than ever sinister and reluctant to the little figure that braved them She wore an old skirt and an old jacket her husband had slipped them in when he strapped her boxes They re warm he had said you may need them She had a rainbow dyed neckerchief and a little fur hat perky with a peacock s iridescent head and crest She was very pretty The paleness of her illness lent her a new charm And she walked the lonely road with an air She had never been a great walker and she was proud of each of the steps that this clear hill air gave her the courage to take And it was glorious after all to be alone the only human thing on these wide moors where the curlews mewed as if the place belonged to them There was a sound behind her The rattle of wheels She stopped She turned and looked Far below her lay the valley all about her was the immense quiet of the hills On the white road quite a long way off yet audible in that noble stillness hoofs rang wheels whirred She waited for the thing to pass for its rings of sound to die out in that wide pool of silence The wheels and the hoofs drew near The rattle and jolt grew louder She saw the horse and cart grow bigger and plainer In a moment it would have passed She waited It drew near In another moment it would be gone and she be left alone to meet again the serious inscrutable face of the grey landscape But the cart as it drew near drew up the driver tightened rein and the rough brown horse stopped his hairy legs set at a strong angle Have a lift asked the driver There was something subtly coercive in the absolute carelessness of the tone There was the hearer on foot here was the speaker in a cart She being on foot and he on wheels it was natural that he should offer her a lift in his cart it was a greengrocer s cart She could see celery cabbages a barrel or two and the honest blue eyes of the man who drove it the man who seeing a fellow creature at a disadvantage instantly offered to share such odds as Fate had allotted to him in life s dull handicap The sudden new impossible situation appealed to her If lifts were offered well that must mean that lifts were generally accepted In Rome one does as Rome does In Derbyshire evidently a peacock crested toque might ride unreproved by social criticism in a greengrocer s cart A tea tray on wheels it seemed to her She was a born actress she had that gift of throwing herself at a moment s notice into a given part which in our silly conventional jargon we nickname tact Thank you she said I should like it very much The box on which he arranged a seat for her contained haddocks He cushioned it with a sack and his own shabby greatcoat and lent her a thick rough hand for the mounting Which way were you going he asked and his voice was not the soft Peak sing song but something far more familiar I was only going for a walk she said but it s much nicer to drive I wasn t going anywhere Only I want to get back to Buxton some time I live there said he I must be home by five I ve a goodish round to do Will five be soon enough for you Quite she said and considered within herself what role it would be kindest most tactful most truly gentlewomanly to play She sought to find in a word the part to play that would best please the man who was with her That was what she had always tried to find With what success let those who love her tell I mustn t seem too clever she said to herself I must just be interested in what he cares about That s true politeness mother always said so So she talked of the price of herrings and the price of onions and of trade and of the difficulty of finding customers who had at once appreciation and a free hand When he drew up in some lean grey village or at the repellent gates of some isolated slate roofed house he gave her the reins to hold while he with his samples of fruit and fish laid out on basket lids wooed custom at the doors She experienced a strangely crescent interest in his sales Between the sales they talked She found it quite easy having swept back and penned in the major part of her knowledges and interests to leave a residuum that was quite enough to meet his needs As the chill dusk fell in cloudy folds over the giant hill shoulders and the cart turned towards home she shivered Are you cold he asked solicitously The wind strikes keen down between these beastly hills Beastly she repeated Don t you think they re beautiful Yes he said of course I see they re beautiful for other folks but not for me What I like is lanes an elm trees and farm buildings with red tiles and red walls round fruit gardens and cherry orchards and thorough good rich medders up for hay and lilac bushes and bits o flowers in the gardens same what I was used to at home She thrilled to the homely picture Why that s what I like too she said These great hills I don t see how they can feel like home to anyone There s a bit of an orchard one end of it is just a red barn wall and there are hedges round and it s all soft warm green lights and shadows and thrushes sing like mad That s home He looked at her Yes he said slowly that s home And then she went on the lanes with the high green hedges dog roses and brambles and may bushes and traveller s joy and the grey wooden hurdles and the gates with yellow lichen on them and the white roads and the light in the farm windows as you come home from work and the fire and the smell of apples from the loft Yes he said that s it I m a Kentish man myself You ve got a lot o words to talk with When he put her down at the edge of the town she went to rejoin her nurse feeling that to one human being at least she had that day been the voice of the home ideal and of all things sweet and fair And of course this pleased her very much Next morning she woke with the vague but sure sense of something pleasant to come She remembered almost instantly She had met a man on whom it was pleasant to smile and whom her smiles and her talk pleased And she thought quite honestly that she was being very philanthropic and lightening a dull life She wrote a long loving letter to John did a little shopping and walked out along a road It was the road by which he had told her that he would go the next day He overtook her and pulled up with a glad face that showed her the worth of her smiles and almost repaid it I was wondering if I d see you he said was you tired yesterday It s a fine day to day Isn t it glorious she returned blinking at the pale clear sun It makes everything look a heap prettier doesn t it Even this country that looks like as if it had had all the colour washed out of it in strong soda and suds Yes she said And then he spoke of yesterday s trade he had done well and of the round he had to go to day But he did not offer her a lift Won t you give me a drive to day she asked suddenly I enjoyed it so much Will you he cried his face lighting up as he moved to arrange the sacks I didn t like to offer I thought you d think I was takin too much on myself Come up reach me your hand Right oh The cart clattered away I was thinking ever since yesterday when I see you how is it you can think o so many words all at once It s just as if you was seeing it all the way you talked about the red barns and the grey gates and all such I do see it she said inside my mind you know I can see it all as plainly as I see these great cruel hills Yes said he that s just what they are they re cruel And the fields and woods is kind like folks you re friends with She was charmed with the phrase She talked to him coaxing him to make new phrases It was like teaching a child to walk He told her about his home It was a farm in Kent red brick with the glorydyjohn rose growin all up over the front door so that they never opened it The paint had stuck it fast said he it was quite a job to get it open to get father s coffin out I scraped the paint off then and oiled the hinges because I knew mother wouldn t last long And she didn t neither Then he told her how there had been no money to carry on the fruit growing and how his sister had married a greengrocer at Buxton and when everything went wrong he had come to lend a hand with their business And now I takes the rounds said he it s more to my mind nor mimming in the shop and being perlite to ladies You re very polite to me she said Oh yes he said but you re not a lady leastways I m sure you are in your art but you ain t a regular tip topper are you now Well no she said perhaps not that It piqued her that he should not have seen that she was a lady and yet it pleased her too It was a tribute to her power of adapting herself to her environment The cart rattled gaily on he talked with more and more confidence she with a more and more pleased consciousness of her perfect tact As they went a beautiful idea came to her She would do the thing thoroughly why not The episode might as well be complete I wish you d let me help you to sell the things she said I should like it Wouldn t you be above it he asked Not a bit she answered gaily Only I must learn the prices of things Tell me How much are the herrings He told her and at the first village she successfully sold seven herrings five haddocks three score of potatoes and so many separate pounds of apples that she lost count He was lavish of his praises You might have been brought up to it from a girl he said and she wondered how old he thought she was then She yawned no more over dull novels now Buxton no longer bored her She had suddenly discovered a new life a new stage on which to play a part her own ability in mastering which filled her with the pleasure of a clever child or a dog who has learned a new trick Of course it was not a new trick it was the old one It was impossible not to go out with the greengrocer every day What else was there to do How else could she exercise her most perfectly developed talent that of smiling on people till they loved her We all like to do that which we can do best And she never felt so contented as when she was exercising this incontestable talent of hers She did not know the talent for what it was She called it being nice to people So every day saw her with roses freshening in her cheeks driving over the moors in the wheeled tea tray And now she sold regularly One day he said What a wife you d make for a business chap But even that didn t warn her because she happened to be thinking of Jack and she thought how good a wife she meant to be to him He was a business chap too What are you really by trade I mean he said on another occasion Nothing in particular What did you think I was she said Oh I dunno I thought a lady s maid as likely as not or maybe in the dressmaking You aren t a common sort anyone can see that Again pique and pleasure fought in her She never so much as thought of telling him that she was married She saw no reason for it It was her role to enter into his life not to dazzle him with visions of hers At last that happened which was bound to happen And it happened under the shadow of a great rock in a cleft green grown and sheltered where the road runs beside the noisy stony rapid unnavigable river He had drawn the cart up on the grass and she had got down and was sitting on a stone eating sandwiches for her nurse had persuaded her to take her lunch with her so as to spend every possible hour on these life giving moors He had eaten bread and cheese standing by the horse s head It was a holiday He was not selling fish and vegetables He was in his best and she had never liked him so little As she finished her last dainty bite he threw away the crusts and rinds of his meal and came over to her Well he said with an abrupt tenderness that at once thrilled and revolted her don t you think it s time as we settled something betwixt us I don t know what you mean she said But quite suddenly and terribly she did Why he said I know well enough you re miles too good for a chap like me but if you don t think so that s all right And I tell you straight you re the only girl I ever so much as fancied Oh she breathed do you mean You know well enough what I mean my pretty he said but if you want it said out like in books I ve got it all on my tongue I love every inch of you and your clever ways and your pretty talk I haven t touched a drop these eight months I shall get on right enough with you to help me and we ll be so happy as never was There ain t ne er a man in England ll set more store by his wife nor I will by you nor be prouder on her You shan t do no hard work I promise you that Only just drive out with me and turn the customers round your finger I don t ask no questions about you nor your folks I know you re an honest girl and I d trust you with my head Come give me a kiss love and call it a bargain She had stood up while he was speaking but she literally could not find words to stop the flow of his speech Now she shrank back and said No no Don t you be so shy my dear he said Come just one And then I ll take you home and interduce you to my sister You ll like her I ve told her all about you Waves of unthinkable horror seemed to be closing over her head She struck out bravely and it seemed as though she were swimming for her life No she cried it s impossible You don t understand You don t know I know you ve been keeping company with me these ten days he said and his voice had changed What did you do it for if you didn t mean nothing by it I didn t know she said wretchedly I thought you liked being friends If it s what you call friends being all day long with a chap I don t so call it he said But come you re playing skittish now ain t you Don t tease a chap like this Can t you see I love you too much to stand it I know it sounds silly to say it but I love you before all the world I do my word I do He held out his arms I see I see you do she cried all her tact washed away by this mighty sea that had suddenly swept over her But I can t I m I m en I m promised to another young man I wonder what he ll say to this he said slowly I m so so sorry she said I d no idea I see he said you was just passing the time with me and you never wanted me at all And I thought you did Get in miss I ll take you back to the town I ve just about had enough holiday for one day I am so sorry she kept saying But he never answered Do forgive me she said at last Indeed I didn t mean Didn t mean said he lashing up the brown horse no and it don t matter to you if I think about you and want you every day and every night so long as I live It ain t nothing to you You ve had your fun And you ve got your sweetheart God I wish him joy of you Ah don t she said and her soft voice even here even now did not miss its effect I do like you very very much and She had never failed She did not fail now Before they reached the town he had formally forgiven her I don t suppose you meant no harm he said grudgingly though coming from Kent you ought to know how it is about walking out with a chap But you say you didn t and I ll believe you But I shan t get over this this many a long day so don t you make no mistake Why I ain t thought o nothing else but you ever since I first set eyes on you There don t you cry no more I can t abear to see you cry He was blinking himself Outside the town he stopped Good bye he said I haven t got nothing agin you but I wish to Lord above I d never seen you I shan t never fancy no one else after you Don t be unhappy she said And then she ought to have said good bye But the devil we call the force of habit would not let her leave well alone I want to give you something she said a keepsake to show I shall always be your friend Will you call at the house where I m staying this evening at eight I ll have it ready for you Don t think too unkindly of me Will you come He asked the address and said Yes He wanted to see her just once again and he would certainly like the keepsake She went home and looked out a beautiful book of Kentish photographs It was a wedding present and she had brought it with her to solace her in her exile by pictures of the home land Her unconscious thought was something like this Poor fellow poor poor fellow But he behaved like a gentleman about it I suppose there is something in the influence of a sympathetic woman I am glad I was a good influence She bathed her burning face cooled it with soft powder and slipped into a tea gown It was a trousseau one of rich heavy yellow silk and old lace and fur She chose it because it was warm and she was shivering with agitation and misery Then she went and sat with the old nurse and a few minutes before eight she ran out and stood by the front door so as to open it before he should knock She achieved this Come in she said and led him into the lodging house parlour and closed the door It was good of you to come she said taking the big beautiful book from the table This is what I want you to take just to remind you that we re friends She had forgotten the tea gown She was not conscious that the accustomed suavity of line the soft richness of texture influenced voice gait smile gesture But they did Her face was flushed after her tears and the powder which she had forgotten to dust off added the last touch to her beauty He took the book but he never even glanced at the silver and tortoise shell of its inlaid cover He was looking at her and his eyes were covetous and angry Are you an actress or what No she said shrinking Why What the hell are you then he snarled furiously I m I m a The old nurse scared by the voice raised beyond discretion had dragged herself to the door of division between her room and the parlour and now stood clinging to the door handle She s a lady young man said the nurse severely and her aunt s a lady of title and don t you forget it Forget it he cried with a laugh that Jack s wife remembers still she s a lady and she s fooled me this way I won t forget it nor she shan t neither By God I ll give her something to forget With that he caught the silken tea gown and Jack s trembling wife in his arms and kissed her more than once They were horrible kisses and the man smelt of onions and hair oil And I loved her curse her he cried flinging her away so that she fell against the arm of the chair by the fire He went out slamming both doors She had softened and bewitched him to the forgiving of the outrage that her indifference was to his love The outrage of her station s condescension to his was unforgivable She went back to her Jack next day She was passionately glad to see him Oh Jack she said I ll never never go away from you again But the greengrocer from Kent reeled down the street to the nearest public house At closing time he was telling in muffled muddled speech the wondrous tale how his girl was a real lady awfully gone on him pretty as paint and wore silk dresses every day She s a real lady she is he said Ay said the chucker out we know all about them sort o ladies Time please I tell you she is her aunt s a lady of title and the gal s that gone on me I expect I ll have to marry her to keep her quiet I ll have to chuck you out to keep you quiet returned the other Come on outside THE BRUTE THE pearl of the dawn was not yet dissolved in the gold cup of the sunshine but in the northwest the dripping opal waves were ebbing fast to the horizon and the sun was already half risen from his couch of dull crimson She leaned out of her window By fortunate chance it was a jasmine muffled lattice as a girl s window should be and looked down on the dewy stillness of the garden The cloudy shadows that had clung in the earliest dawn about the lilac bushes and rhododendrons had faded like grey ghosts and slowly on lawn and bed and path new black shadows were deepening and intensifying She drew a deep breath What a picture The green garden the awakened birds the roses that still looked asleep the scented jasmine stars She saw and loved it all Nor was she unduly insensible to the charm of the central figure the girl in the white lace trimmed gown who leaned her soft arms on the window sill and looked out on the dawn with large dark eyes Of course she knew that her eyes were large and dark also that her hair was now at its prettiest rumpled and tumbled from the pillow and far prettier so than one dared to allow it to be in the daytime It seemed a pity that there should be no one in the garden save the birds no one who had awakened thus early just that he might gather a rose and cover it with kisses and throw it up to the window of his pretty sweetheart She had but recently learned that she was pretty It was on the evening after the little dance at the Rectory She had worn red roses at her neck and when she had let down her hair she had picked up the roses from her dressing table and stuck them in the loose rough brown mass and stared into the glass till she was half mesmerised by her own dark eyes She had come to herself with a start and then she had known quite surely that she was pretty enough to be anyone s sweetheart When she was a child a well meaning aunt had told her that as she would never be pretty or clever she had better try to be good or no one would love her She had tried and she had never till that red rose day doubted that such goodness as she had achieved must be her only claim to love Now she knew better and she looked out of her window at the brightening sky and the deepening shadows But there was no one to throw her a rose with kisses on it If I were a man she said to herself but in a very secret shadowy corner of her inmost heart and in a wordless whisper if I were a man I would go out this minute and find a sweetheart She should have dark eyes too and rough brown hair and pink cheeks In the outer chamber of her mind she said briskly It s a lovely morning It s a shame to waste it indoors I ll go out The sun was fully up when she stole down through the still sleeping house and out into the garden now as awake as a lady in full dress at the court of the King The garden gate fell to behind her and the swing of her white skirts went down the green lane On such a morning who would not wear white She walked with the quick grace of her nineteen years and as she went fragments of the undigested poetry that had been her literary diet of late swirled in her mind With tears and smiles from heaven again The maiden spring upon the plain Came in a sunlit fall of rain and so on though this was July and not spring at all And A man had given all other bliss And all his worldly work for this To waste his whole heart in one kiss Upon her perfect lips Her own lips were not perfect yet as lips went they were well enough and anyway kisses would not be wasted on them She went down the lane full of the anxious trembling longing that is youth s unrecognised joy and at the corner where the lane meets the high white road she met him That is to say she stopped short as the whispering silence of the morning was broken by a sudden rattle and a heavy thud not pleasant to hear And he and his bicycle fell together six yards from her feet The bicycle bounded and twisted and settled itself down with bold resentful clatterings The man lay without moving Her Tennyson quotations were swept away She ran to help Oh are you hurt she said He lay quite still There was blood on his head and one arm was doubled under his back What could she do She tried to lift him from the road to the grass edge of it He was a big man but she did succeed in raising his shoulders and freeing that right arm As she lifted it he groaned She sat down in the dust of the road and lowered his shoulders till his head lay on her lap Then she tied her handkerchief round his head and waited till someone should pass on the way to work Three men and a boy came after the long half hour in which he lay unconscious the red patch on her handkerchief spreading slowly and she looking at him and getting by heart every line of the pale worn handsome face She spoke to him she stroked his hair She touched his white cheek with her finger tips and wondered about him and pitied him and took possession of him as a new and precious appanage of her life so that when the labourers appeared she said He s very badly hurt Go and fetch some more men and a hurdle and the boy might run for the doctor Tell him to come to the White House It s nearest and it may be dangerous to move him further The Blue Lion ain t but a furlong further miss said one of the men touching his cap It s much more than that said she who had but the vaguest notion of a furlong s length Do go and do what I tell you They went and as they went remorselessly dissected with the bluntest instruments her motives and her sentiments It was not hidden from them that wordless whisper in the shadowy inner chamber of her heart Perhaps the Blue Lion isn t so very much further but I can t give him up No I can t But it was almost hidden from her In her mind s outer hall she said I m sure I ought to take him home No girl in a book would hesitate And I can make it all right with mother It would be cruel to give him up to strangers Deep in her heart the faint whisper followed I found him he s mine I won t let him go He stirred a little before they came back with the hurdle and she took his uninjured hand and pressed it firmly and kindly and told him it was all right he would feel better presently She did have him carried home and when the doctor had set the arm and the collar bone and had owned that it would be better not to move him at present she knew that her romance would not be cut short just yet She did not nurse him because it is only in books that young girls of the best families act as sick nurses to gentlemen But her mother dear kind clever foolish gentlewoman did the nursing and the daughter gathered flowers daily to brighten his room And when he was better yet still not well enough to resume the bicycle tour so sharply interrupted by a flawed nut she read to him and talked to him and sat with him in the hushed August garden Up to this point observe her interest had been purely romantic He was a man of forty five Perhaps he had a younger brother a splendid young man and the brother would like her because she had been kind He had lived long abroad had no relatives in England He knew her Cousin Reginald at Johannesburg everyone knew everyone else out there The brother there really was a brother would come some day to thank her mother for all her goodness and she would be at the window and look down and he would look up and the lamp of life would be lighted She longed with heart whole earnestness to be in love with someone for as yet she was only in love with love But on the evening when there was a full moon the time of madness as everybody knows her mother falling asleep after dinner in her cushioned chair in the lamp lit drawing room he and she wandered out into the garden They sat on the seat under the great apple tree He was talking gently of kindness and gratitude and of how he would soon be well enough to go away She listened in silence and presently he grew silent too under the spell of the moonlight She never knew exactly how it was that he took her hand but he was holding it gently strongly as if he would never let it go Their shoulders touched The silence grew deeper and deeper She sighed involuntarily not because she was unhappy but because her heart was beating so fast Both were looking straight before them into the moonlight Suddenly he turned put his other hand on her shoulder and kissed her on the lips At that instant her mother called her and she went into the lamp light She said good night at once She wanted to be alone to realise the great and wonderful awakening of her nature its awakening to love for this was love the love the poets sang about A kiss a touch the charm was snapped She wanted to be alone to think about him But she did not think She hugged to her heart the physical memory of that strong magnetic hand clasp the touch of those smooth sensitive lips on hers held it close to her till she fell asleep still thrilling with the ecstasy of her first lover s kiss Next day they were formally engaged and now her life became an intermittent delirium She longed always to be alone with him to touch his hands to feel his cheek against hers She could not understand the pleasure which he said he felt in just sitting near her and watching her sewing or reading as he sat talking to her mother of dull things politics and the war and landscape gardening If she had been a man she said to herself always far down in her heart she would have found a way to sit near the beloved so that at least hands might meet now and then unseen But he disliked public demonstrations and he loved her She however was merely in love with him That was why when he went away she found it so difficult to write to him She thought his letters cold though they told her of all his work his aims ambitions hopes because not more than half a page was filled with lover s talk He could have written very different letters indeed he had written such in his time and to more than one address but he was wise with the wisdom of forty years and he was beginning to tremble for her happiness because he loved her When she complained that his letters were cold he knew that he had been wise She found it very difficult to write to him It was far easier to write to Cousin Reginald who always wrote such long interesting letters all about interesting things Cousin Reginald who had lived with them at the White House till a year ago and who knew all the little family jokes and the old family worries They had been engaged for eight months when he came down to see her without any warning letter She was alone in the drawing room when he was announced and with a cry of joy she let fall her work on the floor and ran to meet him with arms outstretched He caught her wrists No he said and the light of joy in her face made it not easy to say it My dear I ve come to say something to you and I mustn t kiss you till I ve said it The light had died out You re not tired of me He laughed No not tired of you my little princess but I am going away for a year If you still love me when I come back we ll be married But before I go I must say something to you Her eyes were streaming with tears Oh how can you be so cruel she said and her longing to cling to him to reassure herself by personal contact set her heart beating wildly I don t want to be cruel he said you understand dear that I love you and it s just because I love you that I must say it Now sit down there and let me speak Don t interrupt me if you can help it Consider it a sort of lecture you re bound to sit through He pushed her gently towards a chair She sat down sulkily awkwardly and he stood by the window looking out at the daffodils and early tulips Dear I am afraid I have found something out I don t think you love me Oh how can you how can you Be patient he said I ve wondered almost from the first You re almost a child and I m an old man oh no I don t mean that that s any reason why you shouldn t love me but it s a reason for my making very sure that you do before I let you marry me It s your happiness I have to think of most Now shall I just go away for a year or shall I speak straight out and tell you everything If your father were alive I would try to tell him I can t tell your mother she wouldn t understand You can understand Shall I tell you Yes she said looking at him with frightened eyes Well look back You think you love me Haven t my letters always bored you a little though they were about all the things I care for most I don t understand politics she said sullenly And I don t understand needle work but I could sit and watch you sew for ever and a day Well go on What other crime have I committed besides not going into raptures over Parliament She was growing angry and he was glad It is not so easy to hurt people when they are angry And when I am talking to your mother that bores you too and when we are alone you don t care to talk of anything but but This task was harder than he had imagined possible I ve loved you too much and I ve shown it too plainly she said bitterly My dear you ve never loved me at all You have only been in love with me And isn t that the same thing Oh it s no use he said I must be a brute then No it s not the same thing It s your poets and novelists who pretend it is It s they who have taught you all wrong It s only half of love and the worst half the most untrustworthy the least lasting My little girl when I kissed you first you were just waking up to your womanhood you were ready for love as a flower bud is ready for sunshine and I happened to be the first man who had the chance to kiss you and hold your dear little hands Do you mean that I should have liked anyone else as well if he had only been kind enough to kiss me No no but I wish girls were taught these things out of books If you only knew what it costs me to be honest with you how I have been tempted to let you marry me and chance everything Don t you see you re a woman now women were made to be kissed and when a man behaves like a brute and kisses a girl without even asking first or finding out first whether she loves him it s not fair on the girl I shall never forgive myself Don t you see I took part of you by storm the part of you that is just woman nature not yours but everyone s and how were you to know that you didn t love me that it was only the awakening of your woman nature I hate you she said briefly Yes he answered simply I knew you would Hate is only one step from passion She rose in a fury How dare you use that word to me she cried Oh you are a brute You are quite right I don t love you I hate you I despise you Oh you brute Don t he said I only used that word because it s what people call the thing when it s a man who feels it With you it s what I said the unconscious awakening of the womanhood God gave you Try to forgive me Have I said anything so very dreadful It s a very little thing dear the sweet kindness you ve felt for me It s nothing to be ashamed or angry about It s not a hundredth part of what I have felt when you have kissed me It s because it s such a poor foundation to build a home on that I am frightened for you Suppose you got tired of my kisses and there was nothing more in me that you did care for And that sort of lover s love doesn t last for ever without the other kind of love Oh don t say any more she cried jumping up from her chair I did love you with all my heart I was sorry for you I thought you were so different Oh how could you say these things to me Go Shall I come back in a year he asked smiling rather sadly Come back Never I ll never speak to you again I ll never see you again I hope to God I shall never hear your name again Go at once You ll be grateful to me some day he said when you ve found out that love and being in love are not the same thing What is love then The kind of love you d care for I care for it all he said I think love is tenderness esteem affection interest pity protection and passion Yes you needn t be frightened by the word it is the force that moves the world but it s only a part of love Oh I see it s no good God bless you child you ll understand some day She does understand now she has married her Cousin Reginald and she understands deeply and completely But she only admits this in that deep shadowy almost disowned corner of her heart In the reception room of her mind she still thinks of her first lover as That Brute DICK TOM AND HARRY AND so I look in to see her whenever I can spare half an hour I fancy it cheers her up a bit to have some one to talk to about Edinburgh and all that You say you re going to tell her about its having been my doing your getting that berth Now I won t have it You promised you wouldn t I hate jaw as you know and I don t want to have her gassing about gratitude and all that rot I don t like it even from you So stow all that piffle You d do as much for me any day I suppose Edinburgh is a bit dull but you ve got all the higher emotions of our fallen nature to cheer you up Essex Court is dull if you like It s three years since I had the place to myself and I tell you it s pretty poor sport I don t seem to care about duchesses or the gilded halls nowadays Getting old I suppose Really my sole recreation is going to see another man s girl and letting her prattle prettily about him Lord what fools these mortals be Sorry I couldn t answer your letter before I suppose you ll be running up for Christmas So long I m taking her down those Ruskins she wanted Here s luck The twisted knot of three thin initials at the end of the letter stood for one of the set of names painted on the black door of the Temple Chambers The other names were those of Tom who had strained a slender competence to become a barrister and finding the achievement unremunerative had been glad enough to get the chance of sub editing a paper in Edinburgh Dick enveloped and stamped his letter threw it on the table and went into his bedroom When he came back in a better coat and a newer tie he looked at the letter and shrugged his shoulders and he frowned all the way down the three flights and as far as Brick Court Here he posted the letter Then he shrugged his shoulders again but after the second shrug the set of them was firmer As his hansom swung through the dancing lights of the Strand he shrugged his shoulders for the third time And at that his tame devil came as at a signal and drew a pretty curtain across all thoughts save one the thought of the other man s girl Indeed hardly a thought was left rather a sense of her of those disquieting soft eyes of hers the pretty hands the frank laugh the long beautiful lines her gowns took on the unexpected twists and curves of her hair above all the reserve veiling tenderness as snowflakes might veil a rose with which she spoke of the other man Dick had known Tom for all of their men s lives and they had been friends Both had said so often enough But now he thought of him as the other man The lights flashed past Dick s eyes were fixed on a picture A pleasant room an artist s room prints sketches green curtains the sparkle of old china fire and candle light A girl in a long straight dress he could see the little line where it would catch against her knee as she came forward to meet him with both hands outstretched Would it be both hands He decided that it would to night He was right even to the little line in the sea blue gown Both hands such long thin magnetic hands You are good she said at once Oh you must let me thank you Tom s told me who it was that got him that splendid berth Oh what a friend you are And lending him the money and everything I can t tell you It s too much You are Don t he said it s nothing at all It s everything said she Tom s told me quite all about it mind I know we owe everything to you My dear Miss Harcourt he began But she interrupted him Why not Harry she asked I thought Yes Thank you But it was nothing You see I couldn t let poor old Tom go on breaking his heart in silence when just writing a letter or two would put him in a position to speak She had held his hands or he hers or both all this time Now she moved away to the fire Come and sit down and be comfortable she said This is the chair you like And I ve got some cigarettes your very own kind from the Stores She remembered a time when she had thought that it was he Dick who might break his heart for her The remembrance of that vain thought was a constant pin prick to her vanity a constant affront to her modesty She had tried to snub him in those days to show him that his hopes were vain And after all he hadn t had any hopes he d only been anxious about Tom In the desolation of her parting from Tom she had longed for sympathy Dick had given it and she had been kinder to him than she had ever been to any man but her lover first because he was her lover s friend and secondly because she wanted to pretend to herself that she had never fancied that there was any reason for not being kind to him She sat down in the chair opposite to his Now she said I won t thank you any more if you hate it so but you are good and neither of us will ever forget it He sat silent for a moment He had played for this for this he had delayed to answer the letter wherein Tom announced his intention of telling Harriet the whole fair tale of his friend s goodness He had won the trick Yet for an instant he hesitated to turn it over Then he shrugged his shoulders I will not mention this again but it was a tiresome way he had when the devil or the guardian angel were working that curtain I told you of and said Dear little lady you make me wish that I were good Then he sighed it was quite a real sigh and she wondered whether he could possibly not be good right through Was it possible that he was wicked in some of those strange mysterious ways peculiar to men billiards barmaids opera balls flashed into her mind Perhaps she might help him to be good She had heard the usual pretty romances about the influence of a good woman Come she said light up and tell me all about everything So he told her many things And now and then he spoke of Tom just to give himself the pleasure pain of that snow veiled rose aspect He kissed her hand when he left her a kiss of studied brotherliness Yet the kiss had in it a tiny heart of fire fierce enough to make her wonder when he had left her whether after all But she put the thought away hastily I may be a vain fool she said but I won t be fooled by my vanity twice over And she kissed Tom s portrait and went to bed Dick went home in a heavenly haze of happiness so he told himself as he went When he woke up at about three o clock and began to analyse his sensations he had cooled enough to call it an intoxication of pleasurable emotion At three in the morning if ever the gilt is off the ginger bread Dick lay on his back his hands clenched at his sides and gazing open eyed into the darkness he saw many things He saw all the old friendship the easy jolly life in those rooms the meeting with Harriet Harcourt it was at a fancy ball and she wore the white and black dress of a Beardsley lady he remembered the contrast of the dress with her eyes and mouth He saw the days when his thoughts turned more and more to every chance of meeting her as though each had been his only chance of life He saw the Essex Court sitting room as it had looked on the night when Tom had announced that Harriet was the only girl in the world adding at almost a night s length that impassioned statement of his hopeless financial condition He could hear Tom s voice as he said And I know she cares Dick felt again the thrill of pleasure that had come with the impulse to be for once really noble to efface himself to give up the pursuit that lighted his days the dream that enchanted his nights His own voice too he heard Cheer up old chap We ll find a lucrative post for you in five minutes and set the wedding bells a ringing in half an hour or less Why on earth didn t you tell me before The glow of conscious nobility had lasted a long while nearly a week if he recollected aright Then had come the choice of two openings for Tom one in London and one equally good in Edinburgh Dick had chosen to offer to his friend the one in Edinburgh He had told himself then that both lovers would work better if they were not near enough to waste each other s time and he had almost believed he was almost sure even now that he had almost believed that this was the real reason But when Tom had gone there had been frank tears in the lovers parting and Dick had walked up the platform to avoid the embarrassment of witnessing them You beast you brute you hound said Dick to himself lying rigid and wretched in the darkness You knew well enough that you wanted him out of the way And you promised to look after her and keep her from being dull And you ve done all you can to keep your word haven t you She hasn t been dull I swear And you ve been playing for your own hand and that poor stupid honest chap down there slaving away and trusting you as he trusts God And you ve written him lying letters twice a week and betrayed him as far as you got the chance every day and seen what a cur you are every night as you see it now Oh yes you re succeeding splendidly She forgets to think of Tom when she s talking to you How often did she mention him last night It was you every time You re not fit to speak to a decent man you reptile He relaxed the clenched hands Can t you stop this infernal see saw he asked pounding at his pillow light and fire every day and hell black ice every night Look at it straight you coward If you re game to face the music why face it Marry her and friendship and honesty be damned Or perhaps you might screw yourself up to another noble act not a shoddy one this time Still sneering he got up and pottered about in slippers and pyjamas till he had stirred together the fire and made himself cocoa He drank it and smoked two pipes This is very unromantic but so it was He slept after that When he woke in the morning all things looked brighter He almost succeeded in pretending that he did not despise himself But there was a letter from Tom and the guardian angel took charge of the curtain again He was tired brain and body The prize seemed hardly worth the cost The question of relative values at any rate seemed debatable The day passed miserably At about five o clock he was startled to feel the genuine throb of an honest impulse Such an impulse in him at that hour of the day when usually the devil was arranging the curtain for the evening s tragi comedy was so unusual as to rouse in him a psychologic interest strong enough to come near to destroying its object But the flame of pleasure lighted by the impulse fought successfully against the cold wind of cynical analysis and he stood up Upon my word said he the copy books are right Be virtuous and you will be happy At least if you aren t you won t And if you are One could but try He packed a bag He went out and sent telegrams to his people at King s Lynn and to all the folk in town with whom he ought in these next weeks to have danced and dined and he wrote a telegram to her But that went no further than the floor of the Fleet Street Post Office where it lay in trampled scattered rhomboids Then he dined in Hall he could not spare from his great renunciation even such a thread of a thought as should have decided his choice of a restaurant and he went back to the gloomy little rooms and wrote a letter to Tom It seemed until his scientific curiosity was aroused by the seeming that he wrote with his heart s blood After the curiosity awoke the heart s blood was only highly coloured water Look here I can t stand it any longer I m a brute and I know it and I know you ll think so The fact is I ve fallen in love with your Harry and I simply can t bear it seeing her every day almost and knowing she s yours and not mine there the analytic demon pricked up its ears and the scratching of the pen ceased I have fought against this the letter went on after a long pause You don t know how I ve fought but it s stronger than I am I love her impossibly unbearably the only right and honourable thing to do is to go away and I m going My only hope is that she ll never know Your old friend As he scrawled the signatory hieroglyphic his only hope was that she would know it and that the knowledge would leaven with tenderly pitying thoughts of him the heroic figure her happiness with Tom the commonplace He addressed and stamped the envelope but he did not close it I might want to put in another word or two he said to himself And even then in his inmost heart he hardly knew that he was going to her He knew it when he was driving towards Chenies Street and then he told himself that he was going to bid her good bye for ever Angel and devil were so busy shifting the curtain to and fro that he could not see any scene clearly He came into her presence pale with his resolution to be noble to leave her for ever to happiness and Tom It was difficult though even at that supreme moment to look at her and to couple those two ideas I ve come to say good bye he said Good bye the dismay in her eyes seemed to make that unsealed letter leap in his side pocket Yes I m going circumstances I can t help I m going away for a long time Is it bad news Oh I am sorry When are you going To morrow he said even as he decided to say to night But you can stay a little now can t you Don t go like this It s dreadful I shall miss you so He fingered the letter I must go and post a letter then I ll come back if I may Where did I put that hat of mine As she turned to pick up the hat from the table he dropped the letter the heart s blood written letter on the floor behind him I ll be back in a minute or two he said and went out to walk up and down the far end of Chenies Street and to picture her alone with his letter She saw it at the instant when the latch of her flat clicked behind him She picked it up and mechanically turned it over to look at the address He in the street outside knew just how she would do it Then she saw that the letter was unfastened How often had Tom said that there were to be no secrets between them This was his letter But it might hold Dick s secrets But then if she knew Dick s secrets she might be able to help him He was in trouble anyone could see that awful trouble She turned the letter over and over in her hands He without walking with half closed eyes felt that she was so turning it Suddenly she pulled the letter out and read it He out in the gas lit night knew how it would strike at her pity her tenderness her strong love of all that was generous and noble He pictured the scene that must be when he should re enter her room and his heart beat wildly He held himself in he was playing the game now in deadly earnest He would give her time to think of him to pity him time even to wonder whether after all duty and honour had not risen up in their might to forbid him to dare to try his faith by another sight of her He waited keenly aware that long as the waiting was to him who knew what the ending was to be it must be far far longer for her who did not know At last he went back to her And the scene that he had pictured in the night where the east wind swept the street was acted out now exactly as he had foreseen it She held in her hand the open letter She came towards him still holding it I ve read your letter she said In her heart she was saying I must be brave Never mind modesty and propriety Tom could never love me like this He s a hero my hero In the silence that followed her confession he seemed to hear almost the very words of her thought He hung his head and stood before her in the deep humility of a chidden child I am sorry he said I am ashamed Forgive me I couldn t help it No one could Good bye Try to forgive me He turned to go but she caught him by the arms He had been almost sure she would You mustn t go she said Oh I am sorry for Tom but it s not the same for him There are lots of people he d like just as well but you Hush he said gently don t think of me I shall be all right I shall get over it His sad set smile assured her that he never would never in this world or the next Her eyes were shining with the stress of the scene his with the charm of it You are so strong so brave so good she made herself say I can t let you go Oh don t you see I can t let you suffer You ve suffered so much already you ve been so noble Oh it s better to know now If I d found out later She hung her head and waited But he would not spare her Since he had sold his soul he would have the price the full price to the last blush the last tear the last tremble in the pretty voice Let me go he said and his voice shook with real passion let me go I can t bear it He took her hands gently from his arms and held them lightly Next moment they were round his neck and she was clinging wildly to him Don t be unhappy I can t bear it Don t you see Ah don t you see Then he allowed himself to let her know that he did see When he left her an hour later she stood in the middle of her room and drew a long breath Oh she cried What have I done What have I done He walked away with the maiden fire of her kisses thrilling his lips I ve won I ve won I ve won His heart sang within him But when he woke in the night these months had taught him the habit of waking in the night and facing his soul he said It was very easy after all very very easy And was it worth while But the next evening when they met neither tasted in the other s kisses the bitterness of last night s regrets And in three days Tom was to come home He came All the long way in the rattling shaking train a song of delight sang itself over and over in his brain He too had his visions he was not too commonplace for those He saw her her bright beauty transfigured by the joy of reunion rushing to meet him with eager hands and gladly given lips He thought of all he had to tell her The fifty pounds saved already The Editor s probable resignation his own almost certain promotion the incredibly dear possibility of their marriage before another year had passed It seemed a month before he pressed the electric button at her door and pressed it with a hand that trembled for joy The door opened and she met him but this was not the radiant figure of his vision It seemed to be not she but an image of her an image without life without colour Come in she said I ve something to tell you What is it he asked bluntly What s happened Harry What s the matter I ve found out she said slowly but without hesitation had she not rehearsed the speech a thousand times in these three days I ve found out that it was a mistake Tom I I love somebody else Don t ask who it is I love him Ah don t For his face had turned a leaden white and he was groping blindly for something to hold on to He sat down heavily on the chair where Dick had knelt at her feet the night before But now it was she who was kneeling Oh don t Tom dear don t I can t bear it I m not worth it He s so brave and noble and he loves me so And don t I love you said poor Tom and then without ado or disguise he burst into tears She had ceased to think or to reason Her head was on his shoulder and they clung blindly to each other and cried like two children When Tom went to the Temple that night he carried a note from Harry to Dick With sublime audacity and a confidence deserved she made Tom her messenger It s a little secret she said smiling at him and you re not to know Tom thought it must be something about a Christmas present for himself He laughed a little shakily and took the note Dick read it and crushed it in his hand while Tom poured out his full heart There s been some nonsense while I was away he said she must have been dull and unhinged you left her too much alone old man But it s all right now She couldn t care for anyone but me after all and she knew it directly she saw me again And we re to be married before next year s out if luck holds Here s luck old man said Dick lifting his whisky When Tom had gone to bed weary with the quick sequence of joy and misery and returning joy Dick read the letter again I can t do it said the letter it s not in me He loves me too much And I am fond of him He couldn t bear it He s weak you see He s not like you brave and strong and noble But I shall always be better because you ve loved me I m going to try to be brave and noble and strong like you And you must help me Dear God bless you Good bye After all said Dick as he watched the white letter turn in the fire to black gold spangled after all it was not so easy And oh how it would have been worth while MISS EDEN S BABY MISS EDEN S life history was a sad one She told it to her employer before she had been a week at the Beeches missus Despard came into the school room and surprised the governess in tears No one could ever resist missus Despard I suppose she has had more confidences than any woman in Sussex Anyhow Miss Eden dried her tears and faltered out her poor little story She had been engaged to be married missus Despard s was a face trained to serve and not to betray its owner so she did not look astonished though Miss Eden was so very homely poor thing that the idea of a lover seemed almost ludicrous she had been engaged to be married and her lover had been killed at Elendslaagte and her father had died of heart disease an attack brought on by the shock of the news and his partner had gone off with all his money and now she had to go out as a governess her mother and sister were living quietly on the mother s little fortune There was enough for two but not enough for three So Miss Eden had gone governessing But you needn t pity me for that she said when missus Despard said something kind because really it s better for me If I were at home doing nothing I should just sit and think of him for hours and hours at a time He was so brave and strong and good he died cheering his men on and waving his sword and he did love me so We were to have been married in August She was weeping again more violently than before missus Despard comforted her there is no one who comforts so well and the governess poured out her heart When the dressing bell rang Miss Eden pulled herself together with a manifest effort I ve been awfully weak and foolish she said and you ve been most kind Please forgive me and and I think I d rather not speak of it any more ever It s been a relief just this once but I m going to be brave Thank you thank you for all your goodness to me I shall never forget it And now Miss Eden went about her duties with a courageous smile and missus Despard could not but see and pity the sad heart beneath the bravely assumed armour Miss Eden was fairly well educated and she certainly was an excellent teacher The children made good progress She worshipped missus Despard but then every one did that and she made herself pleasures of the little things she was able to do for her mending linen arranging flowers running errands and nursing the Baby She adored the Baby She used to walk by herself in the Sussex lanes for missus Despard often set her free for two or three hours at a time and more than once the mother and children turning some leafy corner in their blackberrying or nutting expeditions came upon Miss Eden walking along with a far away look in her eyes and a face set in a mask of steadfast endurance She would sit sewing on the lawn with Mabel and Gracie playing about her answering their ceaseless chatter with a patient smile To missus Despard she was a pathetic figure mister Despard loathed her but then he never liked women unless they were pretty I ought to be used to your queer pets by now he said but really this one is almost too much Upon my soul she s the ugliest woman I ve ever seen She certainty was not handsome Her eyes were fairly good but mouth and nose were clumsy and hers was one of those faces that seem to have no definite outline Her complexion was dull and unequal Her hair was straight and coarse and somehow it always looked dusty Her figure was her only good point and as mister Despard observed If a figure without a face is any good why not have a dressmaker s dummy and have done with it mister Despard was very glad when he heard that a little legacy had come from an uncle and that Miss Eden was going to give up governessing and live with her people Miss Eden left in floods of tears and she clung almost frantically to missus Despard You have been so good to me she said I may write to you mayn t I and come and see you sometimes You will let me won t you Tears choked her and she was driven off in the station fly And a new governess young commonplacely pretty and entirely heart whole came to take her place to the open relief of mister Despard and the little less pronounced satisfaction of the little girls She ll write to you by every post now I suppose said mister Despard when the conventional letter of thanks for kindness came to his wife But Miss Eden did not write again till Christmas Then she wrote to ask missus Despard s advice There was a gentleman a retired tea broker in a very good position She liked him did missus Despard think it would be fair to marry him when her heart was buried for ever in that grave at Elendslaagte But I don t want to be selfish and poor mister Cave is so devoted My dear mother thinks he would never be the same again if I refused him mister Despard read the letter and told his wife to tell the girl to take the tea broker for goodness sake and be thankful She d never get such another chance His wife told him not to be coarse and wrote a gentle motherly letter to Miss Eden On New Year s Day came a beautiful and very expensive handkerchief sachet for missus Despard and the news that Miss Eden was engaged And already she wrote I feel that I can really become attached to Edward He is goodness itself Of course it is not like the other That only comes once in a woman s life but I believe I shall really be happy in a quiet humdrum way After that news of Miss Eden came thick and fast Edward was building a house for her Edward had bought her a pony carriage Edward had to call his house No seventy Queen s Road a new Town Council resolution and it wasn t in a street at all but quite in the country only there was going to be a road there some day And she had so wanted to call it the Beeches after dear missus Despard s house where she had been so happy The wedding day was fixed and would missus Despard come to the wedding Miss Eden knew it was a good deal to ask but if she only would It would add more than you can possibly guess to my happiness she said if you could come There is plenty of room in my mother s little house It is small but very convenient and it has such a lovely old garden so unusual you know in the middle of a town and if only dear Mabel and Gracie might be among my little bridesmaids The dresses are to be half transparent white silk over rose colour Dear Edward s father insists on ordering them himself from Liberty s The other bridesmaids will be Edward s little nieces such sweet children Mother is giving me the loveliest trousseau Of course I shall make it up to her but she will do it and I give way just to please her It s not pretentious you know but everything so good Real lace on all the under things and twelve of everything and The letter wandered on into a maze of lingerie and millinery and silk petticoats mister and missus Despard were still debating the question of the bridesmaids whose dresses were to come from Liberty s when a telegraph boy crossed the lawn missus Despard tore open the envelope Oh how frightfully sad she said I am sorry Edward s father dangerously ill Wedding postponed The next letter was black edged and was not signed Eden Edward s father had insisted on the marriage taking place before he died it had in fact been performed by his bedside It had been a sad time but missus Edward was very happy now My husband is so good to me his thoughtful kindness is beyond belief she wrote He anticipates my every wish I should be indeed ungrateful if I did not love him dearly Dear missus Despard this gentle domestic love is very beautiful I hope I am not treacherous to my dead in being as happy as I am with Edward Ah I hear the gate click I must run and meet him He says it is not like coming home unless my face is the first he sees when he comes in Good bye A thousand thanks for ever for all your goodness Your grateful Ella Cave Either their carriage drive is unusually long or her face was not the first said mister Despard Why didn t she go and meet the man and not stop to write all that rot Don t Bill said his wife You were always so unjust to that girl Girl said mister Despard And now the letters were full of detail the late Miss Eden wrote a good hand and expressed herself with clearness Her letters were a pleasure to missus Despard Poor dear she said It really rejoices my heart to think of her being so happy She describes things very well I almost feel as though I knew every room in her house it must be very pretty with all those Liberty muslin blinds and the Persian rugs and the chair backs Edward s grandmother worked and then the beautiful garden I think I must go to see it all I do love to see people happy You generally do see them happy said her husband it s a way people have when they re near you Go and see her by all means And missus Despard would have gone but a letter bearing the same date as her own crossed it in the post it must have been delayed for it reached her on the day when she expected an answer to her own letter offering a visit But the late Miss Eden had evidently not received this for her letter was a mere wail of anguish Edward is ill typhoid I am distracted Write to me when you can The very thought of you comforts me Poor thing said missus Despard I really did think she was going to be happy Her sympathetic interest followed Edward through all the stages of illness and convalescence as chronicled by his wife s unwearying pen Then came the news of the need of a miniature trousseau and the letters breathed of head flannels robes and the charm of tiny embroidered caps They were Edward s when he was a baby the daintiest embroidery and thread lace The christening cap is Honiton They are a little yellow with time of course but I am bleaching them on the sweet brier hedge I can see the white patches on the green as I write They look like some strange sort of flowers and they make me dream of the beautiful future In due season Baby was born and christened and then Miss Eden that was wrote to ask if she might come to the Beeches and bring the darling little one missus Despard was delighted She loved babies It was a beautiful baby beautifully dressed and it rested contentedly in the arms of a beautifully dressed lady whose happy face missus Despard could hardly reconcile with her recollections of Miss Eden The young mother s happiness radiated from her and glorified her lips and eyes Even mister Despard owned when the pair had gone that marriage and motherhood had incredibly improved Miss Eden And now the sudden departure of a brother for the other side of the world took missus Despard to Southampton whence his boat sailed and where lived the happy wife and mother who had been Miss Eden When the tears of parting were shed and the last waving handkerchief from the steamer s deck had dwindled to a sharp point of light and from a sharp point of light to an invisible point of parting and sorrow missus Despard dried her pretty eyes and thought of trains There was no convenient one for an hour or two I ll go and see Ella Cave said she and went in a hired carriage No seventy Queen s Road she said I think it s somewhere outside the town Not it said the driver and presently set her down in a horrid little street at a horrid little shop where they sold tobacco and sweets and newspapers and walking sticks This can t be it There must be some other Queen s Road said missus Despard No there ain t said the man What name did yer want Cave said missus Despard absently missus Edward Cave The man went into the shop Presently he returned She don t live here he said she only calls here for letters missus Despard assured herself of this in a brief interview with a frowsy woman across a glass topped show box of silk embroidered cigar cases The young person calls every day mum she said quite a respectable young person mum I should say if she was after your situation Thank you said missus Despard mechanically yet with her own smile the smile that still stamps her in the frowsy woman s memory as that pleasant spoken lady She paused a moment on the dirty pavement and then gave the cabman the address of the mother and sister the address of the little house small but very convenient and with a garden such a lovely old garden and so unusual in the middle of a town The cab stopped at a large sparkling plate glassy shop a very high class fruiterer s and greengrocer s The name on the elaborately gilded facia was beyond any doubt Eden Frederick Eden missus Despard got out and walked into the shop To this hour the scent of Tangerine oranges brings to her a strange sick helpless feeling of disillusionment A stout well oiled woman in a very tight puce velveteen bodice with bright buttons and a large yellow lace collar fastened with a blue enamel brooch leaned forward interrogatively missus Cave said missus Despard Don t know the name madam Wasn t that the name of the gentleman Miss Eden married It seems to me you re making a mistake madam Excuse me but might I ask your name I m missus Despard Miss Eden lived with me as governess Oh yes the puce velvet seemed to soften very pleased to see you I m sure Come inside madam Ellen s just run round to the fishmonger s I m not enjoying very good health just now the glance was intolerably confidential and I thought I could fancy a bit of filleted plaice for my supper or a nice whiting Come inside do missus Despard stunned could think of no course save that suggested She followed missus Eden into the impossible parlour that bounded the shop on the north Do sit down said missus Eden hospitably and the girl shall get you a cup of tea It s full early but a cup of tea s always welcome early or late isn t it Yes indeed said missus Despard automatically Then she roused herself and added But please don t trouble I can t stay more than a few minutes I hope Miss Eden is well Oh yes she s all right She lives in clover as you might say since her uncle on the mother s side left her that hundred a year Made it all in fried fish too I should have thought it a risk myself but you never know missus Despard was struggling with a sensation as of sawdust in the throat sawdust and a great deal of it and very dry But I heard that Miss Eden was married Not she said missus Eden with the natural contempt of one who was I understood that she had married a mister Cave It s some other Eden then There isn t a Cave in the town so far as I know except mister Augustus he s a solicitor and Commissioner for Oaths a very good business and of course he d never look the same side of the road as she was nor she couldn t expect it But really missus Despard persisted I do think there must be some mistake Because she came to see me and and she brought her baby missus Eden laughed outright Her baby Oh really But she s never so much as had a young man after her let alone a husband It s not what she could look for either for she s no beauty poor girl Yet the Baby was evidence of a sort missus Despard hated herself for hinting that perhaps missus Eden did not know everything I don t know what you mean madam The puce bodice was visibly moved That was my baby bless his little heart Poor Ellen s a respectable girl she s been with me since she was a little trot of six all except the eleven months she was away with you and then my Fred see her to the door and fetched her from your station She would go though not our wish I suppose she wanted a change But since then she s never been over an hour away except when she took my Gustavus over to see you She must have told you whose he was but I suppose you weren t paying attention And I must say I don t think it s becoming in you if you ll excuse me saying so to come here taking away a young girl s character At least if she s not so young as she was of course we none of us are not even yourself madam if you ll pardon me saying so I beg your pardon said missus Despard She had never felt so helpless so silly The absurd parlour ponderous with plush dusky with double curtains had for her all the effect of a nightmare She felt that she was swimming blindly in a sea of disenchantment Don t think me inquisitive she said but Miss Eden was engaged wasn t she some time ago to someone who was killed in South Africa Never in all her born days said missus Eden with emphasis I suppose it s her looks I ve had a good many offers myself though I m not what you might call anything out of the way but poor Ellen never had so much as a nibble missus Despard gasped She clung against reason to the one spar of hope in this sea of faiths dissolved It might be it must be some mistake You see poor Ellen missus Eden made as much haste to smash up the spar as though she had seen it poor Ellen when her mother and father died she was but six There was only her and my Fred so naturally we took her and what little money the old lady left we spent on her sending her to a good school and never counting the bit of clothes and victuals She was always for learning something and above her station and the reverend missus Peterson at saint Michael and All Angels she made a sort of pet of Ellen and set her up more than a bit missus Despard remembered that missus Peterson had been Miss Eden s reference And then she would come to you though welcome to share along with us and you can see for yourself it s a good business and when that little bit was left her of course she d no need to work so she came home here and I must say she s always been as handy a girl and obliging as you could wish but wandering too in her thoughts Always pens and ink I shouldn t wonder but what she wrote poetry Yards and yards of writing she does I don t know what she does with it all But missus Despard knew missus Eden talked on gaily and gladly till not even a straw was left for her hearer to cling to Thank you very much she said I see it was all a mistake I must have been wrong about the address She spoke hurriedly for she had heard in the shop a step that she knew For one moment a white face peered in at the glass door then vanished it was Miss Eden s face her face as it had been when she told of her lost lover who died waving his sword at Elendslaagte But the telling of that tale had moved missus Despard to no such passion of pity as this For from that face now something was blotted out and the lack of it was piteous beyond thought Thank you very much I am so sorry to have troubled you she said and somehow got out of the plush parlour and through the shop fruit filled orange scented At the station there was still time and too much time The bookstall yielded pencil paper envelope and stamp She wrote Ella dear whatever happens I am always your friend Let me know can I do anything for you I know all about everything now But don t think I m angry I am only so sorry for you dear so very very sorry Do let me help you She addressed the letter to Miss Eden at the greengrocer s Afterwards she thought that she had better have left it alone It could do no good and it might mean trouble with her sister in law for Miss Eden late missus Cave the happy wife and mother She need not have troubled herself for the letter came back a week later with a note from missus Eden of the bursting bright buttoned velvet bodice Ellen had gone away no one knew where she had gone missus Despard will always reproach herself for not having rushed towards the white face that peered through the glass door She could have done something anything So she thinks but I am not sure And it was none of it true Bill she said piteously when Mabel and Gracie safely tucked up in bed she told him all about it I don t know how she could No dead lover no retired tea broker no pretty house and sweet brier hedge with and no Baby She was a lying lunatic said Bill I never liked her Hark what s that All right Love a duck daddy s here He went up the stairs three at a time to catch up his baby who had a way of wandering with half awake wailings out of her crib in the small hours All right Kiddie winks daddy s got you he murmured coming back into the drawing room with the little soft warm flannelly bundle cuddled close to him She s asleep again already he said settling her comfortably in his arms Don t worry any more about that Eden girl Molly she s not worth it His wife knelt beside him and buried her face against his waistcoat and against the little flannel night gown Oh Bill she said and her voice was thick with tears don t say things like that Don t you see It was cruel cruel She was all alone no mother no sister no lover She was made so that no one could ever love her And she wanted love so much so frightfully much so that she just had to pretend that she had it And what about the Baby asked mister Despard taking one arm from his own baby to pass it round his wife s shoulders Don t be a darling idiot Molly What about the Baby Oh don t you see missus Despard was sobbing now in good earnest She wanted the Baby more than anything else Oh don t say horrid things about her Bill We ve got everything and she d got nothing at all don t say things don t mister Despard said nothing He thumped his wife sympathetically on the back It was the baby who spoke Want mammy she said sleepily and at the transfer remembered her father and daddy too she added politely Miss Eden was somewhere or other Wherever she was she was alone And these three were together I daresay you re right about that girl said mister Despard Poor wretch By Jove she was ugly THE LOVER THE GIRL AND THE ONLOOKER 
696_93314_000001_000000	train-clean-100	The two were alone in the grassy courtyard of the ruined castle 
696_93314_000001_000001	train-clean-100	The rest of the picnic party had wandered away from them or they from it Out of the green grown mound of fallen masonry by the corner of the chapel a great may bush grew silvered and pearled on every scented still spray 
696_93314_000001_000002	train-clean-100	The sky was deep clear strong blue above and against the blue the wallflowers shone bravely from the cracks and crevices of ruined arch and wall and buttress 
696_93314_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 They shine like gold she said 
none	none	I wish one could get at them
696_93314_000003_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you want some he said and on the instant his hand had found a strong jutting stone his foot a firm ledge and she saw his figure grey flannel against grey stone go up the wall towards the yellow flowers 
696_93314_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh don t she cried 
none	none	I don t really want them please not I wish 
696_93314_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Then she stopped because he was already some twelve feet from the ground and she knew that one should not speak to a man who is climbing ruined walls 
696_93314_000005_000001	train-clean-100	So she clasped her hands and waited and her heart seemed to go out like a candle in the wind and to leave only a dark empty sickening space where a moment before it had beat in anxious joy 
696_93314_000005_000002	train-clean-100	For she loved him had loved him these two years had loved him since the day of their first meeting 
696_93314_000005_000003	train-clean-100	And that was just as long as he had loved her 
696_93314_000005_000004	train-clean-100	But he had never told his love 
696_93314_000005_000005	train-clean-100	There is a code of honour right or wrong and it forbids a man with an income of a hundred and fifty a year to speak of love to a girl who is reckoned an heiress 
696_93314_000005_000006	train-clean-100	There are plenty who transgress the code but they are in all the other stories 
696_93314_000005_000007	train-clean-100	He drove his passion on the curb and mastered it 
696_93314_000005_000008	train-clean-100	Yet the questions Does she love me 
696_93314_000005_000009	train-clean-100	Does she know I love her 
696_93314_000005_000010	train-clean-100	Does she wonder why I don t speak and the counter questions Will she think I don t care 
696_93314_000005_000011	train-clean-100	Doesn t she perhaps care at all 
696_93314_000005_000012	train-clean-100	Will she marry someone else before I ve earned the right to try to make her love me afforded a see saw of reflection agonising enough for those small hours of wakefulness when we let our emotions play the primitive games with us 
696_93314_000005_000013	train-clean-100	But always the morning brought strength to keep to his resolution 
696_93314_000005_000014	train-clean-100	He saw her three times a year when Christmas Easter and Midsummer brought her to stay with an aunt brought him home to his people for holidays 
696_93314_000005_000015	train-clean-100	And though he had denied himself the joy of speaking in words he had let his eyes speak more than he knew 
696_93314_000005_000016	train-clean-100	And now he had reached the wallflowers high up and was plucking them and throwing them down so that they fell in a wavering bright shower round her feet 
696_93314_000005_000017	train-clean-100	She did not pick them up 
696_93314_000005_000018	train-clean-100	Her eyes were on him and the empty place where her heart used to be seemed to swell till it almost choked her 
696_93314_000006_000000	train-clean-100	He was coming down now 
696_93314_000006_000001	train-clean-100	He was only about twenty five feet from the ground 
696_93314_000006_000002	train-clean-100	There was no sound at all but the grating of his feet as he set them on the stones and the movement now and then of a bird in the ivy 
696_93314_000006_000003	train-clean-100	Then came a rustle a gritty clatter loud falling stones his foot had slipped and he had fallen 
none	none	No he was hanging by his hands above the great refectory arch and his body swung heavily with the impetus of the checked fall 
696_93314_000006_000005	train-clean-100	He was moving along now slowly hanging by his hands now he grasped an ivy root another and pulled himself up till his knee was on the moulding of the arch 
696_93314_000006_000006	train-clean-100	She would never have believed anyone who had told her that only two minutes had been lived between the moment of his stumble and the other moment when his foot touched the grass and he came towards her among the fallen wallflowers 
696_93314_000006_000007	train-clean-100	She was a very nice girl and not at all forward and I cannot understand or excuse her conduct 
none	none	She made two steps towards him with her hands held out caught him by the arms just above the elbow shook him angrily as one shakes a naughty child looked him once in the eyes and buried her face in his neck sobbing long dry breathless sobs 
696_93314_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Even then he tried to be strong 
696_93314_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t he said tenderly don t worry 
696_93314_000008_000001	train-clean-100	It s all right I was a fool Pull yourself together there s someone coming 
696_93314_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t care she said for the touch of his cheek pressed against her hair told her all that she wanted to know 
696_93314_000009_000001	train-clean-100	 Let them come I don t care 
696_93314_000009_000002	train-clean-100	Oh how could you be so silly and horrid 
none	none	Oh thank God thank God Oh how could you 
696_93314_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Of course a really honourable young man would have got out of the situation somehow 
none	none	He didn t 
696_93314_000010_000002	train-clean-100	He accepted it with his arms round her and his lips against the face where the tears now ran warm and salt 
none	none	It was one of the immortal moments 
696_93314_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The picture was charming too a picture to wring the heart of the onlooker with envy or sympathy according to his nature 
696_93314_000011_000001	train-clean-100	But there was only one onlooker a man of forty or thereabouts who paused for an instant under the great gate of the castle and took in the full charm and meaning of the scene 
696_93314_000011_000002	train-clean-100	He turned away and went back along the green path with hell in his heart 
696_93314_000011_000003	train-clean-100	The other two were in Paradise 
none	none	The Onlooker fell like the third in Eden the serpent in fact 
696_93314_000011_000005	train-clean-100	Two miles away he stopped and lit a pipe 
none	none	It s got to be borne I suppose he said like all the rest of it She s happy enough 
696_93314_000012_000001	train-clean-100	I ought to be glad 
696_93314_000012_000002	train-clean-100	Anyway I can t stop it Perhaps he swore a little 
696_93314_000012_000003	train-clean-100	If he did the less precise and devotional may pardon him 
696_93314_000012_000004	train-clean-100	He had loved the Girl since her early teens and it was only yesterday s post that had brought him the appointment that one might marry on 
696_93314_000012_000005	train-clean-100	The appointment had come through her father for whom the Onlooker had fagged at Eton 
696_93314_000012_000006	train-clean-100	He went back to London hell burning briskly 
696_93314_000012_000007	train-clean-100	Moral maxims and ethereal ideas notwithstanding it was impossible for him to be glad that she was happy like that 
none	none	The Lover who came to his love over strewn wallflowers desired always as has been seen to act up to his moral ideas 
696_93314_000013_000001	train-clean-100	So he took next day a much earlier train than was at all pleasant and called on her father to explain his position and set forth his prospects 
696_93314_000013_000002	train-clean-100	His coming was heralded by a letter from her 
696_93314_000013_000003	train-clean-100	One must not quote it it is not proper to read other people s letters especially letters to a trusted father from a child only and adored 
696_93314_000013_000004	train-clean-100	Its effect may be indicated briefly 
696_93314_000013_000005	train-clean-100	It showed the father that the Girl s happiness had had two long years in which to learn to grow round the thought of the young man whom he now faced for the first time 
696_93314_000013_000006	train-clean-100	Odd for to the father he seemed just like other young men 
696_93314_000013_000007	train-clean-100	It seemed to him that there were so many more of the same pattern from whom she might have chosen 
696_93314_000013_000008	train-clean-100	And many of them well off too 
696_93314_000013_000009	train-clean-100	However the letter lay in the prosperous pocket book in the breast of the father s frock coat and the Lover was received as though that letter were a charm to ensure success 
696_93314_000013_000010	train-clean-100	A faulty or at least a slow working charm however for the father did not lift a bag of gold from his safe and say Take her take this also be happy he only consented to a provisional engagement took an earnest interest in the young man s affairs and offered to make his daughter an annual allowance on her marriage 
696_93314_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 At my death she will have more he said for of course I have insured my life 
696_93314_000014_000001	train-clean-100	You of course will insure yours 
696_93314_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course I will the Lover echoed warmly does it matter what office 
696_93314_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh any good office the Influential if you like 
696_93314_000016_000001	train-clean-100	I m a director you know 
696_93314_000017_000000	train-clean-100	The young man made a reverent note of the name and the interview seemed played out 
696_93314_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 It s a complicated nuisance the father mused it isn t even as if I knew anything of the chap 
696_93314_000018_000001	train-clean-100	I oughtn t to have allowed the child to make these long visits to her aunt 
696_93314_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Or I ought to have gone with her 
696_93314_000018_000003	train-clean-100	But I never could stand my sister Fanny 
696_93314_000018_000004	train-clean-100	Well well and he went back to his work with the plain unvarnished heartache of the anxious father not romantic and pretty like the lover s pangs but as uncomfortable as toothache all the same 
696_93314_000019_000000	train-clean-100	He had another caller that afternoon he whom we know as the Onlooker came to thank him for the influence that had got him the appointment as doctor to the Influential Insurance Company 
696_93314_000020_000000	train-clean-100	The father opened his heart to the Onlooker and the Onlooker had to bear it 
696_93314_000020_000001	train-clean-100	It was an hour full of poignant sentiments 
696_93314_000020_000002	train-clean-100	The only definite thought that came to the Onlooker was this I must hold my tongue 
696_93314_000020_000003	train-clean-100	I must hold my tongue He held it 
696_93314_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Three days later he took up his new work 
696_93314_000021_000001	train-clean-100	And the very first man who came to him for medical examination was the man in whose arms he had seen the girl he loved 
696_93314_000022_000000	train-clean-100	The Onlooker asked the first needful questions automatically 
696_93314_000022_000001	train-clean-100	To himself he was saying The situation is dramatically good but I don t see how to develop the action 
none	none	It really is rather amusing that I I should have to tap his beastly chest and listen to his cursed lungs and ask sympathetic questions about his idiotic infant illnesses one thing he ought to be able to remember those pretty vividly the confounded pup 
696_93314_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The Onlooker had never done anything wronger than you have done my good reader and he never expected to meet a giant temptation any more than you do 
none	none	A man may go all his days and never meet Apollyon 
696_93314_000023_000002	train-clean-100	On the other hand Apollyon may be waiting for one round the corner of the next street 
696_93314_000023_000003	train-clean-100	The devil was waiting for the Onlooker in the answers to his careless questions Father alive 
none	none	No 
696_93314_000023_000005	train-clean-100	What did he die of For the answer was Heart and in it the devil rose and showed the Onlooker the really only true and artistic way to develop the action in this situation so dramatic in its possibilities 
696_93314_000023_000006	train-clean-100	The illuminative flash of temptation was so sudden so brilliant that the Doctor Onlooker closed his soul s eyes and yielded without even the least pretence of resistance 
696_93314_000024_000000	train-clean-100	He took his stethoscope from the table and he felt as though he had picked up a knife to stab the other man in the back 
696_93314_000024_000001	train-clean-100	As in fact he had 
696_93314_000025_000000	train-clean-100	Ten minutes later the stabbed man was reeling from the Onlooker s consulting room 
none	none	Mind and soul reeled that is but his body was stiffer and straighter than usual He walked with more than his ordinary firmness of gait as a man does who is just drunk enough to know that he must try to look sober 
696_93314_000026_000000	train-clean-100	He walked down the street certain words ringing in his ears Heart affected probably hereditary weakness 
696_93314_000026_000001	train-clean-100	No office in the world would insure you 
696_93314_000027_000000	train-clean-100	And so it was all over the dreams the hopes the palpitating faith in a beautiful future 
696_93314_000027_000001	train-clean-100	His days might be long they might be brief but be his life long or short he must live it alone 
696_93314_000027_000002	train-clean-100	He had a little fight with himself as he went down Wimpole Street then he hailed a hansom and went and told her father who quite agreed with him that it was all over 
none	none	The father wondered at himself for being more sorry than glad 
696_93314_000028_000000	train-clean-100	Then the Lover went and told the Girl 
none	none	He had told the father first to insure himself against any chance of yielding to what he knew the Girl would say 
696_93314_000028_000002	train-clean-100	She said it of course with her dear arms round his neck 
696_93314_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 I won t give you up just because you re ill she said why you want me more than ever 
696_93314_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 But I may die at any moment 
696_93314_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 So may I And you may live to be a hundred I ll take my chance 
none	none	Oh don t you see too that if there is only a little time we ought to spend it together
696_93314_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 It s impossible he said it s no good 
696_93314_000032_000001	train-clean-100	I must set my teeth and bear it 
696_93314_000032_000002	train-clean-100	And you I hope it won t be as hard for you as it will for me 
none	none	But you can t give me up if I won t be given up can you 
696_93314_000034_000000	train-clean-100	His smile struck her dumb 
none	none	It was more convincing than his words But why she said presently Why why why
696_93314_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Because I won t because it s wrong 
696_93314_000036_000001	train-clean-100	My father ought never to have married 
696_93314_000036_000002	train-clean-100	He had no right to bring me into the world to suffer like this It s a crime 
696_93314_000036_000003	train-clean-100	And I ll not be a criminal 
696_93314_000036_000004	train-clean-100	Not even for you not even for you 
696_93314_000036_000005	train-clean-100	You ll forgive me won t you 
696_93314_000036_000006	train-clean-100	I didn t know and oh what s the use of talking 
696_93314_000037_000000	train-clean-100	Yet they talked for hours 
none	none	Conventionally he should have torn himself away unable to bear the strain of his agony As a matter of fact he sat by her holding her hand 
696_93314_000037_000003	train-clean-100	It was for the last time the last last time 
696_93314_000037_000004	train-clean-100	There was really a third at that interview 
none	none	The Onlooker had imagination enough to see the scene between the parting lovers They parted 
696_93314_000039_000000	train-clean-100	And now the Onlooker dared not meet her dared not call at the house as he had used to do 
696_93314_000039_000001	train-clean-100	At last the father pressed him he went 
696_93314_000039_000002	train-clean-100	He met her And it was as though he had met the ghost of her whom he had loved 
696_93314_000039_000003	train-clean-100	Her eyes had blue marks under them her chin had grown more pointed her nose sharper 
696_93314_000039_000004	train-clean-100	There was a new line on her forehead and her eyes had changed 
none	none	Over the wine he heard from the father that she was pining for the Lover who had inherited heart disease
696_93314_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 I suppose it was you who saw him by the way said he a tall well set up young fellow dark not bad looking 
696_93314_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 I I don t remember lied the Onlooker with the eyes of his memory on the white face of the man he had stabbed 
696_93314_000043_000000	train-clean-100	Now the Lover and the Onlooker had each his own burden to bear 
none	none	And the Lover s was the easier 
696_93314_000043_000002	train-clean-100	He worked still though there was now nothing to work for more he worked as he had never worked in his life because he knew that if he did not take to work he should take to drink or worse devils and he set his teeth and swore that her Lover should not be degraded 
696_93314_000043_000003	train-clean-100	He knew that she loved him and there was a kind of fierce pain pleasure like that of scratching a sore in the thought that she was as wretched as he was that divided in all else they were yet united in their suffering 
none	none	He thought it made him more miserable to know of her misery 
696_93314_000043_000005	train-clean-100	But it didn t 
none	none	He never saw her but he dreamed of her and sometimes the dreams got out of hand and carried him a thousand worlds from all that lay between them 
696_93314_000043_000007	train-clean-100	Then he had to wake up 
696_93314_000043_000008	train-clean-100	And that was bad 
696_93314_000044_000000	train-clean-100	But the Onlooker was no dreamer and he saw her about three times a week 
696_93314_000044_000001	train-clean-100	He saw how the light of life that his lying lips had blown out was not to be rekindled by his or any man s breath 
696_93314_000044_000002	train-clean-100	He saw her slenderness turn to thinness the pure healthy pallor of her rounded cheek change to a sickly white covering a clear cut mask of set endurance 
696_93314_000044_000003	train-clean-100	And there was no work that could shut out that sight no temptation of the world the flesh or the devil to give him even the relief of a fight 
696_93314_000044_000004	train-clean-100	He had no temptations he had never had but the one 
696_93314_000044_000005	train-clean-100	His soul was naked to the bitter wind of the actual and the days went by went by and every day he knew more and more surely that he had lied and thrown away his soul and that the wages of sin were death and no other thing whatever 
696_93314_000044_000006	train-clean-100	And gradually little by little the whole worth of life seemed to lie in the faint far chance of his being able to undo the one triumphantly impulsive and unreasoning action of his life 
696_93314_000045_000000	train-clean-100	But there are some acts that there is no undoing 
none	none	And the hell that had burned in his heart so fiercely when he had seen her in the other man s arms burned now with new bright lights and infernal flickering flame tongues 
696_93314_000046_000000	train-clean-100	And at last out of hell the Onlooker reached out his hands and caught at prayer 
696_93314_000046_000001	train-clean-100	He caught at it as a drowning man catches at a white gleam in the black of the surging sea about him it may be a painted spar it may be empty foam 
696_93314_000046_000002	train-clean-100	The Onlooker prayed 
696_93314_000047_000000	train-clean-100	And that very evening he ran up against the Lover at the Temple Station and he got into the same carriage with him 
696_93314_000048_000000	train-clean-100	He said Excuse me 
696_93314_000048_000001	train-clean-100	You don t remember me 
696_93314_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 I m not likely to have forgotten you said the Lover 
696_93314_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 I fear my verdict was a great blow 
696_93314_000050_000001	train-clean-100	You look very worried very ill News like that is a great shock 
none	none	It is a little unsettling said the Lover
696_93314_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Are you still going on with your usual work 
none	none	Yes
696_93314_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Speaking professionally I think you are wrong 
696_93314_000054_000001	train-clean-100	You lessen your chances of life 
696_93314_000054_000002	train-clean-100	Why don t you try a complete change 
696_93314_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Because if you must know my chances of life have ceased to interest me 
696_93314_000056_000000	train-clean-100	The Lover was short with the Onlooker but he persisted 
696_93314_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 Well if one isn t interested in one s life one may be interested in one s death or the manner of it 
696_93314_000057_000001	train-clean-100	In your place I should enlist 
none	none	It s better to die of a bullet in South Africa than of fright in London 
696_93314_000058_000000	train-clean-100	That roused the Lover as it was meant to do 
696_93314_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t really know what business it is of yours sir he said but it s your business to know that they wouldn t pass a man with a heart like mine 
none	none	I don t know 
696_93314_000060_000001	train-clean-100	They re not so particular just now 
696_93314_000060_000002	train-clean-100	They want men 
696_93314_000060_000003	train-clean-100	I should try it if I were you 
696_93314_000060_000004	train-clean-100	If you don t have a complete change you ll go all to pieces 
none	none	That s all 
696_93314_000061_000000	train-clean-100	The Onlooker got out at the next station 
696_93314_000061_000001	train-clean-100	Short of owning to his own lie he had done what he could to insure its being found out for the lie it was or at least for a mistake 
none	none	And when he had done what he could he saw that the Lover might not find it out might be passed for the Army might go to the Front might be killed and then Well I ve done my best anyhow he said to himself and himself answered him Liar you have not done your best 
696_93314_000061_000003	train-clean-100	You will have to eat your lie Yes though it will smash your life and ruin you socially and professionally 
696_93314_000061_000004	train-clean-100	You will have to tell him you lied and tell him why You will never let him go to South Africa without telling him the truth and you know it 
696_93314_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 Well you know best I suppose he said to himself 
696_93314_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 But are you perfectly certain 
none	none	Perfectly 
696_93314_000064_000001	train-clean-100	I tell you man you re sound s a bell and a fine fathom of a young man ye are too 
none	none	Certain Losh man ye can call in the whole College of Physeecians in consultation an I ll wager me professional reputation they ll endorse me opeenion 
696_93314_000064_000004	train-clean-100	Yer hairt s as sound s a roach T other man must ha been asleep when ye consulted him 
696_93314_000064_000005	train-clean-100	Ye ll mak a fine soldier my lad 
696_93314_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 I think not said the Lover and he went out from the presence 
696_93314_000065_000001	train-clean-100	This time he reeled like a man too drunk to care how drunk he looks 
696_93314_000066_000000	train-clean-100	He drove in cabs from Harley Street to Wimpole Street and from Wimpole Street to Brooke Street and he saw Sir William this and Sir Henry that and mister The other thing the great heart specialist 
696_93314_000067_000000	train-clean-100	And then he bought a gardenia and went home and dressed himself in his most beautiful frock coat and his softest white silk tie and put the gardenia in his button hole and went to see the Girl 
696_93314_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 Looks like as if he was going to a wedding said his landlady 
696_93314_000069_000000	train-clean-100	When he had told the Girl everything and when she was able to do anything but laugh and cry and cling to him with thin hands she said 
696_93314_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Dear I do so hate to think badly of anyone 
696_93314_000070_000001	train-clean-100	But do you really think that man was mistaken 
696_93314_000070_000002	train-clean-100	He s very very clever 
696_93314_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 My child Sir Henry and Sir William and mister 
none	none	Ah I don t mean that I know you re all right Thank God Oh thank God 
696_93314_000072_000005	train-clean-100	I mean don t you think he may have lied to you to prevent your marrying me 
696_93314_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 But why should he 
696_93314_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 He asked me to marry him three weeks ago 
none	none	He s a very old friend of ours 
696_93314_000074_000002	train-clean-100	I do hate to be suspicious but it is odd 
696_93314_000074_000003	train-clean-100	And then his trying to get you to South Africa 
none	none	I m certain he wanted you out of the way 
696_93314_000074_000005	train-clean-100	He wanted you to get killed 
696_93314_000074_000006	train-clean-100	Oh how can people be so cruel 
696_93314_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 I believe you re right said the Lover thoughtfully I couldn t have believed that a man could be base like that through and through 
none	none	But I suppose some people are like that without a gleam of feeling or remorse or pity
696_93314_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 You ought to expose him 
696_93314_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Not I we ll just cut him 
696_93314_000077_000001	train-clean-100	That s all I ll trouble to do 
none	none	I ve got you I ve got you in spite of him I can t waste my time in hunting down vermin THE DUEL BUT I wasn t doing any harm she urged piteously She looked like a child just going to cry He was holding your hand He wasn t I was holding his I was telling him his fortune And anyhow it s not your business She had remembered this late and phrased it carelessly It is my Master s business said he She repressed the retort that touched her lips After all there was something fine about this man who in the first month of his ministrations as Parish Priest could actually dare to call on her the richest and most popular woman in the district and accuse her of well most people would hardly have gone so far as to call it flirting Propriety only knew what the Reverend Christopher Cassilis might be disposed to call it They sat in the pleasant fire lit drawing room looking at each other He s got a glorious face she thought Like a Greek god or a Christian martyr I wonder whether he s ever been in love He thought She is abominably pretty I suppose beauty is a temptation Well she said impatiently you ve been very rude indeed and I ve listened to you Is your sermon quite done Have you any more to say Or shall I give you some tea I have more to say he answered turning his eyes from hers You are beautiful and young and rich you have a kind heart oh yes I ve heard little things in the village already You are a born general You organise better than any woman I ever knew though it s only dances and picnics and theatricals and concerts You have great gifts You could do great work in the world and you throw it all away you give your life to the devil s dance you call pleasure Why do you do it Is that your business too she asked again And again he answered It is my Master s business Had she read his words in a novel they would have seemed to her priggish unnatural and superlatively impertinent Spoken by those thin perfectly curved lips they were at least interesting That wasn t what you began about she said twisting the rings on her fingers The catalogue of her gifts and graces was less a novelty to her than the reproaches to her virtue No am I to repeat what I began about Ah but I will I began by saying what I came here to say that you as a married woman have no right to turn men s heads and make them long for what can never be But you don t know she said My husband I don t wish to know he interrupted Your husband is alive and you are bound to be faithful to him in thought word and deed What I saw and heard in the little copse last night I do wish you wouldn t she said You talk as if No he said I m willing even anxious I think to believe that you would not could not Oh she cried jumping up this is intolerable How dare you He had risen too I m not afraid of you he said I m not afraid of your anger nor of your your other weapons Think what you are Think of your great powers and you are wasting them all in making fools of a pack of young idiots But what could I do with my gifts as you call them Do why you could endow and organise and run any one of a hundred schemes for helping on God s work in the world For instance Her charming smile enraged him For instance Well for instance you might start a home for those women who began as you have begun and who have gone down into hell as you will go unless you let yourself be warned She was for the moment literally speechless Then she remembered how he had said I am not afraid of your weapons She drew a deep breath and spoke gently I believe you don t mean to be insulting I believe you mean kindly to me Please say no more now I ll think over it all I m not angry only do you really think you understand everything He might have answered that he did not understand her She did not mean him to understand She knew well enough that she was giving him something to puzzle over when she smiled that beautiful troubled humble appealing half smile He did not answer at all He stood a moment twisting his soft hat in his hands she admired his hands very much Forgive me if I ve pained you more than was needed he said at last it is only because here her smile caught him and he ended vaguely in a decreasing undertone She heard the words king s jewels pearl of great price When he was gone she said Well more than once Then she ran to the low mirror over the mantelpiece and looked earnestly at herself You do look rather nice to day she said And so he s not afraid of any of your weapons And I m not afraid of any of his It s a fair duel Only all the provocation came from him so the choice of weapons is mine And they shall be my weapons he has weapons to match them right enough only the poor dear doesn t know it She went away to dress for dinner humming gaily My love has breath o roses O roses o roses And arms like lily posies To fold a lassie in Not next day she was far too clever for that but on the day after that he received a note Her handwriting was charming no extravagances every letter soberly but perfectly formed I have been thinking of all you said the other day You are quite mistaken about some things but in some you are right Will you show me how to work I will do whatever you tell me Then the Reverend Christopher was glad of the courage that had inspired him to denounce to his parishioners all that seemed to him amiss in them I am glad he said to himself that I had the courage to treat her exactly as I have done the others even if she has beautiful hair and eyes like like He stopped the thought before he found the simile not because he imagined that there could be danger in it but because he had been trained to stop thoughts of eyes and hair as neatly as a skilful boxer stops a blow She had not been so trained and she admired his eyes and hair quite as much as he might have admired hers if she had not been married So now the Reverend Christopher had a helper in his parish work and he needed help for his plain speaking had already offended half his parish And his helper was as he had had the sense to know she could be the most accomplished organiser in the country She ran the parish library she arranged the school treat she started evening classes for wood carving and art needlework She spent money like water and time as freely as money Quietly persistently relentlessly she was making herself necessary to the Reverend Christopher He wrote to her every day there were so many instructions to give but he seldom spoke with her When he called she was never at home Sometimes they met in the village and exchanged a few sentences She was always gravely sweet intensely earnest There was a certain smile which he remembered a beautiful troubled appealing smile He wondered why she smiled no more Her friends shrugged their shoulders over her new fancy It is odd her bosom friend said It can t be the parson though he s as beautiful as he can possibly be because she sees next to nothing of him And yet I can t think that Betty of all people could really Oh I don t know said the bosom friend of her bosom friend Women often do take to that sort of thing you know when they get tired of Of The other sort of thing don t you know How horrid you are said Betty s bosom friend I believe you re a most dreadful cynic really Not at all said the friend complacently stroking his moustache Betty certainly was enjoying herself She had the great gift of enjoying thoroughly any new game She enjoyed first the newness and besides the hidden lining of her new masquerade dress enchanted her But as her new industries developed she began to enjoy the things for themselves It is always delightful to do what we can do well and the Reverend Christopher had been right when he said she was a born general How easy it all is she said and what a fuss those clergy hags make about it What a wife I should be for a bishop She smiled and sighed It was pleasant too to wake in the morning not to the recollection of the particular stage which yesterday s flirtation happened to have reached but to the sense of some difficulty overcome some object achieved some rough place made smooth for her Girls Friendly or her wood carvers or her Parish Magazine And within it all the secret charm of a purpose transfiguring with its magic this eager strenuous working life Her avoidance of the Reverend Christopher struck him at first as modest discreet and in the best possible taste But presently it seemed to him that she rather overdid it There were many things he would have liked to discuss with her but she always evaded talk with him Why he began to ask himself why And the question wormed through his brain more and more searchingly He had seen her at work now he knew her powers and her graces the powers and the graces that made her the adored of her Friendly girls and her carving boys He remembered with hot ears and neck crimson above his clerical collar that interview The things he had said to her How could he have done it Blind idiot that he had been And she had taken it all so sweetly so nobly so humbly She had only needed a word to turn her from the frivolities of the world to better things It need not have been the sort of word he had used And at a word she had turned That it should have been at his word was not perhaps a very subtle flattery but the Reverend Christopher swallowed it and never tasted it He was not trained to distinguish the flavours of flatteries He never tasted it but it worked in his blood for all that And why why why would she never speak to him Could it be that she was afraid that he would speak to her now as he had once spoken He blushed again Next time he met her she was coming up to the church with a big basket of flowers for the altar He took the basket from her and carried it in Let me help you he said No she said in that sweet simple grave way of hers I can do it very well Indeed I would rather He had to go The arrangement of the flowers took more than an hour but when she came out with the empty basket he was waiting in the porch Her heart gave a little joyful jump I want to speak to you said he I m rather late she said as usual couldn t you write No he said I can t write this Sit down a moment in the porch She loved the masterfulness of his tone He stood before her I want you to forgive me for speaking to you as I did once I m afraid you re afraid that I shall behave like that again You needn t be Score number one she said to herself Aloud she said I am not afraid and she said it sweetly seriously I was wrong he went on eagerly I was terribly wrong I see it quite plainly now You do forgive me don t you Yes said she soberly and sighed There was a little silence Her serious eyes watched the way of the wind dimpling the tall feathery grass that grew above the graves Are you unhappy he asked you never smile now I am too busy to smile I suppose she said and smiled the beautiful humble appealing smile he had so longed to see again though he had not known the longing by its right name Can t we be friends he ventured You I am afraid you can never trust me again Yes I can she said It was very bitter at the time but I thought it was so brave of you and kind too to care what became of me If you remember I did want to trust you even on that dreadful day but you wouldn t let me I was a brute he said remorsefully I do want to tell you one thing Even if that boy had been holding my hand I should have thought I had a right to let him if I liked just as much as though I were a girl or a widow I don t understand But tell me please tell me anything you will tell me His tone was very humble My husband was a beast she said calmly He betrayed me he beat me he had every vile quality a man can have No I ll be just to him he was always good tempered when he was drunk But when he was sober he used to beat me and pinch me But but you could have got a separation a divorce he gasped A separation wouldn t have freed me really And the Church doesn t believe in divorce she said demurely I did however and I left him and instructed a solicitor But the brute went mad before I could get free from him and now I suppose I m tied for life to a mad dog Good God said the Reverend Christopher I thought it all out oh many many nights and I made up my mind that I would go out and enjoy myself I never had a good time when I was a girl And another thing I decided quite definitely that if ever I fell in love I would I should have the right to I mean that I wouldn t let a horrible degraded brute of a lunatic stand between me and the man I loved And I was quite sure that I was right And do you still think this he asked in a low voice Ah she said you ve changed everything I don t think the same about anything as I used to do I think those two years with him must have made me nearly as mad as he is And then I was so young I am only twenty three now you know and it did seem hard never to have had any fun I did want so much to be happy She had not intended to speak like this but even as she spoke she saw that this truth telling far outshone the lamp of lies she had trimmed ready You will be happy he said there are better things in the world than Yes she said oh yes Betty did nothing by halves She had kept a barrier between her and him till she had excited him to break it down The barrier once broken she let it lie where he had thrown it and became all at once in the most natural matter of fact guileless way his friend She consulted him about everything Let him call when he would she always received him She surrounded him with the dainty feminine spider webs from which his life almost monastic till now had been quite free She imported a knitting aunt so that he should not take fright at long tete a tetes The knitting aunt was deafish and blindish and did not walk much in the rose garden Betty knew a good deal about roses and she taught the Reverend Christopher all she knew She knew a little of the hearts of men and she gently pushed him on the road to forgiveness from that half of the parish whom his first enthusiastic denunciations had offended She rounded his angles She turned a wayward ascetic into a fairly good parish priest And he talked to her of ideals and honour and the service of God and the work of the world And she listened and her beauty spoke to him so softly that he did not know that he heard One day after long silence she turned quickly and met his eyes After that she ceased to spin webs for she saw Yet she was as blind as he though she did not know it any more than he did At last he saw in his turn and the flash of the illumination nearly blinded him It was late evening Betty was nailing up a trailing rose and he was standing by the ladder holding the nails and the snippets of scarlet cloth The ladder slipped and he caught her in his arms As soon as she had assured him that she was not hurt he said good night and left her Betty went indoors and cried What a pity she said Oh what a pity Now he ll be frightened and it s all over He ll never come again But the next evening he came and when they had walked through the rose garden and had come to the sun dial he stopped and spoke I ve been thinking of nothing else since I saw you When I caught you last night Forgive me if I m a fool but when I held you don t be angry but it seemed to me that you loved me Nothing of the sort said Betty very angrily Then I must be mad he said the way you caught my neck with your arm and your face was against mine and your hair crushed up against my ear Oh Betty if you don t love me what shall I do For I can t live without you Betty had won But even if I had loved you I m married she urged softly Yes do you suppose I ve forgotten that But you remember what you said about being really free and not being bound to that beast I see that you were right right right It s the rest of the world that s wrong Oh my dear I can t live without you Couldn t you love me Let s go away right away together No one will love you as I do No one knows you as I do how good and strong and brave and unselfish you are Oh try to love me a little Betty had leaned her elbows on the sun dial and her chin on her hands But you used to think she began Ah but I know better now You ve taught me everything Only I never knew it till last night when I touched you It was like a spark to a bonfire that I ve been piling up ever since I ve known you You ve taught me what life is and love Love can t be wrong It s only wrong when it s stealing We shouldn t be robbing anybody We should both work better happiness makes people work I see that now I should have to give up parish work but there s plenty of good work wants doing Why I ve nearly finished that book of mine I ve worked at it night after night with the thought of you hidden behind the work If you were my wife what work I could do Oh Betty if you only loved me She lifted her face and looked at him gravely He flung his arm round her shoulders and turned her face up to his She was passive to his kisses At last she kissed him once and drew herself from his arms Come she said She led him to the garden seat in the nut avenue Now she said when he had taken his place beside her I m going to tell you the whole truth I was very angry with you when you came to me that first day You were quite right That boy had been holding my hand what s more he had been kissing it It amused me and if it hurt him I didn t care Then you came And you said things And then you said you weren t afraid of me or my weapons It was a challenge And I determined to make you love me It was all planned the helping in your work and keeping out of your way at first was to make you wish to see me And you see I succeeded You did love me I do he said He caught her hand and held it fiercely I deserved it all I was a brute to you I meant you to love me and you did love me I lied to you in almost everything at first About that man was that a lie he asked fiercely No she laughed drearily That was true enough You see it was more effective than any lie I could have invented No lie could have added a single horror to that story And so I ve won as I swore I would Is that all he said all the truth It s all there s any need for she said I want it all I want to know where I am whether I really was mad last night Betty in spite of all your truth I can t believe one thing I can t believe that you don t love me Man s vanity she began with a flippant laugh Don t he said harshly How dare you try to play with me Man s vanity But it s your honour I know you love me If you didn t you would be How do you know I m not Silence he said If you can t speak the truth hold your tongue and let me speak it I love you and you love me and we are going to be happy I will speak the truth said Betty giving him her other hand You love me and I love you and we are going to be miserable Yes I will speak Dear I can t do it Not even for you I used to think I thought I could I was bitter I think I wanted to be revenged on life and God and everything I thought I didn t believe in God but I wanted to spite Him all the same But when you came after that day in the porch when you came and talked to me about all the good and beautiful things why then I knew that I really did believe in them and I began to love you because you had believed them all the time and because And I didn t try to make you love me after that day in the porch at least not very much oh I do want to speak the truth I used to try so not to try I I did want you to love me though I didn t want you to love anyone else I wanted you to love me just enough to make you happy and not enough to make you miserable And so long as you didn t know you loved me it was all right and when you caught me last night I knew that you would know and it would be all over You made up your mind to teach me that there are better things in the world than love truth and honour and and things like that And you ve taught it me It was a duel and you ve won And you meant to teach me that love is stronger than anything in the world And you have won too Yes she said we ve both won That s the worst of it or the best What is to become of us he said Oh my dear what are we to do Do you forgive me If you are right I must be wrong but I can t see anything now except that I want you so I m glad you loved me enough to be silly she said but oh my dear how glad I am that I love you too much to let you But what are we to do Do Nothing Don t you see we ve taught each other everything we know We ve given each other everything we can give Isn t it good to love like this even if this has to be all It s all very difficult he said but everything shall be as you choose only somehow I think it s worse for me than for you I loved you before and now I adore you I seem to have made a saint of you but you ve made me a man One wishes with all one s heart that that lunatic would die The situation is one would say impossible Yet the lovers do not find it so They work together and parish scandal has almost ceased to patter about their names There is a subtle pleasure for both in the ceremonious courtesy with which ever since that day they treat each other It contrasts so splendidly with the living flame upon each heart altar So far the mutual passion has improved the character of each All the same one wishes that the lunatic would die for she is not so much of a saint as he thinks her and he is more of a man than she knows CINDERELLA HOOTS said the gardener there s nae sense in t The suppression o the truth s bad as a lee Indeed I doot mair hae been damned for t ane than t ither Law mister Murchison you do use language I m sure tittered the parlourmaid I say nae mair than the truth he answered cutting bloom after bloom quickly yet tenderly To bring hame a new mistress to the hoose and never to tell your bairn a word aboot the matter till all s made fast it s a thing he ll hae to answer for to his Maker I m thinking Here s the flowers wumman carry them canny I ll send the lad up wi the lave o the flowers an a bit green stuff in a wee meenit And mind you your flaunting streamers agin the pots The parlourmaid gathered her skirts closely and delicately tip toed to the door of the hothouse Here she took the basket of bright beauty from his hand and walked away across the green blaze of the lawn mister Murchison grunted relief He was not fond of parlourmaids no matter how pretty and streamered He left the hot sweet air of the big hothouse and threaded his way among the glittering glasshouses to the potting shed At its door a sound caught his ear Hoots he said again but this time with a gentle anxious intonation Eh ma lammie said he stepping quickly forward what deevilment hae ye been after the noo and wha is t s been catching ye at it The lammie crept out from under the potting shelf a pair of small arms went round Murchison s legs and a little face round and red and very dirty was lifted towards his He raised the child in his arms and set her on the shelf so that she could lean her flushed face on his shirt front Toots toots said he noo tell me It isn t true is it said the child Hoots said Murchison for the third time but he said it under his breath Aloud he said Tell old Murchison a aboot it Miss Charling dearie It was when I wanted some more of the strawberries she began with another sob and the new cook said not and I was a greedy little pig and I said I d rather be a greedy little pig than a spiteful old cat The tears broke out afresh And you eight past Ye should hae mair sense at siccan age than to ca names The head gardener spoke reprovingly but he stroked her rough hair I didn t not one single name not even when she said I was enough to make a cat laugh even an old one and she wondered any good servant ever stayed a week in the place And what was ye sayin I said Guid ye may be but ye re no bonny I ve heard you say that Murchison so I know it wasn t wrong and then she said I was a minx and other things and I wanted keeping in order and it was a very good thing I had a new mamma coming home to day to keep me under a bit and a lot more and and things about my own own mother and that father wouldn t love me any more But it s not true is it Oh it isn t true She only just said it Ma lammie said he gravely kissing the top of the head nestled against him it s true that yer guid feyther wha never crossed ye except for yer ain sake syne the day ye were born is bringing hame a guid wife the day but ye mun be a wumman and no cry oot afore ye re hurted I ll be bound it s a kind genteel lady he s got that ll love ye and mak much o ye and teach ye to sew fine aye an play at the piano as like s no The child s mouth tightened resentfully but Murchison did not see it Noo ye ll jest be a douce lassie he went on and say me fair that ye ll never gie an unkind word tae yer feyther s new lady Noo promise me that an fine I ken ye ll keep tae it No I won t say anything unkind to her she answered and Murchison hugged himself on a victory for a promise was sacred to Charling He did not notice the child s voice as she gave it When the tears were quite dried he gave her a white geranium to plant in her own garden and went back to his work Charling took the geranium with pretty thanks and kisses but she felt it a burden none the less For her mind was quite made up When she had promised never to say anything unkind to her father s new lady she meant to keep the promise by never speaking to her or seeing her at all She meant to run away How could she bear to be kept under by this strange lady who would come and sit in her own mother s place and wear her own mother s clothes and no doubt presently burn her own mother s picture and make Charling wash the dishes and sweep the kitchen like poor dear Cinderella in the story True Cinderella s misfortunes ended in marriage with a prince but then Charling did not want to be married and she had but little faith in princes and besides she had no fairy godmother Her godmother was dead her own own mother was dead and only father was left and now he had done this thing and he would not want his Charling any more So Charling went indoors and washed her face and hands and smoothed her hair which never would be smoothed put a few treasures in her pocket all her money some coloured chalks a stone with crystal inside that showed where it was broken and went quietly out at the lodge gate carrying the white geranium in her arms because when you are running away you cannot possibly leave behind you the last gift of somebody who loves you But the geranium in its pot was very heavy and it seemed to get heavier and heavier as she walked along the dry dusty road so that presently Charling turned through the swing gate into the field way for the sake of the shadow of the hedge and the field way led past the church and when she reached the low mossy wall of the churchyard she set the pot on it and rested Then she said I think I will leave it with mother to take care of So she took the pot in her hands again and carried it to her mother s grave Of course they had told Charling that her mother was an angel now and was not in the churchyard at all but in heaven only heaven was a very long way off and Charling preferred to think that mother was only asleep under the green counterpane with the daisies on it There had been a green coverlet to the bed in mother s room only it had white lilac on it and not daisies So Charling set down the pot and she knelt down beside it and wrote on it with a piece of blue chalk from her pocket From Charling to mother to take care of Then she cried a little bit more because she was so sorry for herself and then she smelt the thyme and wondered why the bees liked it better than white geraniums and then she felt that she was very like a little girl in a book and so she forgot to cry and told herself that she was the third sister going out to seek her fortune After that it was easy to go on especially when she had put the crystal stone which hung heavy and bumpy in the pocket beside the geranium pot Then she kissed the tombstone where it said Helen beloved wife of and went away among the green graves in the sunshine Mother had died when she was only five so that she could not remember her very well but all these three years she had loved and thought of a kind beautiful Something that was never tired and never cross and always ready to kiss and love and forgive little girls however naughty they were and she called this something mother in her heart and it was for this something that she left her kisses on the gravestone And the gravestone was warm to her lips as she kissed it It was on a wide furze covered down across which a white road wound like a twisted ribbon that Charling s courage began to fail her The white road looked so very long there were no houses anywhere and no trees only far away across the down she saw the round tops of some big elms They look like cabbages she said to herself She had walked quite a long way and she was very tired Her dinner of sweets and stale cakes from the greeny glass bottles in the window of a village shop had not been so nice as she expected the woman at the shop had been cross because Charling had no pennies only the five shilling piece father had given her when he went away and the woman had no change And she had scolded so that Charling had grown frightened and had run away leaving the big round piece of silver on the dirty little counter This was about the time when she was missed at home and the servants began to search for her running to and fro like ants whose nest is turned up by the spade A big furze bush cast a ragged square yard of alluring shade on the common Charling flung herself down on the turf in the shadow I wonder what they are doing at home she said to herself after a while I don t suppose they ve even missed me They think of nothing but making the place all flowery for her to see Nobody wants me At home they were dragging the ornamental water in the park old Murchison directing the operation with tears running slow and unregarded down his face Charling lay and looked at the white road Somebody must go along it presently Roads were made for people to go along Then when any people came by she would speak to them and they would help her and tell her what to do I wonder what a girl ought to do when she runs away from home said Charling to herself Boys go to sea of course but I don t suppose a pirate would care about engaging a cabin girl She fell a musing however on the probable woes of possible cabin girls and their chances of becoming admirals as cabin boys always did in the stories and so deep were her musings that she positively jumped when a boy passing along the road began suddenly to whistle It was the air of a comic song in a minor key and its inflections were those of a funeral march It went to Charling s heart Now she knew as she had never known before how lonely and miserable she was She scrambled to her feet and called out Hi you boy The boy also jumped But he stopped and said Well though in a tone that promised little Come here said Charling At least of course I mean come if you please The boy shrugged his shoulders and came towards her Well he said again very grumpily Charling thought so she said Don t be cross I wish you d talk to me a little if you are not too busy If you please I mean of course She said it with her best company manner and the boy laughed not unkindly but still in a grudging way Then he threw himself down on the turf and began pulling bits of it up by the roots Go ahead said he But Charling could not go ahead She looked at his handsome sulky face his knitted brow twisted into fretful lines and the cloud behind his blue eyes frightened her Oh go away she said I don t want you Go away you re very unkind The boy seemed to shake himself awake at the sight of the tears that rushed to follow her words I say don t you know I say but Charling had flung herself face down on the turf and took no notice I say look here he said I am not unkind really I was in an awful wax about something else and I didn t understand Oh drop it I say look here what s the matter I m not such a bad sort really Come kiddie what s the row He dragged himself on knees and elbows to her side and began to pat her on the back with some energy There there he said don t cry there s a dear Here I ve got a handkerchief as it happens for Charling was feeling blindly and vainly among the coloured chalks He thrust the dingy handkerchief into her hands and she dried her eyes still sobbing That s the style said he Look here we re like people in a book Two travellers in misfortune meet upon a wild moor and exchange narratives Come tell me what s up You tell first said Charling rubbing her eyes very hard but swear eternal friendship before you begin then we can t tell each other s secrets to the enemy He looked at her with a nascent approval She understood how to play then this forlorn child in the torn white frock He took her hand and said solemnly I swear Your name she interrupted I N or M swear you know Oh yes Well I Harry Basingstoke swear to you Charling she interpolated the other names don t matter I ve got six of them That we will support no maintain eternal friendship And I Charling swear the same to you Harry Why do they call you Charling Oh because my name s Charlotte and mother used to sing a song about Charlie being her darling and I was her darling only I couldn t speak properly then and I got it mixed up into Charling father says But let s go on Tell me your sad history poor fellow wanderer My father was a king said Harry gravely but Charling turned such sad eyes on him that he stopped Won t you tell me the real true truth she said I will you Well said he the real true truth is Charling I ve run away from home and I m going to sea Charling clapped her hands Oh so have I So am I Let me come with you Would they take a cabin girl on the ship where you re going to do you think And why did you run away Did they beat you and starve you at home Or have you a cruel stepmother or stepfather or something No said he grimly I haven t any step relations and I m jolly well not going to have any either I ran away because I didn t choose to have a strange chap set over me and that s all I am going to tell you But about you How far have you come to day About ninety miles I should think said Charling at least my legs feel exactly like that And what made you do such a silly thing he said smiling at her and she thought his blue eyes looked quite different now so that she did not mind his calling her silly You know it s no good girls running away they always get caught and then they put them into convents or something She slipped her hand confidingly under his arm and put her head against the sleeve of his Norfolk jacket Not girls with eternal friends they don t she said You ll take care of me now You won t let them catch me Tell me why you did it then Charling told him at some length And father never told me a word about it she ended and I wasn t going to stay to be made to wash the dishes and things like Cinderella I wouldn t stand that not if I had to run away every day for a year Besides nobody wants me nobody will miss me This was about the time when they found the white geranium in the churchyard and began to send grooms about the country on horses And Murchison was striding about the lanes gnawing his grizzled beard and calling on his God to take him too if harm had come to the child But perhaps the stepmother would be nice the boy said Not she Stepmothers never are I know just what she ll be like a horrid old hag with red hair and a hump Then you ve not seen her No You might have waited till you had It would have been too late then said Charling tragically But your father wouldn t have let you be treated unkindly silly Fathers generally die when the stepmother comes or else they can t help themselves You know that as well as I do I suppose your father is a good sort He s the best man there is said Charling indignantly and the kindest and bravest and cleverest and amusingest and he can sit any horse like wax and he can fence with real swords and sing all the songs in all the world There Harry was silent racking his brain for arguments Look here kiddie he said slowly if your father s such a good sort he d have more sense than to choose a stepmother who wasn t nice He s a much finer chap than the fathers in fairy tales You never read of them being able to do all the things your father can do No said Charling that s true He s sure to have chosen someone quite jolly really Harry went on more confidently Charling looked up suddenly Who was it chose the chap that you weren t going to stand having set over you she said The boy bit his lip I swore eternal friendship so I can never tell your secrets you know said Charling softly and I ve told you every single thing Well it s my sister then said he abruptly and she s married a chap I ve never seen and I m to go and live with them if you please and she told me once she was never going to marry and it was always going to be just us two and now she s found this fellow she knew when she was a little girl and he was a boy as it might be us you know and she s forgotten all about what she said and married him And I wasn t even asked to the beastly wedding because they wanted to be married quietly and they came home from their hateful honeymoon this evening and the holidays begin to day and I was to go to this new chap s house to spend them And I only got her letter this morning and I just took my journey money and ran away My boxes were sent on straight from school though so I ve got no clothes but these I m just going to look at the place where she s to live and then I m off to sea Why didn t she tell you before She says she meant it to be a pleasant surprise because we ve been rather hard up since my father died and this chap s got horses and everything and she says he s going to adopt me As if I wanted to be adopted by any old stuck up money grubber But you haven t seen him said Charling gently If I m silly you are too aren t you She hid her face on her sleeve to avoid seeing the effect of this daring shot Only silence answered her Presently Harry said Now kiddie let me take you home will you Give the stepmother a fair show anyhow Charling reflected She was very tired She stroked Harry s hand absently and after a while said I will if you will Will what Go back and give your chap a fair show And now the boy reflected Done he said suddenly After all what s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander Come on He stood up and held out his hand This was about the time when the cook packed her box and went off leaving it to be sent after her Public opinion in the servants hall was too strong to be longer faced The shadows of the trees lay black and level across the pastures when the two children reached the lodge gates A floral arch was above the gate and wreaths of flowers and flags made the avenue gay Charling had grown very tired and Harry had carried her on his back for the last mile or two resting often because Charling was a strong healthy child and as he phrased it no slouch of a weight Now they paused at the gate of the lodge This is my house said Charling They ve put all these things up for her I suppose If you ll write down your address I ll give you mine and we can write and tell each other what they are like afterwards I ve got a bit of chalk somewhere She fumbled in the dusty confusion of her little pocket while Harry found the envelope of his sister s letter and tore it in two Then one on each side of the lodge gate post the children wrote slowly and carefully for some moments Presently they exchanged papers and each read the words written by the other Then suddenly both turned very red But this is my address said she The Grange Falconbridge It s where my sister s gone to live anyhow said he Then then Conviction forced itself first on the boy What a duffer I ve been It s him she s married Your sister Yes Are you sure your father s a good sort How dare you ask said Charling It s your sister I want to know about She s the dearest old darling he cried Oh kiddie come along run for all you re worth and perhaps we can get in the back way and get tidied up before they come and they need never know He held out his hand Charling caught at it and together they raced up the avenue But getting in the back way was impossible for Murchison met them full on the terrace and Charling ran straight into his arms There should have been scolding and punishment no doubt but Charling found none And now who so sleek and demure as the runaways he in Eton jacket and she in spotless white muslin when the carriage drew up in front of the hall amid the cheers of the tenants and the bowing of the orderly marshalled servants And then a lady pretty as a princess in a fairy tale with eyes as blue as Harry s was hugging him and Charling both at once while a man whom Harry at once owned to be a man stood looking at the group with grave kind eyes We ll never never tell whispered the boy The servants had been sworn to secrecy by Murchison Charling whispered back Never as long as we live But long before bedtime came each of the runaways felt that concealment was foolish in the face of the new circumstances and with some embarrassment a tear or two and a little gentle laughter the tale was told Oh Harry how could you said the stepmother and went quietly out by the long window with her arm round her brother s shoulders Charling was left alone with her father Why didn t you tell me father I wish I had childie but I thought you see I was going away I didn t want to leave you alone for a fortnight to think all sorts of nonsense And I thought my little girl could trust me Charling hid her face in her hands Well it s all right now don t cry my girlie He drew her close to him And you ll love Harry very much I will He brought you back And I ll love her very much So that s all settled said Charling cheerfully Then her face fell again But father don t you love mother any more Cook said you didn t He sighed and was silent At last he said You are too little to understand sweetheart I have loved the lady who came home to day all my life long and I shall love your mother as long as I live Cook said it was like being unkind to mother Does mother mind about it really He muttered something inaudible to the cook s address I don t think they either of them mind my darling Charling he said You cannot understand it but I think they both understand WITH AN E SHE had been thinking of him all day of the incredible insignificance of the point on which they had quarrelled the babyish folly of the quarrel itself the silly pride that had made the quarrel strong till the very memory of it was as a bar of steel to keep them apart Three years ago and so much had happened since then Three years and not a day of them all had passed without some thought of him sometimes a happy quiet remembrance transfigured by a wise forgetfulness sometimes a sudden recollection sharp as a knife But not on many days had she allowed the quiet remembrance to give place to the knife thrust and then kept the knife in the wound turning it round with a scientific curiosity which while it ran an undercurrent of breathless pleasure beneath the pain yet did not lessen this intensified it rather To day she had thought of him thus through the long hours on deck when the boat sped on even keel across the blue and gold of the Channel in the dusty train from Ostend even in the little open carriage that carried her and her severely moderate luggage from the station at Bruges to the Hotel du Panier d Or She had thought of him so much that it was no surprise to her to see him there drinking coffee at one of the little tables which the hotel throws out like tentacles into the Grande Place There he sat in a grey flannel suit His back was towards her but she would have known the set of his shoulders anywhere and the turn of his head He was talking to someone a lady handsome but older than he oh evidently much older Elizabeth made the transit from carriage to hotel door in one swift quiet movement He did not see her but the lady facing him put up a tortoiseshell handled lorgnon and gazed through it and through narrowed eyelids at the new comer Elizabeth reappeared no more that evening It was the waiter who came out to dismiss the carriage and superintend the bringing in of the luggage Elizabeth stumbling in a maze of forgotten French was met at the stair foot by a smiling welcome and realised in a spasm of grateful surprise that she need not have brought her dictionary The hostess of the Panier d Or like everyone else in Belgium spoke English and an English far better than Elizabeth s French had been She secured a tiny bedroom and a sitting room that looked out over the Place so that whenever he drank coffee she might with luck hope to see the back of his dear head Idiot said Elizabeth catching this little thought wandering in her mind and with that she slapped the little thought and put it away in disgrace But when she woke in the night it woke too and cried a little That night it seemed to her that she would have all her meals served in the little sitting room and never go downstairs at all lest she should meet him But in the morning she perceived that one does not save up one s money for a year in order to have a Continental holiday and sweeten all one s High school teaching with one thought of that holiday in order to spend its precious hours between four walls just because well for any reason whatsoever So she went down to take her coffee and rolls humbly publicly like other people The dining room was dishevelled discomposed chairs piled on tables and brooms all about It was in the hotel cafe where the marble topped little tables were that Mademoiselle would be served Here was a marble topped counter too where later in the day aperitifs and petits verres would be handed On this open for the police to read lay the list of those who had spent the night at the Panier d Or The room was empty Elizabeth caught up the list Yes his name was there at the very top of the column Edward Brown and below it Mrs Brown Elizabeth dropped the paper as though it had bitten her and turning sharply came face to face with that very Edward Brown He raised his hat gravely and a shiver of absolute sickness passed over her for his glance at her in passing was the glance of a stranger It was not possible Yet it was true He had forgotten her In three little years They had been long enough years to her but now she called them little In three little years he had forgotten her very face Elizabeth chin in air marched down the room and took possession of the little table where her coffee waited her She began to eat It was not till the sixth mouthful that her face flushed suddenly to so deep a crimson that she dared not raise her eyes to see how many of the folk now breaking their rolls in her company had had eyes for her face As a matter of fact only one observed the sudden colour and he admired and rejoiced for he had seen such a colour in that face before She is angry good said he and poured out more coffee with a steady hand The thought that flooded Elizabeth s face and neck and ears with damask was one quite inconsistent with the calm eating of bread and butter She laid down her knife and walked out chin in air to the last Alone in her sitting room she buried her face in a hard cushion and went as near to swearing as a very nice girl may Oh oh oh oh bother Why did I go down I ought to have fled to the uttermost parts of the earth or even to Ghent Of course Oh what a fool I am It s because he s married that he won t speak to me You fool you fool you fool Yes of course you knew he was married only you thought you d like the silly satisfaction of hearing his voice speak to you and yours speaking to him But oh fool fool fool Elizabeth put on the thickest veil she had and the largest hat and went blindly out She walked very fast never giving a glance to the step and stair gables of the old houses the dominant strength of the belfry the curious un English groups in the streets Presently she came to a bridge a canal overhanging houses balconies a glimpse like the pictures of Venice She leaned her elbows on the parapet and presently became aware of the prospect It is pretty she said grudgingly and at the same moment turned away for in a flower hung balcony across the water she saw him This is too absurd she said I must get out of the place at least for the day I ll go to Ghent He had seen her and a thrill of something very like gratified vanity straightened his shoulders When a girl has jilted you it is comforting to find that even after three years she has not forgotten you enough to be indifferent no matter how you may have consoled yourself in the interval Elizabeth walked fast but she did not get to the railway station because she took the wrong turning several times She passed through street after strange street and came out on a wide quay another canal across it showed old gabled red roofed houses She walked on and came presently to a bridge and another quay and a little puffing snorting steamboat She hurriedly collected a few scattered items of her school vocabulary Est ce que est ce que ce bateau a vapeur va va anywhere A voluble assurance that it went at twelve thirty did not content her She gathered her forces again Oui mais ou est ce qu il va aller The answer sounded something like Sloosh and the speaker pointed vaguely up the green canal Elizabeth went on board This was as good as Ghent Better There was an element of adventure about it Sloosh might be anywhere one might not reach it for days But the boat had not the air of one used to long cruises and Elizabeth felt safe in playing with the idea of an expedition into darkest Holland And now by chance or because her movements interested him as much as his presence repelled her this same Edward Brown also came on board and concealed by the deep daydream into which she had fallen passed her unseen When she shook the last drops of the daydream from her she found herself confronting the boat s only other passenger himself She looked at him full and straight in the eyes and with the look her embarrassment left her and laid hold on him He remembered her last words to him If ever we meet again we meet as strangers Well he had kept to the very letter of that bidding and she had been angry He had been very glad to see that she was angry But now face to face for an hour and a half for he knew the distance to Sluys well enough could he keep silence still and yet avoid being ridiculous He did not intend to be ridiculous yet even this might have happened But Elizabeth saved him She raised her chin and spoke in chill distant courtesy I think you must be English because I saw you at the Panier d Or everyone s English there I can t make these people understand anything Perhaps you could be so kind as to tell me how long the boat takes to get to wherever it does get to It was a longer speech than she would have made had he been the stranger as whom she proposed to treat him but it was necessary to let him understand at the outset what was the part she intended to play He did understand and assumed his role instantly Something under two hours I think he said politely still holding in his hand the hat he had removed on the instant of her breaking silence How cool and pleasant the air is after the town The boat was moving now quickly between grassy banks topped by rows of ash trees The landscape on each side spread away like a map intersected with avenues of tall lean wind bent trees that seemed to move as the boat moved Good said she to herself he means to talk We shan t sit staring at each other for two hours like stuck pigs And he really doesn t know me Or is it the wife Oh I wish I d never come to this horrible country Aloud she said Yes and how pretty the trees and fields are So so nice and green aren t they said he And she said Yes Each inwardly smiled In the old days each had been so eager for the other s good opinion so afraid of seeming commonplace that their conversations had been all fine work and their very love letters too clever by half Now they did not belong to each other any more and he said the trees were green and she said Yes There seem to be a great many people in Bruges said she Yes he said in eager assent Quite a large number There is a great deal to be seen in these old towns So quaint aren t they She remembered his once condemning in a friend the use of that word Now he echoed it So very quaint said he And the dogs drawing carts Just like the pictures aren t they You can get pictures of them on the illustrated post cards So nice to send to one s relations at home She was getting angry with him He played the game too well Ah yes he answered the dear people like these little tokens don t they He s getting exactly like a curate she thought and a doubt assailed her Perhaps he was not playing the game at all Perhaps in these three years he had really grown stupid How different it all is from England isn t it Oh quite said he Have you ever been in Holland Yes once What was it like she asked That was a form of question they had agreed to hate once long ago Oh extremely pleasant he said warmly We met some most agreeable people at some of the hotels Quite the best sort of people you know Another phrase once banned by both The sun sparkled on the moving duckweed of the canal The sky was blue overhead Here and there a red roofed farm showed among the green pastures Ahead the avenues tapered away into distance and met at the vanishing point Elizabeth smiled for sheer pleasure at the sight of two little blue smocked children solemnly staring at the boat as it passed Then she glanced at him with an irritated frown It was his turn to smile You called the tune my lady he said to himself and it is you shall change it not I Foreign countries are very like England are they not he said The same kind of trees you know and the same kind of cows and and everything Even the canals are very like ours The canal system said Elizabeth instructively is the finest in the world Adieu Canal canard canaille he quoted They had always barred quotations in the old days I don t understand Latin said she Then their eyes met and he got up abruptly and walked to the end of the boat and back When he sat down again he sat beside her Shall we go on he said quietly I think it is your turn to choose a subject Oh have you read Alice in Wonderland she said with simple eagerness Such a pretty book isn t it He shrugged his shoulders She was obstinate all women were Men were not He would be magnanimous He would not compel her to change the tune He had given her one chance and if she wouldn t well it was not possible to keep up this sort of conversation till they got to Sluys He would But again she saved him I won t play any more she said It s not fair Because you may think me a fool But I happen to know that you are mister Brown who writes the clever novels You were pointed out to me at the hotel and oh do tell me if you always talk like this to strangers Only to English ladies on canal boats said he smiling You see one never knows They might wish one to talk like that We both did it very prettily Of course more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows but I think I may congratulate you on your first attempt at the English abroad conversation Do you know really she said you did it so well that if I hadn t known who you were I should have thought it was the real you The felicitations are not all mine But won t you tell me about Holland That bit of yours about the hotel acquaintances was very brutal I ve heard heaps of people say that very thing You just caught the tone But Holland Well this is Holland said he but I saw more of it than this and I ll tell you anything you like if you won t expect me to talk clever and turn the phrase That s a lost art and I won t humiliate myself in trying to recover it To begin with Holland is flat Don t be a geography book Elizabeth laughed light heartedly The coinage is No but seriously Well then said he and the talk lasted till the little steamer bumped and grated against the quay side at Sluys When they had landed the two stood for a moment on the grass grown quay in silence Well good afternoon said Elizabeth suddenly Thank you so much for telling me all about Holland And with that she turned and walked away along the narrow street between the trim little houses that look so like a child s toy village tumbled out of a white wood box mister Edward Brown was left planted there Well said he and spent the afternoon wandering about near the landing stage and wondering what would be the next move in this game of hers It was a childish game this playing at strangers yet he owned that it had a charm He ate currant bread and drank coffee at a little inn by the quay sitting at the table by the door and watching the boats Two o clock came and went Four o clock came half past four and with that went the last return steamer for Bruges Still mister Edward Brown sat still and smoked Five minutes later Elizabeth s blue cotton dress gleamed in the sunlight at the street corner He rose and walked towards her I hope you have enjoyed yourself in Holland he said I lost my way said she He saw that she was very tired even before he heard it in her voice When is the next boat There are no more boats to day The last left about ten minutes ago You might have told me she said resentfully I beg your pardon said he You bade me good bye with an abruptness and a decision which forbade me to tell you anything I beg your pardon she said humbly Can I get back by train There are no trains A carriage There are none I have inquired But you she asked suddenly how did you miss the boat How are you going to get back I shall walk said he ignoring the first question It s only eleven miles But for you of course that s impossible You might stay the night here The woman at this inn seems a decent old person I can t There s a girl coming to join me She s in the sixth at the High School where I teach I ve promised to chaperon and instruct her I must meet her at the station at ten She s been ten years at the school I don t believe she knows a word of French Oh I must go She doesn t know the name of my hotel or anything I must go I must walk Have you had any food No I never thought about it She did not realise that she was explaining to him that she had been walking to get away from him and from her own thoughts and that food had not been among these Then you will dine now and if you will allow me we will walk back together Elizabeth submitted It was pleasant to be taken care of And to be ordered about that was pleasant too Curiously enough that very thing had been a factor in the old quarrel At nineteen one is so independent She was fed on omelettes and strange pale steak and mister Brown insisted on beer The place boasted no wine cellar Then the walk began For the first mile or two it was pleasant Then Elizabeth s shoes began to hurt her They were smart brown shoes with deceitful wooden heels In her wanderings over the cobblestones of Sluys streets one heel had cracked itself Now it split altogether She began to limp Won t you take my arm said he No thank you I don t really need it I ll rest a minute though if I may She sat down leaning against a tree and looked out at the darting swallows dimpling here and there the still green water The level sunlight struck straight across the pastures turning them to gold The long shadows of the trees fell across the canal and lay black on the reeds at the other side The hour was full of an ample dignity of peace They walked another mile Elizabeth could not conceal her growing lameness Something is wrong with your foot said he Have you hurt it It s these silly shoes the heel s broken Take them off and let me see She submitted without a protest sat down took off the shoes and gave them to him He looked at them kindly contemptuously Silly little things he said and she instead of resenting the impertinence smiled Then he tore off the heels and dug out the remaining bristle of nails with his pocket knife That ll be better said he cheerfully Elizabeth put on the damp shoes The evening dew lay heavy on the towing path and she hardly demurred at all to his fastening the laces She was very tired Again he offered his arm again she refused it Then Elizabeth take my arm at once he said sharply She took it and they had kept step for some fifty paces before she said Then you knew all the time Am I blind or in my dotage But you forbade me to meet you except as a stranger I have an obedient nature They walked on in silence He held her hand against his side strongly but as it seemed without sentiment He was merely helping a tired woman stranger on a long road But the road seemed easier to Elizabeth because her hand lay so close to him she almost forgot how tired she was and lost herself in dreams and awoke and taught herself to dream again and wondered why everything should seem so different just because one s hand lay on the sleeve of a grey flannel jacket Why should I be so abominably happy she asked herself and then lapsed again into the dreams that were able to wipe away three years as a kind hand might wipe three little tear drops from a child s slate scrawled over with sums done wrong When she remembered that he was married she salved her conscience innocently After all she said it can t be wrong if it doesn t make him happy and of course he doesn t care and I shall never see him again after to night So on they went the deepening dusk turned to night and in Elizabeth s dreams it seemed that her hand was held more closely but unless one moved it ever so little one could not be sure and she would not move it ever so little The damp towing path ended in a road cobblestoned the masts of ships pointed roofs twinkling lights The eleven miles were nearly over Elizabeth s hand moved a little involuntarily on his arm To cover the movement she spoke instantly I am leaving Bruges to morrow No your sixth form girl will be too tired and besides Besides Oh a thousand things Don t leave Bruges yet it s so quaint you know and and I want to introduce you to I won t said Elizabeth almost violently You won t No I don t want to know your wife He stopped short in the street not one of the quaint streets but a deserted street of tall square shuttered stern dark mansions wherein a gas lamp or two flickered timidly My wife he said it s my aunt It said missus Brown in the visitors list faltered Elizabeth Brown s such an uncommon name he said my aunt spells hers with an E Oh with an E Yes of course I spell my name with an E too only it s at the wrong end Elizabeth began to laugh and the next moment to cry helplessly Oh Elizabeth and you looked in the visitors list and He caught her in his arms there in the street No you can t get away I m wiser than I was three years ago I shall never let you go any more my dear The girl from the sixth looked quite resentfully at the two faces that met her at the station It seemed hardly natural or correct for a classical mistress to look so happy Elizabeth s lover schemed for and got a goodnight word with her at the top of the stairs by the table where the beautiful brass candlesticks lay waiting in shining rows Sleep well you poor tired little person he said as he lighted the candle such little feet such wicked little shoes such a long long long walk You must be tired too she said Tired with eleven miles and your hand against my heart for eight of them I shall remember that walk when we re two happy old people nodding across our own hearthrug at each other So he had felt it too and if he had been married how wicked it would have been But he was not married yet I am not very very tired really she said You see it was my hand against I mean your arm was a great help It was your hand he said Oh you darling It was her hand too that was kissed there beside the candlesticks under the very eyes of the chambermaid and two acid English tourists UNDER THE NEW MOON THE white crescent of the little new moon blinked at us through the yew boughs As you walk up the churchyard you see thirteen yews on each side of you and yet if you count them up they make twenty seven and it has been pointed out to me that neither numerical fact can be without occult significance The jugglery in numbers is done by the seventh yew on the left which hides a shrinking sister in the amplitude of its shadow The midsummer day was dying in a golden haze Amid the gathering shadows of the churchyard her gown gleamed white ghostlike Oh there s the new moon she said I am so glad Take your hat off to her and turn the money in your pocket and you will get whatever you wish for and be rich as well I obeyed with a smile half of whose meaning she answered No she said I am not really superstitious I m not at all sure that the money is any good or the hat but of course everyone knows it s unlucky to see it through glass Seen through glass I began a hat presents a gloss which on closer inspection No no not a hat the moon of course And you might as well pretend that it s lucky to upset the salt or to kill a spider especially on a Tuesday or on your hat Hats I began again certainly seem to It s not the hat she answered pulling up the wild thyme and crushing it in her hands you know very well it s the spider Doesn t that smell sweet She held out the double handful of crushed sun dried thyme and as I bent my face over the cup made by her two curved hands I was constrained to admit that the fragrance was delicious Intoxicating even I added Not that White lilies intoxicate you so does mock orange and white may too only it s unlucky to bring it into the house I smiled again I don t see why you should call it superstitious to believe in facts she said My cousin s husband s sister brought some may into her house last year and her uncle died within the month My husband s uncle s sister s niece Was saved from them by the police She says so so I know it s true I had got thus far in my quotation when she interrupted me Oh well if you re going to sneer she said and added that it was getting late and that she must go home Not yet I pleaded See how pretty everything is The sky all pink and the red sunset between the yews and that good little moon And how black the shadows are under the buttresses Don t go home already they will have lighted the yellow shaded lamps in your drawing room Your sister will be sitting down to the piano Your mother is trying to match her silks Your brother has got out the chess board Someone is drawing the curtains The day is over for them but for us here there is a little bit of it left We were sitting on the lowest step of a high square tomb moss grown and lichen covered The yellow lichens had almost effaced the long list of the virtues of the man on whose breast this stone had lain as itself in round capitals protested since the year of grace seventeen oh three The sharp leafed ivy grew thickly over one side of it and the long uncut grass came up between the cracks of its stone steps It s all very well she said severely Don t be angry I implored How can you be angry when the bats are flying black against the rose sky when the owl is waking up his is a soft fluffy awakening and wondering if it s breakfast time I won t be angry she said Besides the owl it s disrespectful to the dear sleepy dead people to be angry in a churchyard But if I were really superstitious you know I should be afraid to come here at night At the end of the day I corrected It is not night yet Tell me before the night comes all the wonderful things you believe Recite your credo Don t be flippant I don t suppose I believe more unlikely things than you do You believe in algebra and Euclid and log what s his names Now I don t believe a word of all that We have it on the best authority that by getting up early you can believe six impossible things before breakfast But they re not impossible Don t you see that s just it The things I like to believe are the very things that might be true And they re relics of a prettier time than ours a time when people believed in ghosts and fairies and witches and the devil oh yes and in God and His angels too Now the times are bound in yellow brick and we believe in nothing but Euclid and and company prospectuses and patent medicines When she is a little angry she is very charming but it was too dark for me to see her face Then I asked it is merely the literary sense that leads you to make the Holy Sign when you find two knives crossed on your table or to knock under the table and cry Unberufen when you have provoked the Powers with some kind word of the destiny they have sent you I don t she said I don t talk foreign languages You say unbecalled for I know but this is mere subterfuge Is it the literary sense that leads you to treasure farthings to refuse to give pins to object to a dinner party of thirteen to fear the plucking of the golden elder to avoid coming back to the house when once you ve started even if you ve forgotten your prayer book or your umbrella to decline to pass under a ladder I always go under a ladder she interrupted ignoring the other counts it only means you won t be married for seven years I never go under ladders Tell me is it the literary sense Bother the literary sense she said Bother is not a pretty word but this did not strike me till I came to write it down Look she went on at the faint primrose tint over the pine trees and those last pink clouds high up in the sky I could see the outline of her lifted chin and her throat against the yew shadows but I determined to be wise I looked at the pine trees and said I want you to instruct me Why is it unlucky to break a looking glass and what is the counter charm I don t know there was some awe in her voice I don t think there is any counter charm If I broke a looking glass I believe I should have to give up believing in these things altogether It would make me too unhappy I was discreet enough to pass by the admission And why is it unlucky to wear black at a wedding And if anyone did wear black at your wedding what would you do You are very tiresome this evening she said Why don t you keep to the point Nobody was talking of weddings and if you must wander why not stray in more amusing paths Why don t you talk of something interesting Why do you try to be disagreeable If you think I m silly to believe all these nice picturesque things why don t you give me your solid dull dry scientific reasons for not believing them Your wish is my law I responded with alacrity Superstition then is the result of the imperfect recognition in unscientific ages of the relations of cause and effect To persons unaccustomed correctly to assign causes one cause is as likely as another to produce a given effect Hallucinations of the senses have also doubtless And now you re only dull she said The light had slowly faded while we spoke till the churchyard was almost dark the grass was heavy with dew and sadness had crept like a shadow over the quiet world I am sorry Everything I say is wrong to night I was born under an unlucky star Forgive me It was I who was cross she admitted at once very cheerfully but indeed not without some truth But it doesn t do anyone any harm to play at believing things honestly I m not sure whether I believe them or not but they have some colour about them in an age grown grey in its hateful laboratories and workshops I do want to try to tell you if you really want to know about it I can t think why but if I meet a flock of sheep I know it is lucky and I m cheered and if a hare crosses the path I feel it is unlucky and I m sad and if I see the new moon through glass I m positively wretched But all the same I m not superstitious I m not afraid of ghosts or dead people or things like that I m not sure that she did not add So there Would you dare to go to the church door at twelve at night and knock three times I asked with some severity Yes she said stoutly though I know she quailed I would Now you ll admit that I m not superstitious Yes I said and here I offer no excuse The devil entered into me and though I see now what a brute beast I was I cannot be sorry I own that you are not superstitious How dark it is growing The ivy has broken the stone away just behind your head there is quite a large hole in the side of the tomb No don t move there s nothing there If you were superstitious you might fancy on a still dark sweet evening like this that the dead man might wake and want to come up out of his coffin He might crouch under the stone and then trying to come out he might very slowly reach out his dead fingers and touch your neck Ah The awakened wind had moved an ivy spray to the suggested touch She sprang up with a cry and the next moment she was clinging wildly to me as I held her in my arms Don t cry my dear oh don t Forgive me it was the ivy She caught her breath How could you how could you And still I held her fast with as she grew calmer a question in the clasp of my arms and presently on my lips Oh my dear forgive me And is it true do you do you Yes no I don t know No no not through my veil it is so unlucky THE LOVE OF ROMANCE SHE opened the window at which no light shone All the other windows were darkly shuttered The night was still only a faint breath moved among the restless aspen leaves The ivy round the window whispered hoarsely as the casement swung back too swiftly rested against it She had a large linen sheet in her hands Without hurry and without delayings she knotted one corner of it to the iron staple of the window She tied the knot firmly and further secured it with string She let the white bulk of the sheet fall between the ivy and the night then she climbed on to the window ledge and crouched there on her knees There was a heart sick pause before she grasped the long twist of the sheet as it hung let her knees slip from the supporting stone and swung suddenly by her hands Her elbows and wrists were grazed against the rough edge of the window ledge the sheet twisted at her weight and jarred her shoulder heavily against the house wall Her arms seemed to be tearing themselves from their sockets But she clenched her teeth felt with her feet for the twisted ivy stems on the side of the house found foothold and the moment of almost unbearable agony was over She went down helped by feet and hands and by ivy and sheet almost exactly as she had planned to do She had not known it would hurt so much that was all Her feet felt the soft mould of the border a stout geranium snapped under her tread She crept round the house in the house s shadow found the gardener s ladder and so on to the high brick wall From this she dropped deftly enough into the suburban lane dropped too into the arms of a man who was waiting there She hid her face in his neck trembling and said Oh Harry I wish I hadn t Then she began to cry helplessly The man receiving her embrace with what seemed in the circumstances a singularly moderated enthusiasm led her with one arm still lightly about her shoulders down the lane at the corner he stood still and said in a low voice Hush stop crying at once I ve something to say to you She tore herself from his arm and gasped It s not Harry she said Oh how dare you She had been brave till she had dropped into his arms Then the need for bravery had seemed over Now her tears were dried swiftly and suddenly by the blaze of anger and courage in her eyes Don t be unreasonable he said and even at that moment of disappointment and rage his voice pleased her I had to get you away somehow I couldn t risk an explanation right under your aunt s windows Harry s sprained his knee cricket He couldn t come A sharp resentment stirred in her against the lover who could play cricket on the very day of an elopement He told you to come Oh how could he betray me My dear girl what was he to do He couldn t leave you to wait out here alone perhaps for hours I shouldn t have waited long she said sharply you came to tell me now you ve told me you d better go Look here he said with gentle calm I do wish you d try not to be quite so silly I m Harry s doctor and a middle aged man Let me help you There must be some better way out of your troubles than a midnight flight and a despairingly defiant note on the pin cushion I didn t she said I put it on the mantelpiece Please go I decline to discuss anything with you Ah don t he said I knew you must be a very romantic person or you wouldn t be here and I knew you must be rather sill well rather young or you wouldn t have fallen in love with Harry But I did not think after the brave and practical manner in which you kept your appointment I did not think that you d try to behave like the heroine of a family novelette Come sit down on this heap of stones there s nobody about There s a light in your house now You can t go back yet Here let me put my Inverness round you Keep it up round your chin and then if anyone sees you they won t know who you are I can t leave you alone here You know what a lot of robberies there have been in the neighbourhood lately there may be rough characters about Come now let s think what s to be done You know you can t get back unless I help you I don t want you to help me and I won t go back she said But she sat down and pulled the cloak up round her face Now he said as I understand the case it s this You live rather a dull life with two tyrannical aunts and the passion for romance They re not tyrannical only one s always ill and the other s always nursing her She makes her get up and read to her in the night That s her light you saw Well I pass the aunts Anyhow you met Harry somehow It was at the Choral Society And then they stopped my going because he walked home with me one wet night And you have never seen each other since Of course we have And communicated by some means more romantic than the post It wasn t romantic It was tennis balls Tennis balls You cut a slit and squeeze it and put a note in and it shuts up and no one notices it It wasn t romantic at all And I don t know why I should tell you anything about it And then I suppose there were glances in church and stolen meetings in the passionate hush of the rose scented garden There s nothing in the garden but geraniums she said and we always talked over the wall he used to stand on their chicken house and I used to turn our dog kennel up on end and stand on that You have no right to know anything about it but it was not in the least romantic No that sees itself May I ask whether it was you or he who proposed this elopement Oh how dare you she said jumping up you have no right to insult me like this He caught her wrist Sit down you little firebrand he said I gather that he proposed it You at any rate consented no doubt after the regulation amount of proper scruples It s all very charming and idyllic and what are you crying for Your lost hopes of a happy life with a boy you know nothing of a boy you ve hardly seen a boy you ve never talked to about anything but love s young dream I m not crying she said passionately turning her streaming eyes on him you know I m not or if I am it s only with rage You may be a doctor though I don t believe you are but you re not a gentleman Not anything like one I suppose not he said a gentleman would not make conditions I m going to make one You can t go to Harry because his Mother would be seriously annoyed if you did and so believe me would he though you don t think it You can get up and leave me and go away into the night like a heroine of fiction but you can t keep on going away into the night for ever and ever You must have food and clothes and lodging And the sun rises every day You must just quietly and dully go home again And you can t do it without me And I ll help you if you ll promise not to see Harry or write to him for a year He ll see me He ll write to me she said with proud triumph I think not I exacted the promise from him as a condition of my coming to meet you And he promised Evidently There was a long silence She broke it with a voice of concentrated fury If he doesn t mind I don t she said I ll promise Now let me go back I wish you hadn t come I wish I was dead Come he said don t be so angry with me I ve done what I could for you both On conditions You must see that they are good or you wouldn t have accepted them so soon I thought it would have taken me at least an hour to get you to consent But no ten minutes of earnest reflection are enough to settle the luckless Harry s little hash You re quite right he doesn t deserve more I am pleased with myself I own I must have a very convincing manner Oh she cried passionately I daresay you think you ve been very clever But I wish you knew what I think of you And I d tell you for twopence I m a poor man gentle lady won t you tell me for love His voice was soft and pleading beneath the laugh that stung her Yes I will tell you for nothing she cried You re a brute and a hateful interfering disagreeable impertinent old thing and I only hope you ll have someone be as horrid to you as you ve been to me that s all I think I ve had that already quite as horrid he said grimly This is not the moment for compliments but you have great powers You are brave and I never met anyone who could be more horrid as you call it in smaller compass all with one little tiny adjective My felicitations You are clever Come don t be angry any more I had to do it you ll understand some day You wouldn t like it yourself she said softening to something in his voice I shouldn t have liked it at your age he said sixteen fifteen what is it I m nineteen next birthday she said with dignity And the date The fifteenth of June I don t know what you mean by asking me And to day s the first of July he said and sighed Well well if your Highness will allow me I ll go and see whether your aunt s light is out and if it is we ll attempt the re entrance He went She shivered waiting for what felt like hours And the resentment against her aunts grew faint in the light of her resentment against her lover s messenger and this in its turn was outshone by her anger against her lover He had played cricket He had risked his life on the very day whose evening should have crowned that life by giving her to his arms She set her teeth Then she yawned and shivered again It was an English July and very cold And the slow minutes crept past What a fool she had been Why had she not made a fight for her liberty for her right to see Harry if she chose to see him The aunts would never have stood up against a well planned determined disagreeable resistance In the light of this doctor s talk the whole thing did seem cowardly romantic and worst of all insufferably young Well to morrow everything should change she would fight for her Love not merely run away to him But the promise Well Harry was Harry and a promise was only a promise There were footsteps in the lane The man was coming back to her She rose It s all right he said Come In silence they walked down the lane Suddenly he stopped You ll thank me some day he said Why should you throw yourself away on Harry You re worth fifty of him And I only wish I had time to explain this to you thoroughly but I haven t She too had stopped Now she stamped her foot Look here she said I m not going to promise anything at all You needn t help me if you don t want to but I take back that promise Go do what you like I mean to stick to Harry and I ll write and tell him so to night So there He clapped his hands very softly Bravo he said that s the right spirit Plucky child Any other girl would have broken the promise without a word to me Harry s luckier even than I thought I ll help you little champion Come on He helped her over the wall carried the ladder to her window and steadied it while she mounted it When she had climbed over the window ledge she turned and leaned out of the window to see him slowly mounting the ladder He threw his head back with a quick gesture that meant I have something more to say lean out She leaned out His face was on a level with hers You ve slept soundly all night don t forget that it s important he whispered and you needn t tell Harry one sided things are so trivial but I can t help it I have the passion for romance too With that he caught her neck in the curve of his arm and kissed her lightly but fervently Good bye he said thank you so much for a very pleasant evening He dropped from the ladder and was gone She drew her curtain with angry suddenness Then she lighted candles and looked at herself in the looking glass She thought she had never looked so pretty And she was right Then she went to bed and slept like a tired baby Next morning the suburb was electrified by the discovery made by the nursing aunt that all the silver and jewels and valuables from the safe at the top of the stairs had vanished The villains must have come through your room child she said to Harry s sweetheart the ladder proves that Slept sound all night did you Well that was a mercy They might have murdered you in your bed if you d happened to be awake You ought to be humbly thankful when you think of what might have happened The girl did not think very much of what might have happened What had happened gave her quite food enough for reflection Especially when to her side of the night s adventures was added the tale of Harry s He had not played cricket he had not hurt his knee he had merely confided in his father s valet and had given that unprincipled villain a five pound note to be at the Cross Roads in the orthodox style with a cab for the flight a post chaise being alas out of date Instead of doing this the valet with a confederate had gagged and bound young Harry and set him in a convenient corner against the local waterworks to await events I never would have believed it of him added Harry in an agitated india rubber ball note he always seemed such a superior person you d have thought he was a gentleman if you d met him in any other position I should I did she said to herself And oh how frightfully clever And the way he talked And all the time he was only keeping me out of the way while they stole the silver and things I wish he hadn t taken the ruby necklace it does suit me so And what nerve He actually talked about the robberies in the neighbourhood He must have done them all Oh what a pity But he was a dear And how awfully wicked he was too but I ll never tell Harry She never has Curiously enough her Burglar Valet Hero was not caught though the police most intelligently traced his career from his being sent down from Oxford to his last best burglary She was married to Harry with the complete consent of everyone concerned for Harry had money and so had she and there had never been the slightest need for an elopement save in youth s perennial passion for romance It was on her birthday that she received a registered postal packet It had a good many queer postmarks on it and the stamps were those of a South American republic It was addressed to her by her new name which was as good as new still It came at breakfast time and it contained the ruby necklace several gold rings and a diamond brooch All were the property of her late aunts Also there was an india rubber ball and in it a letter Here is a birthday present for you it said Try to forgive me Some temptations are absolutely irresistible That one was And it was worth it It rounded off the whole thing so perfectly That last indiscretion of mine nearly ruined everything There was a policeman in the lane I only escaped by the merest fluke But even then it would have been worth it At least I should like you to believe that I think so His last indiscretion said Harry who saw the note but not the india rubber ball that means stealing your aunts things of course unless it was dumping me down by the waterworks but of course that wasn t the last one But worth it Why he d have had seven years if they d caught him worth it He must have a passion for burglary She did not explain to Harry because he would never have understood But the burglar would have found it quite easy to understand that or anything She was so shocked to find herself thinking this that she went over to Harry and kissed him with more affection even than usual Yes dear he said I don t wonder you re pleased to get something back out of all those things I quite understand Yes dear said she I know You always do Transcriber s Notes Obvious punctuation errors repaired Page two hundred nineteen
