Raiding with Morgan Illustration AS HE SAT ON HIS HORSE AND LOOKED OUT UPON THE RIVER The Young Kentuckians Series Raiding with Morgan BY Byron A Dunn Author of General Nelson s Scout On General Thomas s Staff Battling for Atlanta From Atlanta to the Sea Chicago A C McClurg company nineteen oh three COPYRIGHT BY A C MCCLURG company A D nineteen oh three PUBLISHED SEPT thirty nineteen oh three PREFACE General John H Morgan was one of the most picturesque figures in the Civil War an officer without a peer in his chosen line During the two years of his brilliant career he captured and paroled at least ten thousand Federal soldiers and kept three times that number in the rear of the Federal army guarding communications When we consider the millions of dollars worth of property he destroyed and how he paralyzed the movements of Buell we do not wonder that he was considered the scourge of the Army of the Cumberland General Morgan was a true Kentucky gentleman and possessed one of the kindest of hearts The thousands of persons captured by him almost invariably speak of the good treatment accorded them The following incident reveals more clearly than words his generous spirit In reporting a scout he says Stopped at a house where there was a sick Lincoln soldier who died that night No men being in the neighborhood his wife having no person to make a coffin or bury him I detailed some men who made a coffin The adventures of Calhoun as a secret agent of the Knights of the Golden Circle opens up a portion of the history of the Civil War which may be almost unknown to our younger readers During the war the whole North was honeycombed with secret societies whose members denounced Lincoln as a usurper and a bloody monster and maintained that the government had no right to coerce the South They resisted the draft encouraged desertions and embarrassed the Federal Government in every way possible In secret many of the leaders plotted armed rebellion the liberation of Confederate prisoners and the burning of Northern cities They held out inducements to the South to invade the North and there is but little doubt that Morgan was lured to his destruction by their representations Shortly after the close of the war the author met a gentleman who had served on the staff of General Breckinridge This officer affirmed that he carried a message from Breckinridge to Morgan saying that the former had positive information that forty thousand armed Knights stood ready to assist Morgan if he would invade Indiana Everything goes to show that Morgan relied on these reports and it was this belief that induced him to disobey the orders of General Bragg It is an interesting question whether General Breckinridge was really privy to the plans of the Knights and whether he secretly encouraged Morgan to disobey orders hoping that the appearance of a Confederate force in the North would lead to the overthrow of the Lincoln Government and the independence of the South The author has taken the ground that Breckinridge was fully cognizant of Morgan s intended move This volume mentions only the greatest of the General s raids and the author has tried to narrate them with historical accuracy as regards time place and circumstances In stating the number of his men his losses and the damage he inflicted on the Federals the General s own reports have been followed these as was to be expected differ widely in many cases from those of the Federal officers The tale of the exploits of Calhoun is substantially true though the hero himself is fictitious for every one of his most notable feats was accomplished by one or other of Morgan s men It was Lieutenant Eastin of Morgan s command who killed Colonel Halisy in single combat Calhoun s achievements in the escape from the Ohio Penitentiary were actually performed by two different persons a sharp dining room boy furnished the knives with which the prisoners dug their way to liberty Captain Thomas H Hines planned and carried to a successful termination the daring and ingenious escape Captain Hines fled with General Morgan and every adventure which befell Calhoun in The Flight to the South actually befell Captain Hines The Captain s marvellous story was published in the January number of The Century eighteen ninety one and to this narrative the author is indebted for the

4719_25765_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER I 
none	none	AFTER SHILOH The great battle of Shiloh had been fought and victory had been snatched from the hands of the Confederates by the opportune arrival of Buell s army The Southerners had lost their beloved commander slain a third of their number had fallen 
4719_25765_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Although defeated they had not been conquered 
4719_25765_000004_000002	train-clean-360	They had set forth from Corinth in the highest hopes fully expecting to drive Grant s army into the Tennessee River 
4719_25765_000004_000003	train-clean-360	This hope was almost realized when it suddenly perished twenty thousand fresh troops had arrived upon the field and the Confederates were forced to retreat 
4719_25765_000004_000004	train-clean-360	But they had fallen back unmolested for the Federal army had been too severely punished to think of pursuing 
none	none	Both armies were willing to rest and have their decimated ranks filled with fresh troops Of all the Southern troops engaged at Shiloh none felt their defeat more keenly than the Kentucky brigade under the command of Colonel Trabue 
4719_25765_000005_000001	train-clean-360	They had fought as only brave men can fight they left one third of their number on the field killed and wounded 
none	none	Defeat could not demoralize them and it fell to their lot to cover the retreat of Beauregard They had stood like a wall of adamant between their fleeing army and the victorious Federals 
4719_25765_000005_000004	train-clean-360	No charge could pierce that line of heroes 
4719_25765_000005_000005	train-clean-360	With faces to the foe they slowly fell back contesting every inch of ground 
none	none	Fondly had they hoped that Grant would first be crushed then Buell annihilated and their march to Nashville would be unopposed From Nashville it would be an easy matter to redeem their beloved Kentucky from the ruthless Northern invaders It was but a few days after the battle that there was a social gathering of Kentucky officers at the headquarters of General John C Breckinridge Conspicuous in that group of notable men was one whose insignia of office showed him to be only a captain But he was already a marked man He had greatly distinguished himself in Kentucky and Tennessee as a daring raider and scout and at the battle of Shiloh he had rendered invaluable service at the head of a squadron of independent cavalry It was but natural that in such a gathering the situation would be freely discussed
4719_25765_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 It looks to me said Breckinridge with a sigh that if we are forced to give up Corinth our cause in the West will be lost 
4719_25765_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I am in favor of holding Corinth to the last man 
4719_25765_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 What is your opinion Morgan asked one of the officers turning to the captain of whom we have spoken 
none	none	Thus addressed John H Morgan modestly answered The General will pardon me if I differ with him somewhat in his opinion Corinth should be held as long as that can be done with safety to the army But Corinth itself is of little value to us now that the railroad between here and Chattanooga is in the hands of the enemy It is not worth the sacrifice of a hundred men
4719_25765_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 What would you give up Corinth without a struggle asked the officer in surprise 
none	none	Not if a battle offered a reasonable hope of victory replied Morgan What I mean is that the place should not be held so long as to endanger the safety of the army 
4719_25765_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Corinth is nothing the army is everything 
4719_25766_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 nothing 
none	none	the army is everything
4719_25765_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you believe Captain that Corinth could be lost and our cause not greatly suffer 
4719_25765_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly 
none	none	The further the enemy advances into the South the more vulnerable he becomes Even now give me a thousand men and I can keep forty thousand of the enemy busy protecting their lines of communication Morgan you are joking exclaimed several of the officers
4719_25765_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 No joke about it 
none	none	I expect to see old Kentucky before many days and if I do there will be consternation in the ranks of the Yankees Do you think you can reach Kentucky with a thousand men asked Breckinridge in a tone which showed his doubt I shall make the attempt with less than half of that number replied Morgan coolly 
4719_25765_000019_000000	train-clean-360	A murmur of surprise arose and then Trabue asked Will Beauregard let you make the hazardous attempt 
4719_25766_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	with my own squadron but he will risk no more men in the venture
4719_25765_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Well good bye John if you try it said one of the officers laughing 
4719_25765_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Why good bye Colonel 
none	none	Because the Yankees will get you sure
4719_25765_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps answered Morgan dryly as he arose to go 
none	none	The whole South will ring with the praises of that man one of these days remarked Breckinridge after Morgan had made his exit
4719_25765_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 A perfect dare devil 
none	none	I am proud he is a Kentuckian remarked Trabue Not knowing the flattering words spoken of him Morgan wended his way to his headquarters where he was informed by the orderly who took his horse that a young Confederate officer had been waiting for some time to see him
4719_25765_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 He said he must see you continued the orderly and if necessary he would wait all night 
none	none	All right I will see what he wants replied Morgan as he turned and entered his headquarters There he was greeted by a young man not much more than a boy who wore the uniform of a Confederate lieutenant 
4719_25765_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Morgan gave him a swift glance and then exclaimed Bless my heart 
none	none	if this isn t Calhoun Pennington son of my old friend Judge Pennington I am more than glad to see you I have heard of some of your exploits and often wondered why you did not seek to take service with me 
4719_25765_000048_000003	train-clean-360	Let s see 
4719_25765_000030_000004	train-clean-360	Let s see You were on the staff of the late lamented Governor Johnson were you not 
4719_25765_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied Calhoun and his voice trembled and tears came into his eyes in spite of himself as he thought of the death of his beloved chief 
none	none	A grand man a brave man said Morgan gently
4719_25765_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Now that he has gone what do you propose doing 
4719_25765_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 That is what I have come to see you about 
none	none	General Beauregard has offered me a position on his staff but I wanted to see you before I accepted What a position on the staff of General Beauregard That is a rare honor for one so young as you are 
4719_25765_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Of course you are going to accept 
none	none	I do not know yet I am to give him an answer in the morning as I said I wanted to see you first Great as the honor is which has been offered me I feel it is a service which would not be agreeable to me I much prefer the freer life of a scout and ranger Perhaps you may know I have done much of this kind of work I have even performed more dangerous tasks than that of scouting and I confess I rather like it Morgan mused for a moment and then suddenly asked Are you not a cousin of Frederic Shackelford son of the late Colonel Richard Shackelford of our army 
4719_25765_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Calhoun s brow clouded 
4719_25765_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes he answered but why do you say the late Colonel Shackelford 
4719_25765_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Uncle Dick is not dead 
4719_25765_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that so 
4719_25765_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I am rejoiced to hear it 
none	none	It was reported he was among the slain
4719_25765_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 He was desperately wounded answered Calhoun but he did not die and he is now a prisoner in the hands of the Yankees 
none	none	Uncle Dick is a hero but as for that traitor cousin of mine I hate him and again Calhoun s brow grew dark I have no reason to love him laughed Morgan but I cannot help admiring him He it was who discovered our well laid plans and forced me to flee from Lexington as a thief in the night Aye answered Calhoun but for him and that brute Nelson Kentucky would now have been out of the Union 
4719_25765_000041_000001	train-clean-360	But that is not all 
none	none	Had it not been for the same two traitors there would have been a different story to tell of Shiloh Grant s army would now have been prisoners Buell s in full flight and our own pressing northward to redeem Kentucky Had there been no Nelson Buell s army would not have reached Grant in time to save him from destruction If there had been no Fred Shackelford I should have borne the news to General Johnston that Buell would join Grant by the fifth and Johnston would have made his attack a couple of days earlier I was bearing the news to Johnston that Nelson would reach Savannah by the fifth when I was captured
4719_25765_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Captured echoed Morgan in surprise 
none	none	Yes captured and by no less a personage than my cousin Fred Shackelford But for this I would have reached Johnston by the second as it was I did not reach Shiloh until the morning of the last day of the battle
4719_25765_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Then you escaped queried Morgan 
none	none	No my cousin let me go after he had held me until he knew my information would be of no value 
4719_25765_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I was dressed in citizen s clothes 
none	none	He could have had me hanged as a spy I suppose I ought to be thankful to him but I am not And Calhoun shuddered when he thought how near he had been to death one That was kind of him said Morgan and you ought to be thankful to him whether you are or not To tell the truth I took a great fancy to young Shackelford and tried hard to get him to cast his lot with me 
4719_25765_000046_000002	train-clean-360	But as I failed to get him I believe you would make a splendid substitute 
none	none	You still think you had rather go with me than be on Beauregard s staff
4719_25765_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 A thousand times yes 
none	none	I had rather go with you as a private than be a lieutenant on the General s staff answered Calhoun with vehemence 
4719_25765_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Morgan s eyes sparkled 
none	none	That is the finest compliment I ever had paid me he said but I cannot allow the son of my old friend Judge Pennington to serve in the ranks as a private soldier Yet my companies are fully officered now Let s see 
4719_25765_000048_000004	train-clean-360	How would you like to go back to Kentucky 
none	none	Go back to Kentucky asked Calhoun in surprise
4719_25765_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes to recruit for my command 
4719_25765_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Do you think you could dodge the Yankees 
4719_25765_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe I could 
4719_25765_000051_000001	train-clean-360	I could at least try answered Calhoun his face aglow with the idea 
none	none	The case is this said Morgan I am going to make a raid in a few days and am going to try to reach Kentucky 
4719_25765_000052_000001	train-clean-360	My present force is small not much over four hundred 
4719_25765_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I do not look for much help from the Confederate Government 
none	none	Those in authority do not regard with much favor independent organizations To augment my force I must in a great measure rely on my own efforts I know there are hundreds of the flower of Kentucky youths eager to join me if they had the opportunity You are just the person to send back to organize them 
4719_25765_000052_000007	train-clean-360	When can you start 
none	none	In the morning answered Calhoun Morgan smiled Good he said You are made of the right material We will make full arrangements to morrow 
4719_25765_000054_000004	train-clean-360	Good night now for it is getting late 
4719_25765_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Thus dismissed Calhoun went away with a light heart 
none	none	He was to be one of Morgan s men It was all he wished The next morning Calhoun informed General Beauregard that while sensible of the great honor which he would bestow on him by appointing him a member of his staff yet he believed he could be of more service to the South by casting his fortune with Morgan and he had concluded to do so While I greatly regret to lose you replied the General I believe you have chosen well To one of your temperament service with Morgan will be much more congenial than the duties of a staff officer In fact continued the General with a smile I think you resemble Morgan in being restive under orders and prefer to have your own way and go where you please A command or two of partisan rangers may do but too many would be fatal to the discipline of an army Morgan may do the enemy a great deal of mischief but after all the fate of the South must be decided by her great armies
4719_25765_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 True General replied Calhoun but if Morgan can keep thousands of the enemy in the rear guarding their communications the great armies of the North will be depleted by that number 
none	none	That is true also answered Beauregard and for that reason Morgan will be given more or less of a free rein 
4719_25765_000059_000001	train-clean-360	I have recommended him for a colonelcy 
none	none	Convey to him my regards and tell him I heartily congratulate him upon his last recruit General Beauregard s kind words touched Calhoun deeply
4719_25766_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you 
none	none	General he replied with feeling I trust I shall never prove myself unworthy of your good opinion 
4719_25765_000060_000003	train-clean-360	May God bless you and crown your efforts with victory 
none	none	After parting with Beauregard Calhoun lost no time in reporting to Morgan He found his chief in command of about four hundred men rough daring fellows who would follow their leader wherever he went A more superb body of rough riders was never formed Calhoun was introduced to the officers of the squadron and when it became known that he was going back to Kentucky to recruit for the command although many of the officers wondered why their chief had selected one so young they gave him a hearty welcome But when it became known that he was the son of Judge Pennington of Danville that he had already won renown as a daring scout and had been offered a position on the staff of General Beauregard their welcome was doubly enthusiastic To this welcome there was one exception One of Morgan s officers Captain P C Conway had applied to Morgan for permission to go back to Kentucky on this same duty and had been refused He was a short thickset red faced man with a very pompous air His weakness was liquor yet he was a brave efficient officer What he considered an affront was never forgiven for he was of a revengeful disposition It was consistent with his character that he should become a mortal enemy of Calhoun When he was introduced to Calhoun he merely bowed and did not offer to give his hand
4719_25765_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe I have heard of Captain Conway said Calhoun with a smile 
4719_25765_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 I have heard a cousin of mine speak of him 
none	none	Why yes spoke up Morgan with a twinkle in his eye Captain Lieutenant Pennington is a cousin of your particular friend Captain Fred Shackelford of the Yankee army 
4719_25765_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Conway fairly turned purple with rage 
none	none	Lieutenant Pennington has no reason to be proud of his relationship to that sneak and spy he snorted I have no more reason to love my cousin than you replied Calhoun with some warmth He may have played the spy so have I but sneak he is not and I would thank you not to use the term again traitor though he is to the South and his native state Conway glared at him for a moment but there was something in Calhoun s eye which told him that if he repeated the term it might cause trouble so he snapped Well spy and traitor if those terms suit you better but it may be of interest to you to know that I have sworn to see that precious cousin of yours hanged and with a fearful oath I will see that he is 
4719_25765_000070_000000	train-clean-360	With these words he turned on his heel and stalked away 
none	none	Shackelford s name has the same effect on Conway that a red rag has on a mad bull laughed Morgan
4719_25765_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 He can never forget that trick your cousin played on him 
none	none	Ah I remember said Calhoun Fred told me all about it Conway may take a dislike to me simply because I am Fred s cousin 
4719_25765_000072_000003	train-clean-360	I noticed that he greeted me rather coldly 
none	none	I reckon he will not carry his hatred so far as that replied Morgan yet it may be best not to mention Shackelford s name to him But Morgan might have changed his mind if he had heard Conway talking to a brother officer Just to think he fumed that the Captain picked on that young upstart to go back to Kentucky to recruit instead of one of us I volunteered to go yesterday and he put me down 
4719_25765_000075_000002	train-clean-360	To my mind Pennington is no better than that sneak of a cousin of his and Morgan will find it out some day 
4719_25765_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Better keep a still tongue in your head Conway dryly replied the officer a Captain Matthews to whom Conway was complaining 
none	none	Morgan will give you hell if he finds you are trying to create dissatisfaction I am not afraid of Morgan muttered Conway but he said no more In the mean time Calhoun was hurriedly making preparations for his journey Many of the officers and men were engaged in writing letters to send back by him to the dear ones in Kentucky Morgan intrusted to him several important communications to prominent Southern sympathizers 
4719_25765_000079_000000	train-clean-360	Just as Calhoun was ready to start Morgan gave him his secret instructions 
none	none	What I now tell you he said is too important to commit to writing You may be captured For hundreds of miles you must ride through a country swarming with Yankees You will need discretion as much or more than you will need courage 
4719_25765_000080_000003	train-clean-360	Much depends on your success 
none	none	I intend to make a raid north about the first week in May 
4719_25765_000080_000005	train-clean-360	If possible and I think it is I shall try to reach Kentucky 
none	none	My force when I start will not reach five hundred 
4719_25765_000080_000007	train-clean-360	If I could be joined by a thousand when I reach Kentucky I believe I could sweep clear to the Ohio River 
none	none	But with the short time at your disposal that will be impossible But join me at Glasgow with all you can 
4719_25765_000080_000010	train-clean-360	I expect to be in Glasgow by the tenth of May at the latest 
4719_25765_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 All right replied Calhoun I will try to meet you there at that time with at least one or two good companies 
none	none	Little did Morgan think at the time how badly he would need those companies At last all was ready and amid shouts of Good bye and Success to you Calhoun vaulted into the saddle and rode away eastward CHAPTER II THROUGH THE LINES 
4719_25766_000002_000000	train-clean-360	At the time Calhoun started for Kentucky General Halleck was concentrating his immense army at Pittsburg Landing preparatory to an attack on Corinth 
none	none	Federal gunboats patrolled the Tennessee River as far up as Eastport General Mitchell held the Memphis and Charleston Railroad between Decatur and Stevenson but between Corinth and Decatur there was no large body of Federals and the country was open to excursions of Confederate cavalry In Middle Tennessee every important place was held by detachments of Federal troops To attempt to ride through the lines was an exceedingly dangerous undertaking but that is what Calhoun had to do to reach Kentucky He expected to meet with little danger until he attempted to cross the lines of General Mitchell which extended along the railroads that ran from Nashville southward The country through which he had to pass was intensely Southern and the Yankee cavalry did not venture far from the railroads When Calhoun left Corinth he rode straight eastward until he reached Tuscumbia Alabama 
4719_25766_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Here he found little trouble in finding means to cross the Tennessee River 
none	none	Once across the river he took a northeast course which would take him through Rogersville Now and then he met small squads of Confederate cavalry They were scouting through the country and did not seem to be under very strict military discipline doing much as they pleased Now and then he came across a party of recruits making their way to the Confederate army at Corinth 
4719_25766_000004_000001	train-clean-360	They were mostly country boys rough uncouth and with little or no education 
none	none	They knew or cared little of the causes which had led up to the war but they knew that the Southland had been invaded that their homes were in danger and they made soldiers whose bravery and devotion excited the admiration of the world In order to find out what General Mitchell was doing and as nearly as he could to ascertain the number of his forces Calhoun resolved to ride as near the line of the Nashville and Decatur railroad as was prudent As he approached Rogersville he learned that the place had just been raided by a regiment of Yankee cavalry and the country was in a panic Approaching the place cautiously he was pleased to ascertain that the cavalry after committing numerous depredations had retreated to Athens He now learned for the first time of the atrocities which had been committed on the defenceless inhabitants of Athens and his blood boiled as he listened to the recital No wonder the citizens of Rogersville were in a panic fearing that their fate might be the same
4719_25766_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 The whelps and robbers he exclaimed how I should like to get at them But their time will come 
none	none	Never will the South lay down her arms until every Northern soldier is driven in or across the Ohio In Rogersville Calhoun met with a Doctor Jenkins who was especially well informed as to the strength and positions of the Federal army and as to the feelings of the citizens At first said he the result of the battle of Shiloh greatly discouraged us and the slaughter was horrifying But we are getting over that now and every true son of the South is more determined than ever to fight the war to the bitter end even if we see our homes in flames and the country laid waste How is it that Kentucky does not join hands with her sister states
4719_25766_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 She will she must cried Calhoun 
4719_25766_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Already thousands of her sons are flocking to the Southern standard 
none	none	It needs but a victory a Confederate army to enter her territory and the people will rise en masse There are not enough traitors or Yankees in the state to keep them down Do you think Beauregard can hold Corinth asked the Doctor
4719_25766_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 He can if any one can 
none	none	He is a great general answered Calhoun But Morgan thinks the loss of Corinth would not be fatal if the army were saved
4719_25766_000012_000003	train-clean-360	 Under no consideration says Morgan should Beauregard allow himself to be cooped up in Corinth 
4719_25766_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I reckon he is right sighed the Doctor but may the time never come when he will have to give it up 
none	none	Amen to that answered Calhoun From Rogersville Calhoun made his way north He ascertained that the railroad which Mitchell was engaged in repairing was not strongly guarded and he believed that with five hundred men Morgan could break it almost anywhere between Athens and Columbia 
4719_25766_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Near Mount Pleasant he met a Confederate officer with a party of recruits which he was taking south 
none	none	He sent back by him a statement to Morgan of all he had learned and added Taking everything into consideration I believe that Pulaski will be the best place for you to strike 
4719_25766_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I have no fears but that you can capture it even with your small force 
none	none	Calhoun met with his first serious adventure shortly after he had crossed the railroad which he did a few miles south of Columbia Thinking to make better time he took the main road leading to Shelbyville 
4719_25766_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He was discovered by a squad of Federal cavalry which immediately gave chase But he was mounted on a splendid horse one that he had brought with him from Kentucky 
none	none	He easily distanced all his pursuers with the exception of three or four and he was gradually drawing away from all of them except a lieutenant in command of the squad who seemed to be as well mounted as himself Illustration HE EASILY DISTANCED ALL HIS PURSUERS
4719_25766_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Only one muttered Calhoun looking back as a pistol ball whistled by his head I can settle him and he reached for a revolver in his holster 
none	none	As he did so his horse stepped into a hole and plunged heavily forward throwing Calhoun over his head For a moment he lay bruised and stunned and then staggered to his feet only to find the Federal officer upon him
4719_25766_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Surrender you Rebel cried the officer but quick as a flash Calhoun snatched a small revolver which he carried in his belt and fired 
none	none	Instead of hitting the officer the ball struck the horse fairly in the head and the animal fell dead Leaving the officer struggling to extricate himself from his fallen horse Calhoun scrambled over a fence and scurried across a small field beyond which was a wood 
4719_25766_000021_000002	train-clean-360	A scattering volley was fired by the foremost of the pursuers but it did no harm and Calhoun was soon across the field 
none	none	Mounting the fence on the other side he stood on the top rail and turning around he uttered a shout of defiance then jumping down disappeared in the wood The foremost of the Federals a tall lanky sergeant named Latham galloped to the side of his commander who was still struggling to extricate himself from his fallen horse Springing from his saddle he helped him to his feet and anxiously inquired Are you hurt Lieutenant The Rebel the Rebel where is he 
4719_25766_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Did you get him asked the Lieutenant 
none	none	Get him drawled the Sergeant I think not 
4719_25766_000024_000001	train-clean-360	He got across that field as if Old Nick was after him 
none	none	But once across he had the cheek to stand on the fence and crow like a young rooster 
4719_25766_000024_000003	train-clean-360	I took a crack at him but missed 
none	none	Why didn t you pursue him demanded the officer fiercely What in those woods Might as well look for a needle in a haymow But are you hurt Lieutenant
4719_25766_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 My leg is sprained he groaned but the worst of it is Jupiter is dead 
none	none	Curse that Rebel how I wish I had him 
4719_25766_000027_000002	train-clean-360	I would make him pay dearly for that horse 
none	none	Here is the Rebel s horse 
4719_25766_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I caught him exclaimed one of the men leading up Calhoun s horse which he had captured 
none	none	He looks like a mighty fine horse only he seems a little lame from his fall That is a fine horse said Latham looking him over but he has been rode mighty hard 
4719_25766_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Wonder who that feller can be 
none	none	I see no signs of any other Reb He must have been alone Say he was a Jim dandy whoever he was 
4719_25766_000029_000005	train-clean-360	I thought you had him sure Lieutenant 
none	none	So did I answered the Lieutenant with an oath When his horse threw him I had no idea he would try to get away and ordered him to surrender But quick as a flash he jerked a revolver from his belt and fired Better be thankful he hit the horse instead of you said the Sergeant For answer the Lieutenant limped to a stone and sitting down said Examine that roll behind the saddle of the horse Perhaps we can find out who the fellow was 
4719_25766_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Sergeant Latham took the roll which was securely strapped behind Calhoun s saddle and began to unroll it as carefully as if he suspected it might be loaded 
4719_25766_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 A fine rubber and a good woollen blanket remarked the Sergeant 
none	none	Looks mighty like those goods once belonged to our good Uncle Samuel 
4719_25766_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Bet your life they are a part of the plunder from Shiloh 
none	none	Ah here is a bundle of letters
4719_25766_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Give them to me said the Lieutenant 
none	none	The Sergeant handed them over and the officer hastily glanced over them reading the superscriptions Why he exclaimed in surprise these letters are all addressed to persons in Kentucky What could that fellow be doing with letters going to Kentucky 
4719_25766_000037_000002	train-clean-360	We will see He tore open one of the letters 
4719_25766_000038_000000	train-clean-360	He had read but a few lines when he exclaimed with a strong expletive Boys I would give a month s pay if we had captured that fellow 
4719_25766_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Who was he 
none	none	Who was he cried several soldiers in unison He was let me see and the Lieutenant tore open several more of the letters and rapidly scanned them yes these letters make it plain 
4719_25766_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He was a Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington and he was from the Rebel army at Corinth 
none	none	I take it he was on his way back to Kentucky to recruit for the command of a Captain John H Morgan 
4719_25766_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Morgan Morgan I have heard of that fellow before 
4719_25766_000040_000004	train-clean-360	He played the deuce with us in Kentucky last winter burned the railroad bridge over Bacon Creek captured trains tore up the railroad and played smash generally 
none	none	These letters all seem to be private ones written by the soldiers in Morgan s command to their relatives and friends back in Kentucky 
4719_25766_000040_000006	train-clean-360	But he may have carried important dispatches on his person 
4719_25766_000040_000007	train-clean-360	We let a rare prize slip through our fingers 
4719_25766_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t be helped now dryly remarked Sergeant Latham 
4719_25766_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 If you had captured him it might have put one bar if not two on your shoulder strap 
4719_25766_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The Lieutenant scowled but did not reply 
4719_25766_000042_000001	train-clean-360	All the letters were read and passed around 
none	none	Three or four of them occasioned much merriment for they were written by love lorn swains whom the cruel hand of war had torn from their sweethearts
4719_25766_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Golly 
none	none	it s a wonder them letters hadn t melted from the sweetness they contained remarked Sergeant Latham
4719_25766_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Or took fire from their warmth put in a boyish looking soldier 
none	none	Not half as warm as the letter I caught you writing to Polly Jones the other day laughed a comrade Boys I looked over his shoulder and read some of it 
4719_25766_000045_000002	train-clean-360	I tell you it was hot stuff 
4719_25766_000045_000003	train-clean-360	 My dearest Polly it commenced I 
none	none	But he never finished the sentence for the young soldier sprang and struck him a blow which rolled him in the dust
4719_25766_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 A fight a fight shouted the men and crowded around to see the fun 
4719_25766_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop that roared the Lieutenant or I will have you both bucked and gagged when we get to camp 
4719_25766_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Sergeant Latham see that both of those men are put on extra duty to night 
none	none	When things had quieted down others of the letters were read but some of them occasioned no merriment Instead one could see a rough blouse sleeve drawn across the eyes and a gulping down as if something choked the wearer These were letters written to the wives and mothers who were watching and waiting for their loved ones to return These letters reminded them of their own wives and mothers in the Northland waiting and praying for them Suddenly the Lieutenant spoke up Boys we have been wasting time over those letters That fellow was making his way back to Kentucky He has no horse What more natural than that he would try and obtain one at the first opportunity That old Rebel Osborne lives not more than a mile ahead You remember we visited him last week and threatened to arrest him if the railroad was tampered with any more 
4719_25766_000050_000006	train-clean-360	It was thought he sheltered these wandering bands of Confederates who make it dangerous to step outside the camp 
none	none	If we push on we may catch our bird at Osborne s If not it will at least give you a chance to see the pretty daughter remarked the Sergeant
4719_25766_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Shut up or I will have you reduced to the ranks growled the Lieutenant 
4719_25766_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The subject was rather a painful one to the Lieutenant for during his visit to the Osbornes the week before when he tried to make himself agreeable to the daughter the lady told him in very plain words what she thought of Yankees 
none	none	It s nearly noon too continued the Lieutenant after the interruption and that spring near the house is a splendid place to rest our horses and eat our dinners so fall in The Lieutenant slowly mounted Calhoun s horse for his fall had made him sore and in none the best of humor he gave the command Forward The plantation of mister Osborne was soon reached 
4719_25766_000055_000001	train-clean-360	It was a beautiful place The country had not yet been devastated by the cruel hand of war and the landscape rich with the growing crops lay glowing under the bright April sky 
none	none	The mansion house stood back from the road in a grove of noble native trees and the whole surroundings betokened a home of wealth and refinement 
4719_25766_000056_000000	train-clean-360	From underneath a rock near the house gushed forth a spring whose waters clear as crystal ran away in a rippling stream 
4719_25766_000056_000001	train-clean-360	It was near this spring that Lieutenant Haines for that was the officer s name halted his troops 
none	none	Better throw a guard around the house he said to Sergeant Latham for if that Rebel has found his way here he may make a sneak out the back way 
4719_25766_000057_000001	train-clean-360	After you get the guard posted we will search the house 
none	none	As the Sergeant was executing his orders mister Osborne came out of the house and approaching the troop to Lieutenant Haines s surprise gave him a cordial greeting I cannot say I am rejoiced to see you again he exclaimed with a smile except you come in peace 
4719_25766_000059_000001	train-clean-360	I trust that the telegraph wire has not been cut or the railroad torn up again 
none	none	Nothing of the kind has happened answered the Lieutenant Then I reckon I am in no danger of arrest and I trust you will take dinner with us It is nearly ready 
4719_25766_000062_000000	train-clean-360	The invitation nearly took away the Lieutenant s breath but he accepted it gladly 
none	none	As they were going toward the house mister Osborne remarked carelessly I see you have thrown a guard around the house 
4719_25766_000062_000002	train-clean-360	Are you afraid of an attack 
4719_25766_000062_000003	train-clean-360	I know of no body of Confederates in the vicinity 
4719_25766_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 The truth is replied Haines we ran into a lone Confederate about a mile from here 
4719_25766_000063_000001	train-clean-360	We captured his horse but he succeeded in escaping to the woods after killing my horse 
none	none	I did not know but he might have found refuge here and excuse me mister Osborne but I may be under the necessity of searching your house
4719_25766_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Do as you please replied mister Osborne coldly I have seen no such Confederate but if I had I should have concealed him if I could 
4719_25766_000064_000001	train-clean-360	But do not let this circumstance spoil our good nature or our dinner 
4719_25766_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Just then they met Sergeant Latham returning from posting the guard Sergeant you may withdraw the guard said the Lieutenant mister 
none	none	Osborne informs me he has not seen our runaway Confederate 
4719_25766_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The Sergeant turned back to carry out the order muttering Confederate Confederate 
none	none	The Lieutenant is getting mighty nice he generally says Rebel If Lieutenant Haines was surprised at the cordial greeting he had received from mister Osborne he was more than surprised at the reception he met from missus Osborne and especially the daughter Miss Clara Miss Osborne was a most beautiful girl about twenty years of age 
4719_25766_000068_000001	train-clean-360	No wonder Lieutenant Haines felt his heart beat faster when he looked upon her 
4719_25766_000068_000002	train-clean-360	When he met her the week before she treated him with the utmost disdain now she greeted him with a smile and said I trust you have not come to carry papa away in captivity 
4719_25766_000068_000003	train-clean-360	If not you are welcome 
none	none	Nothing of the sort this time I am happy to say exclaimed the Lieutenant with a bow and I hope I shall never be called upon to perform that disagreeable duty
4719_25766_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you she answered with a smile 
4719_25766_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 Now you must stay and take dinner with us while your men rest 
none	none	The Lieutenant tells me he met with quite a little adventure about a mile below here said mister Osborne Miss Osborne looked up inquiringly Before more could be said missus Osborne announced that dinner was ready and the Lieutenant sat down to a most sumptuous repast What was Lieutenant Haines s adventure you spoke of at length asked Miss Osborne of her father
4719_25766_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Better let the Lieutenant tell the story for I know nothing of it answered mister Osborne but he spoke of searching the house for a supposed concealed Confederate 
4719_25766_000075_000000	train-clean-360	As mister Osborne said this Miss Osborne gave a little gasp and turned pale but quickly recovering herself she turned a pair of inquiring eyes on the Lieutenant eyes that emitted flames of angry light and seemed to look him through and through 
4719_25766_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Lieutenant Haines turned very red 
none	none	Forgive me if I thought of such a thing he replied humbly
4719_25766_000076_000002	train-clean-360	 Your father has assured me he has neither seen nor concealed any Confederate officer and his word is good with me Make yourself easy 
none	none	I shall not insult you by searching the house A look as of relief came over the face of Miss Osborne as she answered I thank you very much I shall never say again there are no gentlemen among the Yankees But tell us of your adventure I thought I heard firing about an hour ago Was there any one hurt
4719_25766_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Only my poor horse he was killed answered Haines 
none	none	Ah in the days of knighthood to be unhorsed was to be defeated exclaimed Miss Osborne gayly
4719_25766_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 You must admit yourself vanquished 
none	none	Haines laughingly replied I am sorry to disappoint you but as I captured my enemy s horse and he fled on foot I cannot admit defeat Then your enemy was a solitary knight queried Miss Osborne
4719_25766_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but to all appearances a most gallant one 
none	none	Strange she mused who he could be and what he could be doing in this section 
4719_25766_000083_000001	train-clean-360	The place for true knights at this time is at Corinth 
4719_25766_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 From letters captured with his horse I take it he was from Corinth said Haines 
4719_25766_000084_000001	train-clean-360	 From those letters we learned that his name was Calhoun Pennington that he was a lieutenant in the command of Captain John H Morgan a gentleman who has given us considerable trouble and may give us more and that he was on his way back to Kentucky to recruit for Morgan s command 
none	none	You say you captured letters queried the girl
4719_25766_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes a whole package of them 
4719_25766_000086_000001	train-clean-360	They were from members of Morgan s command to their friends back in Kentucky 
none	none	The boys are having rare fun reading them I suppose it is according to military usages to read all communications captured from the enemy remarked Miss Osborne with a slight tinge of sarcasm in her tone but it seems sacrilege that these private letters should fall into profane hands
4719_25766_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Some of them were rich laughed Haines they were written by loving swains to their girls 
none	none	There were others written to wives and mothers which almost brought tears to our eyes they were so full of yearnings for home
4719_25766_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Lieutenant there was nothing in those letters of value to you from a military standpoint was there suddenly asked Miss Osborne 
none	none	Nothing Then I have a great boon to ask 
4719_25766_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Will you not give them to me 
4719_25766_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Miss Osborne what can you do with them asked Haines in surprise 
4719_25766_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 I can at least keep them sacred 
none	none	Perhaps I can find means of getting them to those for whom they are intended Think of those wives and mothers watching waiting for letters which will never come 
4719_25766_000093_000003	train-clean-360	Oh give them to me Lieutenant Haines and you will sleep the sweeter to night 
none	none	Your request is a strange one said the Lieutenant yet I can see no harm in granting it You can have the letters but the boys may have destroyed some of them by this time Thank you Oh thank you You will never regret your kindness 
4719_25766_000130_000001	train-clean-360	I shall remember it 
none	none	I only ask you to think better of Yankees Miss Osborne we are not all monsters Dinner was now over and Sergeant Latham came to report that the hour for the halt was up and to ask what were the Lieutenant s orders Have the troop ready and we will return to camp 
4719_25766_000098_000001	train-clean-360	I see nothing more we can accomplish here answered the Lieutenant 
4719_25766_000099_000000	train-clean-360	The Sergeant saluted and turned to go when the officer stopped him with Say Sergeant you can gather up all those letters we captured and send them up here with my horse 
none	none	Very well said the Sergeant but he muttered to himself as he returned Now I would like to know what the Lieutenant wants of those letters I bet he has let that girl pull the wool over his eyes In a few moments a soldier appeared leading the Lieutenant s horse 
4719_25766_000102_000000	train-clean-360	The family had accompanied Lieutenant Haines to the porch 
none	none	Stepping down to where his horse was he said to the soldier You may return and tell Sergeant Latham to move the troop 
4719_25766_000102_000002	train-clean-360	I will catch up with you in a few moments 
none	none	Did you bring the letters
4719_25766_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir answered the soldier saluting and handing the package to his commander 
4719_25766_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well you may go now 
none	none	Lieutenant Haines stood and watched the soldiers while his order was being obeyed for he did not wish to have any of his men see him give the package to Miss Osborne After his troop had moved off Haines placed the bridle of his horse in the hands of a waiting colored boy and returning to the porch where mister Osborne and the ladies still stood said That is the horse I captured from my foe He is a beauty isn t he Jupiter was a splendid horse but I do not think I lost anything by the exchange Here are the letters Miss Osborne you see I have kept my promise and he reached out the package to her But before she could take them they were snatched from Haines s hand and a stern voice said I will take the letters please Had a bombshell exploded at Lieutenant Haines s feet he would not have been more surprised and his surprise changed to consternation when he found himself looking into the muzzle of a revolver Lieutenant Haines was no coward but he was unarmed save his sword and there was no mistaking the look in Calhoun s eye It meant death if he attempted to draw his sword As for mister Osborne he seemed as much surprised as Lieutenant Haines Miss Osborne gave a little shriek and then cried
4719_25766_000109_000002	train-clean-360	 Oh how could you betray us and stood with clasped hands and with face as pale as death 
none	none	mister Osborne was the first to recover from his surprise I know not who you are he said but Lieutenant Haines is my guest and I will have no violence 
4719_25766_000110_000002	train-clean-360	Lower that weapon 
none	none	Without doing so Calhoun answered If I have done anything contrary to the wishes of those who have so kindly befriended me I am sorry but I could not withstand the temptation to claim my own As it is I will bid you good day Thus saying he dashed past them and snatching the bridle of his horse from the negro boy he vaulted into the saddle and was away at full speed For a moment not a word was spoken and then Lieutenant Haines turned on mister Osborne and said bitterly I congratulate you on the success of your plot I will not be fool enough again to take the word of a Southern gentleman 
4719_25766_000114_000000	train-clean-360	mister Osborne flushed deeply but before he could reply his daughter sprang in front of him and faced Lieutenant Haines with flashing eye 
none	none	I will not have my father accused of deception and falsehood she cried He knew nothing of that Confederate being concealed in the house 
4719_25766_000115_000001	train-clean-360	I alone am to blame and I told you nothing 
4719_25766_000115_000002	train-clean-360	I strove to entertain you and keep you from searching the house and I accomplished my purpose 
none	none	And you got those letters from me to give to him Yes 
4719_25766_000118_000000	train-clean-360	Lieutenant Haines groaned 
none	none	It may be some satisfaction to you he said to know that this may mean my undoing disgrace a dishonorable dismissal from the service I shall take no pleasure in your dishonor she exclaimed the color slowly mounting to her cheeks
4719_25766_000119_000001	train-clean-360	 I did not intend that Lieutenant Pennington should show himself 
none	none	It was his rashness that has brought all this trouble How can I return to camp without arms without a horse It would have been a kindness to me if your friend Lieutenant Pennington had put a bullet through my brain 
4719_25766_000121_000000	train-clean-360	mister Osborne now spoke 
none	none	Lieutenant Haines he said my daughter speaks the truth when she says I knew nothing of the Confederate officer being in my house Had I known it I should have tried to conceal him to protect him but I should not have invited you to be my guest 
4719_25766_000121_000003	train-clean-360	As my guest you are entitled to my protection and I shall make what reparation is in my power Then turning to the colored boy who had stood by with mouth and eyes wide open he said Tom go and saddle and bridle Starlight and bring him around for this gentleman 
none	none	Surely you do not intend to give me a horse mister Osborne said Haines As my guest I can do no less replied mister Osborne If Lieutenant Pennington had not taken his I should have let him have one to continue on his way to Kentucky 
4719_25766_000123_000002	train-clean-360	So you see after all I am out nothing 
none	none	Just then they were aroused by the sound of horses feet and looking up they saw Sergeant Latham accompanied by two soldiers coming on a gallop Riding up the Sergeant saluted and casting his sharp eyes around said Lieutenant excuse me but you were so long in joining us that I feared something an accident had befallen you so I came back to see Where in the world is your horse Lieutenant Coming answered his superior briskly for he had no notion of explaining just then what had happened When the colored boy came leading an entirely strange horse with citizen saddle and bridle on the Sergeant exchanged meaning glances with his companions but said nothing Mounting Lieutenant Haines bade the family good day and rode moodily away No sooner were they out of hearing than the Sergeant forgetting military discipline exclaimed What in blazes is up Lieutenant 
4719_25766_000127_000002	train-clean-360	I suspected something was wrong all the time 
none	none	That is what made you come back is it asked the Lieutenant Yes I did not march the command far before I halted and waited for you Pretty soon we heard the sound of a galloping horse and thought you were coming But when you didn t appear I became alarmed and concluded to ride back and see what was the matter
4719_25766_000130_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you Sergeant for your watchfulness 
none	none	I shall remember it Then as they rode along the Lieutenant told Latham his story And that pesky Reb was concealed in the house all the time was he asked Latham
4719_25766_000133_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes the girl worked it fine 
none	none	The Sergeant laughed long and loud And she coaxed the letters from you too Oh my Oh my And he nearly bent double Shut up you fool you growled Haines Say you must help me out of this scrape Trust me Lieutenant I will tell how brave you were and how you run the Rebel down and how you would have captured him if he hadn t shot your horse But look out after this how you let Southern girls fool you 
4719_25766_000137_000000	train-clean-360	The Lieutenant sighed 
none	none	She is the most beautiful creature I ever saw he murmured
4719_25766_000137_000002	train-clean-360	 Gods 
none	none	I shall never forget how she looked when she sprang in between me and that Pennington when he had his revolver levelled at my head Forget her was the sage advice of the Sergeant but the Lieutenant did not take it CHAPTER III RECRUITING IN KENTUCKY It did not take Calhoun long after he had plunged into the wood to ascertain that he was not pursued so he slackened his headlong pace then stopped that he might catch his breath Whew he panted here is a go Horse gone arms except this small revolver gone baggage gone letters gone Thank God the dispatches are safe and he tapped his breast where they lay hidden That is about as tight a place as I care to be in he continued as he began to work his way through the woods I call this blamed tough luck Here I am nearly three hundred miles from my destination A horse I must and will have and that quickly Surely the planters in this section are too loyal to the South not to let me have a horse when they know the predicament I am in I will try my luck at the very first opportunity If worse come to worst I will steal one that is I will confiscate one With this resolve he pushed rapidly on and after going a half mile or more he came out of the woods and beyond lay a fine plantation I wonder if those pesky Yankees will trouble me if I try to make that house he thought I will risk it anyway for if I can reach it it means a horse Making his way cautiously he soon reached the road in safety He listened intently but could hear nothing of the enemy but from the opposite direction there came the measured beat of a horse s hoofs Looking up he saw not a Yankee but a lady approaching at a swift gallop Calhoun s heart gave a great bound for he knew that no Southern woman would betray him and he stepped out from his place of concealment and stood in plain view by the side of the road When the rider saw him she gave a start of surprise and then reined in her horse with such ease and grace as to charm him He saw at a glance she was young and exceedingly beautiful Pardon me he exclaimed reaching for his hat and then he remembered he had none having lost it when his horse fell Excuse my appearance he laughed I find I have no hat to take off Probably some Yankee has it as a trophy by this time I am a Confederate officer in distress and as a daughter of the South I know I can appeal to you and not in vain You can she replied quickly I thought I heard firing and I rode down to see what it meant as I knew of no party of Confederates in the vicinity A company of Federal cavalry were firing at me answered Calhoun My horse fell and I had to run or be captured Were you all alone she queried Yes all alone Then I forgive you for running she answered with a ringing laugh otherwise I should not But how came you here and all alone In a few words Calhoun told her who he was and his business Come with me she cried quickly Let us gain the house before the Yankees come as no doubt they will Father will let you have a horse If no other be forthcoming I will give you my Firefly here although it would almost break my heart to part with him and she lovingly patted the neck of her gallant steed I sincerely hope such a sacrifice will never be called for replied Calhoun No sacrifice is too great to aid our beloved cause she answered but come we are losing time the Yankees may be here any moment If Lieutenant Haines had not stopped to read the captured letters Calhoun and his fair guide would not have reached the house undiscovered As it was they had hardly entered it when the Federals hove in sight There is that Yankee officer riding my horse exclaimed Calhoun How I should like to meet him alone They are going to stop gasped the girl They may search the house but they will not if I can outwit them Mother she said to an elderly lady who had just entered and was gazing at Calhoun in surprise take this officer upstairs and conceal him There is now no time for explanations The Yankees are in the yard The mother without a word motioned Calhoun to follow her and led him upstairs Hardly had they disappeared when her father entered There is that Lieutenant Haines and his company visiting us again he said with some anxiety I wonder what they want Father said the girl go and meet Lieutenant Haines use him nicely Invite him to dinner mister Osborne looked at his daughter in surprise I never expected to see the time you would want me to invite a Yankee officer to dinner he said Never mind now I will explain afterwards Go quick for I see he is throwing a guard around the house was her answer mister Osborne went wondering what had come over his daughter and was entirely successful in carrying out her scheme although it was unknown to him Before his return missus Osborne came downstairs her face denoting her anxiety Mother said the girl do not let father know we have any one concealed It will enable him to say truly he knows of no Confederate around And mother I have told him to invite the Federal commander it s that odious Lieutenant Haines to dinner Be nice to him Use him like a welcome honored guest We must disarm all suspicion and keep them from searching the house if possible We have seen how well her plan worked and how completely Lieutenant Haines was thrown off his guard Little did he think that while he was enjoying his dinner downstairs the Confederate officer who had escaped him was feasting like a king upstairs It soon became evident to Calhoun that there was no danger of the house being searched and from a window he observed all that was passing without When he saw the troop ride away and his own horse led up to the house for the Federal commander that spirit of recklessness for which he was noted came over him and without thinking of what the effect might be on those who had at great risk so kindly befriended him he resolved to try to capture his own With satisfaction he saw the last Yankee depart leaving the commander behind Now is my time he exclaimed exultingly and looking to see that his revolver was in perfect condition he crept softly downstairs and as has been noted was perfectly successful So sudden was his appearance so swift were his movements that the little company could only gaze after him in astonishment until he had disappeared For a few minutes Calhoun was hilarious over the success of his bold dash then came to him the thought that he had cruelly wronged the Osbornes in what he had done He suddenly checked his horse and then turned as if he would ride back hesitated then turned once more and rode on his way but more slowly It is too late now he sighed to himself to undo the wrong I may have done To think I may have brought trouble on the head of that glorious girl who even would give me her own horse It s the meanest trick you ever did Calhoun Pennington and it would serve you right if the Yankees captured you It was in no enviable frame of mind that Calhoun continued his journey It was not long before he noticed that his horse was lame The fall that he had had had evidently strained his shoulder Calhoun more bitterly than ever regretted that he had not restrained himself If he had he might now have been riding a good fresh horse given him by mister Osborne Serves me right he groaned Oh what a fool and not only a fool but a brute I have been That girl I can t help thinking that I may have got her into serious trouble A few miles more and his horse became so lame that Calhoun had to come down to a walk He dismounted with a ruthful face It s no use he said I shall have to leave him Where can I get another horse The opportunity came sooner than he expected He had dismounted in a wood a thick growth of cedars screening him from the observation of any one passing along the road Hearing the sound of an approaching horseman he crept to the side of the road and to his surprise saw a Federal officer approaching unattended He was riding leisurely along unsuspicious of danger and whistling merrily With Calhoun to think was to act Halt Surrender were the words which saluted the startled officer as Calhoun sprang into the road by his side and levelled a revolver at his breast The officer was a brave man and he reached for his revolver Touch that weapon and you are a dead man said Calhoun in a low firm voice Fool don t you see I have the drop on you The set features of the Federal relaxed he even smiled as he replied I guess you are right No use kicking What is your pleasure Dismount No on this side The officer did as he was bidden Calhoun took hold of the horse s bridle still keeping the man covered with his revolver Now continued Calhoun your name rank and regiment Mark Crawford Captain Company B th Ohio Cavalry was the answer Captain Crawford I am very happy to have met you As it may be a little inconvenient for you and me to travel together I ask you to give me your parole of honor that you will not bear arms against the Southern Confederacy until regularly exchanged May I be permitted to ask replied the Captain with a peculiar smile who it is that makes this demand Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Morgan s cavalry Well Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Morgan s cavalry you may go to the devil before I will give you my parole Calhoun was astounded at the reply I am afraid I shall have to shoot you he said Shoot an unarmed prisoner if you will was the fearless reply it would be an act worthy of a Rebel and traitor Lieutenant Pennington I am well aware you are alone that you cannot take me with you It would be an act of cowardice in me to give you my parole As Captain Crawford said this he folded his arms across his breast and looked Calhoun in the face without the quiver of a muscle Calhoun was filled with admiration at the bravery of the man Captain you are too brave a man to die a dog s death neither would I think of shooting a defenceless man I shall let you go but shall be under the necessity of borrowing your horse You will find mine in the bushes there badly crippled Good bye May we meet again Thus saying Calhoun sprang on the Captain s horse and dashed away Captain Crawford stood looking after him until he was out of sight May you have your wish my fine fellow he exclaimed I would ask nothing better than that we should meet again Both had their wish they met again not once but several times A brave fellow that said Calhoun to himself as he galloped away I would as soon have thought of shooting my brother He didn t bluff worth a cent The horse which Calhoun had captured was a good one and he rode him for many a day We will not follow Calhoun in all his adventures in his journey toward his destination in Kentucky Suffice it to say he met with numerous perils and made some narrow escapes but at last found himself near Danville There resided a few miles from Danville a rich planter named Ormsby Calhoun knew him as an ardent friend of the South one well versed in all secret attempts to take Kentucky out of the Union and one who kept well posted in everything which pertained to the welfare of the Confederacy and at Ormsby s he resolved to stop and lay his plans for the future He was received with open arms So you are from John Morgan said mister Ormsby and wish to recruit for his command You have come at an opportune time To morrow there is a secret meeting of prominent Confederates near Harrodsburg I am to attend You will meet a number there for whom you have letters Of course you will go with me Tired as he was Calhoun rode that night with mister Ormsby to be present at the meeting If he was to meet Morgan at Glasgow during the first days of May his time was short very short and what he should do had to be done quickly When he was introduced to those present as from Morgan and just from Corinth their enthusiasm knew no bounds He had to tell the story of Shiloh of the tragic death of Governor Johnson of the retreat but how the spirit of the Southern army was unbroken and that the South would not and could not be conquered To his delight Calhoun found that two companies of cavalry were nearly ready to take the field and it was unanimously agreed that they should cast their fortune with Morgan I believe that Morgan with a thousand men can ride clear to the Ohio River declared Calhoun It only remains for Kentuckians to rally to his standard and give him the support that he desires It was agreed that the companies should be filled as soon as possible and should go whenever Calhoun said the word Calhoun returned with mister Ormsby as he wished to enter Danville to visit his parents Disguised as a country boy with produce to sell he had no trouble in passing the pickets into town With a basket of eggs on his arm he knocked at the back door of his father s residence It was opened by Chloe the cook Want eny good fresh eggs asked Calhoun No go way wid ye yo po white trash snapped the old negro woman as she attempted to shut the door in his face Chloe The dish which she held in her hand went clattering to the floor Fo de land s sake she cried if it isn t Massa Calhoun De Lawd bress yo chile De Lawd bress you And she seized him and fairly dragged him into the house Hush Chloe not so loud Don t tell father I am here yet And Chloe don t whisper I am here to a soul If the Yankees found out I was here they might hang me Oh Lawd Oh Lawd hang youn Massa she cried Ole Chloe tell no one That s right Aunt Chloe Now bake those biscuits I see you are making in a hurry And make my favorite pie I want to eat one more meal of your cooking No one can cook like Aunt Chloe Yo shell hev a meal fit fo de king cried the old negress her face all aglow You must hurry Chloe for I can t stay long Now I will go and surprise father And surprise him he did The old Judge could hardly believe the seeming country boy was his son Where in the world did you come from he asked From Corinth answered Calhoun I am now back to recruit for Morgan So you have joined Morgan have you Yes Now that Governor Johnson is killed I know of no service I would like as well as to ride with Morgan You could have come home my son Father what do you mean Come home while the South is bleeding at every pore Come home like a craven while the contest is yet undecided I am wrong my son but it is so hard for you my only child to be in the army Oh that dreadful battle of Shiloh The agony the sleepless nights it has caused me Thank God you are yet safe Yes father and I trust that the hand of a kind Providence will still protect me But here is a letter from Morgan The Judge adjusted his spectacles and read the letter with much interest My son he said after he had finished it it is well you were not captured with such letters on your person It might have cost you your life Even now I tremble for your safety Does any one know you are in Danville Only Aunt Chloe and she is as true as steel Yet there is danger I know the house is under the closest surveillance The Federal authorities know I am an ardent friend of the South and they watch me continually Morgan says in his letter that he hopes it will not be long before he will be in Kentucky And mark my word cried Calhoun it will not be Before many weeks the name of Morgan will be on every tongue He will be the scourge of the Yankee army But father what of Uncle Dick and Fred Colonel Shackelford is at home minus a leg The Federal authorities have paroled him Fred is at home nursing him Your uncle won imperishable honors on the field of Shiloh What a pity he has such a son as Fred Calhoun s face clouded The remembrance of his last meeting with Fred still rankled in his breast I never want to see him again he said The Judge sighed Oh this war this war he exclaimed how it disrupts families You and Fred used to be the same as brothers I thought nothing could come in between you and him Calhoun he is a noble boy notwithstanding he is a traitor to his state and the South They say he is going to resign from the army for the sake of his father Won t you go and see him No brusquely answered Calhoun yet he felt in his heart he was wronging his cousin by his action Dinner was now announced by Aunt Chloe and it did her honest old heart good to see the way that Calhoun ate I jes believe dat air chile hab had nuthin to eat fo a week she declared I reckon I shall have to go now said Calhoun rising reluctantly from the table I have already made too long a visit for a country boy with eggs to sell I declare Aunt Chloe I do believe I should kill myself eating if I stayed any longer No danger of dat chile replied Aunt Chloe grinning The words of parting were few Do be careful my son said Judge Pennington his voice trembling with emotion God only knows whether I shall ever see you again or not As Calhoun started to leave a pair of sharp eyes was watching him Those eyes belonged to a pretty girl named Jennie Freeman The Freemans were Judge Pennington s nearest neighbors but mister Freeman was as strong a Union man as the Judge was a Secessionist Once the best of friends a coldness had sprung up between them since the opening of the war Jennie was two years older than Calhoun but they had been playmates from babyhood and were great friends Jennie called him her knight errant More than once he had carried a pair of black eyes in fighting her battles when some of the larger boys had teased her Jennie had seen the supposed country boy enter the kitchen of Judge Pennington and there was something in his walk and manner which attracted her attention If that isn t Cal Pennington I am a sinner she exclaimed to herself She was on the watch for him and when he remained so long she became more than ever convinced that her suspicions were correct At length the boy came out with his basket on his arm Hi there boy come here she called What have you to sell Calhoun paid no attention to her call but hurried on the faster I tell you boy you had better come here if you know when you are well off she called in a threatening voice Oh I know you Calhoun saw that he was discovered and that his best way was to try to make peace with her What do yer want he growled as he walked toward her I hev nuthin to sell all sold out Well I never said the girl as Calhoun came up Do you think I don t know you Cal Pennington A pretty figure you cut in those old clothes and with that basket What in the world are you doing here Hush Jennie not so loud If discovered I might be hanged said Calhoun in a low voice Yankees don t hang traitors they ought to replied the girl with a toss of her head But don t you see I am in disguise I might be taken as a spy What are you but one I ought to inform on you at once Jennie you wouldn t do that I am only here to see father and mother I had to come in disguise or I might be taken prisoner by the Yankees And you are not here to spy You know there are many rumors afloat asked the girl Just here to visit father and mother Can you blame me Jennie As Calhoun said this his heart smote him for while it was true he was in Danville for the purpose of visiting his parents his mission to Kentucky was for an entirely different object Now Jennie you won t tell on me will you he continued in a coaxing tone No if you behave yourself but don t let me hear of any of your capers answered the girl You won t Jennie Good bye I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days Jennie stood looking after him until he disappeared then shaking her head she went into the house saying I couldn t inform on him if he is a Rebel The next few days were busy ones for Calhoun He visited Nicholasville Lexington Harrodsburg had interviews with a large number of prominent Secessionists found out as near as possible the number of Federal troops garrisoning the different towns in fact gathered information of the utmost value to Morgan if he should ever raid Kentucky But all these things could not be done without rumors reaching the Federal authorities It was known that the Southern element was extremely active that recruiting for the Confederate army was going on and at last the name of Calhoun Pennington was mentioned Some one who knew him well declared that he had seen him and it was common report he was back recruiting for Morgan s command The Federal commander at Danville was ordered to keep a close watch on the house of Judge Pennington to see if it was not visited by his son It was on the evening of May twod and Calhoun was in Lexington when he was startled by hearing the news boys crying Pulaski Tennessee captured by John Morgan He is headed north closely pursued by the Federal forces Then Morgan had commenced his raid There was no time to be lost That night the next day and the next night horsemen could be seen galloping furiously along unfrequented roads throughout central Kentucky The word was Meet at the rendezvous near Harrodsburg Three days afterwards two hundred of the best the bravest and the noblest youths of Kentucky were ready to march to join Morgan Each one of them had provided his own outfit They asked no pay to fight for their beloved South Before going Calhoun determined to pay his father one more visit although he knew it was dangerous to do so Concealing his horse in a thicket outside the limits of the city he waited until dark then stole across fields and through alleys home No sooner did the Judge see him than he cried Calhoun Calhoun what have you done Do you know they are on the watch for you I had to see you once more before I went answered Calhoun I was careful and I do not think any one saw me come I have some things of importance to tell you Father and son talked together for some five minutes in low confidential tones when they were interrupted by Jennie Freeman bursting unannounced into the room and crying Run Cal run the soldiers are coming They are most here And before either could say a word she was out again like a flash Who would have thought it of that Abolitionist Freeman s daughter gasped the Judge Fly my boy fly and may God protect you Calhoun knew his danger Grasping his trusty revolver he cried Good bye all and ran through the house to pass out by the back way Just as he reached the door it was opened and he fairly rushed into the arms of a soldier who was entering So surprised were both that they could only stare at each other for a brief second but Calhoun recovered himself first and dealt the soldier a terrific blow over the head with the butt of his revolver The soldier sank down with a moan and Calhoun sprang out over his prostrate body only to meet and overturn another soldier who was just ascending the steps The force of the collision threw him headlong but he was up again in a twinkling and disappeared in the darkness followed by a few ineffectual shots by the baffled Federals Judge Pennington heard the firing and groaned My son oh my son The firing had alarmed the neighborhood and there were many pale faces for the people knew not what it meant A short time afterwards a Federal officer arrested Judge Pennington and he was dragged off to jail But he did not think of himself My son he asked was he captured was he hurt I think the devil protected his own roughly replied the officer but we will attend to you for harboring Rebels Judge Pennington lay in jail among criminals not only that night but for nearly a week There was talk of sending him to a Northern prison as a dangerous man But Fred Shackelford heard of his arrest and his probable fate and came in and had a stormy interview with the Federal commander He showed that Judge Pennington had committed no overt act that his son who was a Confederate soldier had simply come to visit him and had resisted capture as any soldier had a right to do As Fred threatened to report the case to the commander of the Department the Judge was released Jennie Freeman had many qualms of conscience over what she had done But Judge Pennington kept her secret well telling only Fred and when he congratulated Jennie over her act she felt relieved for young Shackelford was not only known as a favorite of General Nelson but as one of the most daring and successful of Union scouts Calhoun met with no more adventures He had no trouble in finding his way to his horse and he lost no time in joining his comrades Boys John Morgan told me to meet him at Glasgow he cried and two hundred voices answered with a loud Hurrah we will do it Little did Calhoun or they think that at that very time John Morgan his forces defeated and scattered was fleeing before the enemy But like them he had set his face toward Glasgow CHAPTER IV MORGAN S FIRST RAID All through the month of April General Halleck had been concentrating the mighty armies of almost the entire West for the purpose of crushing Beauregard at Corinth For a month the two armies lay but a few miles apart almost daily skirmishes taking place between the outposts During the month General O M Mitchell had overrun Middle Tennessee and was holding the Memphis and Charleston railroad from Decatur to Bridgeport Alabama Two railroads led south from Nashville Tennessee both connecting with the Memphis and Charleston Railroad one at Decatur and the other at Stevenson Alabama Both of these roads were of vital importance to General Mitchell for on them he depended for transportation for the sustenance of his army These roads had been badly damaged by the Confederate army when it retreated from Nashville and General Mitchell was busily engaged in repairing them If repaired and held it meant that Chattanooga must fall and the Confederate army be driven still farther south John H Morgan now promoted to a colonelcy believed that with a small force the rear of the Federal army could be raided the railroads cut bridges burned and their communications so destroyed that they would be forced to fall back General Beauregard was not so sanguine While great damage might be done and the Federal army subjected to much inconvenience the contest after all would have to be decided by the great armies Then he needed every man as Halleck was about to move At last he gave Morgan permission to make his raid but with a force not to exceed five hundred It was in the last days of April that Morgan started with his little force on what seemed to many certain destruction But every man in the command was full of enthusiasm They had unlimited faith in their leader and where he went they would follow Following almost the exact route taken by Calhoun Morgan s first blow fell on Pulaski Tennessee So swift and unexpected had been his movements that the Federals were taken completely by surprise The place was surrendered without a struggle Moving rapidly north the command attacked and without any loss captured a wagon train en route from Columbia to Athens Thus at the very commencement of his raid Morgan captured Pulaski with all its military stores a wagon train and some two hundred and seventy prisoners and this without the loss of a man Among the prisoners captured were a son of General O M Mitchell and our old acquaintance Lieutenant Haines The prisoners were all paroled and were astonished at the kind treatment they received Both Captain Jumper who was in charge of the wagon train and the son of General Mitchell were loud in their praise of the way they were used by Morgan After destroying all the Federal property captured and damaging the railroad as much as possible the command continued on their raid their route taking them by the plantation of mister Osborne The welcome they received there was a royal one Colonel Morgan stopped and took dinner with the family Here he heard of the adventure of Calhoun and he laughed long and heartily over the way Calhoun had recovered his horse Tell him said Miss Osborne that I forgive him his abrupt leaving as no harm came to father By the way Lieutenant Haines has become quite friendly coming out to see us two or three times No one can blame him even if you give him but a moment of your company replied Morgan gallantly But Miss Osborne I am sorry to say we took your friend prisoner He was paroled and no doubt is now on his way North Miss Osborne blushed and then said A good riddance I trust I shall never see him again But he was kind to papa He even returned the horse would not keep him That is lucky responded Morgan for if he hadn t been returned one of my men would be riding him now and your chance of getting him would be small From Pulaski Morgan pushed northeast avoiding Shelbyville and Murfreesboro both of these places being too strongly garrisoned for him to attack with his small force He crossed the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad ten miles north of Murfreesboro burned the depot and destroyed as much of the track as his limited time would admit From there he rode straight for Lebanon Tennessee which place he reached just at nightfall The inhabitants received him with the wildest demonstration of joy But trouble was in store for him His men wearied with their long ride and elated over their continued success became careless They knew they were among friends and thought that no harm could come to them so they slept without fear The Federal authorities had become thoroughly alarmed over his progress Strong bodies of troops were in swift pursuit from Shelbyville from Murfreesboro and from Nashville Just before daylight the Federals charged into the little city with whoop and hurrah Taken entirely by surprise Morgan s men thought only of flight Two companies under the command of Colonel Robert C Wood being cut off from their horses threw themselves into a college building in the outskirts of the city and for three hours defended themselves with desperation At last being out of ammunition they were forced to surrender In this unfortunate affair Morgan lost nearly two hundred of his best troops The rest were more or less scattered He himself was chased for eighteen miles and the pursuit ceased only when he with the remnant of his troops had crossed the Cumberland The Federals thought they had thoroughly whipped Morgan and he would give them no more trouble But they did not know the man He had started for Kentucky and to Kentucky he would go After crossing the Cumberland he halted gathered his scattered command together and then with less than three hundred men started for Glasgow Lieutenant Pennington will meet us at Glasgow with reinforcements he told his men But there were some of his officers who had misgivings Chief among these was Captain Conway Speaking to another officer a Captain Mathews Conway said It s strange that the Colonel has such confidence in that young upstart As for me I look for no reinforcements The best thing we can do is to get back as soon as possible Captain what is the matter asked Mathews What has that young fellow done that you have taken such a dislike to him Nothing but the idea of sending a mere boy on such an important mission Why did he not send some one back with influence Pennington is well connected you know his father is Judge Pennington of Danville That makes little difference His mission will be a failure see if it isn t We shall see no reinforcements at Glasgow Just then Morgan came riding along and seeing Conway said Captain I want to thank you for the gallant manner in which you held back the enemy while the command crossed the Cumberland You did nobly This praise so pleased Conway that for a time he forgot his supposed grievance Without further trouble from the Federals the little command reached Glasgow where they were received with open arms by the inhabitants Houses were thrown open to them and food provided in abundance But nothing had been heard of any reinforcements What did I tell you said Conway to Mathews Wait was the answer The night was an anxious one Morning came but still nothing was heard of any reinforcements We will wait another day said Morgan About noon cheering was heard and Morgan s men nearly went wild with enthusiasm as nearly two hundred splendidly mounted men came galloping into camp When the captain in command reported Morgan thanked him in the warmest terms and then looking eagerly around said Where is Lieutenant Pennington I do not see him Lieutenant Pennington answered the Captain asked leave to take twenty men and scout toward Cave City I gave him permission to do so He has an idea that the railroad might be reached and broken at that point Ah I have thought so myself replied Morgan I shall wait for his report with interest The arrival of the two fresh companies had raised the command to as large or larger than it was when it started from Corinth and every man was eager to go on It was nearly night when Calhoun reported with his little company He was jubilant over what he had discovered Colonel he said we can easily capture Cave City and thus sever the connection between Louisville and Nashville The place is lightly guarded Oh If we could only take the place and capture the train on which my gallant men taken prisoners at Lebanon are being taken North I should be supremely happy said Morgan with much feeling Perhaps we can replied Calhoun with enthusiasm How about going farther north than Cave City asked Morgan Calhoun shook his head It will not do he replied all the towns are too strongly held for your small force to cope with At least we can try Cave City answered Morgan and orders were given for the command to be ready to march at sundown The vicinity of Cave City was reached about two o clock in the morning The column was halted and the men were ordered to rest until daylight As soon as it was light Calhoun with a soldier named Emory was sent in advance to the place They were disguised as countrymen and were to linger around the depot and when the charge came they were to prevent the telegraph operator from sending warning of the raid Dressed in homespun clothes and riding sorry steeds Calhoun and Emory played their part to perfection Their entrance into the little place caused no comment and excited no suspicion Sauntering into the depot they gazed curiously around Illustration SAUNTERING INTO THE DEPOT THEY GAZED CURIOUSLY AROUND What s that asked Calhoun pointing at the clicking telegraph instrument That my boy said the operator patronizingly is a telegraphic instrument Did you never see one before No What makes it tick Lightning my son lightning that s a lightning catcher Calhoun opened his eyes in wonder Jes heah that he said to Emory What is it fer he continued turning his attention to the operator once more To send messages replied the operator amused at the ignorance displayed With this little instrument I can talk with any one at Louisville or Nashville What s yo uns givin we uns drawled Calhoun Do yo take we uns fo a fule A guard who stood idly by laughed long and loud A fine specimen of Southern chivalry he chuckled Just then there came the sound of cheering pistol shots and the clatter of horses hoofs mingled with affrighted cries By heavens the town is being raided shouted the operator as he sprang to his instrument Stop thundered Calhoun Touch that instrument and you are a dead man The operator looked up amazed only to find himself covered with a revolver The guard at the same time was looking into the muzzle of a weapon held by Emory Drop that gun said Emory to the trembling man The gun went clanging to the floor You two stand there in the corner with your hands above your heads commanded Calhoun The operator and the guard obeyed with alacrity Keep them covered with your revolver Emory continued Calhoun while I see what I can find Think I will pocket these dispatches first they may be of use Just then he glanced out of the window and saw four or five soldiers running toward the depot There might be more following Giving the telegraphic instrument a kick which sent it flying he started to leave in a hurry Then noticing the blanched faces of the soldiers as they came rushing into the depot he called out No use running Emory we can take the whole crowd prisoners green as we look And they did There was no fight in the frightened men When the excitement was over Calhoun looked over the dispatches which he had captured and found that a passenger train was due from the south in half an hour and that it had orders to wait at Cave City for a freight train to pass coming from the north This was good news and Morgan s men waited in glee for the approaching trains At the appointed time the passenger train came rolling in The reception it received astonished every one on board To Colonel Morgan s great disappointment his men captured at Lebanon were not on the train but there were a great many Federal soldiers principally officers aboard on their way North A few of these at first made some show of resistance but when they saw how hopeless their case was they sullenly submitted to their fate It was not long before the freight train came slowly puffing in It was an immense train of forty five cars heavily loaded with rations clothing and munitions of war for Buell s army Morgan s men freely helped themselves from the rich stores to everything that they needed and could carry and then the work of destruction began The torch was applied and soon the two trains were wrapped in flames The prisoners who had gloomily watched the work of destruction were now lined up and told that they would be released upon their giving their parole This they gladly consented to do It fell to Calhoun to take a list of their names with rank and regiment Don t see why I should be asked to give another parole growled a lieutenant I gave you fellows one at Pulaski a short time since and was on my way home now to stay until I am exchanged How often do you want to take a fellow prisoner anyway Calhoun glanced up much amused The officer started stared at him a moment and then abruptly asked Is your name Pennington It is Lieutenant Pennington if you please You and I have met before Ah I know you now I wish to thank you for I am told you did not visit your wrath on the Osbornes on account of my abrupt leave taking No the girl had concealed you in the house unbeknown to the old gentleman and as he had assured me there were no Confederates about he felt real cut up about it He actually proffered me another horse in the place of the one you took Said I was his guest and should not suffer Just like an old fashioned Southern gentleman the very personification of honesty replied Calhoun It may interest you Lieutenant to know that recovering my horse did me little good for he went so lame I had to leave him And took mine in his place spoke up a fine looking Federal officer who stood near and whose name Calhoun had not yet taken Captain Crawford as I live exclaimed Calhoun extending his hand Captain I want to give you my sincere thanks That was a fine horse you loaned me Must have Kentucky blood in him I am riding him yet How about your parole Captain You know you absolutely refused to give it to me I have changed my mind Ah that is good If you refused this time we might be obliged to take you along with us and that might not be agreeable to you As the Captain gave his parole he said This is the second time we have met There may be a third meeting and it may be my time Au revoir gayly replied Calhoun Little did he think then of their next meeting and what it would mean to him The prisoners all being paroled and the work of destruction complete Morgan s command returned to Glasgow loaded with booty The capture of the trains and the breaking of the railroad at Cave City caused the greatest excitement throughout the Federal army It showed the Federal authorities how weak their line of communication was Although so much depended on Morgan s capture he was left for some days almost unmolested He made a demonstration toward Lebanon captured a number of prisoners and then when the combination against him grew too strong to be resisted he withdrew at his leisure and at length found rest for his command at Chattanooga CHAPTER V MORGAN S FIRST GREAT RAID The struggle for the possession of Corinth was ended General Halleck with his immense army of one hundred and twenty five thousand men had thought to reduce the place by regular siege and force General Beauregard to capitulate surrendering himself with his whole army But Beauregard was too able a general to be caught in a trap For a month he held the Federal army at bay and then when Halleck was about to spring his trap Beauregard silently withdrew leaving to him but a barren victory The Confederate army was saved and to the Federal forces the occupation of Corinth proved as demoralizing as a defeat The result showed that John Morgan was right when he said that the hope of the South rested not on the occupancy of any single place but on the safety of its armies The fall of Corinth at once changed the theatre of war The Federal army was divided the Army of the Tennessee under Grant remaining in Mississippi and Western Tennessee and the Army of the Ohio under Buell being ordered to march east and capture Chattanooga If Buell had acted promptly and swiftly he might have been successful and the death blow would have been given to the Confederacy long before it was But he moved slowly and haltingly and the golden opportunity was lost It gave the Confederacy time to transfer to Chattanooga the larger part of the army which had been at Corinth The command of this army was given to General Braxton Bragg a brave man and by many thought to be one of the ablest generals of the South It at once became the dream of General Bragg to gather as large an army as possible then march northward clear to the Ohio River sweeping everything before him This dream came near being realized It was made possible by the efforts and deeds of two men General John H Morgan and General N B Forrest These two great raiders and leaders of cavalry nearly turned the scale in favor of the Confederacy They raided the rear of the Federal army tore up railroads destroyed millions of dollars worth of property and captured thousands of prisoners They ran General Buell nearly distracted and caused him not to know which way to turn They made it possible for General Bragg to reach Kentucky unopposed and if after reaching Kentucky General Bragg had proved as able a leader of infantry as Morgan was of cavalry Buell s army would have been destroyed While Bragg was organizing his army at Chattanooga another Confederate army was being organized at Knoxville under General E Kirby Smith this army was to invade Kentucky by way of East Tennessee while General Bragg was to invade by way of Middle Tennessee Once in Kentucky the two armies were to unite This programme was successfully carried out and yet the whole movement was a failure as far as the occupancy of Kentucky was concerned After the fall of Corinth Colonel Morgan rendezvoused his little force at Chattanooga From Chattanooga he proceeded to Knoxville where he at once began the preparations for another raid As Cumberland Gap was held by the Federals Colonel Morgan decided to cross over into Middle Tennessee before invading Kentucky His command consisted of about nine hundred men made up of two regiments and two independent companies His own regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Basil Duke All through Morgan s career Colonel Duke was his chief adviser so much so that many claim that Morgan s success was mainly due to Colonel Duke Why don t some one shoot Basil Duke through the head and blow out John Morgan s brains exclaimed a disgusted Federal officer after a fruitless effort to catch Morgan But the officer was mistaken both had brains Like Grant and Sherman they worked hand in hand and one needed the other Together they were invincible Before leaving Knoxville Morgan picked out twenty five men mounted on the best and fleetest horses and placed them in the command of Calhoun Pennington They were to be the scouts of the command and well did they do their duty More than once did they save Morgan from heavy loss by ascertaining the movements of the enemy Morgan left Knoxville July fourth His route lay directly west over the Cumberland Mountains to Sparta a distance of one hundred and four miles This in spite of the rough roads he made in three days Many of the mountaineers of East Tennessee clung to the Union and much of the way he had to ride through almost as hostile a country as if raiding through the North The utmost vigilance had to be used and Calhoun with his scouts was kept well in front to see that the road was clear On the second day s march there was the crack of a rifle from a mountainside and one of the scouts tumbled from his horse dead A little cloud of smoke up the mountain showed from where the shot was fired With a cry of rage the scouts sent a volley where the little cloud was seen then springing from their horses clambered up the mountain to hunt down the murderer but their search was fruitless About a mile beyond where the shooting took place they came to a rough log cabin surrounded by a few acres of comparatively smooth ground A small patch of corn and potatoes was growing near the cabin and an old man with tangled gray hair and beard was hoeing in the field An old woman sat in the door calmly smoking a corn cob pipe Neither seemed to notice the soldiers as they came riding up You man come here sternly called Calhoun The mountaineer deliberately laid down his hoe and slowly came to where Calhoun was He seemed to be in no hurry nor did he appear to be disturbed What is your name demanded Calhoun Nichols Jim Nichols drawled the man Are you well acquainted around here demanded Calhoun Hev lived heah goin on twenty years was the answer We have just had a man shot by one of you skulking mountaineers Do you know of any one likely to do such a deed Tell the truth or it will be the worse for you The old man shook his head The men be all gone in one army or de other he answered Are you Union or Confederate asked Calhoun The wah is nuthin to we uns he drawled we uns own no niggers That s no answer fiercely replied Calhoun I have a mind to hang you up like a dog A little stretching of the neck might loosen your tongue At the word hang a strange look came into the old man s eyes a look as of mortal hatred but it was gone in a moment and the drawling answer came We uns knows nuthin thar may be strange men hidin in the mountin We uns don t know Have you a family A gal Where is she Done gone over the mountin to see the Jimson gals You have no son At the word son again that deadly glint came in the old man s eye Again it was gone in a moment and the answer came No The cabin was searched the mountaineer and his wife apparently perfectly unconcerned as to what was going on but nothing suspicious was found and Calhoun had to confess himself baffled But after Morgan s column had passed a tall lank girl with unkempt hair might have been seen coming down the mountainside carrying a long rifle in her hand Swiftly and surely as a deer she leaped from rock to rock and soon neared the cabin Carefully concealing her rifle beneath a huge rock she came slowly up to the door of the cabin where the old man sat smoking He looked up at her inquiringly but did not say a word We uns got one dad she said as she passed in Not another word was spoken but the old man sat and smoked and watched the sun as it slowly sunk to rest behind the mountain If Calhoun had known that Nichol s only son had been hanged the winter before by the Confederate authorities for bridge burning and that his sister had sworn revenge he would not have been at a loss as to who had fired the deadly shot for every mountain girl can use a rifle From Sparta Morgan made a rapid march to Selina where he forded the Cumberland River At Selina he learned that there was a Federal force at Tompkinsville which is just over the line in Kentucky By a swift advance he hoped to surprise and capture this force As the command crossed the line from Tennessee into Kentucky the enthusiasm of the men knew no bounds They sang My Old Kentucky Home and cheered again and again Tompkinsville was reached at five o clock on the morning of the ninth of July The Federals under the command of Major Thomas J Jordan of the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry though surprised made a stand and the battle at once opened But a few shots from Morgan s mountain howitzers utterly demoralized the Federals and they fled in confusion Major Jordan after retreating about a mile succeeded in rallying about seventy five of his men and made a stand to cover the retreat of his force Calhoun with some fifteen of his scouts far in advance of the main column charged down on them without hesitating a moment The Federals although they outnumbered the scouts five to one were ridden down and throwing down their arms they cried for mercy In this fight the gallant Colonel Hunt was mortally wounded He was one of Morgan s best officers and his loss was deeply mourned From Tompkinsville Morgan moved to Glasgow arriving there at one o clock in the morning The Federal garrison had heard of his approach and had fled leaving everything behind them A large quantity of military stores fell into Morgan s hands and was destroyed Although it was in the middle of the night the glad news spread through the town and the citizens were hailing each other with the glad shout Morgan has come again Morgan has come again Soon from every house lights were flashing and every woman was engaged in cooking When morning came not only a steaming hot breakfast of the best that the place afforded was set before the men but three days cooked rations were given each man At Glasgow Morgan gave out that he was again to raid the Louisville and Nashville Railroad In order to carry out the deception when he left Glasgow he followed the road which would lead him to strike the railroad in between Woodsonville and Mumfordsville but when he was within a few miles of the road he halted his command and taking only Calhoun and his scouts he struck the road at a lonely place a short distance from Horse Cove Here he had his telegraph operator a sharp young fellow named Ellsworth attach his private instrument to the telegraph wire and for two hours Ellsworth in the midst of a driving storm and standing in water up to his knees took every message that passed over the wire It was rare fun to hear the Federal officers telling all their secrets and revealing the terror they were in over Morgan s raid After listening to their plans of how they would try to capture him Morgan had Ellsworth send the following dispatch to the provost marshal at Louisville Nashville Tenn July ten eighteen sixty two General Forrest commanding brigade attacked Murfreesboro routing our forces and is now moving on Nashville Morgan is reported to be between Scottsville and Gallatin and will act in concert with Forrest it is believed Inform general commanding STANLEY MATHEWS Provost Marshal Morgan sent this dispatch to lead the Federal authorities to believe that he was returning from Kentucky But the strange part of it is that Forrest did on that very day attack and capture Murfreesboro and of this fact Morgan was entirely ignorant Leaving the telegraph and railroad intact so as to have the Federals remain in ignorance of what he had done and where he was Morgan rejoined his command and set out for Lebanon a ride of over forty miles The place fell almost without struggle Dashing in at the head of his scouts Calhoun took possession of the telegraph office This was at three o clock in the morning Unsuspicious of danger the regular telegraph operator was at home asleep and Ellsworth was once more installed at the instrument It seemed that the day before Colonel Johnson commanding the place had telegraphed for reinforcements saying he feared an attack The first dispatch that Ellsworth received was What news Any more skirmishing To which Ellsworth answered No we drove what few cavalry there were away The next was Has the train arrived yet No How many troops on train asked Ellsworth About five hundred was the answer This was what Morgan wanted to know and he at once dispatched a column to intercept the train But the train scented danger and backed with all speed toward Louisville At Lebanon immense stores fell into Morgan s hands Two large warehouses filled to overflowing with clothing rations and the munitions of war were given to the flames Five thousand stand of arms were among the trophies Morgan picked out the best of these to arm his men The destruction of Federal property being complete Morgan started north going through Springfield and Mackville to Harrodsburg Here he met with a most enthusiastic reception Nothing was too good for Morgan s men While at Harrodsburg Calhoun greatly wished that Morgan would make a detour and visit Danville but this Morgan refused to do as it would take him too far out of his route and give the Federals time to concentrate against him Thus Calhoun was prevented from entering his native town in triumph Morgan had caused the report to be circulated far and near that he had a force of five thousand and that his object was the capture of Frankfort From Harrodsburg he moved to Midway on the line of the Louisville and Lexington Railroad The place was about equidistant from Frankfort and Lexington and from it either place could be equally threatened Here he once more took possession of the telegraph office and Ellsworth was once more busy in sending telegrams In the names of the different Federal officers Morgan telegraphed right and left ordering the Federal troops here and there everywhere but to the right place and causing the utmost confusion The poor Federals were at their wits end they knew not what to do or which way to turn The whole state was in terror The name of Morgan was on every tongue his force was magnified fivefold General Boyle in command of the Department of Kentucky was deluged with telegrams imploring assistance He in turn deluged General Halleck General Buell and even President Lincoln Send me troops or Kentucky is lost John Morgan will have it he said Lincoln telegraphed to Halleck at Corinth They are having a stampede in Kentucky Please look to it Buell telegraphed I can do nothing Have no men I can send Thus Kentucky was left to her fears Never did a thousand men create a greater panic From Midway Colonel Morgan made a strong demonstration toward Frankfort strengthening the belief that he was to attack that place but his real object was the capture of Lexington Calhoun with his men scouted clear up to the outskirts of the place driving in the Federal outposts but he learned that the city was garrisoned by at least five times the number of Morgan s men This fact he reported to his chief who saw that it would be madness to attempt to capture it Morgan therefore resolved to swing clear around Lexington thoroughly breaking the railroad which led from that place to Cincinnati so he gave orders to start for Paris But he was unexpectedly delayed for a day at Midway by an unfortunate incident the capture of Calhoun and one of his men by the Home Guards CHAPTER VI CAPTURED BY HOME GUARDS All through Kentucky during the war there were companies of troops known as Home Guards They were in reality the militia of the state They in many instances rendered valuable services and did much to keep Kentucky in the Union If it had not been for them the Federal government would have been obliged to keep twice as many troops in the state as it did Not being under as strict discipline as the United States troops they were more dreaded by the Southern element than the regular army These Home Guards were very bitter and lost no opportunity of harassing those who clung to the cause of the South Now and then there were bands of these Guards that were nothing but bands of guerrillas who lived by plundering and they were frequently guilty of the most cold blooded murders It was by such a band that Calhoun was captured He had been scouting toward Frankfort to see if the Federals were moving any considerable body of troops from that place to attack Morgan He found them so frightened that they were not thinking of attacking Morgan they were bending every nerve to defend the city from an expected attack by him He was on his way back with the news that there was no danger from the direction of Frankfort when he was told that a band of Home Guards that were in fact a set of robbers had their haunts in the rough hilly country to the south of him and he determined to try to effect their capture After riding several miles and hearing nothing of them he ordered a return to Midway The day was very hot and coming to a cross road where several trees cast their grateful shade and a little brook ran babbling by he ordered his men to halt and rest The shade and the water were very acceptable to both man and beast dismounting the men lay sprawling around in the shade Seeing a house standing on an eminence up the cross road Calhoun decided to take one of his soldiers named Nevels and ride up to it to see if he could learn anything Better let us all go there is no telling what one may run into in this country said a sergeant named Graham who in the absence of Calhoun would be in command of the little company No Graham answered Calhoun both men and horses are tired and need the little rest they are getting I do not think there is any danger If I see anything suspicious I will signal to you With these words Calhoun with his companion rode away There he goes as careless as if there was not an enemy within forty miles said Graham looking after them and shaking his head I tell you the Lieutenant will get into trouble some of these days He is altogether too rash never thinks of danger Don t worry about the Lieutenant lazily replied one of the men he never gets into a scrape without getting out of it He is a good one he is The Sergeant did not answer but stood earnestly gazing after his chief who by this time was about a quarter of a mile away Here Calhoun and Nevels descended into a depression which for a moment would hide them from the watchful eyes of the Sergeant As Calhoun entered this depression he noticed that a thick growth of underbrush came up close to the side of the road affording a splendid place for concealment For a moment a feeling as of unseen danger came over him but nothing suspicious could be seen or heard and dismissing the thought he rode forward Suddenly Calhoun s horse stopped and pricked up his ears What s the matter Selim What do you see exclaimed Calhoun as he gently touched him with the spur The horse sprang forward but had gone but a few yards when as suddenly as if they had arisen out of the ground a dozen men with levelled guns arose by the side of the road and demanded their surrender Desperate as the chance was Calhoun wheeled his horse to flee when before him stood a dozen more men his retreat was cut off Surrender or you are dead men cried the leader Calhoun saw they were surrounded by at least twenty five men and a most villainous looking set they were There was no help for it To refuse to surrender meant instant death and Calhoun and Nevels yielded as gracefully as possible The Sergeant stood still looking up the road waiting for them to appear when he caught sight of the head of a man then of another and another Boys he shouted excitedly something is wrong the Lieutenant is in trouble The little squad sprang to their horses and without thinking of danger or what force they would meet rode to the rescue the Sergeant in the lead But when they neared the place they were met with a volley which brought three of the horses down and seriously wounded two of the men Forward shouted the Sergeant staggering to his feet and holding his wounded arm from which the blood was streaming But another volley brought down two more of the horses and the Sergeant seeing they were outnumbered more than two to one ordered a halt and made preparations to resist a charge which he thought would surely come No charge came and all was silent in front The Sergeant ordered an advance but no enemy was found They had silently decamped and left no trace behind and had taken Calhoun and Nevels with them Crippled as they were and the Sergeant suffering terribly from his wound it was decided it would be madness to pursue with their small force So one of the men on a swift horse was sent to carry the news to Morgan while the others followed more leisurely When the news reached camp the greatest excitement prevailed and every man in the command clamored to be sent to the rescue Colonel Morgan chose Captain Huffman who with thirty of his famous Texan rangers was soon galloping to the scene of the encounter under the guidance of the courier who had brought the news On the way they met Calhoun s little squad sorrowfully returning Not a man but begged to be allowed to go with the rescuing party but this on account of the tired condition of their horses and on account of the two wounded men had to be refused It was well along in the afternoon when the theatre of the encounter was reached Captain Huffman had with him three or four men who for years had been accustomed to Indian fighting in Texas these men took up the trail and followed it like bloodhounds After going three or four miles the advance ran into two men who sought safety by running into the woods but a shot in the leg brought one of them down and he was captured At first he denied knowing anything of the affair saying he had heard nothing of a fight But when Captain Huffman ordered a rope to be brought and it was placed around his neck he begged piteously saying that if they would spare his life he would tell them all he knew And this is what he told them He belonged to a band led by a man known as Red Bill from his florid complexion It was this band that had captured Calhoun and Nevels It seemed that the officer whom they had captured had known Red Bill in Danville and taunted him with being a chicken thief This so angered Red Bill that he determined to hang the officer This resulted in a quarrel among the members of the band many of whom had become tired of the leadership of Red Bill being fearful that his crimes would bring retribution on their heads At last it was agreed that the band would disperse Red Bill on the promise that he might have the two horses captured agreeing to deliver the two prisoners to the Federal commander at Frankfort But added the prisoner whose name was Evans I doubt if they ever reach Frankfort I reckon Red Bill will find some means of getting rid of them before he gets there Captain Huffman listened to this story with horror If this miscreant makes way with Lieutenant Pennington and Nevels I will hunt him to his death if it takes ten years he declared Then turning to Evans he asked Did any of the gang side with Red Bill Yes five of them did and stayed with him was the answer And you men at least twenty of you by your own story coolly left our men to be foully murdered furiously demanded Captain Huffman The prisoner hung his head but did not answer Answer thundered Huffman Red Bill promised to take them to Frankfort he at length managed to say And you have just admitted that his promise was worth nothing Where did this thing occur Where did you leave Red Bill and his prisoners demanded Huffman About three miles from here answered Evans Lead us to the place at once I dare not he whimpered Red Bill will kill me if I give away the place of rendezvous We are under a terrible oath not to reveal it You need not fear Red Bill answered Captain Huffman in ominous tones for I am going to hang you Boys bring the rope Mercy Mercy gasped the shivering wretch Then lead us to the place where you left Red Bill and that quickly My wound he whined pointing to his leg Bind up his leg said Huffman to one of his men The wound was rudely dressed and then Evans was placed on a horse in front of a sturdy trooper Now take us to the place where you left Red Bill by the shortest and quickest route you say it is three miles If we don t reach it in half an hour I will hang you like a dog And continued Huffman to the trooper in front of whom Evans was riding blow out his brains at the first sign of treachery For answer the trooper touched his revolver significantly After riding swiftly for about two miles Evans bade them turn into a path which led into the woods The way became rough and rocky and their progress was necessarily slower Evans was in mortal terror lest the half hour would be up before they could reach the place It is right down thar he at length said pointing down a ravine which led to a stream The place was admirably adapted for concealment On a small level place surrounded by high cliffs stood a tumble down house It was shut in from view from every point except the single one on which they stood Leave the horses here whispered Huffman I think I caught sight of some one down there We will creep up on them unawares Leaving the horses in charge of ten men Captain Huffman with the rest of his force silently crept down the gorge Illustration THEY SILENTLY CREPT DOWN THE GORGE We will now turn to Calhoun After he was captured and heard his men cheering as they made the charge his heart stood still for he expected they would all be killed He was therefore greatly surprised when the firing ceased and his captors came running back and hurried him through the woods at a break neck speed The rapid pace was kept up for about three miles when finding they were not pursued they adopted a more leisurely gait Of this Calhoun was glad for he was entirely out of breath The leader of the gang and another probably the second in command had appropriated the horses and Calhoun and Nevels had been forced to walk or rather run Once Calhoun ventured to ask the result of the fight and was told that all of his men had been killed This he knew to be a lie as his captors would not have retreated so hastily if they had achieved so sweeping a victory He asked another question but was roughly told to shut up When the rendezvous was reached Red Bill for the first time noticed his prisoners closely He started when he saw Calhoun and then turning to his gang said I reckon we had better string these fellows up and get them out of the way String us up boldly answered Calhoun and I would not give a cent for your worthless lives Morgan would never rest as long as one of you encumbered the earth Who is afraid of Morgan exclaimed Red Bill with an oath He and the rest of you are nuthin but hoss thieves an yo will all hang one of these days I know yo my young rooster you air the son of that ole Rebil Judge Pennington of Danville I hev it in fur him And I know you now hotly replied Calhoun forgetting the danger he was in You used to live in Danville and went by the name of Red Bill Your popularity consisted in the fact that you were known as an adept chicken thief My father once sent you to jail for petit larceny Bill s face grew still redder Yo lie yo dog he hissed Yo father did send me to jail but I war innocent an he knowed it But he thought I war only po white trash while he is an aristocrat I swore to hev my revenge an I will hev it Boys what do we uns do with hoss thieves in ole Kentuck Hang em exclaimed four or five voices An we uns will hang this crowin bantam I will learn him to call me a chicken thief classin me with niggers exclaimed Red Bill with fury What will we uns do with the other feller asked one of the men Hang him too Dead men don t talk But some of the gang began to demur over this summary proceeding saying that the Federal authorities would deal severely with them if it became known they murdered prisoners in cold blood Not only this but Morgan had captured hundreds of Home Guards and paroled them But if they should execute one of his prominent officers he would show no mercy The discussion became so hot they came nearly fighting among themselves At last one of them said I am tired of the hull business I am goin home An I An I cried a dozen voices It was finally agreed that the gang should disband only five agreeing to remain with Red Bill Being allowed to keep the plunder and horses they had captured these men with Red Bill promised to deliver Calhoun and Nevels to the Federal authorities at Frankfort unharmed Calhoun and Nevels had watched this quarrel among their captors with the utmost anxiety knowing that upon the result depended their lives It was with the deepest concern that they beheld the members of the party depart leaving them with Red Bill and his five boon companions No sooner were they alone than the six with oaths and jeers tied their prisoners securely to trees drawing the cords so closely that they cut into the flesh Although the pain was terrible neither Calhoun nor Nevels uttered a moan After the prisoners were thus securely tied Red Bill produced a bottle of whisky and the six commenced drinking apparently taking no notice of their captives The whole six were soon fiendishly drunk Staggering up to Calhoun Red Bill growled Think we uns goin to take you to Frankfort I reckin That is what you promised replied Calhoun calmly Well we uns ain t We uns goin to hang ye Calhoun turned pale then controlling himself by a powerful effort he replied Do the Home Guards of Kentucky violate every principle of honorable warfare Damn honorable warfare Yo uns called me a chicken thief I call you a hoss thief Hoss thieves air hanged Ha ha the son of Judge Pennington strung up fo stealin hosses Won t that sound nice and he burst into a devilish laugh in which he was joined by the others Calhoun saw there was no hope It was hard to die such an ignominious death Oh he thought if I had only been permitted to die amid the flame and smoke of battle Such a death is glorious but this A great lump arose in his throat and came near choking him Gulping it back he whispered to Nevels Don t show the white feather Let them see how Morgan s men can die The brave fellow nodded he could not speak He had a wife and child at home They were unbound from the tree but their arms and limbs were kept tightly pinioned Ropes were brought and tied around their necks and the free ends thrown over a limb of the tree Can ye tie a true hangman s knot Jack asked Red of the villain who was adjusting the rope around Calhoun s neck That I can Red he answered with a chuckling laugh It s as neat a job as eny sheriff can do The sun had just sunk to rest the gloom of night was settling over the forest Calhoun saw the shadows thicken among the trees The darkness of death would soon be upon him String em up shouted Red Just then the solemn hoot of a distant owl was heard One of the men holding the rope dropped it and shivered from head to foot Boys he whispered let s don t do it That s a note of warning I never knew it to fail Cuss ye fo a white livered coward yelled Red Bill String them up I tell ye For answer there came the sharp crack of rifles the rush of armed men and the infuriated Texans were on them No mercy was shown in a moment it was all over Quickly the cords which bound Calhoun and Nevels were cut and the terrible nooses removed from their necks Thank God we were in time cried Captain Huffman wringing Calhoun s hand But Calhoun stood as one in a trance So sudden had been his deliverance he could not realize it He had nerved himself to die and now that he was safe he felt sick and faint and would have fallen if he had not been supported Both he and Nevels soon rallied and poured out their thanks to the brave men who had come to their rescue We would never have found you said Huffman if we had not run on one of the gang who under the threat of death piloted us here Where is he asked Calhoun With the boys up with the horses Let him go pleaded Calhoun but for him I would now have been food for the buzzards To which we will leave these carrion answered Huffman pointing to the dead Home Guards But we must be going Morgan is impatient to be on the road Great was the rejoicing in Morgan s command when Captain Huffman returned bringing Calhoun and Nevels safe and much satisfaction was expressed over the fate of their captors In half an hour after the return of Captain Huffman s command Morgan s men were en route for Paris CHAPTER VII CALHOUN TAKES FRED PRISONER After leaving Midway Morgan did not march directly to Paris but halted at Georgetown a little city twelve miles north of Lexington The citizens of Georgetown gave Morgan s command the same joyous welcome which they had received at almost every place visited for Morgan came to them not as an enemy but as a liberator From Georgetown Morgan resolved to attack Cynthiana which lies north of Paris having heard there was a considerable body of Federal troops stationed there Sending a small force toward Lexington to keep up the fiction of an attack upon that place Morgan moved with the main body of his force upon Cynthiana Here was fought the fiercest battle that Morgan was engaged in during his raid Cynthiana was held by Colonel John J Landram of the Eighteenth Kentucky He had under him about four hundred men mostly Home Guards and raw recruits Landram put up a most gallant defence and the battle raged for an hour and a half with the greatest fury It was at last decided by a furious charge made by Major Evans at the head of his Texas rangers The entire force of Colonel Landram was killed wounded and taken prisoners Colonel Morgan lamented the loss of some forty of his bravest men Calhoun was not in this fight having been sent with his scouts toward Lexington to watch the movements of the enemy From Cynthiana Morgan moved on Paris and the place surrendered without a shot being fired Some twenty five miles of the Cincinnati and Lexington railroad was now in Morgan s possession and he proceeded to destroy it as thoroughly as his limited time admitted But he was being encompassed by his enemies A large force was moving on him from Frankfort another from Lexington Calhoun with his faithful scouts kept him fully informed of these movements Just in time to elude General Green Clay Smith s forces from Lexington he marched for Winchester His next move was to Richmond This left all the pursuing forces in the rear The celerity of Morgan s movements the marvellous endurance of his men astonished and confounded his enemies At Richmond Morgan decided to make a stand and give battle to his pursuers but Calhoun brought word that at least five thousand Federals were closing in on him To give battle to such a number would have been madness so he marched for Crab Orchard On the march Calhoun made a detour toward Danville so as to visit the plantation of his uncle Colonel Richard Shackelford He was also in hopes of meeting his cousin Fred He had heard how Fred had interceded for his father keeping him from being sent to a Northern prison and he wished to thank him He was ashamed of the hatred he had felt toward him and resolved to make amends for it His arrival was a genuine surprise but to his consternation Fred presented himself in the uniform of a captain of the Federal army His men clamored to take Fred prisoner but just as Calhoun had succeeded in quieting them to his dismay Captain Conway came galloping upon the scene at the head of his company He had obtained permission from Morgan to scout toward Danville His real object was to capture Fred who he knew was at home Once in his hands he hoped to convict him as a spy His plan was frustrated by the bold stand taken by Colonel Shackelford who delivered Fred as a prisoner to Calhoun with instructions to take him to Morgan This Calhoun did and Morgan at once paroled him although Conway tried his best to have him held as a spy Morgan not only paroled Fred but let him return with the horse he had ridden although many of the men looked on the splendid animal with envious eyes But Morgan would not hear of their taking a horse which belonged to his old friend Colonel Shackelford Why didn t you ride that horse of yours asked Captain Mathews of Fred alluding to Fred s famous horse Prince Afraid you might keep him laughed Fred you are a good judge of a horse Captain Right you are responded Mathews I am sorry I didn t think of that horse when we were at Richmond I would have visited you with my friend Conway and taken the horse Think I will have to return for him yet Fred thought little of what Mathews said but that very night Mathews dispatched two of his men back in disguise to steal Fred s horse From Crab Orchard Morgan marched to Somerset surprising the place and capturing a large wagon train It was also a depot for army supplies all of which Morgan gave to the torch Here he again took possession of the telegraph office and enlightened the Federals as to his movements At Somerset Morgan s raid was practically at an end There were no Federal troops in front of him his pursuers were a day behind After he had completed the destruction of all the United States property in the place and was ready to leave he caused the following dispatches to be sent Somerset Ky July twenty two eighteen sixty two GEORGE D PRENTICE Louisville Ky Good morning George D I am quietly watching the complete destruction of all of Uncle Sam s property in this little burg I regret exceedingly that this is the last that comes under my supervision on this route I expect in a short time to pay you a visit and wish to know if you will be at home All well in Dixie JOHN H MORGAN Commanding Brigade Somerset Ky July twenty two eighteen sixty two GENERAL J T BOYLE Louisville Ky Good morning Jerry This telegraph is a great institution You should destroy it as it keeps me too well posted My friend Ellsworth has all of your dispatches since July ten on file Do you wish copies JOHN H MORGAN Commanding Brigade Somerset Ky July twenty two eighteen sixty two honorable GEORGE DUNLAP Washington D C Just completed my tour through Kentucky Captured sixteen cities destroyed millions of dollars of United States property Passed through your county but regret not seeing you We paroled fifteen hundred Federal prisoners Your old friend JOHN H MORGAN Commanding Brigade The feelings of the above gentlemen as they received these telegrams can better be imagined than described The one to General Boyle must have cut him to the quick as he read it To know how completely Morgan had outwitted him was like gall and wormwood to him From Somerset Morgan halted his command at Livingston Tennessee to take a much needed rest Never did men need it more They had accomplished one of the most astonishing feats in the annals of American warfare No wonder the name of Morgan struck terror to the hearts of the Federals Morgan in his report of his raid sums it up as follows I left Knoxville on the fourth day of this month with about nine hundred men and returned to Livingston on the twenty eighth instant with nearly twelve hundred having been absent just twenty four days during which time I travelled over one thousand miles captured seventeen towns destroyed all the government property and arms in them dispersed about fifteen hundred Home Guards and paroled nearly twelve hundred regular troops I lost in killed wounded and missing of the number I carried into Kentucky about ninety CHAPTER VIII THE CAPTURE OF GALLATIN Morgan s command had not been encamped at Livingston more than two or three days when to every one s astonishment a couple of soldiers belonging to Captain Mathews s company came riding into camp one on Fred Shackelford s famous horse Prince and the other on a well known horse of Colonel Shackelford s called Blenheim Calhoun hearing the cheering and laughter which greeted the soldiers as they galloped in waving their hats and shouting ran out of his quarters to see what was occasioning the excitement He could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the well known horse of Fred Then his heart gave a great jump for the thought came to him that his cousin had been waylaid and killed But if so how did the soldiers come to have Blenheim too To his relief he soon learned the truth of the story how from Crab Orchard Captain Mathews had sent back two of his company to capture Prince and they had returned not only with Prince but with Blenheim Mathews was in high spirits as he appropriated Prince Jumping on his back he galloped him through camp showing off his fine points and declaring he could outrun any horse in the brigade A match was soon arranged but Prince so easily outstripped every competitor that soon no officer was found who had the hardihood to enter his horse in the lists against him Blenheim was awarded to Conway much to his satisfaction He could not forego the opportunity of crowing over Calhoun thinking he would be vexed over the capture of his cousin s horse Why do you come blowing around me asked Calhoun nettled by his manner I am neither the keeper of my cousin nor the keeper of his horse Oh you were so careful of his precious person when I took him prisoner I did not know but your carefulness might extend to his horse replied Conway with a sneer Calhoun felt his blood boil but controlling himself he replied You did not take Captain Shackelford and I am surprised that you should make such a statement You forget that I was there before you You would have let the fellow go snapped Conway Just as Colonel Morgan did on his parole answered Calhoun It was your fault that he slipped through my fingers exclaimed Conway angrily but my time will come I have swore to see him hanged before this war is over and I shall Catch your rabbit before you skin him Captain replied Calhoun with provoking coolness and the laugh was on Conway who turned away with a muttered oath Conway had entertained a secret dislike to Calhoun ever since their first meeting partly because he had been chosen by Morgan instead of Conway himself to go back to Kentucky and partly on account of his being Fred s cousin But after the affair at Colonel Shackelford s house he took little pains to conceal his dislike Many of the officers of the brigade noticed this and predicted that sooner or later there would be trouble between the two But Calhoun was not through with being bantered over the capture of Prince Captain Mathews came riding up and with a flourish said Ah Lieutenant I reckon you have seen this hoss before what do you think of him Now Mathews was a rough rollicking fellow and quite a favorite in the command He and Calhoun were good friends and so Calhoun answered pleasantly He is the best horse in Kentucky I know it for I was once beaten by him in a race But continued Calhoun with a laugh my advice is to guard him very carefully or Captain Shackelford will get him back sure That horse has more tricks than you dream of I am not worrying replied Mathews One of your scouts has just had to fork over five dollars to one of my men on a bet they made at Crab Orchard that I could not get the hoss Perhaps you would like to bet I can t keep him Yes I will go you twenty five that Captain Shackelford will have his horse back in less than two months answered Calhoun dryly Done exclaimed the Captain gleefully and the stakes were placed in the hands of Captain Huffman The bet afforded much amusement to the officers but all of them looked upon it as a very foolish bet on the part of Calhoun That twenty five is gone said Huffman to Calhoun as he pocketed the stakes but I am sure of having fifty dollars for at least two months I reckon I shall lose said Calhoun but Mathews had better not let Shackelford get sight of his horse Why asked a dozen voices in concert Because that horse is up to more antics than a trick horse in a circus You will see if we ever run across my cousin in our raids I don t know what you mean said one of the officers but your cousin will have a fine time getting that horse away from Jim Mathews Wait and see was Calhoun s answer It was not many days before they knew what Calhoun meant A few days sufficed to rest Morgan s command and it was not the nature of Morgan to remain long idle He had to be doing something It was known that the Confederate armies were about ready to make the long talked of forward movement into Kentucky In fact General Kirby Smith had already set out from Knoxville to invade Eastern Kentucky and General Bragg was nearly ready to take the initiative from Chattanooga The Federal army in Tennessee was scattered and owing to the raids of Morgan and Forrest the men were on short rations General Buell was at his wits end He knew that General Bragg was preparing to advance but thought he would not attempt the invasion of Kentucky before attacking him He therefore looked for a great battle somewhere in Middle Tennessee and concentrated his forces for that event Before Bragg moved Morgan decided to strike another blow at the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and this time right under the noses of the Federal army Gallatin is only twenty six miles from Nashville and Morgan decided to attempt its capture In order to spy out the land Calhoun entered the place as a country lad He found that it was garrisoned by a Federal force of about four hundred under the command of Colonel Boone The discipline was lax In the daytime no pickets were out and Calhoun found no difficulty in entering the place He made himself known to a few of the citizens and they gave him all the information possible To them the coming of Morgan meant deliverance from a hateful foe It did not take Calhoun long to find out the station of every picket at night The camp of the Federals was on the fair ground half a mile from the city Colonel Boone was accustomed to sleep at a hotel in the city in fact his wife was sick at the hotel Colonel Boone knew that Morgan was near and was fearful of an attack He telegraphed both to Nashville and to General Buell at MacMinnville for reinforcements but no attention was paid to his demand Instead he was ordered to send nearly half of his force away to intercept a drove of beef cattle which it was reported the Confederates were driving down from Kentucky That the citizens might not know that his numbers were depleted Colonel Boone did not send this force away until midnight thinking no one would see them depart But sharp eyes were watching Nothing was going on in Gallatin without Calhoun s knowledge He lost no time in reporting to Morgan and the attack came swiftly Knowing the location of every picket post Calhoun was able to effect their capture without the firing of a gun and Morgan rode into Gallatin without the knowledge of the Federal force which was only half a mile away Colonel Boone was captured at the hotel The first intimation he had that Morgan was in the city was when he was commanded by Calhoun to surrender A demand was now made on the camp that it should surrender which it did Thus without firing a gun Gallatin with the entire Federal garrison and all the military stores which it contained was captured Losing no time Morgan ordered the companies of Captain Mathews and Captain Conway together with Calhoun s scouts to take the stockade which guarded the tunnel six miles north of town The attack was successful the stockade surrendering after a slight resistance The tunnel was now in the possession of the Confederates A long train of cars which had been captured was piled with wood rails and other combustibles set on fire and run into the tunnel The sides and roof of the tunnel were supported by heavy woodwork and the whole tunnel was soon a roaring mass of flame The wood being burned away the tunnel caved in and it was months before a train ran through from Louisville to Nashville Morgan had effectually blocked the road Highly elated with their success the command returned to Gallatin Mathews and Conway riding at the head of the column To Calhoun was committed the care of the prisoners and he brought up the rear When about half way to Gallatin Calhoun heard the report of a single pistol shot in front then a rapid succession of rifle shots The head of the column seemed to be thrown into confusion and the whole command came to a halt Fearful that an attack had been made by a Federal force coming from Nashville Calhoun gave orders to shoot down the first prisoner who attempted to escape and prepared to resist any attack that might come But no more firing was heard and the column began to move again Soon an officer came riding back and told Calhoun a story that interested him greatly Mathews and Conway were riding at the head of the column when as it reached a cross road a peculiar sharp whistle suddenly pierced the air Mathews s horse gave a prodigious bound unseated his rider and dashed up the cross road Conway s horse bolted and in spite of Conway s efforts followed A boy sprang out of the bushes into the road and Mathews s horse stopped by his side He fired at Conway hitting him in the shoulder To save himself from being shot again Conway flung himself from his horse The boy sprang onto Mathews s horse and rode away at full speed followed by the other horse An ineffectual volley was fired at the boy Captain Mathews s arm was broken by the fall Illustration HE FIRED AT CONWAY So Captain Mathews has lost his horse asked Calhoun with a faint smile Yes he will quit blowing now And I have won twenty five dollars but I am sorry Mathews had his arm broken When Calhoun reached Gallatin Captain Conway had had his wound dressed and Mathews s arm was in splints Conway was in a towering passion He blamed Calhoun for his ill luck saying if it had not been for him Fred Shackelford would have been hanged as a spy From this time he did not try to conceal his hatred of Calhoun Captain Mathews took his misfortune more philosophically It was a blamed sharp trick on the part of young Shackelford he exclaimed Then turning to Captain Huffman he said Give that money to Lieutenant Pennington he has won it But I give you all fair warning I shall get that hoss back My reputation depends upon it Then to think that I who prided myself on being one of the best hossmen in Morgan s troop should be thrown Bah it makes me sick and his face took on a look of disgust I warned you said Calhoun that that horse was up to tricks When Fred gives that whistle he will unhorse any rider who is on his back I have seen Fred try it time and time again with his father s nigger boys as riders and Prince never failed of unhorsing them When Fred gave that whistle his horse would have gone to him or died in the attempt I am sorry you didn t let Conway hang him replied Mathews gently rubbing his broken arm but I will get even with him see if I don t I want that hoss worse than ever A few days after the capture of Gallatin a Federal force moved up from Nashville reoccupied the city committed many depredations and began arresting the citizens right and left accusing them of complicity with Morgan When Morgan heard of this he at once moved to the relief of the distressed city Attacking the rear guard of the enemy as it was leaving the place he not only defeated them but drove them to within seven miles of Nashville capturing the force at Pilot Knob and burning the high railroad trestle at that place He also captured a train of cars and liberated forty of the citizens of Gallatin who were being taken to Nashville as prisoners They had been used with the greatest cruelty by their captors In this raid Morgan captured nearly two hundred prisoners Notwithstanding the provocation was great considering the way the citizens of Gallatin had been used Morgan treated his prisoners kindly and paroled them The Federal authorities now being thoroughly alarmed resolved to crush Morgan To this end a brigade of cavalry was organized at MacMinnville placed under the command of General R W Johnson and sent against him Johnson thought that Morgan was at Hartsville and marched against that place But when he reached Hartsville and learned that Morgan was at Gallatin he at once marched to attack him there confident of easy victory Up to this time the Federals had boasted that Morgan would not fight anything like an equal force that he always attacked isolated posts with overwhelming numbers They were now to learn something different Morgan had been kept well posted by Calhoun and his scouts with regard to every movement of Johnson Although he knew that he was greatly outnumbered Morgan resolved to give battle and teach the boasting Yankees a lesson Early on the morning of August twenty one Calhoun came galloping into Gallatin with the information that Johnson was close at hand To avoid fighting a battle in the city Morgan moved out on the Hartsville pike meeting the enemy about two miles from Gallatin The engagement opened at once with fury Up to that time it was the greatest engagement fought in the West in which cavalry only was engaged For a time the Federals fought bravely and for an hour the issue of the battle was doubtful then a charge stampeded a portion of the Federal forces Thoroughly panic stricken they threw away guns accoutrements everything that impeded their progress thinking only of safety in flight Plunging into the Cumberland River they forded it and did not stop running until they reached Nashville The remaining Federal force under General Johnson retreated about two miles and then made a brave stand But nothing could withstand the fury of Colonel Basil Duke s attack whose command had the advance General Johnson and many of his men were taken prisoners and the remainder were scattered In this engagement the Federals lost two hundred men killed wounded and missing Their general himself was a prisoner Thus to their cost they found that when the occasion demanded it Morgan would fight Morgan s loss in the battle was only five killed and twenty wounded but among the latter was the brave Captain Huffman who had an arm shattered Colonel Basil Duke in this fight won the highest praise from Morgan for the masterly manner in which he handled his regiment It was greatly owing to the efforts of Colonel Duke that the victory was won In this battle Calhoun bore a conspicuous part Single handed he engaged a Federal officer who was trying to rally his men and forced him to surrender When he delivered up his sword Calhoun saw to his surprise that it was his old acquaintance Lieutenant Haines Ah Lieutenant said Calhoun I am glad to have met you again When the battle is over I will come and see you Pennington again as I am alive gasped the astonished Lieutenant After all was over Calhoun sought him out and found him sitting dejected and crestfallen among the prisoners Cheer up Lieutenant said Calhoun pleasantly we are going to parole you You will soon be at liberty How often do you want to parole a fellow This will be the third time growled Haines Curse the luck I thought we would wipe you off the face of the earth sure this time We would too if it hadn t been for that cowardly regiment which broke An if has stood in between many a man and success answered Calhoun How long ago were you exchanged About two months replied Haines and here I am in for it again I expected to win a captaincy to day If this is the way it goes I shall die a lieutenant Oh you may wear the star of a general yet who knows To change the subject have you met the charming Miss Osborne since your return to the army A change came over the face of Haines one that transformed his rather handsome features into those of a malignant spirit Calhoun saw it and wondered The Lieutenant quickly recovered himself and answered Yes but trouble has come upon the family mister Osborne refused to take the oath of allegiance and as he was looked upon as a dangerous character he has been sent North as a prisoner To wear his life away in some Northern bastile exclaimed Calhoun in a fury Monstrous That is not all returned Haines By some means the house took fire and burned with all its contents I did all I could for them tried to save mister Osborne but could not but I will not relax my efforts to have him released I have some powerful friends in the North Calhoun thanked him and went his way But that look which came over Haines s face what did it mean It was months before Calhoun knew CHAPTER IX THE DUEL IN August eighteen sixty two Cumberland Gap the gateway between Eastern Kentucky and East Tennessee was held by a Federal force of over ten thousand commanded by General George W Morgan It was this force which confronted General Kirby Smith as he set out to invade Kentucky The place being too strong to carry by assault General Smith left a force in front of the Gap to menace it made a flank movement with the rest of his army passed through Roger s Gap unopposed and without paying any attention to the force at Cumberland Gap pushed on with all speed for Central Kentucky At the same time General Bragg made his long expected advance from Chattanooga completely deceiving Buell who first concentrated his army at Altamont and then at MacMinnville Bragg marched unopposed up the Sequatchie Valley to Sparta General George H Thomas had advised Buell to occupy Sparta but the advice was rejected Buell could not or would not see that Kentucky was Bragg s objective point He now believed that Nashville or Murfreesboro was the point of danger and he concentrated his army at the latter place From Sparta General Bragg had marched to Carthage crossed the Cumberland River and was well on his way to Kentucky before Buell waked up Bragg was then three days ahead of him If Bragg had marched straight for Louisville there would have been no troops to oppose him until he reached that place and Louisville would have fallen But he stopped to take Mumfordsville and the delay was fatal It gave Buell the opportunity to overtake him When the forward movement began Colonel John H Morgan was ordered to Eastern Kentucky to watch the force at Cumberland Gap and prevent it from falling on the rear of the army of General Smith Smith moved rapidly and on August twenty nine fought the battle of Richmond where a Federal force of seven thousand was almost annihilated only about eight hundred escaping By the movements of Smith and Bragg the Federal force at Cumberland Gap was cut off For that army the situation was a grave one In their front was General Stevenson with a force too small to attack but large enough to keep them from advancing In their rear were the Confederate armies They were short of food starvation stared them in the face It was either surrender or a retreat through the mountains of Eastern Kentucky General George W Morgan called a council of his officers and it was decided to evacuate the Gap and attempt the retreat The Gap was evacuated on the night of the seventeenth of September All government property which could not be carried away was given to the flames The rough mountain road had been mined and the mines were exploded to prevent Stevenson from following But as Stevenson s force was infantry it would be of little avail in following the retreating Federals A toilsome march of two hundred and twenty miles over rough mountainous roads lay between the Federals and the Ohio River To the credit of General G W Morgan be it said he conducted the retreat with consummate skill It was expected that a Confederate force in Eastern Kentucky under General Humphrey Marshall would try to cut the Federals off but Marshall never appeared and it was left to the brigade of John H Morgan to do what they could to oppose the retreat One cavalry brigade could not stop the progress of ten thousand well disciplined troops Day after day Morgan hung on the Federal flanks and rear taking advantage of every opening and making their way a weary one After a toilsome march of sixteen days the Federal force footsore and completely exhausted reached the Ohio at Greenupsburg on the Ohio River and was safe During these sixteen days Calhoun was almost continually in the saddle the foremost to strike the last to retreat When the pursuit was ended his little band of scouts had seventy five prisoners to their credit When Morgan saw that it was useless to follow the retreating army any longer without taking any rest he turned the head of his column toward Central Kentucky for he knew he would be needed there Calhoun could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the change a few weeks had effected All Central Kentucky had been swept clear of the Federals Panic stricken they had fled back to Louisville and Cincinnati and were cowering in their trenches Indiana and Ohio were in an agony of fear The governors were frantically calling on the people to arise en masse and save their states from invasion When the command reached Danville Calhoun was nearly beside himself with joy Over the courthouse floated the Stars and Bars of the South It was the first time Calhoun had ever seen there the flag he loved so well With a proud hurrah he dashed up to the door of his father s residence there was no one to molest him or make him afraid From the house of every friend of the South hung a Confederate flag Redeemed Kentucky redeemed at last shouted Calhoun as he dismounted But he was disappointed in not finding his father at home The Judge was in Frankfort helping to form a provisional government for the state Many of the more sanguine of the Southern element of the state already considered it safe in the Confederacy Although his father was not at home Calhoun received a most joyful welcome Bress de chile if he isn t bac again cried Aunt Chloe Yes Chloe said Calhoun as he shook her honest black hand and now be sure and get up one of your best dinners I can eat it in peace this time And Chloe cook enough for a dozen Colonel Morgan with his staff will be here to dine But what Morgan s command learned was anything but satisfactory Kirby Smith had advanced to within six miles of Covington there halted and at last fallen back Bragg instead of marching direct to Louisville had turned aside to Bardstown allowing Buell s army to enter the city of Louisville unopposed There Buell had been joined by twenty thousand fresh troops Clothing and refitting his men he had turned and was now marching on Bardstown A great battle might be fought any day In fact it was reported that Bragg had already abandoned Bardstown and was marching in the direction of Danville or Harrodsburg I don t like it at all said Morgan Our generals have already let the golden opportunity pass But there is still hope With the armies of Bragg and Smith united they should be strong enough to give battle and crush Buell So good was the dinner and so animated the discussion that it was late in the afternoon when they arose from the table As they came out Morgan suddenly stopped and said Hark Away in the northwest in the direction of Perryville the dull heavy booming of cannon was heard They listened and the dull roar like distant thunder was continuous A battle is being fought they said in low tones May God favor the right At Perryville the forces of Buell and Bragg had met and were engaged in deadly strife Until nightfall the heavy dull roar was heard and then it died away Which army had been victorious They could not tell After the battle of Perryville Buell fully expecting that Bragg would fight a decisive battle for the possession of the state remained inactive for three days for the purpose of concentrating his army It was fatal to all his hopes for Bragg had already decided to leave the state and he utilized the three days in getting away with his immense trains He had been grievously disappointed in the hope that his army would be largely recruited and that at least twenty thousand Kentuckians would flock to his standard But Kentucky had already been well drained of men furnishing troops by thousands for both sides From one point of view the invasion of Kentucky by the Confederates had been a magnificent success A loss of at least twenty thousand had been inflicted on the Federal armies while the loss of the Confederate army had not been over one third of that number In addition to that the immense stores gathered and taken South were of inestimable value to the army But in the chagrin and disappointment over Bragg s retreat these things were lost sight of and the Confederate general was most bitterly denounced Calhoun went wild when he heard that the state was to be given up without a decisive battle that all that had been gained was to go for naught and his feelings were shared by all Morgan s men It won t prevent us from visiting the state once in a while said Morgan with a grim smile As for Judge Pennington he was so disgusted that although his whole heart was with the South he gave up all idea of forming a state government loyal to the Confederacy and remained quiet during the rest of the war The armies will have to settle it he would say we can do nothing here One of the first things that Calhoun did after he reached Danville was to see Jennie Freeman and thank her for her timely warning It was kind of you Jennie he said for I know that you hate the cause for which I am fighting My conscience has hurt me awfully ever since replied Jennie with a toss of her head and then I believe you told me an awful fib Why how is that Jennie asked Calhoun You worked on my sympathy and said if you were caught you would be hanged The Union forces don t hang prisoners They would only have shut you up and that is what you deserve But Jennie I was in disguise they would have hanged me as a spy Don t believe it but I sometimes think half of you Rebels ought to be hanged Oh Jennie Jennie what a bloodthirsty creature you have grown But where is your father Thank the Lord where the old flag yet floats in Louisville He will stay there until that rag comes down and she pointed to the Confederate flag floating over the courthouse Poor girl never to see her father again exclaimed Calhoun in tones of compassion What do you mean she asked turning pale A sudden fear had come over her had anything befallen her father Calhoun saw her mistake Laughing he said I only meant that flag would never come down Is that all she replied saucily you all will be scurrying south like so many rabbits in less than a week Give us ten days No not an hour more than a week And mind if you get caught you needn t call on me for help Well Jennie don t let s quarrel Perhaps I can return the favor you did me by helping you some day The opportunity came sooner than he expected The next day Jennie ventured out to visit a sick friend On her return she had to pass a couple of Confederate officers one of whom was intoxicated The other appeared to be reasoning with him and trying to get him to go to his quarters As Jennie was hurrying past them the one who was intoxicated staggered toward her and leering at her exclaimed How how do pretty one Give me a a kiss Jennie turned to flee but he caught her roughly by the arm Just as he did so he was struck a terrific blow in the face which sent him rolling in the gutter Take my arm Jennie said Calhoun for it was he who struck the blow I will see you safe home The trembling girl took his arm saying Oh Calhoun how glad I am you came How can I thank you enough Do you know that dreadful man Yes I am sorry to say he is a captain in Morgan s command His name is Conway We left him back in Tennessee wounded But he was able to follow Bragg s army and he joined us only yesterday By the way it was Fred Shackelford who shot him He shot him when he got Prince back Conway was riding Blenheim Oh Fred told me all about that Wasn t that just splendid in him getting his horse back Where is Fred now asked Calhoun I don t know Did you know General Nelson was shot Shot Nelson shot cried Calhoun Where How Jennie had to tell him what little she knew about it All that she had heard had come from Confederate sources Well Jennie here you are at home I feel ashamed It is the first time I ever knew one of Morgan s men to insult a woman I hope that miserable Conway will give you no trouble said Jennie as they parted No fears on that score lightly replied Calhoun as he bade her good bye But Calhoun well knew there would be trouble No Kentucky officer would forgive a blow no matter what the provocation was under which it was given The blow which Conway received had the effect of sobering him but he presented a pitiable sight His face was covered with blood and one eye was nearly closed When he knew it was Calhoun that had struck him his rage was fearful Nothing but blood would wipe out the insult For a Kentucky gentleman not to resent a blow meant disgrace and dishonor he would be looked upon as a contemptible coward But Conway was no coward He knew he was in fault but that would not wipe out the disgrace of the blow There was but one thing for him to do and that was to challenge Calhoun That night Calhoun was waited upon by Captain Mathews who in the name of Conway demanded an abject apology This of course was refused and a formal challenge was delivered Calhoun at once accepted it and referred Mathews to his friend Lieutenant Matson Look here Pennington said Mathews I do not want you to think I uphold Conway in what he did I am no saint but I never insulted a woman Conway would not have done it if he had not been drunk I was just going to the lady s rescue when you struck the blow There was no need of knocking Conway down I understand the girl is a Lincolnite but that makes no difference Conway is right in demanding satisfaction And I am willing to give it to him answered Calhoun The only thing I ask is that the affair be arranged quickly Let it be to morrow morning at sunrise And Captain understand that I bear you no grudge I consider your action perfectly honorable Mathews bowed and withdrew He and Matson quickly arranged the preliminaries The meeting was to take place at sunrise in a secluded spot near Danville the weapons were pistols the distance fifteen paces Only one shot was to be allowed The affair had to be managed with the utmost secrecy above all things it had to be kept from the ears of Morgan But it was whispered from one to another until half the officers knew of it None blamed Calhoun yet none could see how Conway could avoid giving the challenge Both are dead men said an officer with a grave shake of the head Morgan ought to be told he would stop it Tell Morgan if you dare cried half a dozen voices Oh I am not going to tell if they wish to kill each other it s none of my business replied the officer turning away Calhoun was known as the best pistol shot in the brigade and Conway was no mean marksman Everyone thought it would be a bloody affair Many were aware of the enmity which Conway held toward Calhoun and knew he would kill him if he could Meanwhile Jennie slept unconscious of the danger Calhoun was in for her sake It was a beautiful autumn morning when they met The sun was just rising touching woods and fields and the spires of the distant town with its golden light The meeting was in a place which Calhoun well knew How often he had played there when a boy It was an open glade in the midst of a grove of mighty forest trees The trees had taken on the beautiful hues of autumn and they flamed with red and gold and orange At least twenty had assembled to witness the duel A surgeon stood near with an open case of instruments at his feet Many glanced at it but turned their eyes away quickly It was too suggestive The principals were placed in position A hush came over the little group of spectators Even the breeze seemed no longer to whisper lovingly among the trees but took upon itself the wail of a dirge and a shower of leaves red as blood fell around the contestants Are you ready gentlemen asked Mathews Ready answered Calhoun Ready said Conway One two three fire Conway s pistol blazed and Calhoun felt a slight twinge of pain The ball had grazed his left side near the heart and drawn a few drops of blood For a moment Calhoun stood then coolly raised his pistol and fired in the air The spectators raised a shout of applause but Conway was white with rage I demand another shot he shouted Pennington s action has made a farce of this meeting It was the condition that but one shot should be allowed remonstrated Mathews The condition has not been fulfilled angrily replied Conway I demand another shot In the mean time Matson had gone up to Calhoun and seeing the hole through his clothing exclaimed My God are you shot Lieutenant A mere scratch it s nothing answered Calhoun An examination showed it to be so but blood had been drawn This should have satisfied Conway but it did not he still insisted on a second shot This the seconds were about to refuse absolutely when Calhoun asked to be heard Although Captain Conway richly deserved the blow I gave him he said yet as a gentleman and an officer I felt he could do no less than challenge me I have given him the satisfaction he demanded If he insists on continuing the duel I shall conclude it is his desire to kill me through personal malice not on account of his injured honor which according to the code has been satisfied This time there will be no firing in the air Give him the second shot if he desires it No No cried a dozen voices Mathews went up to Conway and speaking in a low tone said You fool do you want to be killed Pennington will kill you as sure as fate if you insist on the second shot Now you are out of it honorably Conway mumbled something and Mathews turning around said Gentlemen my principal acknowledges himself satisfied It is with pleasure that I compliment both of the principals in this affair They have conducted themselves like true Kentucky gentlemen and I trust they will part as such Shake hands gentlemen shake hands cried their friends crowding around them Calhoun gave his freely but Conway extended his coldly There was a look in his eye which foreboded future trouble Such a meeting could not be kept secret and it soon came to the ears of Morgan Both of the principals as well as the seconds were summoned into his presence He listened to all the details in silence and then said It is well that this affair resulted as it did If either one of the principals had fallen the other would have been summarily dealt with Both of you looking at Conway and Calhoun were to blame Lieutenant Pennington should not have struck the blow no gentleman will tamely submit to the indignity of a blow As for you Captain Conway I am surprised that you one of my officers should insult a lady If this offence is ever repeated intoxication will be no plea in its extenuation Heretofore it has been our proud boast that where Morgan s men are there any lady be she for North or South is as safe as in her own home Let us see that it will always be so The men who heard burst into a wild cheer Each of them was a knight to uphold the honor of woman As Captain Conway listened to the reprimand his red face became redder His heart was full of anger but he was diplomat enough to listen with becoming humility To his fellow officers his plea was intoxication and in the stirring times which followed his offence was forgotten Scouts came dashing into the city with the startling intelligence that a large Federal force was advancing on the place It was not long before a battle was being waged through the streets Before an overwhelming force of infantry Morgan had to fall back Bragg was in full retreat and to Morgan fell the lot of guarding the rear As they were falling back from Camp Dick Robinson Calhoun met a Major Hockoday who to him was the bearer of sad news The Major said that that morning his men pursued a Federal scout who had ventured inside their lines In his effort to escape he had fallen over the cliff of Dick River and been killed And I am sorry to say added the Major that that scout was your cousin Captain Fred Shackelford Are you sure asked Calhoun in a trembling voice Perfectly sure I knew him too well to be mistaken For the sake of his father I sent word to the overseer of the General s plantation so that the body could be found and given Christian burial Thank you replied Calhoun as he turned away with swimming eyes All his old love for his cousin had returned There was little heart in Calhoun for battle that day It was weeks before he learned that Fred was not dead CHAPTER X HARTSVILLE WHEN Bragg evacuated Kentucky his weary army found rest at Murfreesboro This little city is thirty two miles southeast of Nashville situated on the railroad leading from Nashville to Chattanooga It had already become famous by the capture of a Federal brigade there in August by General N B Forrest and was destined to become the theatre of one of the greatest battles of the war In the Federal army a great change had taken place General Buell had been relieved from command and General W Rosecrans the hero of the battle of Corinth appointed in his place This general assembled his army at Nashville Thus the two great armies were only thirty two miles apart with their outposts almost touching Bragg believing that it would be impossible for Rosecrans to advance before spring established his army in winter quarters and the soldiers looked forward to two or three months of comparative quiet Rosecrans s first duty was to reopen the Louisville and Nashville Railroad which had been so thoroughly destroyed by Morgan An army of men did the work a work which took them weeks to accomplish But it was not in the nature of Morgan to be quiet Not only he but his men fretted in camp life Its daily routine with its drills did not suit them Their home was the saddle and they wanted no other Therefore Morgan began to look around in search of a weak point in the Federal lines For this purpose Calhoun and his scouts were kept busy They seemed to be omnipresent now here now there They would ride in between the Federal posts learn of the citizens where the enemy were posted and whether their camps were guarded with vigilance or not Many a prisoner was picked up and much valuable information obtained In this way Morgan soon knew as well as the Federal commander himself how his troops were posted and the number at each post Taking everything into consideration Calhoun reported that Hartsville offered the best opening for an attack It is the extreme eastern outpost of the Federals he said The nearest troops to them are at Castalian Springs nine miles away The country from here to Hartsville is entirely free of Federal troops and we can approach the place unobserved The Cumberland River is low and can be forded But if you wish I will go and make a thorough reconnaissance of the place Go and be back as soon as possible replied Morgan but be careful do not take too many risks With a dozen of his trusty scouts Calhoun had no trouble in reaching the bank of the Cumberland River opposite Hartsville Here concealed in the woods through his glass he noted the position of every regiment and drew a map of the camp But he was not satisfied with this Under the cover of darkness he crossed the river determined to learn more Above all he wished to learn where the enemy s pickets were posted at night their exact force as nearly as possible and the discipline which they were under He wanted to do all this without alarming them After crossing the river he concluded to call at a commodious farm house situated some three miles from Hartsville He was almost certain of a hearty welcome there were few disloyal to the South in that section At first he was taken for a Federal soldier in disguise and admittance was refused but once the inmates were convinced that he was one of Morgan s men the heartiness of his welcome made up for the coldness of his first reception The planter was well posted There was one brigade at Hartsville Until a few days before the brigade had been commanded by a Colonel Scott but he had been relieved by a Colonel Moore This Moore was the colonel of one of the regiments at Hartsville and had been in the service but a short time Most of the troops were raw and inexperienced Calhoun was glad to hear all this In the morning dressed as a rough country boy he made a circuit of the entire place This he did by going on foot and keeping to the fields and woods The location of every picket post was carefully noted and the best way to approach each one In two or three instances he did not hesitate to approach soldiers who were foraging outside of the lines and in a whining tone enter into conversation with them informing them he was looking for some of his father s pigs Mighty fraid sum ov yo uns Yanks got em he said with a sigh No doubt sonny no doubt replied a soldier with a hearty laugh You see if a pig comes up and grunts at the flag we have a right to kill him for the insult offered Probably your pigs were guilty of this heinous crime and were sacrificed for the good of the country Do yo uns mean the Yanks hev em asked Calhoun Undoubtedly sonny What are you going to do about it Goin to tell dad replied Calhoun as he limped off for he pretended to be lame Calhoun found that the post was picketed much more strongly to the east than the west for Castalian Springs lay to the west and the Federals had no idea that an attack would come from that direction If attacked the Confederates would try to force the ford or they would come from the east For this reason Calhoun decided that Morgan should cross the river in between Hartsville and Castalian Springs and assault from the west There was a ferry two miles below Hartsville where the infantry could cross the river but the cavalry would have to go to a ford seven miles or within two miles of Castalian Springs To his surprise but great gratification he found neither the ferry nor the ford guarded Calhoun recrossed the river in safety and joining his scouts whom he had left on the southern side of the river he lost no time in making his way back to Murfreesboro Morgan heard his report with evident satisfaction Our only danger said Calhoun as he finished his report is from the force at Castalian Springs From what I could learn there are at least five thousand Federals there To be successful we must surprise the camp at Hartsville capture the place and re cross the river before the force from the Springs can reach us A hard thing to do but I believe it can be done So do I said Morgan with General Bragg s consent I will start at once General Bragg not only gave his consent but owing to the importance of the expedition added to Morgan s cavalry brigade two regiments of infantry and a battery The force marched to within five miles of Hartsville and halted until night The night proved very dark and the way was rough There was but one small ferry boat in which to cross the infantry and it was five thirty in the morning before the infantry were all across and in position two miles from Hartsville The cavalry had had even a rougher time than the infantry and one large regiment had not yet reported But Morgan determined not to wait for it would soon be light and they would be discovered So with thirteen hundred men Morgan moved to capture a Federal brigade of over two thousand and in a position of their own choosing To Calhoun and his scouts was assigned the difficult but important task of capturing the outposts without alarming the camp The success of the whole movement might depend upon this So adroitly did Calhoun manage it that the surprised pickets were captured without firing a gun Nor was the Confederate force discovered until they were within four hundred yards of the Federal camp and advancing in line of battle It was now getting light and a negro camp follower discovered them and gave the alarm The Federals having been taken by surprise and most of the officers and men being raw and inexperienced consternation reigned in the camp But they formed their lines and for a few moments put up a brave fight Then their lines broke Colonel Moore did not seem to have his brigade well in hand and each regiment fought more or less independently In a short time only the One Hundred and Fourth Illinois regiment was left on the site of the camp to continue the battle Although this regiment had been only three months in the service and had never been in an engagement before under the command of their brave Lieutenant Colonel Douglass Hapeman they did not surrender until they were entirely surrounded and nearly two hundred of their number had been shot down Morgan warmly complimented this regiment on its bravery saying if all the regiments had been like it the result of the contest would have been doubtful In one hour and a quarter after the battle opened all was over A whole brigade had laid down their arms to the prowess of Morgan But now a new danger arose Calhoun had been sent toward Castalian Springs to watch the enemy in that direction One of his scouts came dashing in with the intelligence that five thousand Federals were hurrying to the relief of Hartsville They must be stopped and time given to get the prisoners and munitions of war across the Cumberland Morgan hurried two regiments to where Calhoun and his little band of scouts were resisting the advance of the enemy The show of strength made halted the Federals and a precious hour and a half was gained In this time by almost superhuman efforts Morgan had succeeded in crossing the prisoners and his men to the south side of the Cumberland They were now safe from pursuit It was during the fight with the approaching reinforcements that an incident happened which caused Calhoun many hours of uneasiness During the hottest of the engagement a ball evidently fired from the rear grazed his cheek He thought little of it supposing some one had fired in his rear not seeing him But in a moment a ball passed through his hat Wheeling suddenly to his surprise he saw Captain Conway with a smoking revolver in his hand You are shooting carelessly Captain exclaimed Calhoun angrily riding up to him For a moment the Captain cowered then recovering himself he said You are mistaken Lieutenant it was some one in the rear The same balls came close to me Just then the order was given to fall back and Conway rode hastily away There was no direct proof but Calhoun was certain Conway had tried to kill him More than one man has been disposed of in time of battle by a personal enemy Many an obnoxious officer has bitten the dust in this manner Calhoun could only bide his time and watch But he now firmly believed his life was in more danger from Conway than it was in battle with the Federals Hartsville considering everything was one of the greatest victories Morgan ever won as he captured a whole brigade with a vastly inferior force The Federals lost in killed wounded and captured two thousand one hundred men Of these nearly three hundred were killed and wounded Morgan s actual force engaged was only thirteen hundred and of these he lost one hundred and forty a small loss considering he was the assaulting party The capture of Hartsville caused the utmost chagrin in the Federal army and not only in the army but throughout the North Even President Lincoln telegraphed asking for full particulars General Halleck ordered the dishonorable dismissal of Colonel Moore but the order was never carried into effect Of his bravery there was no question This victory caused the name of Morgan to be more feared than ever Morgan is coming was a cry which caused fear and trembling in many a Yankee s heart President Davis of the Confederate States shortly after the capture of Hartsville visited Murfreesboro and as a reward for his services presented Morgan with a commission as Brigadier General in the Confederate army General Hardie asked that he be made a Major General Hardie knew Morgan and appreciated his worth but for some reason President Davis refused the request CHAPTER XI MORGAN S SECOND GREAT RAID General Morgan was allowed but ten days rest after his return from his great victory at Hartsville General Rosecrans had finished repairing the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and trains were running again between the two cities Reports had been brought to General Bragg that the Federal troops at Nashville were suffering greatly for want of food that military stores of all kinds were short and he thought if the road were again broken Rosecrans would be forced to fall back on account of supplies Who so willing and able to break it as General Morgan But there was little use of trying to raid the road south of Bowling Green for it was guarded by thousands of men To cripple the road effectually meant another raid clear through the state of Kentucky To this General Morgan was not averse When his men heard that another raid was to be made into Kentucky their enthusiasm knew no bounds What cared they for the dangers to be encountered for long rides for sleepless nights and the tremendous fatigue they would be called upon to endure They were to stir up the Yankees once more that was enough Kentucky Ho for Kentucky was their cry and they shouted and sang until they could shout and sing no longer for want of breath Bragg was fully alive to the importance of the expedition and was willing to give Morgan all the troops he could possibly spare Morgan was soon at the head of the most formidable force he had ever commanded It consisted of over three thousand cavalry with a full battery besides his own light battery The task which had been assigned him was indeed a perilous one It was to ride almost to the very gates of Louisville and to destroy the immense trestle works at Muldraugh Hill This done the Louisville and Nashville Railroad would again be effectually crippled for weeks He set out from Alexandria on December twenty two and in two days he was in Glasgow Kentucky The citizens of Glasgow had come to look upon Morgan as a monthly visitor by this time therefore they were not surprised at his coming Here he met with the first Federal force which was quickly scattered Remaining in Glasgow only long enough to rest his horses he pushed on for Mumfordsville where the great bridge spans the Green River But learning that the place was held by so strong a force that it would be madness for him to attack it he passed a few miles to the right and struck the railroad at Bacon Creek Here a stout block house defended by ninety soldiers guarded the bridge They put up a stout defence in hopes of being reinforced from Mumfordsville but at last were compelled to surrender the block house being knocked to pieces by Morgan s artillery Burning the bridge and destroying four miles of road the command moved on to Nolan where another block house was captured and a bridge burned This was the third time that these bridges had been destroyed by Morgan Elizabethtown was the next goal to be reached As they approached the place Calhoun who was in advance with his scouts was met by an officer bearing a flag of truce who handed him a dirty envelope on which was scrawled ELIZABETHTOWN KY December twenty seven eighteen sixty two To the Commander of the Confederate Force Sir I demand an unconditional surrender of all of your forces I have you surrounded and will compel you to surrender I am sir your obedient servant H S SMITH Commanding U S Force Well exclaimed Calhoun as he glanced at it I have often been told that Yankees have cheek but this is the greatest exhibition of it I have met Who is H S Smith anyway One of the numerous Smith family I reckon dryly responded one of his men He should have signed it John Smith This would have concealed his identity and prevented us from knowing what a fool he is But the message was taken back to Morgan and Calhoun never saw him laugh more heartily than when he read it Go back and tell mister Smith replied Morgan trying to keep his face straight that he has made a little mistake It is he who is surrounded and must surrender The message was taken back but mister Smith answered pompously that it was the business of United States officer to fight not to surrender Very good replied Calhoun get back and let us open the ball It took only a few shells from Morgan s battery to convince mister Smith he had made a mistake and that it was the business of at least one United States officer to surrender and not to fight Six hundred and fifty two prisoners fell into Morgan s hands also a large quantity of military stores The stores were destroyed At Elizabethtown Morgan was in striking distance of the object of his expedition the great trestles at Muldraugh Hill There were two trestles known as the upper and lower both defended by stout stockades General Morgan divided his forces Colonel Breckinridge with one brigade attacking the lower stockade while Morgan with Colonel Duke s brigade attacked the upper A couple of hours of severe shelling convinced the commanders of these stockades also that it was the duty of a United States officer to surrender and not to fight Seven hundred more prisoners and an immense store of military goods were added to Morgan s captures The goods as usual were destroyed It was but a few minutes after the surrender of the block houses when the trestles were a mass of flames They were immense structures each nearly fifteen hundred feet long and from eighty to ninety feet high Thus the object of the expedition had been gained Again the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was rendered useless to Rosecrans s army But Morgan s danger had just commenced Thus far he had had his own way The enraged Federals were moving heaven and earth to compass his capture A brigade was transported from Gallatin to Mumfordsville by rail joined to the force at that place and ordered to move east and cut off his retreat The forces in Central Kentucky were ordered to concentrate at Lebanon Thus they hoped to cut off every line of retreat Don t let Morgan escape was the command flashed to every Federal officer in Kentucky From Muldraugh Hill Morgan marched for Bardstown This led him across the Lebanon Railroad Before all of his force had crossed the Rolling Fork of Salt River the pursuing force under Colonel Harlan came up and engaged the rear The rear guard under Colonel Duke gallantly resisted them until all had crossed in safety but during the action Colonel Duke was severely wounded by a piece of shell General Boyle the Federal commander at Louisville gave out that he had died of his wounds and there was great rejoicing But the gallant Colonel lived to the disappointment of his enemies The Federals in close pursuit left Morgan little time to destroy the railroad leading to Lebanon but he captured a stockade and burned the bridge at Boston Reaching Bardstown in safety he pushed rapidly on to Springfield From that place he could threaten either Danville or Lebanon His rapid movements puzzled the Federals and prevented them from concentrating their forces for they knew not which way he would go next From Springfield Morgan turned south leaving Lebanon a few miles to his left so as to avoid the large force at that place he reached New Market a few hours in advance of his pursuers To avoid the troops which had been concentrating at Hodgensville he now took the road to Campbellsville In going through the Muldraugh range of hills to the south of New Market his rear guard was struck by the advance of the Federals under Colonel Hoskins and was only beaten back after a lively fight There was now more or less skirmishing for some miles There now happened to Calhoun one of the most thrilling adventures he experienced during the whole war As the post of danger was now in the rear he was there with his scouts doing valiant service in holding back the Federals There had been no skirmishing for some time and nothing had been seen or heard of their pursuers Not thinking of danger he and a Captain Tribble halted their horses by the side of a bubbling spring and dismounted to get a drink the rest of the guard passing on They lingered longer than they thought and had just remounted their horses when they were suddenly surprised by three horsemen who came galloping up yelling to them to surrender For Calhoun and Tribble to snatch their revolvers and fire was the work of a moment The Federals returned the fire A pistol duel now took place and both sides emptied their revolvers but strange to say no one was hurt Throwing down their now useless weapons all drew their swords and furiously spurred their horses on to the combat It was almost like a mediaeval contest where knight met knight with sword only While one of the Federals engaged Captain Tribble two rode straight for Calhoun the foremost a fine looking man in the uniform of a Federal colonel Parrying his blow Calhoun by a skilful turn of his horse avoided the other They wheeled their horses and came at Calhoun again Again did Calhoun parry the fierce blow aimed at him at the same time he managed to prick the horse of the other so that for a moment it became unmanageable This left Calhoun free to engage the Colonel alone who aimed at him a tremendous blow This blow Calhoun avoided and as it met with no resistance its force threw the Colonel forward on his saddle As quick as lightning the point of Calhoun s sword reached his heart and the combat was over Illustration THE FORCE OF THE BLOW THREW THE COLONEL FORWARD ON HIS SADDLE During this time Tribble had vanquished his antagonist The remaining Federal seeing one of his comrades dead and the other a prisoner threw down his sword and surrendered The dead officer proved to be Colonel D J Halisy of the Sixth Kentucky cavalry This conflict was long remembered as one of the most remarkable ever engaged in by any of Morgan s men and Calhoun was warmly congratulated by the whole command on his prowess The death of Colonel Halisy seemed to dampen the enthusiasm of Morgan s pursuers Although they followed him to Campbellsville and from Campbellsville to Columbia the pursuit was a feeble one In fact so timid was Colonel Hoskins that he ordered his advance not to engage Morgan if they found him at Columbia but to wait for the column from Hodgensville to come up From Columbia all pursuit ceased and Morgan was left to return to Tennessee at his leisure While at Columbia Morgan reports that his men heard distinctly the sound of distant cannonading away to the southwest To their accustomed ears it told of a battle raging It was the thunder of Rosecrans s cannon at Stone River Little did Morgan s men think at that time that that distant thunder meant that hundreds of their brave brothers were being slaughtered in that fatal charge of Breckinridge Murfreesboro is as the crow flies a hundred and eighteen miles from Columbia In no other battle during the war is it reported that cannonading was heard so far From Columbia Morgan proceeded by easy stages to Smithville Tennessee which he reached January five just fourteen days after he had started on his raid from Alexandria During this time his command had travelled fully six hundred miles This raid was one of the most remarkable Morgan ever made when we consider what he accomplished and the number of troops that tried in vain to capture him Riding within a few miles of thousands of men he easily eluded all his pursuers and escaped almost scot free General Morgan in summing up the results of this raid says It meant the destruction of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad from Mumfordsville to Shephardsville within eighteen miles of Louisville rendering it impassable for at least two months the capture of eighteen hundred and seventy seven prisoners including sixty two commissioned officers the destruction of over two million dollars worth of United States property and a large loss to the enemy in killed and wounded The loss of my entire command was killed two wounded twenty four missing sixty four It seems impossible that so much could be accomplished with so slight a loss The number of his killed and wounded shows that the Federals touched him very gingerly that they did not force the fighting In the capture of the stockades in which he took so many prisoners Morgan suffered hardly any loss as he forced the surrender with his artillery But the joy which Morgan and his men felt over the success of the raid was clouded when they reached Tennessee by the news of the result of the battle of Stone River Murfreesboro no longer belonged to the South Bragg had retreated to his new line along Duck River CHAPTER XII A SPY A SPY For nearly six months after the battle of Stone River the Federal army made no general advance General Rosecrans made his headquarters at Murfreesboro while Bragg s was at Tullahoma But these months were not months of idleness Almost daily skirmishes took place between the lines and there were a number of contests which arose to the dignity of battles Morgan s cavalry protected the right of Bragg s army His headquarters were nominally at MacMinnville but it could truly be said they were in the saddle Morgan did not stay long in any one place A number of expeditions were made against him sometimes with a whole division but he managed to elude them with slight loss Only twice during all this time did severe reverse overtake him once at Milton when he failed in his efforts to capture a brigade of infantry and again at Snow Hill when he was charged by a whole division of cavalry under the leadership of General David Stanley His captures of scouting and forage parties were numerous during these months and he added a long list of prisoners to those he had already captured But so strongly was every place held and so numerous had become the Federal cavalry it was impossible to make any large capture The enemy had learned by bitter experience that eternal vigilance was their only safety in guarding against Morgan and the troops which held the left of Rosecrans s army were always in fear No Federal soldier was safe half a mile outside the lines Bitterly did many sleepy soldiers curse him for at three o clock every morning they were forced to get up and stand at arms until broad daylight The Federal officers wanted no more surprises But in spite of all their vigilance Morgan would swoop down and carry off prisoners from under their very noses These months were busy ones for Calhoun he and his scouts were always on the go At the battle of Milton he greatly distinguished himself and was the subject of a complimentary order But during the battle he received a slight flesh wound in the arm and the ball came from the rear Again was Conway behind him The thought that he might be slain in this treacherous manner was distracting but what could he do He durst not complain such a monstrous charge against a brother officer would have to be substantiated by the best of proof He could only avoid Conway as much as possible during battle and hope for the best After the battle at Milton by reason of losses in the regiment Conway was promoted being appointed major It was fortunate for Calhoun that he was chief of scouts and on Morgan s staff or Conway would have made his life a burden for he was a member of the regiment of which Conway was major One day Calhoun being sent on special duty over to the left of Bragg s army found himself in Columbia He now remembered what Captain Haines had told him of the misfortunes which had befallen the Osbornes and he determined to visit them As he approached the place a sigh escaped him for the plantation no longer was blooming like a rose and the splendid mansion house was a charred mass of ruins He found the family living in a small house which once had been occupied by the overseer Their story was soon told After Lieutenant Haines had been exchanged he came back and was stationed at Columbia He visited them frequently was very attentive to Miss Osborne and at last asked her to become his wife He was very politely but firmly refused He now began a series of petty persecutions and was forbidden the house as a guest Then he began to threaten He reported to the commander that Osborne s house was the headquarters of a gang of guerrillas which gave the Federal authorities in Columbia and Pulaski a great deal of trouble About this time the murder of General Robert McCook by guerrillas greatly angered the Federals A few days after he was killed a couple of foragers from Columbia were found dead Lieutenant Haines lost no time in reporting that the gang of guerrillas sheltered by Osborne had murdered the men A party was sent out who burned the house took away everything of value in the shape of stock and arrested mister Osborne who was afterwards sent North as a prisoner Calhoun listened to the recital with flashing eyes The villain he exclaimed if I had only known this he would not have escaped so easily when we captured him at Gallatin That is not all continued missus Osborne in a broken voice After all this had happened the scoundrel had the effrontery to renew his suit and say if Emma would marry him he would see that mister Osborne was released that he had powerful political friends who could accomplish this We spurned his proposition as it deserved I knew my husband would rather rot in prison than consent to such a monstrous thing Oh had I known had I known exclaimed Calhoun pacing up and down the room in his excitement but we may meet again Little did Calhoun think that before many days they would meet again and that that meeting would nearly mean for him the ignominious death of a spy A few days after his return from Columbia he asked the permission of Morgan to visit Nashville I would like to see said he what our friends the enemy are doing in that city Morgan shook his head I don t want to see you hanged he replied But Calhoun argued so zealously that at last Morgan s scruples were overcome and he gave his consent but added If you should be captured and executed I would never forgive myself Calhoun looked upon it as a mere holiday affair he had passed through too many dangers to be terrified Taking half a dozen of his trusty scouts with him he had no trouble in reaching the Cumberland River a few miles above Nashville The few scouting parties of the enemy they met were easily avoided He ordered his scouts to remain secreted in a thick wood near by a friendly house from which they could obtain food for themselves and provender for their horses If I am not back in three days said he return to Morgan and tell him I have been captured His men pleaded with him to let at least one of them accompany him but this he refused saying it would but add to his danger From the gentleman who resided in the nearby house he secured a skiff which had been kept secreted from the lynx eyed Federals In this Calhoun proposed to float down to Nashville Night came dark and cloudy It was just such a night as Calhoun wished Clad in a suit of citizen s clothes and with muffled oars he bade his comrades a cheerful good night and pushed out into the river and in a moment the darkness had swallowed him up He floated down as noiselessly as a drifting stick In an hour s time the lights of Nashville came in view the dangers of his trip had just commenced He knew that the banks of the river would not only be strongly patrolled but the lights from the shore and from the steamers moored at the wharfs shone across the stream in places making it impossible for an object the size of his boat to pass without being noticed But Calhoun was prepared for just such an emergency He was a capital swimmer and had no fears of the water He had weighted his skiff with stones bored a hole in the bottom and filled it with a plug which could easily be removed When he had drifted as far as he dared he removed the plug The skiff gradually filled and at last sank If any person had looked after it disappeared all he would have seen would have been the small branch of a tree covered with leaves floating down with the current When Calhoun was well down abreast of the city and coming to a place where shadows covered the river he turned toward the bank Fortunately he landed near a dark alley which led down to the water Listening intently he heard nothing and making his way up the alley he soon came to a street A violent storm came on which was of advantage to him for if he met any one it would account for his dripping clothes It also had the effect of driving the patrol guards into shelter Calhoun was no stranger in the city He had visited it frequently when a boy for he had an uncle residing there now a colonel in the Confederate army But his family still resided in the old home and he knew that there he would find a haven of safety Carefully making his way and dodging the few guards that he met he soon reached the house The yard was inclosed with a high iron fence the pickets provided with sharp points But Calhoun had been in the army too long to be baffled by any such obstacle He mounted the fence with but little trouble and dropped down into the yard Making his way to the rear of the house he found refuge in a small shed The night had turned cool and he shivered with the cold But he durst not arouse the household for the alarm might be heard outside The hours passed wearily by but at last morning came He looked eagerly for some of the family to appear but only the colored servants passed in and out To escape being seen he had hidden behind a large box in the shed He heard the call for breakfast and concluded he had never been so hungry before in his life After a while his patience was rewarded A young lady came out of the house and entering the shed began looking around as if searching for something It was his cousin Kate Kate he whispered The girl started and looked wildly around Kate She uttered a little scream and turned as if to flee Kate don t be afraid It is I your cousin Calhoun Pennington Where Where she half whispered looking eagerly around and poised as if still for flight Here behind the box Come close There don t ask a question Get the servants out of the way and smuggle me into the house unseen I am wet cold and hungry Kate flew to do his bidding In a few moments she came out and beckoned to him and right gladly he followed her into the house One risen from the dead would hardly have created more surprise than did his appearance His aunt and Kate persisted in embracing him wet and dirty as he was To their eager questions he said Dry clothes first Auntie and breakfast I am famished I will then talk with you to your heart s content missus Shackelford had had a son about the size of Calhoun killed in the army and our hero was soon arrayed in a nice dry suit and seated before a substantial breakfast upon which he made a furious assault When his hunger was fully appeased he informed his aunt and Kate he was ready to talk And how they did talk They had a thousand questions to ask and he had full as many To his surprise and joy he learned that his cousin Fred Shackelford had not been killed by his fall over the cliff as Major Hockoday reported Instead he was alive and well was with the army at Murfreesboro and frequently visited them He has been a good friend to us said missus Shackelford but at one time he was nearly the death of Kate Why how was that asked Calhoun Then for the first time he heard of Forrest s plot to capture Nashville and of Kate s part in it of her condemnation and imprisonment as a spy and how Fred had secured her pardon two Calhoun listened to the story in wonder When it was finished he exclaimed Why Kate you are a heroine I am proud of you I am not proud of myself answered Kate I blush every time I think of how how I lied and deceived Oh that is a part of war laughed Calhoun If Morgan didn t lie about the number of men he had the Yanks would gobble him up in no time We don t call such things lying it s a righteous deceiving of the enemy But I am ready to sink into the earth with shame every time I think of Ainsworth sighed Kate That s rich laughed Calhoun crying because you broke the heart of a Yankee Kate I have a mind to send you into the enemy s lines If Cupid s darts were only fatal your bright eyes would create more havoc than a battle No use sending her away broke in missus Shackelford there are more Federal officers buzzing around her now than I wish there were Mighty useful to worm secrets from exclaimed Kate but I make no promises to any of them That s right Kate get all the secrets from them you can said Calhoun that is what I am in Nashville for Can any one get around the city without much danger Oh yes in the daytime but there is always more or less danger to strangers Business is going on as usual The city is lively livelier than before the war but it is soldiers soldiers everywhere And you have to have no passes asked Calhoun It is best to have one Most of us have standing permits to come and go in the city as we please Can you get me a permit asked Calhoun eagerly There is Jim Grantham replied Kate thoughtfully his description will suit Calhoun close enough I can get Jim to loan you his Calhoun was now told that the Southern people in Nashville were thoroughly organized into a secret society They had their signs and pass words so that they could know each other So far no one had proved a traitor The Federal authorities suspected that such an organization existed but their shrewdest detectives never succeeded in finding out anything about it Kate who had gone for the permit of James Grantham soon returned with it The description fitted Calhoun almost as well as if made out for himself He could now walk the streets of Nashville with little fear of arrest He was given a list of those who could most probably give him the information he desired He marvelled to see how quickly a little sign which he gave was answered and was amazed at the work this secret organization was doing Not a regiment entered or left Nashville but they knew its exact strength and to what point it was ordered In two days Calhoun had gathered information which would be of vast value to the Confederate cause and it was now time for him to see by what means he could leave the city He was on his way to see three gentlemen who said they could get him outside of the city without trouble or danger when an incident happened which came near sending him to the gallows He was walking unconcernedly along the street when he suddenly came face to face with Haines now a captain Although Calhoun was dressed in citizen s clothes the captain knew him at a glance A spy A spy he yelled at the top of his voice and made a grab at Calhoun Calhoun struck him a tremendous blow which sent him rolling in the gutter and fled at the top of his speed But a score of voices took up the cry and a howling mob mostly of soldiers were at his heels He hoped to reach the river where among the immense piles of stores heaped along the levee or among the shipping he might secrete himself but a patrol guard suddenly appeared a block away and his retreat was cut off He gave himself up for lost and reached for a small pistol which he carried with the intention of putting a bullet through his own heart for thought he they shall never have the pleasure of hanging me before a gaping crowd Just then he saw two young ladies standing in the open door of a house What told him safety lay there he never knew but hope sprang up within his breast Dashing up the steps he thrust the ladies back into the house slammed the door to and locked it So rude was his entrance one of the ladies fell to the floor Save me Save me he cried I am a Confederate spy and he gave the sign of the secret order The young lady who had not fallen was terribly frightened but she grasped the situation in a moment Upstairs she gasped pointing the way tell mother the secret place Calhoun lost no time in obeying her The girl flew to the back door and opened it then back just as her sister was rising her face covered with blood for she had hit her nose in falling Quick Annette in the parlor said her sister assent to everything I say Annette staggered into the parlor hardly knowing what she did for she was dazed and terribly frightened The sister whose name was Inez was now at the door which was giving way before the blows of Calhoun s pursuers All this happened in less than a minute Stop she cried I will unlock the door and she did so and when the soldiers rushed in crying Where is he Where is the spy she stood wringing her hands and sobbing My sister Oh my sister he has murdered her The words brought the soldiers to a halt Who murdered your sister asked a sergeant who seemed to be the leader The man the man who ran in here Where is he He is the fellow we want He rushed out of the back door Oh my sister my sister After him boys don t let him get away yelled the sergeant and they rushed through the house in hot pursuit The house was rapidly filling when a captain appeared and learning of the sobbing Inez what the trouble was said Murdered your sister Horrible where is she Here said Inez leading the way into the parlor Annette was reclining on a sofa her face bloody she was apparently in a fainting condition The captain acted quickly He ordered the house to be cleared sent a subordinate for a surgeon and another to have the whole block surrounded In the mean time the mother of the girls had appeared and was adding her sobs to those of her eldest daughter When the surgeon came and had washed the blood from Annette s face her only injury was found to be a bruised nose Both the captain and the surgeon looked inquiringly How is this they asked you said your sister was murdered I I thought she was stammered Inez I saw the blood and thought the man had stabbed her Tell us just what happened said the captain Annette who had by this time so far recovered from her fright as to comprehend what was going on saw Inez give her the signal of danger It put her on her guard Why it was this way said Inez in answer to the captain sister and I were going out but just as we opened the door there was a tumult on the street We stopped to see what the trouble was when a man dashed up the steps We tried to oppose him but he struck sister a cruel blow knocking her down flung me backward and slamming the door to locked it then running through the house disappeared through the back door Seeing sister s face covered with blood I picked her up and carried her into the parlor By this time the soldiers were breaking down the door and I went and unlocked it Annette only knew that she tried to oppose the entrance of a strange man who knocked her down She must have been rendered unconscious for she remembered nothing more until she found herself lying on the sofa in the parlor The mother missus Lovell was upstairs and knew nothing of what had happened until alarmed by the screams of her daughters and the noisy entrance of the soldiers These stories so accorded with the known facts that the captain did not for a moment doubt them But when the sergeant returned and reported that no trace of the fugitive could be discovered he was puzzled Orders were given to search every house in the block This was done but the search was fruitless When this fact was reported the captain bit his lip in vexation Then turning to Inez he said Pardon me Miss Lovell while I do not doubt your story in the least are you sure the fellow ran out of the house Was not his opening the back door just a ruse He opened the door and then dodged into some room thinking this house the safest place for him Every house in the block has been searched except this one and we can find no trace of him While I regret it I shall be compelled to have this house searched I am sure he ran out answered Inez but I confess I was very badly frightened If you think he is in the house search it I ask as a favor that you search it for if he is concealed in the house as you think he may murder us all A thorough search was made but there was found no trace of Calhoun The officers and soldiers retired greatly puzzled A strong guard was maintained around the block for three days then all hopes of catching Calhoun were given up and the guard was withdrawn The Federal authorities had become aware who the fugitive was through Captain Haines I cannot be mistaken he said I have met him too many times He is one of the most daring of all of Morgan s cutthroats and then he gave an account of his first meeting with Calhoun But where was Calhoun all this time When he rushed upstairs at the command of Inez he was met at the top by missus Lovell who started in affright at the sight of him Your daughter said The secret place he exclaimed as he gave her the sign of danger My pursuers are already at the door The lady quickly recovered herself Come she said and led Calhoun into a room Here she began working in a corner Her hands trembled as she did so for the soldiers were thundering at the door downstairs and she could hear it giving way To Calhoun s intense surprise a section of the apparently solid wall gave way leaving an opening large enough for a person to enter by crawling on his hands and knees Quick go in said the lady Calhoun needed no second bidding but crawled in and the wall slowly came back to place Calhoun found himself in a narrow place between the wall of the room and the side of the house The house had been built with a mansard roof on the sides thus leaving a space This space was about three feet wide at the bottom coming to a point at the top Close under the eaves where it would not be noticed an aperture had been left for the admission of air and through it a ray of light came Narrow and contracted as his quarters were to Calhoun they were more welcome than a palace It was plain that the place had been occupied before for on the floor there were soft blankets and in feeling around Calhoun discovered a jug of water and some provisions It was evident that no one who was put in there hurriedly was to be allowed to suffer from thirst or hunger Calhoun could hear every word which was said when the soldiers searched the room His heart stood still when he heard them sounding the walls but they gave forth no uncertain sound and the soldiers departed much to his relief It was not until the next day that Calhoun was allowed to leave his hiding place and then he was told he must not leave the room He had to be ready to seek his refuge at a moment s notice if found necessary For three days he was virtually a prisoner then the guards around the block were withdrawn Word was taken to his aunt and Kate where he was They had been in an agony of fear over his non return But they durst not visit him To missus Lovell and her daughters Calhoun felt he could never repay what they had done for him He felt like a brute when Annette was introduced to him her pretty features disfigured by a swollen nose and when he was making his most abject apologies she interrupted him with a gay laugh I am proud of that nose she exclaimed as proud as a gallant soldier of his wounds for does it not show that I have shed my blood for our beloved South We are of the opinion that during his enforced imprisonment Calhoun would have lost his heart to Annette if he had not learned she was engaged to a gallant officer in Bragg s army What troubled Calhoun the most was the thought that his scouts would return to Morgan with the news that he was captured but there was no help for it After the guards had been withdrawn he at once began to make plans for his escape from the city The original plan had to be given up for the vigilance of the Federals had been redoubled and it was impossible for any one to leave the city without his identity being fully established At last Inez clapped her hands I have it she cried Get him out to doctor Caldwell The doctor lives clear on the outskirts of the city and on the bank of the river Lieutenant Pennington can take to the river going as he did coming But he can t float up stream said Annette and as for a boat that will be impossible He can swim said Inez swim across the river He will be above the pickets around Edgefield But how can he get to doctor Caldwell It is not safe for him to appear on the street Not a guard but has a description of him said the careful Annette doctor Caldwell is attending missus Robinson the Robinsons lived next door it will be easy for the doctor to take him in his buggy no guard will think of disturbing the doctor he is too well known Calhoun eagerly caught at the idea When doctor Caldwell visited missus Robinson during the day he was seen and consented to the scheme Muffle him up he said he will be taken for one of my patients Before Calhoun left he wrote a letter and directed it to Captain Haines Regt This Inez promised to mail when Calhoun was well out of the city doctor Caldwell had no trouble in taking Calhoun to his home Here he stayed until dark then bidding the hospitable physician good bye he plunged into the river and was soon across and began to make his way slowly up the northern bank But the night was dark and after many falls and bruises he concluded to wait for daylight Having made himself a bed of leaves beside a log he was soon sleeping as peacefully as if no dangers were lurking near As for Captain Haines he was bitterly disappointed when Calhoun was not caught But his leave of absence was out and he had to return to his regiment near Murfreesboro A day or two after his return the following letter came with his mail NASHVILLE TENN April twenty five eighteen sixty three To captain Chas Haines My Dear Captain When you receive this I shall be well out of Nashville We have already met three times and I trust we may meet once more If we do it will be our last for one or the other of us will die I know of your damnable treatment of the Osbornes Be assured it will be avenged Sincerely yours CALHOUN PENNINGTON Lieutenant Morgan s Command Captain Haines was no coward but his hand trembled like a leaf when he laid the letter down CHAPTER XIII UNDER ARREST Calhoun did not wake until the light of the morning sun was sifting through the branches of the trees He arose stiff and somewhat chill but the day promised to be a warm one and a little exercise put a delightful heat through his body All he lacked was a good breakfast and he must not look for that until he had crossed the river he was yet too close to Nashville to try to cross it Then he must secure a horse and where would he be so likely to secure one as at the home of mister Edmunds the gentleman of whom he had obtained the skiff and who had given him all possible aid He had no hopes of finding his men for at the end of three days they would return to Morgan taking his horse with them He slowly made his way up the river dodging two or three scouting parties until he thought he must be nearly opposite to where mister Edmunds lived The place seemed favorable as there were woods on both sides of the river so he determined to cross But if he had known it he had selected a very dangerous place A road which led down to the river was but a few yards in front of him and it was one of the places to which the Federal cavalry came as they patrolled the bank of the river Just as he was about to remove some of his clothing which he would carry over on his head as he swam the stream he was startled by the sound of horses hoofs and he hastily concealed himself in a thicket Soon a Federal sergeant accompanied by two soldiers came down the road and riding near the edge of the river dismounted Here is the place said the sergeant What are we to do here asked one of the men Keep watch to see if any Johnny attempts to cross the river answered the sergeant but I doubt if we see anything larger than buzzards and we can t stop them The men made themselves comfortable and lay in the shade smoking their pipes Calhoun was considering the proposition whether he could not quietly withdraw and flank them without being seen when one of the men said Sergeant let me go to that house we passed and see if I cannot get a canteen of milk It will go good with our hardtack You can both go replied the sergeant I guess I can stop any one who attempts to cross the river while you are away But don t be gone long The men quickly availed themselves of the opportunity and mounting their horses rode away The sergeant stretched himself on the ground and lazily watched the river Now was Calhoun s time He had secured a good revolver when he left Nashville This he had kept dry when he swam the river by wrapping it in his outside clothing which he had made into a bundle and carried over on his head Taking the revolver in his hand ready for instant use he cautiously crept up on the sergeant Illustration HE CAUTIOUSLY CREPT UP ON THE SERGEANT That individual leaped to his feet as if he had springs when he heard the stern command Surrender He reached for his weapon but suddenly stopped when he saw he was looking into the muzzle of a revolver Hands up Be quick about it The hands of the sergeant slowly went above his head Pardon me but I will relieve you of this said Calhoun as he took a revolver from the belt of his prisoner and tossed it into the river Up to this time the sergeant had not said a word but now he exclaimed with the utmost disgust How thundering careless of me Sergeant Latham you are no good you ought to be reduced to the ranks Oh don t feel too bad about it better men than you have been caught napping replied Calhoun consolingly But no bigger fool To be gobbled in like this and by a blamed skulking citizen too Now if Rest your mind there if it will make you feel any better broke in Calhoun I am no civilian I am Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Morgan s command You don t say replied the sergeant apparently much relieved Lieutenant allow me to introduce myself I am Sergeant Silas Latham We have had the pleasure of meeting before Where asked Calhoun in surprise Down in Tennessee when you got away with Lieutenant Haines s horse so slick Calhoun s face darkened Did you have anything to do with the persecution of the Osbornes he asked threateningly Not I That was the blamedest meanest trick I ever knew Haines to do But he was dead gone on the girl I half believe he would have turned Reb if he could have got her I saw Haines the other day remarked Calhoun Where asked the Sergeant In Nashville I had the pleasure of knocking him down The Sergeant chuckled Served him right He threatened to have me reduced to the ranks because I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself the way he persecuted that girl Are you in his company now No he is the captain of another company Glad of it Sergeant Latham I would like to continue this conversation but time presses Give me your parole and I will be going By gum I won t do it exclaimed Latham with energy If you want to take me prisoner take me But do you think I am going sneaking back to camp with the story that I let one Johnny gobble me No sir not by a jugful Latham you are a character Can you swim Never learned when a boy Will your horse carry double asked Calhoun No he is a poor swimmer he would drown us both Latham I am afraid I shall have to shoot you I don t see any other way to get rid of you Latham thought a moment and said Let me ride the horse across and you swim A brilliant idea declined with thanks Latham scratched his head as if for an idea Perhaps I can hang on by the horse s tail he remarked hesitatingly That s better It s either a parole the tail or death Which shall it be I will take the tail All right but you must give me your word of honor that you will hang on Like grim death answered Latham Come then I have fooled away too much time already Marching his prisoner up to where his horse was tethered Calhoun took Latham s sword and carbine which hung to the saddle and pitched them into the river after the revolver Mounting the horse Calhoun said Now no fooling The slightest attempt on your part to escape and I shall shoot you without compunction of conscience I am not fool enough to run when there is a revolver at my head growled Latham Nevertheless you will bear watching I am of the opinion you are a slippery customer You just walk by my side here until we reach deep water They entered the river Latham wading quietly by the side of the horse until the water became so deep the horse began to plunge Now grab his tail commanded Calhoun and he watched Latham until he had taken a firm hold of the horse s tail and was in water beyond his depth For the Lord s sake keep his head above water shouted Latham from behind as the horse made a fearful plunge For the next few minutes Calhoun had enough to do without looking to see what had become of Latham The horse as the Sergeant had said proved a poor swimmer Twice he came near drowning but at last managed to struggle through When he got to where the water was shallow enough for the horse to wade Calhoun looked around to see how Latham had fared To his surprise he saw that worthy leaning against a tree on the bank from which they had started and apparently he had been watching the struggles of the horse in the water with a great deal of satisfaction Calhoun hardly knew whether to laugh or get angry Riding to the edge of the water he turned his horse around and yelled over You are a pretty fellow you are Like most Yankees your word of honor is worthless Did just what I said I would yelled back Latham You did not You told me you would hold on that horse s tail like grim death And so I did I am holding on to it yet and to Calhoun s surprise Latham shook a large piece of the horse s tail at him He had neatly severed it Calhoun shook with suppressed laughter but assuming a severe tone he said You lied to me like a Turk anyway you miserable Yankee you told me you could not swim I told you no such thing you skulking Rebel yelled back Latham wrathfully Come back here and fight me like a man and I will wallop you until you can t stand for calling me a liar I would have you know I am a member of the church in good standing Didn t you tell me you couldn t swim No I told you I had never learned to swim when a boy When did you learn to swim After I became a man Calhoun exploded Say Latham he cried I forgive you You are the slickest Yankee I ever met I must be going for I see your men are coming Ta ta Calhoun turned and urged his horse up the bank but not in time to escape having two balls sing uncomfortably close to his head Sergeant Latham had little trouble in recovering his arms from the river as the water was not deep where Calhoun had thrown them The Sergeant made the following report of the affair to his superior officer Sir I have the honor to report that a Rebel scout crossed the Cumberland to day near the post where I was stationed I followed him into the river but my horse being a poor swimmer I was forced to abandon him in mid stream to save myself SILAS LATHAM Sergeant The capture of Latham s horse and the ludicrous affair with him put Calhoun in the best of humor He reached the house of mister Edmunds without further adventure and met with a hearty welcome from that gentleman who informed him that his men had lingered a day longer than he had ordered in the hope that he would return After satisfying his hunger Calhoun bade his kind host good bye and without trouble reached Morgan s camp that night Here he was received as one snatched from the jaws of death for they had given him up as lost The valuable information which he had collected was forwarded to General Bragg and in due time an acknowledgment was received from that general warmly congratulating him and saying he had recommended him for a captaincy It was but a few days after his return that Calhoun was with a regiment reconnoitring near Braddyville when they were suddenly attacked by a whole brigade of Federal cavalry The engagement was a spirited one but owing to the superior numbers of the Federals the Confederates were forced to fall back During the retreat Calhoun with his scouts was holding back the advance of the enemy They were furiously charged by two companies of the Federals and a hand to hand conflict took place During this combat Calhoun became engaged with a Federal captain and to his surprise he saw that his antagonist was Captain Haines The recognition was mutual and it must have unnerved the hand of the Captain for although but a few feet from Calhoun he fired and missed him Before he could fire again Calhoun dashed his empty revolver into his face The force of the blow caused him to reel in his saddle and before he could recover Calhoun had cut him down The bloody repulse of these two companies cooled the ardor of the Federals and the Confederates withdrew without further molestation Major Conway noted Calhoun s growing popularity with the command and his hatred if possible grew more bitter The sting of the blow he had received still rankled in his heart and he swore sooner or later to have his revenge His attempts to assassinate Calhoun in time of battle so far had failed and Calhoun s extreme wariness now usually kept them apart during an engagement The crafty Major was busily thinking of some other scheme by which he could kill Calhoun without bringing suspicion on himself when an incident happened which he thought would not only cause Calhoun to die a most disgraceful death but redound greatly to his own credit Calhoun was out with his scouts when he fell in with a small party of the enemy As he outnumbered them he thought their capture was easy But he was met with such a rapid and accurate fire that his men were forced to fall back Them Yankees have repeating rifles growled one of his men and they know how to shoot This was true and Calhoun was thinking of withdrawing from the fight entirely when he caught sight of the leader of the Federals The horse which he rode he would know among ten thousand It was Prince the famous horse of his cousin and the rider must be Fred Ordering his men to cease firing Calhoun tied a white handkerchief to the point of his sword and rode forward Fred for it was he rode out to meet him As soon as he came within hearing distance he asked Do you surrender Surrender nothing answered Calhoun a little disgusted If you only knew how many men I had back there you would think of surrendering yourself I simply came out to have a little talk with you Cal as sure as I live exclaimed Fred and in a moment the two cousins had each other by the hand forgetting they were enemies remembering only their love for each other They had much to say to each other and talked longer than they thought but were about to part mutually agreeing to withdraw their men when they were startled by the sound of rapid firing Looking up they saw that Fred s men were being charged by a large force of Confederates They were in full retreat firing as they galloped back Fred was alone in the midst of his enemies The Confederates proved to be a full squadron in command of Major Conway He was accompanied by Captain Mathews No sooner did they see Fred than they shouted in their delight The hoss is mine again cried Mathews And this spy and sneak is in my power at last exclaimed Conway pointing at Fred and what is better I have you my fine fellow said Conway turning to Calhoun I have long known that you were holding treasonable conferences with the enemy and have only been waiting for indubitable proof I have it now Lieutenant turning to one of his officers arrest Lieutenant Pennington and on your life see that he does not escape The enormity of the charge dumbfounded Calhoun He could scarcely believe his ears He began to protest but was cut short by Conway who ordered the Lieutenant to take an escort of ten men and to conduct Calhoun straightway to General Bragg at Tullahoma Tell the General he said that I have positive proof of Lieutenant Pennington s treasonable intercourse with the enemy The case is so important I thought it best to send the prisoner direct to him As soon as I see General Morgan I will file formal charges The Lieutenant seemed surprised at his orders to take Calhoun direct to Bragg but he said nothing and choosing his escort was soon on the way to Tullahoma with his prisoner Major Conway s real object in sending Calhoun to Tullahoma was to bring the case directly to the notice of General Bragg and thus compel Morgan to take action He knew that his charge would not be believed in Morgan s command but he would see that there was plenty of evidence at the right time Disarmed under arrest charged with the most heinous offence of which an officer could be guilty it is no wonder that Calhoun s heart sank within him on that dismal journey to Tullahoma Better to have been hanged as a spy by the Federals than to be shot as a traitor by my own men he muttered to himself The thought of dying such a disgraceful death was maddening When he arrived at Tullahoma his reception by General Bragg was not exactly such as he had expected Bragg was noted as a martinet and a great stickler for military forms When the lieutenant who had Calhoun in charge reported to him and told him the verbal message which Major Conway had sent he flew into a furious rage What does Major Conway mean by sending a prisoner to me with such a message as that he sputtered What is General Morgan about that he has not attended to this and presented his charges in due form Officer take the prisoner to General Morgan and tell Major Conway to read up on army discipline If it had endangered his whole army Bragg would have contended for rigid adherence to military law When Bragg s order was reported to Calhoun hope began to revive Surely Morgan would give him a fair hearing Every act he had done in the army would disprove the monstrous charges of Major Conway It was with a much lighter heart that he set out for MacMinnville But when he reached that place he was surprised by the astonishing news that Conway had been shot killed while in the act of murdering his cousin in cold blood One of the men who was with Conway at the time was mortally wounded and confessed the whole thing Conway was to prepare a paper which they were to swear was found on Fred s person criminating Calhoun With such evidence his conviction would have been certain He thanked God for the death of Conway It meant a thousand times more to him than life for it kept his name unsullied Morgan made a full report of the whole matter to General Bragg The plot was damnable he wrote yet it might have been successful if Major Conway had not met his just deserts But one might as well accuse me of holding treasonable communications with the enemy as Lieutenant Pennington He is the officer as you may remember that entered Nashville a short time since and sent you such a valuable report Moreover he is the very officer I have chosen to look into that matter which we have discussed so much I expect to send him North next week Thus was Calhoun fully exonerated and not only that but he was to be chosen for a most important mission He also had the satisfaction of seeing Morgan make Captain Mathews return Fred his horse much to the Captain s disgust But what was the important duty upon which Calhoun was to be sent North He had heard nothing of it before Some time before the honorable C L Vallandigham a noted Democratic politician of Ohio and an ex member of Congress had been arrested at his home in Dayton for treason He was tried by military court martial found guilty and banished South The excitement was intense Thousands of his friends rallied to his defence and at one time it looked as if the streets of Dayton would run red with blood His friends were in open revolt against the government and opposed the prosecution of the war Before this numerous reports had reached the South of the dissatisfaction of a large number of the Democratic party with Lincoln especially with his proclamation freeing the slaves They were sick and tired of the war and were more than willing to give the South her independence They were ready to force Lincoln to do this A secret society known as the Knights of the Golden Circle existed throughout the North and was most numerous in the states of Illinois Indiana and Ohio The purpose of this society was to resist the draft encourage desertions from the army embarrass the government in every way possible and if necessary resort to arms Already numerous small encounters had taken place between the Knights and the militia of these states It was the boast of the Knights that they had a quarter of a million men armed and drilled ready to take the field If a Confederate force would only invade the North their ranks would be augmented by these thousands It was to investigate these reports and find out the truth that Calhoun was to be sent North CHAPTER XIV THE KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE No one was more surprised than Calhoun when told that he had been selected to go North on a secret and most important mission General Breckinridge and I have selected you said Morgan because we have confidence in your sagacity bravery and discretion We know no one better fitted to intrust this delicate and perhaps dangerous mission to than yourself But I am so young said Calhoun while I gladly accept the honor which I feel you have bestowed upon me would not one older and more experienced than I do better Your youth is one of the main reasons why we have chosen you replied Morgan A youth like you will not excite suspicion half as quickly as a man Then I am more than willing to go answered Calhoun and trust that the confidence you repose in me will not prove to have been misplaced I have no fears on that score answered Morgan I know that you will succeed if any one can The General then fully explained what was required of him Calhoun listened in silence I think I fully understand what you want of me General but how am I to approach these Knights of the Golden Circle How am I to find out who are Knights That has already been provided for answered Morgan We are now ready to initiate you into a camp of the Golden Circle Does the order exist down South too asked Calhoun in surprise Certainly to some extent was the answer If not how could we know the secrets of the order You are willing I suppose to take the oaths required If there is not anything in them to hinder me from being a true son of the South replied Calhoun I assure you there is not for I have taken them said Morgan but you must bear in mind this is a Northern order its chief purpose to overthrow the Lincoln government its chief cornerstone is States Rights The honorable C L Vallandigham who was lately sent into our lines for disloyalty but who has now found a refuge in Canada is the Supreme Commander of the order No truer friend of the South exists than Vallandigham He believes in the doctrine of secession The North is sick and tired of the war and wants to put a stop to it and let the South go in peace This is the purpose of the order All right said Calhoun I am ready to join any order that has that for its purpose Calhoun was conducted to a tent where to his surprise he met quite a number of the officers of the command There was one stranger present a gentleman in civilian dress Calhoun was told that he was from the North was a high officer in the order and that he would conduct the initiatory ceremonies When Calhoun issued from that tent he was a full fledged member of the Knights of the Golden Circle But he had taken only the first degree The other degrees were to be given to him after he had arrived in the North After having fully learned the signs grips and passwords of the order Calhoun was ready for his journey He now received his final instructions from Morgan and Breckinridge It did not take Calhoun long to see that while these gentlemen were willing to use the order they had the utmost contempt for it All nations use traitors and despise them at the same time The Knights of the Golden Circle were traitors to their section Calhoun felt this and loathed the men with whom he was to mingle but if they could help the South to secure her independence it was all he asked He like the noble Major Andre of Revolutionary fame was willing to risk his life for the cause he loved Andre failed and suffered an ignominious death but his fame grows brighter with the centuries while the traitor Arnold is still abhorred Here is a belt containing ten thousand dollars in United States money said Morgan handing him a belt You will need it our money don t go in the North Whew you must have had your hand in Lincoln s strong box said Calhoun as he took the money Morgan smiled as he answered A Yankee paymaster don t come amiss once in a while Calhoun was next given an official envelope which he was to hand to General Forrest who was then operating in Northern Mississippi and Western Tennessee You will receive full instructions from Forrest continued Morgan what to do and how to get through the Yankee lines We have concluded to send you by the way of Western Tennessee as you will not be so apt to meet with any Federal officer who might know you Now go and may success attend you Calhoun took his chief s hand His heart was too full to say a word A strong grasp and he was gone He had no trouble in finding General Forrest who carefully read the papers that Calhoun handed him He then scanned Calhoun closely from head to feet I reckon you understand the purport of these papers he said in rather a harsh voice I suppose they relate to sending me through the lines answered Calhoun Well I can send you through young man but you are going on a fool s errand I have had a good deal to do with those Knights of the Golden Circle as they call themselves They are all right in giving away everything they know but when it comes to fighting bah one of my companies would lick ten thousand Then you haven t much faith in the fighting qualities of the Knights said Calhoun with a smile Faith Not I They are Yankees mere money grabbers Ask one of them for ten dollars and he will shut up as tight as a clam But they worry the Lincoln government and keep up a fire in the rear therefore they should be encouraged You will find them a scurvy lot to deal with though How soon can I start North asked Calhoun To night answered Forrest I am the president of an underground railroad took my cue from the Abolitionists when they were engaged in running our niggers through to Canada I have a regular mail North I will send you through with one of the carriers I reckon I had better send your credentials by a second carrier It might be awkward if you were captured with them You must leave here dressed as a citizen and bear in mind that your name is W B Harrison Where shall I find my credentials asked Calhoun At Mount Vernon Illinois which is the terminus of my railroad at present Inquire for Judge Worley Once in his hands you will be all right If all the Knights were like him there would be something doing but he is a Kentuckian no whining Yankee Calhoun had heard much of General Forrest and during his interview with him studied him carefully He put him down as a man of indomitable energy of great courage and possessing military genius of a high order On the other hand he was illiterate rough in his language and lacked the polish of a cultured gentleman which Morgan possessed But there was a magnetism about him which drew men to him If I were not riding with Morgan I should surely want to be with Forrest thought Calhoun Night came and Calhoun was introduced to the mail carrier who was to be his guide He was a thin wiry man named Givens In age Calhoun put him down at about forty The few days during which Calhoun was with Givens gave him a very high opinion of the guide s bravery and sagacity Givens related many of his hairbreadth escapes during their journey and seemed to treat them as great jokes During the entire journey through Tennessee and Kentucky Givens kept to unfrequented roads and in the darkest night rode as one entirely familiar with the way At every place they stopped they seemed to be expected A man would take their horses and in the evening when they started they would find fresh horses provided Givens informed Calhoun that these stations were a night ride apart and that at each a relay of horses was kept concealed in the woods I now understand said Calhoun what an underground railroad means If the Abolitionists had as complete a one as you no wonder they were so successful in getting away with our slaves Givens chuckled as he answered They did I know all about it was in the business myself You asked Calhoun in surprise and he instinctively recoiled from the man A man has to do something for a living growled Givens I got so much for each nigger I ran off He then refused to discuss the subject further One night as they were travelling at a rapid gait a low tremulous whistle came from the side of the road Givens reined in his horse so quickly that he fell back on his haunches He answered the whistle in the same low tremulous note A man stepped from the bushes into the road and spoke a few words to Givens in a low tone Givens turned to Calhoun and said Yanks ahead We will have to go round them Under the guidance of the man they turned into a path through the woods The way was rough and Givens swore roundly because they were losing time A good sized stream was reached which they had to swim They emerged from it wet and out of humor Givens cursing the Yankees to his heart s content He explained that it eased his mind When the road was reached their guide bade them good bye and disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared Givens and Calhoun now urged their horses to their utmost speed in order to reach their next stopping place by daylight But do the best they could the sun was an hour high before they reached their haven of rest Luckily they met with no one and they felt safe One more night and we shall reach the Ohio said Givens when they dismounted after a long wearisome night ride But it was destined that they should not reach the Ohio the next night for they had not ridden more than five miles after they had started before they were brought up with the sharp command Halt Who comes there Citizens without the countersign answered Givens without a moment s hesitation and then to Calhoun Wheel and run for your life They both turned and clapped spurs to their horses but not before the sentinel had fired Calhoun heard a sharp exclamation of pain and turning his head saw Givens tumble from his horse He had carried his last mail There was no time to halt for Calhoun heard the rapid hoof beats of horses in pursuit Coming to a cross road he sprang from his horse and struck him a vicious blow which sent him galloping wildly down the road In a moment a squad of Federal cavalry passed in swift pursuit Calhoun breathed freer after the trampling of their horses died away in the distance But he was alone without a horse and in a strange country He was now thankful that Forrest had not sent his credentials with Givens Calhoun made his way slowly on foot turning into a road which led in the direction which he wished to go All through the night he plodded and when morning came he found he was close to a large plantation He determined to make himself known Placing his revolver in his bosom where he could get it in a moment he boldly went up to the house Fortunately he met the owner of the plantation who saluted him with Heah git off of my place or I will set the dogs on you I want no tramps around heah Calhoun glanced at himself and did not wonder he had been mistaken for a disreputable character His night s walk had made sad havoc with the looks of his clothes The road was muddy and he had fallen down several times Rather in desperation than thinking it would do any good he made the sign of recognition of the Knights of the Golden Circle To his surprise it was answered Who are you and why do you come in such a plight asked the gentleman Calhoun s story was soon told And you are one of Morgan s men said the gentleman whose name was Cressey I have a son with Morgan and he gave his name One of my scouts replied Calhoun delighted Calhoun had indeed found a friend and a place of refuge The next night with a good horse and guide Calhoun was taken to a house but a short distance from the river The farmer who owned the house was to take a load of produce into Mount Vernon that day Calhoun could easily go with him without exciting suspicion This was done and before noon Calhoun free and unsuspected was walking the streets of Mount Vernon Shortly after dinner he inquired for the office of Judge Worley and was shown the most pretentious law office in the little city Entering he inquired for the Judge and was told that he was in his private office Tell him that a gentleman wishes to see him on very important business said Calhoun A clerk bade him be seated and disappeared He returned in a moment and said the Judge would see him at once When Calhoun entered the private office he saw seated at a desk a dignified looking gentleman about sixty years of age who eyed him sharply and Calhoun was sure a look of disappointment came over his face This then was the gentleman who wished to see him on very important business hardly more than a boy He did not even ask Calhoun to be seated but said in a cold voice Well what do you want Be in a hurry for I am very busy This was not the kind of reception Calhoun was looking for Gulping down his indignation he said I am just from the South I was directed to come to you who would prove a friend Ah some one must have taken an unwarranted liberty with my name While he was saying this Calhoun was aware a pair of steel gray eyes were trying to read his very soul Is that all at length continued the Judge I have no time to give you as I told you I am very busy and he dismissed his visitor with a wave of the hand As a last resort Calhoun gave the sign of recognition of the Knights of the Golden Circle There was no recognition instead a testy Why don t you go Calhoun s face flamed with anger but controlling himself he replied When you receive some mail from the South you may find some dispatches from General Forrest which will cause you to treat me differently If such dispatches come be here in your office at nine o clock to night When Calhoun mentioned mail from the South and General Forrest the Judge turned pale and Calhoun fancied he made a motion as if to stop him but the young man paid no attention to the signal and strode indignantly from the office No sooner was he gone than the Judge turned eagerly to a pile of mail which he had just received and which the coming of Calhoun had interrupted him in reading Hurriedly running over the letters he picked out one and opened it with nervous fingers It was written in cipher Opening a secret drawer in his desk he took out the key to the cipher and began the translation of the dispatch As he did so he gave vent to his surprise in various exclamations Lieutenant Calhoun Pennington of Morgan s staff will go by name of W B Harrison comes North to fully investigate conditions If favorable will invade North Pennington is member of K G C The Judge laid down the letter and seemed to be gazing into vacancy He was thinking thinking hard At last he picked up the letter and read it through to the end Then he made preparations to go out I shall not be back again this afternoon he said to his clerk as he passed out You can lock up the office when you leave I shall not need you this evening When Calhoun called that evening he was met at the door by the Judge and given a reception much different from that he received in the afternoon I am glad to see you Lieutenant said the Judge and he raised his hand as if in military salute but was careful not to touch his forehead And I am rejoiced to make the acquaintance of Judge Worley replied Calhoun raising his hand as if to shade his eyes from the light They then advanced and grasped each other by the hand the fore finger of each resting on the pulse of the other Nu said Calhoun Oh responded the Judge Lac answered Calhoun Nu oh lac they then both said together Thus were they introduced to each other as members of the Knights of the Golden Circle The Judge was now profuse in his apologies for his treatment of Calhoun at their first meeting The fact is said the Judge we are surrounded by Lincoln spies on every hand Some of them have gained admittance into the order One cannot be too careful Then your youth misled me I am now surprised that one so young should be selected for so important a commission No apology is needed said Calhoun I confess I was indignant at first but I now see you were right in receiving me as you did Have you received General Forrest s letter yet Yes and it makes all plain By the way I see that your name is Calhoun Have you ever noticed our password particularly No you must bear in mind I am a new member Read your name backwards said the Judge with a smile Calhoun did so and exclaimed in surprise Nuohlac Why it s my name spelled backwards Aye and it is the name of the greatest American who ever lived exclaimed the Judge with enthusiasm I trust that you honor the name Would that John C Calhoun were alive now What a glorious day it would be for him But his spirit lives lives and thank God there is no Andrew Jackson in the presidential chair Lincoln seems to have more nerve than I wish he had answered Calhoun Lincoln is an ignoramus a filthy story teller a monster Seward is the brains of the administration Without Seward Lincoln would be nothing Calhoun thought it wise not to dispute with the Judge so he changed the subject by asking the number of Knights of the Golden Circle in the state That under my oath I cannot give answered the Judge I see by General Forrest s letter that you have taken only the first degree of the order That entitles you to very little information It is the duty of those who take only this degree to obey not to question General Forrest advises that the other degrees be given you as soon as possible I have already made arrangements to have you initiated into the second and third degrees this evening That is as high as we can go here The Judge here looked at his watch and said it was time to go Calhoun accompanied him to a room over a saloon the Judge explaining that they had selected the place so as not to excite suspicion by so many men passing in and out Calhoun found at least fifty men assembled and when he was introduced as one of Morgan s men he received a perfect ovation Hurrah for John Morgan shouted one enthusiastic member and the cheers were given with a will Three cheers were then given for Jeff Davis followed by three groans for Abe Lincoln Calhoun could scarcely believe his ears Was this the North He could well believe he was in the heart of the South The object of the meeting was stated and Calhoun was duly initiated into the second and third degrees There was no mistaking the nature of the society its object was the overthrow of the Lincoln government But resistance to the draft was the main thing discussed Their hatred of even the name of Lincoln was shown in every word Calhoun now armed with the proper credentials was told that to obtain the information which he sought he would have to visit the Grand Commander of the state who was a doctor Warrenton of Springfield Calhoun marvelled that the head officer of such an order should reside under the very shadow of the state capitol The next day found Calhoun in Springfield It was full of Federal soldiers and from almost every house a United States flag was flying It did not look like a very promising place for opposition to the Federal government but Calhoun afterwards learned that the place was honeycombed with members of the Knights of the Golden Circle Calhoun was received by doctor Warrenton with the greatest caution and it was only after he was fully satisfied that his visitor was what he represented himself to be that the Doctor consented to talk Be frank with me said Calhoun John Morgan is contemplating a raid in the North and he wishes to know whether in that case he can expect any aid from this order and if so to what number The Doctor seemed to be fired with the idea of Morgan making a raid but said If you are to be given the full information you ask for you must be initiated into the fourth degree of the order That is a degree which but very few take and can be given only with the consent of the Supreme Commander The Grand Commanders of the different states meet the Supreme Commander in Canada next Tuesday This is Friday You had better attend that meeting as your mission is very important Why meet in Canada asked Calhoun Because it is safer and and we want to meet the Supreme Commander of the order Ah I understand said Calhoun mister Stop on your life mention no names Our oaths forbid it I stand corrected answered Calhoun humbly It was arranged that Calhoun was to accompany doctor Warrenton to Canada but the Doctor warned him that on the cars they must be to each other as strangers When we reach Detroit said the Doctor go to the Russell House and register as from Chicago Write Chicago Chic I think I will go through to Chicago this evening said Calhoun I should like to make some investigations there you can meet me there Monday So it was arranged the Doctor giving him the names of half a dozen men in that city whom it might be well for him to see But mind said Warrenton do not tell any one of Morgan s contemplated raid That must be a secret Calhoun spent two days in Chicago and what he saw and learned there surprised him more than ever Opposition to the Lincoln government was everywhere The leading newspaper boldly demanded that the war be stopped boastingly proclaimed that there would soon be a fire in the rear that would bring Lincoln to his senses Resistance to the draft was openly talked on the streets It was even hinted that there was a secret move on foot to liberate the prisoners at Camp Douglas and burn the city This is proving interesting thought Calhoun the whole North seems to be a seething volcano ready to burst forth into flames yet something seems to smother the flames Calhoun had an inkling of what smothered the flames when representing himself as a young Englishman he asked a Federal officer why the government permitted such open talk of treason The officer smiled as he answered It is better for them to talk than act The government has its eye on them As long as they only talk it lets them alone The first overt act will be crushed with a heavy hand Then Calhoun remembered what both Worley and Warrenton had told him that government spies were in the order and that they knew not whom to trust Would the spies of the government find out who he was and his mission It was not a very comforting thought CHAPTER XV OHO NE OHO NE OHO NE Monday Calhoun left for Detroit doctor Warrenton was on the train but they met as strangers When he reached the city and went to register at the Russell House a gentleman was carelessly leaning against the desk talking with the clerk He did not appear to notice Calhoun but he had caught the word Chic after his name After a few moments the gentleman approached Calhoun and said Pardon me but is not this mister Harrison of Kentucky My name is Harrison answered Calhoun but if you would examine the register you would see I am from Chicago Ah yes I understand and he gave the secret sign of the order Come he continued and let me introduce you to some friends He led the way to a room where there were several gentlemen seated smoking and talking among them doctor Warrenton who gave him a warm greeting I have been telling them about you said Warrenton and they are all anxious to meet you The Doctor then introduced Calhoun to each member of the party There was Wrightman of New York Bowman of Indiana Hartman of Missouri Bullock of Kentucky and others You don t tell me you are the son of my old friend Judge Pennington of Danville asked mister Bullock as he shook Calhoun warmly by the hand The very same answered Calhoun Gentlemen we need have no fears of Lieutenant Pennington exclaimed mister Bullock addressing those present I will vouch for him with my life Let s see your name is now Harrison for the present answered Calhoun with a smile The party had no trouble in getting across the river and that night there was a meeting in Windsor which boded ill for the Federal government The Supreme Commander of the order was a gentleman in the full vigor of manhood He was polished in his manner rather reserved but every action showed that he was accustomed to command Behind it all Calhoun thought that he detected the signs of an inordinate ambition an ambition which would stop for nothing Isn t he grand whispered doctor Warrenton to Calhoun A fit representative to wear the mantle of your great namesake Better say the mantle of Aaron Burr thought Calhoun but he wisely did not give expression to his thought The object of Calhoun s coming was fully explained and it was decided by a unanimous vote that he should receive the fourth degree and thus be entitled to all the information which he wished The degree was duly conferred on him Calhoun was now certain he was among a band of conspirators who would stop at nothing to achieve their ends Is this the highest of the degrees asked Calhoun when he was through The party exchanged meaning glances and then the Supreme Commander said There is one more degree but it is given only to the highest officers in the order and would not be of the least advantage to you Calhoun was certain there was something which those present did not wish him to know some object which they wished to keep secret The number of members in the order was now given to Calhoun The figures astounded him In Iowa there were twenty thousand members in Missouri fifty thousand in Illinois one hundred and twenty thousand in Indiana one hundred thousand in Ohio eighty thousand Throughout the East the order was not so numerous This seemed strange to Calhoun for he thought that New York especially would be fertile ground for it How many of these men are armed asked Calhoun The answer was In Missouri nearly all in Illinois fifty thousand in Indiana forty thousand in Ohio the same in Kentucky nearly all Gentlemen exclaimed Calhoun with considerable warmth if these figures are correct why have you not arisen before this and hurled the Lincoln government from power Pardon me but it looks like timidity The North is denuded of men those loyal to Lincoln are in the army That is what I have insisted on cried mister Bowman of Indiana jumping to his feet in his excitement I say strike strike now We of Indiana are ready Liberate the Confederate prisoners in Northern prison pens We have arms for them If necessary give every Northern city over to the flames Brother Bowman forgets answered the Supreme Commander that our forces are scattered that if we attempt to concentrate the government will take alarm and crush us At present we have to work in secret But what if Indiana and Ohio should be invaded asked Calhoun That would be different was the answer What if you should be successful in your plans asked Calhoun Let the South go free We firmly believe in the doctrine of States Rights was the answer Would your states cast their lot with the South asked Calhoun eagerly Again there were meaning glances among the leaders It is yet too early to answer that question slowly replied the Supreme Commander or even to discuss it The overthrow of the present Abolition government and the independence of the South is now our object But had the leaders a further object Calhoun resolved to find out and he did The conference at Windsor was over It was resolved that the order should everywhere be strengthened and that it should strike at the first favorable opportunity That opportunity would come at once should the North be invaded From Detroit Calhoun went to Columbus Ohio from there to Dayton the home of Vallandigham He found that that gentleman was the idol of that section They wanted him to come home They swore they would defend him with their lives The whole country reeked with disloyalty to the Federal government Calhoun availed himself of the opportunity of talking with all classes of citizens He especially tried to get at the feelings of the humbler members of the Knights of the Golden Circle why they joined the order and what they proposed doing All the information he gleaned he treasured up From Dayton Calhoun proceeded to Indianapolis where he was to meet mister Bowman He found Indiana much better organized than any of the other states Bowman was enthusiastic and he seemed to hate the Lincoln government with his whole soul He would stop at nothing to achieve his ends But the especial object of his hatred was Governor Morton I want to live long enough he said to see that tyrant hanged for trampling on the constitution of the state Calhoun found that the Knights stood in great dread of Morton They declared he had a way of finding out every secret of the order If he had not been thoroughly guarded his life would not have been worth a farthing Calhoun was taken into the country where he witnessed the drilling of two or three companies of Knights These meetings always took place at night in some secret place and sentinels were posted to guard against surprise Calhoun talked with many of the members to get their ideas and to find out what they wished to accomplish What do you think asked Bowman of Calhoun after they had returned to Indianapolis I have forty thousand of those fellows Will they fight asked Calhoun Fight Of course they will fight was the answer Let Morgan get into the state and you will see At Indianapolis Calhoun met with a wealthy farmer named Jones who lived near Corydon He had no words too severe to say of Lincoln and boasted of the number of Knights in his part of the state We are going to sweep the Black Abolitionists from the earth he exclaimed boastingly and hang Old Abe and Morton too What would you do if Morgan came asked Calhoun Do I would throw my hat in the air and yell until I was hoarse was the answer What if Morgan should want some of your horses asked Calhoun mister Jones s countenance fell At length he mumbled Of course he would pay me for them Of course replied Calhoun in a tone which the old gentleman did not quite understand Just before Calhoun was ready to leave Indianapolis Bowman told him Morton was to hold a reception and asked him if he would not like to attend and see the great War Governor Nothing would suit Calhoun better He had a desire to see the man of whom he had heard so much a man who had the majority of his legislature against him yet held the state as in the hollow of his hand a man who borrowed hundreds of thousands of dollars in his own name that the soldiers of his state might be thoroughly equipped He had overcome every difficulty and held his state firmly for the Union Now with thousands of the citizens of the state secretly plotting against him he moved serenely along the path he had marked out Urged to adopt the most severe measures he knew when and when not to make an arrest He avoided angering his enemies except when the public safety demanded it His very name caused every member of the Knights of the Golden Circle to tremble Little did Calhoun think that when he promised to attend the governor s reception that Morton s detectives were already looking for him The renewed activity of the Knights had aroused the Governor s suspicions and he was not long in finding out the cause To locate and arrest the Southern officer who was causing the ferment was his order to his detectives A large crowd attended the reception and in such a gathering Calhoun felt in no danger He saw in Morton a thickset heavy man with a massive head and brain He looked every inch the intellectual giant that he was The grandest figure thought Calhoun that I have seen in the North He is a man to beware of No wonder the Knights stand in fear of him When Calhoun passing along in the throng took the Governor s hand Morton bent his piercing look upon him and the question came as if shot out of his mouth Where from young man The suddenness of the question threw Calhoun off his guard and almost involuntarily he answered From Kentucky From Kentucky eh And how goes it down there Calhoun was himself again Of course he answered we are greatly divided in that state but all the powers of Jeff Davis cannot tear it from the Union Good pass on and the Governor turned to the next in line But a feeling as of impending danger took possession of Calhoun Why that question to him He had heard it asked of no other Could it be he was suspected Forcing his way through the throng he got out of the building as soon as possible It was well that he did so for hardly had the Governor let go Calhoun s hand when he motioned to General Carrington and whispered to him Arrest that young man Do it as quietly as possible but see he does not get away He is the Southern officer we have been looking for I am sure I have a full description of him General Carrington in turn whispered to a couple of quiet looking men dressed in citizen s clothes who stood near the Governor They nodded and started after Calhoun who was now nearly lost to view in the crowd Once out of the building Calhoun found that hundreds of spectators had gathered out of curiosity They were hurrahing for Lincoln and Morton and shouting for the Union and some were singing We ll hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree Rapidly pushing his way through this mob he reached the outer edge of the circle Here groups of men were standing but they were not hurrahing Instead their looks were dark and surly and it was plain they were not enjoying the proceedings Just as Calhoun reached these groups a heavy hand was laid on his shoulder and a stern low voice said You are our prisoner better come quietly and make no disturbance And in a trice Calhoun felt each of his arms grasped by strong hands He was powerless in the iron grip by which he was held if help there was it must come from the outside Oho ne Oho ne Oho ne The despairing cry cleft the night air like a knife It fell on the astonished ears of hundreds who did not understand it But to those groups of silent sullen browed men it came as the call of a trumpet summoning them to duty Oho ne Oho ne they answered and before the surprised officers could draw a weapon could raise a hand to defend themselves they were beaten down and their prisoner snatched from them The alarm was raised and a company of soldiers came on the run with fixed bayonets scattering the crowd right and left But when they reached the spot they found only a couple of half dazed and bleeding officers They could only say they had been set upon knocked down and their prisoner taken from them By whom they did not know for it was dark and the crowd had dispersed When the onset came Calhoun felt himself grasped by the arm and a voice whispered Follow me quick Into the darkness Calhoun dashed following his guide In the shadow of buildings through dark alleys they ran At last they came to a part of the city where only a lamp gleamed here and there They stopped running both exhausted their breath coming in quick gasps Illustration INTO THE DARKNESS CALHOUN DASHED FOLLOWING HIS GUIDE We are safe now said the guide but it was a close shave for you What did they arrest you for To hang me answered Calhoun with a shudder I am a Confederate officer I thought you must be some big gun or old Morton wouldn t have tried to arrest you in that crowd but don t worry you are all right now His guide whose name proved to be Randall soon came to a house which he said was his home and he exclaimed none of Abe Lincoln s minions will ever find you here I have sheltered more than one escaped Confederate prisoner from that infernal pen out there called Camp Morton It should be called Camp Hades Calhoun was ushered into the house and shown a room Sleep soundly and without fear said mister Randall Calhoun took his advice but before he went to sleep he did not forget to return thanks for his escape and he also had a great deal more respect for the Knights of the Golden Circle than he had had before The next morning the papers came out with a full description of Calhoun telling of his escape and saying he was a famous spy The article ended with the announcement that so important did the government consider his person that a reward of one thousand dollars would be paid for his recapture Calhoun now knew that his work was done in the North The only thing that remained for him was to get out of it as secretly as possible Two days afterwards he was conveyed out of the city concealed in a farmer s wagon He was passed on from the hands of one true Knight to another and at the end of three days he found himself on the banks of the Ohio a few miles above Madison In the darkness of the night he was rowed over and his feet once more pressed the soil of his native state In his ecstasy he felt like kissing the ground for was it not the soil of Kentucky At the house of a true Southerner he found refuge His measure was taken into Carrolton where a tailor made him a fine uniform Purchasing a horse of the gentleman with whom he stayed he bade him good bye and sprang into the saddle The sun had just set and the whole west glowed with the beauty which we ascribe to the Golden City In the midst of the gold hung the new moon like a silver bow See see cried Calhoun the new moon I saw it over my right shoulder It means good luck And while the happy omen still gleamed in the west he galloped away CHAPTER XVI CALHOUN MAKES HIS REPORT By keeping off the main roads and avoiding the towns Calhoun had no trouble in making his way back into Tennessee He had been gone nearly a month and was glad to see his old command who gave him a royal welcome He was showered with questions as to where he had been but to each and every one he would laugh and say Be glad to tell you boys but can t Thought you had deserted us said his scouts Not till death replied Calhoun I was on a secret mission The General knows where I was It s all right then but mark my word there will be some deviltry going on shortly one of them remarked sagely As General Breckinridge was greatly interested Calhoun did not make his report until that General could meet with Morgan Then Calhoun gave a detailed account of all he had seen and heard He was listened to with breathless attention His report agrees perfectly with all I have heard remarked Breckinridge much pleased I have had a dozen different agents in the North and they all agree But you have not given us your own conclusions Lieutenant said Morgan It might seem presumptuous in me answered Calhoun By no means let us hear it replied both generals Calhoun thus entreated gave the conclusions he had formed not from what had been told him by the leaders of the Knights of the Golden Circle but from his own observations He was listened to with evident interest Your conclusions seem to be at utter variance with all that was told you and every fact given said Breckinridge You admit that dissatisfaction in the Democratic party is almost universal over the way the war is being conducted you say that we have not been deceived regarding the numbers of the Knights of the Golden Circle that there are eighty thousand of the order in Indiana alone of whom forty thousand are armed as you know every member of that order has taken an oath not to take up arms against the South that they believe in states rights that they will resist by force the tyranny of the Federal government and yet you say it is your belief that if General Morgan should invade the state not a hand would be raised to help him I cannot understand it I will try to make myself plain said Calhoun The Democratic party is sick and tired of the war and want it stopped They believe we can never be whipped and in that they are right But they love the Union revere the old flag They indulge the vain hope that if the war were stopped the Union might be restored We know how foolish that hope is I speak of the rank and file Many of their leaders are notoriously disloyal but they deceive the people with fine words They make the party believe that if the Republican party were only defeated things would be as they were As to the Knights of the Golden Circle the great mass who join it are told it is only a secret political society They scarcely comprehend its oaths they are kept in ignorance of the real motives of the order These Knights hate the party in power with a bitter hatred They are friendly to the South believe we are right but mark my word they will not fight for us They are armed but their idea is to resist the draft Go among them to day and not one in a thousand would enlist to fight in the Southern army Fighting is the last thing they want to do for either side For these reasons I conclude that if General Morgan invaded Indiana he would receive no direct aid from the Knights of the Golden Circle I confess these conclusions are entirely different from what the leaders told me As for the leaders they are heart and soul with us They want us to succeed If they dared they would rise in revolt to morrow They are doing all they can without open resort to arms to have us succeed But they are a band of conspirators They want us to succeed because they want utterly to destroy the Federal Union They want to break loose and form a Northwest Confederacy They dare not tell their followers this but it is what they are working for When Calhoun had stated his opinion both Breckinridge and Morgan asked him many questions He was then dismissed Unknown to Calhoun there were three or four other Southern officers present who had also been in the North They were called in and questioned on the points raised by Calhoun Every one differed with him They believed that if an opportunity were presented the Knights would rise almost to a man at the call of their leaders Breckinridge and Morgan held an earnest consultation Morgan was greatly disappointed over Calhoun s report for he had set his heart on making a raid into Indiana and Ohio He believed it would be the greatest triumph of his life and with the Northwest in open revolt the independence of the South would be assured Lieutenant Pennington must be mistaken said Breckinridge My acquaintance in the North is extensive and I believe my friends there will do just as they say they will Before Morgan and Breckinridge parted it was fully agreed that Morgan should make the raid But when the subject was broached to Bragg that general absolutely refused to sanction it He gave Morgan permission to make a raid into Kentucky and capture Louisville if possible That was as far as he would go and even with that object in view he limited Morgan s force to two thousand Morgan apparently acquiesced in this decision of his commander but in his heart he resolved to disobey if when he neared Louisville he found conditions at all favorable for the invasion of Indiana Some time had passed since Morgan had made a raid and the news that they were again to ride north probably clear to Louisville was welcomed by the rough riders To them a raid was but a holiday It did not take Morgan long to prepare His men were always ready to move To Louisville was the cry we want to call on George D meaning George D Prentice the editor of the Louisville Journal In all probability few men in the Confederate army knew that Morgan was on another raid until he was well on his way This time he entered Kentucky farther east than was his custom and the first intimation the Federals had that he was in the state he was crossing the Cumberland River at Burkesville This was on the second day of July The alarm was given The frenzied Federals telegraphed right and left for troops to head off Morgan It was thought that he intended to strike the Louisville and Nashville Railroad again at his favorite place Bacon Creek General Judah hurried from Tompkinsville with a brigade to head him off but his advance under General Hobson was struck at Marrowbone and hurled back This left Morgan an open road to Columbia and that place fell an easy prey on the threed Leaving General Hobson to pursue Morgan General Judah hurried back to Glasgow to bring up another brigade But General Judah never overtook Morgan until days afterwards and then he caught him at Buffington Island As for Hobson he stuck to Morgan s trail as an Indian sticks to the trail of his enemy He followed him all through Kentucky all through Indiana all through Ohio never but a few hours behind yet never in striking distance until Buffington Island was reached After leaving the forces of Judah and Hobson in the rear Morgan had nearly an open road to Louisville The fourth found him at the crossing of Green River on the road between Columbia and Campbellsville Here a portion of the Twenty fifth Michigan under Colonel Moore was strongly fortified and a charge made by Morgan was bloodily repulsed As both Judah and Hobson were close in his rear it would take too much time to bring these determined men to terms and so Morgan much to his regret was forced to leave them and pass on The fifth of July found him at Lebanon The garrison under Colonel Hanson fought desperately but was forced to capitulate and Lebanon with all its stores and three hundred and fifty prisoners was again in Morgan s hands The next day found him at Bardstown where twenty five men of the Fourth Regular Cavalry under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Sullivan threw themselves into a livery stable strongly fortified it and refused to surrender Here Morgan made a mistake He should have left them and passed on but angered that he should be defied by so few men he determined to capture them and it delayed him twenty four precious hours So enraged were his men over what they considered the obstinacy of the brave little band that they began to misuse the prisoners but Morgan stopped them saying The damned Yankees ought to be complimented on their pluck Never in any of his raids had Morgan met with so fierce resistance as on this one Cut to the quick by the numerous criticisms which had been published in Northern papers that cowardice prompted nearly every one of the surrenders to Morgan these troops fought long after prudence should have caused them to surrender From Bardstown Morgan moved to Shepherdsville He was now within striking distance of Louisville Here it was that he fully decided if he had not done so before upon the invasion of Indiana instead of attempting the capture of Louisville At Shepherdsville he was on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad where a long bridge spans the Salt River But he did not stop to capture the garrison which guarded the bridge nor did he attempt to burn it time was too precious Instead he rode straight west and on the ninth was in Brandenburg Before him rolled the Ohio River beyond lay the green hills of Indiana It was the first time he had led his men clear to the Ohio River The sight of Yankee land aroused them to the utmost enthusiasm They would have attempted to cross if ten thousand foes had opposed them Calhoun had had the advance into Brandenburg with instructions to sweep through the place stopping for nothing and to capture any steamboats which might be at the landing This he did Far in advance of the main body he galloped into the town to the astonishment and dismay of its citizens Two small steamboats were lying at the landing and before the terrorized crews could cut the hawsers and drift out into the stream Calhoun and his men were on board and the boats were theirs The means of crossing the river were now in Morgan s hands But a fresh danger arose A gunboat came steaming down the river from Louisville and opened fire Morgan brought every piece of his artillery into action and for two hours the battle raged Then the gunboat discomfited withdrew and went back to Louisville leaving the way open There was now nothing to prevent Morgan from crossing the river CHAPTER XVII THE PASSING OF THE RUBICON Who can tell the thoughts of John H Morgan as he sat on his horse that July day and with fixed gaze looked out upon the river Beyond lay the fair fields of Indiana the Canaan of his hopes Should he go in and possess The waters needed not to be rolled back He had the means of crossing Before him all was calm peaceful No foe stood on the opposite bank to oppose him no cannon frowned from the hilltops Behind him were thousands of angry Federals in swift pursuit Would it be safer to go ahead than to turn back As Caesar stood on the bank of the Rubicon debating what to do so did Morgan stand on the bank of the Ohio Like Caesar if he once took the step he must abide the consequences But if there was any hesitation in the mind of Morgan he did not hesitate long Cross over was the order which he gave We shall soon know he said to Calhoun whether they are friends or foes over there whether the forty thousand Knights who were so anxious for me to come will appear or not Now to look upon the invasion of Indiana and Ohio by Morgan seems like sheer madness He had a force of only a little over three thousand and the states which he invaded had millions of population But he had reasons to believe that thousands of that population were friendly to him would welcome him with gladness When he so nearly escaped though no hand was raised to help him what would he have accomplished if only a few thousand had come to his relief That there were thousands in the two states who would have flocked gladly to his standard if they had dared there is no doubt But the hand of the government was too strong for them to resist The fires of loyalty burned too fiercely to be quenched by them With all their boasted strength the Knights of the Golden Circle were powerless when the supreme moment came The order to cross the river was hailed with enthusiasm by every man in Morgan s command Where they were going they knew not cared not they would go where their gallant leader led He had never failed them he would not fail them now They knew only that they were to invade the land of their enemies that was enough The war was to be brought home to the North as it had been to the South Calhoun caught the fever which caused the blood of every man to flow more swiftly through his veins He had been full of doubts he trembled for the results if that river were once passed He had been through the North and noted her resources how terribly in earnest her people were that the Union should be saved What if there were thousands of traitors in their midst There were enough loyal men left to crush them What if the state of Indiana was honeycombed with camps of the Knights of the Golden Circle The lodges of the Union League were fully as numerous He now forgot all these things Did not the Knights come to his relief in his hour of sore distress Surely they would not forget their oaths when Morgan came So he tossed his hat in the air and shouted Boys over there is Yankee land we will cross over and possess it The order to cross once given was obeyed with alacrity In an incredibly short time the three thousand men and horses were ferried across the river Burn the boats was Morgan s order The torch was applied and as the flames wrapped them in their fiery embrace lo on the other side came the eager troopers of Hobson Like beasts baffled of their prey they could only stand and gnash their teeth in their rage Between them and Morgan rolled the river and they had no means of crossing Why don t you come across Yanks Morgan s men shouted in derision Got any word you want to send to your mammy We are going to see her they mockingly cried And thus with taunt and laugh and hurrah Morgan s men rode away leaving their enemies standing helpless on the farther bank Twenty miles to Corydon said Calhoun as he galloped with his scouts to the front to take the advance I wonder if I shall meet my friend Jones and whether when he sees us he will throw his hat on high and give us a royal welcome If he spoke the truth the bells of Corydon will ring a joyful peal when the people see us coming and we shall be greeted with waving flags and find hundreds of sturdy Knights ready to join us But in that twenty miles not a single waving flag did Calhoun see not a single shout of welcome did he hear Instead the inhabitants seemed to be in an agony of fear They met only decrepit old men and white faced women and children Not a single cup of cold water was freely offered them in that twenty miles If Calhoun could only have seen the welcome given Hobson s men the day after as they came over the same road the flags that were waved the shouts of welcome that greeted them how women and children stood by the roadside with cooling water and dainty food to give them and sent their prayers after them if Calhoun could have seen all these things his heart would have sunk and he would have known that there was no welcome for Morgan s men in Indiana But he was soon to have a ruder awakening As he neared Corydon he and his scouts were greeted with a volley and sixteen of his men went down The raid for them was over Charge shouted Calhoun and like a whirlwind he and his men were on the little band of home guards who thought they could withstand Morgan s whole force In a few brief minutes the fight was over and on the sod lay several motionless figures In spite of himself Calhoun could not help thinking of Lexington and the farmer minute men who met Pitcairn and his red coats on that April morning in seventeen seventy five Were not these men of Corydon as brave Did they not deserve a monument as much He tried to dismiss the thought as unworthy but it stayed with him for a long time A short distance beyond Corydon stood a fine house which with all its surroundings showed it to be the dwelling of a rich and prosperous farmer When Calhoun came up the owner bareheaded and greatly excited was engaged in controversy with one of Calhoun s scouts who had just appropriated a fine ham from the farmer s smoke house and was busily engaged in tying it to his saddle bow You have no business to take my property without paying for it the farmer was saying angrily I am a friend of the South I have opposed the war from the beginning Seeing Calhoun and noticing he was an officer the farmer rushed up to him crying Stop them Stop them they are stealing my property Well I declare if it isn t my old friend Jones exclaimed Calhoun How do you do mister Jones Where are those five hundred armed Knights who you said would meet us here Where is your hat that you are not throwing it high in air Why are you not shouting hallelujahs over our coming Jones had stopped and was staring at Calhoun with open mouth and bulging eyes Bless my soul he at length managed to stammer if it isn t mister Harrison Lieutenant Pennington at your service But Jones where are those Knights of the Golden Circle you promised would join us here Jones hung his head We we didn t expect you to come so soon he managed to answer we didn t have time to rally mister Jones you told me this whole country would welcome us as liberators They did welcome us back there in Corydon but it was with lead Sixteen of our men were killed and wounded mister Jones there will be several funerals for you to attend in Corydon It must be some of those Union Leaguers exclaimed mister Jones Glad they were killed they threatened to hang me the other day They were heroes compared to you hotly exclaimed Calhoun You and your cowardly Knights can plot in secret stab in the dark curse your government but when it comes to fighting like men you are a pack of cowardly curs But mister Jones hardly heard this fierce Phillipic his eyes were fixed on his smoke house which was being entered by some more of the soldiers Won t you stop them he cried wringing his hands they will take it all Why you are a pack of thieves Boys don t enter or disturb anything in the house cried Calhoun turning to his men but take anything out of doors you can lay your hands on horses everything The men dispersed with a shout to carry out the order Calhoun left mister Jones in the road jumping up and down tearing his hair and shouting at the top of his voice I am going to vote for Abe Lincoln I am I am if I am damned for it In all probability Morgan s raid in Indiana and Ohio made more than one vote for old Abe Of all the thousands of Knights of the Golden Circle in Indiana and Ohio not one took his rifle to join Morgan not one raised his hand to help him In speaking of this to General Shackelford who captured him Morgan said bitterly Since I have crossed the Ohio I have not seen a single friendly face Every man woman and child I have met has been my enemy every hill top a telegraph station to herald my coming every bush an ambush to conceal a foe The people who lived along the route pursued by Morgan will never forget his raid What happened has been told and retold a thousand times around the fireside and the story will be handed down not only to their children but to their children s children Morgan was everywhere proclaimed as a thief and a robber They forgot that he had to subsist at the expense of the country and that he had to take horses to replace those of his own which had broken down Not only that but it was life to him to sweep the country through which he passed clear of horses that his pursuers might not get them The Federals in pursuit took horses as readily as Morgan s men Those who proclaim Morgan a thief and a robber sing with gusto Marching through Georgia and tell how the sweet potatoes started from the ground They forget how Sheridan the greatest cavalry leader of the Federal army boasted he had made the lovely Shenandoah Valley such a waste that a crow would starve to death flying over it The Southern people look upon Sherman and Sheridan as the people of Ohio and Indiana look upon Morgan These generals were not inhuman they simply practised war It is safe to say that less private property was destroyed in Morgan s raid in Indiana and Ohio than in any other raid of equal magnitude made by either side during the war One can now see by reading the dispatches the panic and terror caused by Morgan in this raid From Cairo Illinois to Wheeling West Virginia the Federals were in a panic for they knew not which way Morgan would turn or where he would strike From the entire length of the Ohio the people were wildly calling on the government to send troops to protect them from Morgan There were fears and trembling as far north as Indianapolis Governor Tod of Ohio declared martial law through the southern part of his state and called on Morton to do the same for Indiana But Morton cooler more careful and looking farther ahead as to what might be the effect of such a measure wisely refused to do so From Corydon Morgan rode north to Salem The Federals now thought for sure that Indianapolis was his objective point but from Salem he turned northeast and swept through the state touching or passing through in his route the counties of Jackson Scott Jennings Jefferson Ripley and Dearborn passing into Ohio in the northwest corner of Hamilton County almost within sight of the great city of Cincinnati Turning north he entered Butler County Here as in Indiana he met only the scowling faces of enemies And here is where they worship Vallandigham exclaimed Calhoun passionately Here is where they told me almost every man belonged to the Knights of the Golden Circle and that the whole county would welcome us Here is where even the Democratic party meet in open convention pass resolutions in favor of the South denounce Lincoln as a monster and tyrant and demand that the war cease at once and the South go free saying they will support no man for office who in the least way favors the war And now not a word of welcome not a single hand reached out in aid Oh the cowards the cowards three Morgan made no bitter reply but said You warned us Lieutenant how it would be I have expected no aid since the first day we entered Indiana But with God s help we shall yet escape from our foes Oh if my gallant men were across the Ohio once more It is only that river which stands in between us and safety There is now no hope of securing a steamboat But at Buffington Island the river is shoal and can be forded If we can reach Buffington Island before our enemies we can laugh at our pursuers And for Buffington Island Morgan headed threatening each place along the way to keep the Federals guessing where he would attempt to cross Like a whirlwind he swept through the counties of Warren Clermont Brown Adams Pike Jackson Gallia Meigs brushing aside like so many flies the militia which tried to impede his progress The goal was nearly reached Hobson was half a day behind still trailing still following like a bloodhound The Confederates knew of no force in front except militia Safety was before them The river once passed Morgan would have performed the greatest exploit of the war His men were already singing songs of triumph for the river was in sight Night came on but they marched through the darkness to take position In the gray of the morning they would sweep aside the militia and cross over In the morning a heavy fog hung over river and land as if the sun were afraid to look down upon the scene to be enacted In the gloom Colonel Duke and the dashing Huffman formed their commands and moved to the attack They were received with a fire which surprised them coming as they supposed from militia But with loud cheers they swept forward and the Federals were forced back leaving a piece of artillery A little farther and the ford would be won then there came a crashing volley mingled with the thunder of artillery and they saw before them not militia but long lines of blue coated veterans General Judah s brigade had been transported up the river in steamboats and landed at Pomeroy They had marched all night and were now in possession of the ford In vain the gallant Duke and Huffman struggled against that force They were driven back Flight was to be resumed up the river when couriers came dashing in with the news that Hobson was up They were hemmed in There was one place yet a path through the woods by which a few could escape if the Federal force could be held back for a time Go cried Duke to Morgan and I will hold them until you are gone Go cried Huffman faint and bleeding from a wound and I will stay and help Colonel Duke Go cried Calhoun if you are saved I care not for myself Then there arose a storm of protests Who could so well guard and protect the chief as Calhoun and his scouts And so against Morgan s will Calhoun went with him Come then we will clear the way Calhoun cried to his scouts and before the way was closed six hundred men with Morgan had escaped Hemmed in on every side the Confederates fought as only desperate men can fight but as soon as it was known that Morgan was well away Duke and Huffman and with them many other gallant officers saw it would be madness to fight longer and with breaking hearts they surrendered to their exultant foes Then it was that some two or three hundred in spite of shot and shell in spite of the leaden hail which fell around them plunged down the bank into the river The bodies of many floated down their life blood reddening the water The current swept many a steed and rider down and they were seen no more A few there were who struggled through to safety and these were all that escaped of the thousands that crossed the Ohio at Brandenburg CHAPTER XVIII THE RIDE OF THE SIX HUNDRED What Morgan s thoughts were what his hopes were as he rode away from that fatal field at Buffington Island no one knows With him rode six hundred all that were left of three thousand He could have had no thoughts of attempting to cross the Ohio anywhere near Buffington Island for he rode almost due north It may have been he thought that he might cross near Wheeling or higher up and escape into the mountains of Western Pennsylvania or as a last resort he might reach Lake Erie seize a steamboat and escape to Canada Whatever he thought north he rode through the most populous counties of Ohio And what a ride was that for six hundred men Foes everywhere Home Guards springing up at every corner no rest day or night Close in his rear thundered the legions of General Shackelford a Kentuckian as brave as fearless as tireless as Morgan himself But in spite of all opposition in spite of foes gathering on right and left and in front Morgan rode on sweeping through the counties of Meigs Vinton Hocking Athens Washington Morgan Muskingum Guernsey Belmont Harrison Jefferson until he reached Columbiana County where the end came At almost every hour during this ride the six hundred grew less Men fell from their horses in exhaustion They slept as they rode keeping to their saddles as by instinct The terrible strain told on every one The men grew haggard emaciated When no danger threatened they rode as dead men but once let a rifle crack in front and their sluggish blood would flow like fire through their veins their eyes would kindle with the excitement of battle and they would be Morgan s fierce raiders once more As for Calhoun it seemed as if he never slept never tired It was as if his frame were made of iron Where danger threatened there he was He was foremost in every charge It looked as if he bore a charmed life The day before the end came he was scouting on a road parallel to the one on which the main body was travelling Hearing shots he took a cross road and galloped at full speed to see what was the trouble A small party of Home Guards were retreating at full speed one far in advance of the others was making frantic efforts to urge his horse to greater speed Calhoun saw that he could cut him off and he did so reaching the road just as he came abreast of it So intent was the fellow on getting away he did not notice Calhoun until brought to a stand by the stern command Surrender In his surprise and terror the man rolled from his horse the picture of the most abject cowardice Calhoun ever saw He fairly grovelled in the dust Don t kill me Don t kill me he cried raising his hands in supplication I didn t want to come they forced me I never did anything against you Dismounting Calhoun gave him a kick which sent him rolling Get up you blubbering calf he exclaimed and tell us what you know The fellow staggered to his feet his teeth chattering and trembling like a leaf Now answer my questions and see that you tell the truth said Calhoun Are there any forces in front of us N not not as I know he managed to say Do you know the shortest road to Salineville Yes yes Will you guide us there if I spare your life Anything I will do anything if you won t kill me he whined Very well but I will exchange horses with you as I see you are riding a fine one and he looks fresh remarked Calhoun The exchange was made and then Calhoun said Now lead on and at the first sign of treachery I will blow out your brains Do you understand Yes yes I will take you the shortest road What s your name asked Calhoun as they rode along Andrew Harmon Well Andrew I wish all Yankees were like you If they were we should have no trouble whipping the North I reckon you are about as big a coward as I ever met Harmon still white and trembling did not answer he was too thoroughly cowed Ride as hard as Morgan s men could when they neared Salineville Shackelford was pressing on their rear They had either to fight or surrender My brave boys you have done all that mortals can do I cannot bear to see you slaughtered I will surrender As Morgan said this his voice trembled It was a word his men had never heard him use before General it is not all over for you cried Calhoun his voice quivering with emotion Think of the joy of the Yankees if you should be captured Let me take half the men You take the other half and escape I can hold the enemy in check until you get well away Morgan demurred The sacrifice will be too great he said You must you shall consent We will force you the cry went up from the whole command as from one man Morgan bowed his head he could not speak In silence he took Calhoun s hand tears gathered in his eyes the first tears Calhoun ever saw there There was a strong clasp a clasp which seemed to say It may be the last then wheeling his horse Morgan galloped swiftly away followed by less than half of his six hundred There was not a moment to lose for the Federals were already charging down with triumphant cheers confident of an easy victory Calhoun had posted his men well and a withering volley sent the Federals reeling back They charged again only to recoil before the fierce fire of the Confederates There was now a lull in the fighting Calhoun saw that they were flanking him on the right and left Charge he shouted and the little band were soon in the midst of their enemies The Federals closed in around them There was no way to retreat Calhoun s men seeing how hopeless the fight was began to throw down their arms Surrender cried a fine looking officer to Calhoun who well in front was fighting like a demon Even in that hell of battle Calhoun knew the officer It was Mark Crawford the captain whose horse he had captured in Tennessee and whom he afterwards took prisoner at Cave City But the captain was wearing the shoulder straps of a major now Never shouted Calhoun in answer to the summons to surrender and with sword in hand he spurred forward to engage Crawford in single combat But that officer had a revolver in his hand and he raised it and fired Calhoun felt as if he had been struck on the head with a red hot iron He reeled in his saddle and then fell forward on his horse s neck His sword dropped from his nerveless hand His horse wild with fear and not feeling the restraining hand of a master broke through the ranks of the Federals and bore him out of the conflict Still clinging to the neck of his horse and the horn of his saddle he kept his seat He straightened himself up but the blood streaming over his face blinded him and he saw not where he was going Neither did he realize what had happened for the shock of his wound had rendered him half unconscious His mind began to wander He was a soldier no longer but a boy back in Kentucky running a race with his cousin Fred On on Salim he weakly shouted we must win it is for the Sunny South we are racing The horse still ran at full speed his glossy coat dripping with perspiration his nostrils widely distended and showing red with blood But his pace began to slacken Darkness gathered before the eyes of Calhoun Why it s getting night he murmured Fred where are you Lower still lower he sank until he was once more grasping the neck of his horse A deadly faintness seized him total darkness was around him and he knew no more With Calhoun gone all resistance to the Federals ceased Of the six hundred who had ridden so far and so well fully one half were prisoners The Federals were greatly chagrined and disappointed when they found that Morgan was not among the prisoners The man they desired above all others was still at liberty Forward was the command and the pursuit was again taken up With the remnant of his command Morgan was nearing New Lisbon If there were no foes before him there was still hope From a road to the west of the one he was on a cloud of dust was rising His guide told him that this road intersected the one he was on but a short distance ahead His advance came dashing back saying there was a large body of Federal troops in his front From the rear came the direful tidings that Shackelford was near Morgan saw and his lip quivered It is no use he said it is all over The ride of the six hundred had ended a ride that will ever live in song and story Morgan has surrendered Morgan is a prisoner was the news borne on lightning wings all over the entire North What rejoicing there was among the Federals The great raider the man they feared more than an army with banners was in their power CHAPTER XIX AN ANGEL OF MERCY In front of one of the most beautiful and stately farm houses in Columbiana County stood a young girl With clasped hands and straining eyes she was gazing intently down a road which led to the west The sound of battle came faintly to her ears As she listened a shudder swept through her slight frame My brother My brother she moaned he may be in it O God of battles protect him She would have made a picture for an artist as she stood there The weather being warm she wore a soft thin garment which clung in graceful folds around her Her beautifully rounded arm and shapely shoulders were bare Her luxuriant hair the color of sun beams fell in a wavy mass to her waist Her eyes blue as the sky were now troubled and a teardrop trembled and then fell from the long lashes As she looked the sound of battle became fainter and then ceased altogether But down the road a mile away a little cloud of dust arose It grew larger and larger and at last she saw it was caused by a single horseman who was coming at a furious pace Was the rider a bearer of ill tidings No there was no rider on the horse He who rode must have been killed It might be her brother s horse she grew sick and faint but still she gazed The horse came nearer he was slackening his speed Yes there was some one on the horse a man but he had fallen over on the saddle and his arms were around the horse s neck It must be her brother wounded unto death coming home to die and she gave a great convulsive sob Then like a bird she flew to the middle of the road She saw that the horse s mane and shoulders were dripping with blood that the rider s hair was clotted with it As the horse came to her it stopped and the rider rolled heavily from the saddle With a cry she sprang forward and received the falling man but the weight of Calhoun for it was he bore her to the earth She arose screaming for help There was no one in the house except a colored servant who came rushing out and nearly fainted when she saw her mistress No wonder for the girl s dress and arms were dripping with blood Oh Missy Joyce Missy Joyce wailed the colored woman what s de mattah Be yo killed No no this soldier he is dead or dying Oh Mary what can we do But help was near A couple of neighbors had also heard the sound of battle and were riding nearer that they might learn the result Great heavens what is this exclaimed one as they rode up As I live that is Andrew Harmon s horse Well I never thought Andrew would get near enough to a battle to get shot By this time they had dismounted Going to Calhoun they looked at him and one exclaimed This is not Harmon it s one of Morgan s men Got it good and heavy Served him right Is he dead asked the girl in a trembling voice The man put his hand on Calhoun s heart No marm he answered but I think he might as well be Carry him into the house and send for Doctor Hopkins quick she said What that dirty bloody thing Better let us carry him to the barn It s a blame sight better place than our boys get down South The house I say answered the girl sharply Why Miss Joyce said the other man as he looked at her you are covered with blood Yes I caught him as he fell from his horse she answered I am not hurt The men were about to pick Calhoun up and carry him in according to the directions of the girl when she exclaimed There comes Doctor Hopkins now Sure enough the Doctor had heard of the fight and was coming at a remarkable speed for him to see if his professional services were needed He reined in his horse and jumping from his gig ejaculated Why why what is this And Miss Joyce all bloody I am not hurt The man Doctor she said The Doctor turned his attention to Calhoun As I live one of Morgan s men he exclaimed and hard hit too How did he come here His horse brought him answered one of the men He clung to his horse as far as here when he fell off Miss Joyce caught him as he fell That is what makes her so bloody Well well well was all that the old Doctor could say The queer part is continued the man that the horse belongs to Andrew Harmon I heard that Andrew had gone out with the Home Guards but I could hardly believe it I guess this fellow must have killed him and appropriated the horse What Andrew Harmon killed in battle cried the Doctor straightening up from his examination of Calhoun Don t believe it He will turn up safe enough Then speaking to the girl the Doctor said Miss Joyce this man has nearly bled to death I cannot tell yet whether the ball has entered his head or not If not there may be slight hopes for him but he must have immediate attention It is fortunate I came along as I did Miss Joyce wanted us to take him into the house said one of the men but I suggested the barn The barn first said the Doctor if I remember rightly there is a large work bench there It will make a fine operating table And Joyce warm water towels and bandages Joyce Crawford for that was the girl s name flew to do the Doctor s bidding while the men to their credit be it said picked Calhoun up tenderly and carried him to the barn where the work bench as the Doctor had suggested made an operating table Joyce soon appeared with the water towels and bandages The Doctor had already taken off his coat and rolled up his sleeves ready for work Although he was a country practitioner he was a skilful surgeon Carefully he washed away the blood then clipped away the matted hair from around the wound It seemed to Joyce a long time that he worked but at last the wound was dressed and bandaged The ball did not penetrate the brain he said as he finished nor do I think the skull is injured although the ball plowed along it for some distance Fortunately it was a small bullet one from a revolver probably which hit him It cut a number of small arteries in its course and that is the reason he has bled so much An hour more and he would have been beyond my skill Will he live now asked Joyce The chances are against him If saved at all it will only be by the best of nursing He can be taken into the house now can t he she asked Yes but you had better first let a tub of water be brought and clean underclothes and a night shirt He needs a bath as much as anything Joyce had the men get the water while she procured some underclothes which belonged to her brother Calhoun s clothes were now removed clothes which had not been off him for a month Here is a belt said one of the men it looks as if it might contain money and he was proceeding to examine it when the Doctor forbade him Give it to Miss Joyce he said the fellow is her prisoner The belt was handed over rather reluctantly Calhoun having been bathed Joyce was called and told that her prisoner was ready for her Bring him in the chamber is all prepared was her answer Calhoun was brought in and placed in a large cool upper chamber This is mighty nice for a Rebel said one of the men looking around My Jake didn t get this good care when he was shot at Stone River Too blame nice for a Morgan thief mumbled the other Shut up said the Doctor remember what Miss Joyce has done for our boys Worked her fingers off for them This man or rather boy for he can t be over twenty was brought to her door Would you have him left to die The men hung their heads sheepishly and went out They were not hard hearted men but they were bitter against Morgan and any one who rode with him Now I must go said the old Doctor kindly taking Joyce s hand You have done to this young man as I would have one do to my son in a like extremity The old Doctor s voice broke for he had lost a son in the army Recovering himself he continued I must go now for I may be needed by some of our own gallant boys I will drop in this evening if possible and see how your patient is getting along God bless you Joyce you have a kind heart Joyce looked after the old Doctor with swimming eyes One of God s noblemen she murmured She took the belt which had been taken from Calhoun and which had been handed her by the Doctor and put it carefully away She then began her vigil beside the bedside of the wounded man The Doctor had given her minute directions and she followed them faithfully It was some hours before Calhoun began to show signs of consciousness and when he did come to he was delirious and in a raging fever The Doctor returned as he had promised He shook his head as he felt Calhoun s pulse and listened to his incoherent mutterings This is bad he said It is fortunate he lost so much blood or this fever would consume him But we must hope for the best Only the best of nursing will bring him through That he shall have said Joyce I have sent for Margaret Goodsen You know she is an army nurse and knows all about wounded men Yes Margaret is good none better replied the Doctor All through that night Joyce sat by the bedside of Calhoun cooling his fevered brow giving him refreshing drinks He talked almost continually to himself Now he would be leading his men in battle cheering them on Then he was a boy engaged in boyish sports The name of Fred was uttered again and again I wonder who Fred can be thought Joyce a brother probably Joyce Crawford was the only daughter of the honorable Lorenzo Crawford one of the most prominent citizens of Columbiana County mister Crawford had served two terms in Congress and was at the time of the war a member of the state senate He had one child besides Joyce his son Mark who we have seen was a major in the Federal army mister Crawford lost his wife when Joyce was three years old since that time his house had been presided over by a maiden sister This lady was absent in Steubenville when Morgan appeared so suddenly in the county thus at the time of Calhoun s appearance only Joyce and the servants were at home mister Crawford being absent in the east on duties connected with the Sanitary Commission mister Crawford was what is known as an original Abolitionist Before the war his house was one of the stations of the underground railroad and many a runaway slave he had helped on the way to Canada Twice he had been arrested by the United States officials for violation of the fugitive slave law and both times fined heavily He believed there could be no virtue in a slave owner such a man was accursed of God and should be accursed of men His daughter had to a degree imbibed his sentiments and the idea of slavery was abhorrent to her but her heart was so gentle she could hate no one Calhoun s helplessness appealed to her sympathies and she forgot he was one of Morgan s raiders Although young only eighteen she had admirers by the score but her father so far had forbidden her receiving company considering her as yet only a child Joyce s beau ideal of a man was her brother Mark and he was worthy of her adoration Several years her senior he had watched over and guided her in her childhood and never was a brother more devoted The next morning the news came that Morgan was captured and the scare in Columbiana County was over The morning also brought Miss Crawford who had come hurrying home on receipt of the news that Morgan was in the county She nearly went into hysterics when she learned that one of the dreadful raiders was in the house How could you do it child she cried to Joyce and Doctor why did you let her she added to Doctor Hopkins who had just come in to see his patient Madam it was a case of life or death replied the Doctor Joyce did right We are not heathens in Columbiana County But you will take him right away pleaded the lady It would be death to move him But he might murder us all said Miss Crawford The Doctor smiled If he lives it will be weeks before he will have the strength to kill a fly he answered Miss Crawford sighed and gave up the battle She was not a hard hearted woman but the idea of having one of Morgan s dreadful raiders in the house was trying on her nerves The afternoon brought Major Crawford The story of Joyce s capture of a raider had travelled far and wide and the Major had already heard of it So you captured a prisoner did you Puss he exclaimed kissing her as she threw herself in his arms Is he a regular brigand and bearded like a pard No no he is young almost a boy she answered Margaret Goodsen is taking care of him now Come and see him but he is out of his head and raves dreadfully She led the way to the chamber where Calhoun was No sooner did Major Crawford see him than he turned pale and staggered back Great God he exclaimed What fate was it that had led the man he had shot to the house to be cared for by his sister What is it Mark What is it she cried seeing his agitation Should he tell her Yes it would be best Joyce you will not wonder at my surprise when I tell you it was I who shot him You brother you she cried and instinctively she shrank from him Mark saw it and exclaimed Great God Joyce you don t blame me do you I had to do it to save my life He was about to cut me down with his sword when I fired No no she cried I don t blame you but it was so sudden it is so dreadful I never before realized that war was so terrible Well Joyce save the poor fellow s life if you can I don t want his death on my hands if I can help it Do you know who your prisoner is No you see the condition he is in His name is Pennington Calhoun Pennington He is one of Morgan s bravest and most daring officers I ought to know him he took me prisoner twice You Mark you Yes you remember I told you how I lost my horse in Tennessee He is the fellow who took it He afterwards captured me at Cave City Mark what will become of him if he gets well she asked The United States officials will take him he answered His being here must be reported And and he will be sent to prison Yes until he is exchanged But you were not sent to prison when you were captured she protested No I was paroled but I hardly believe the government will parole any of Morgan s men Why she asked They have given us too much trouble Puss Now we have them I think we will keep them Mark Aunt Matilda don t like my taking this Pennington in She says father will not like it at all I will see Aunt Matilda and tell her it is all right I will also write to father No Joyce I don t want Pennington to die It is best even in war to know you have not killed a man So take good care of him or rather see he has good care Get a man to nurse him nights I will look out for that said Joyce Well Puss good bye keep me posted I had leave of absence only a few hours so I must be going Oh Mark must you go so soon And she clung to him as if she would not let him go Gently disengaging her arms he pressed kiss after kiss on her brow and was gone She sank into a chair weeping and for a time forgot her prisoner The next day Joyce had another visitor in the person of Andrew Harmon He had heard that his horse was at Crawford s and that the officer who took him was there desperately wounded He made his visit with pleasure for of all the girls in Columbiana County she was the one he had selected to become missus Harmon He had no idea he would be refused for was he not considered the greatest catch in the county Harmon had two things to recommend him good looks and money He was accounted a handsome man and was as far as physical beauty was concerned He had the body and muscle of an athlete but there was nothing ennobling or inspiring in the expression of his countenance By nature he was crafty mean cruel and miserly and was one of the biggest cowards that ever walked Like many others he was a great patriot as far as talk was concerned He had been so unfortunate as to be drafted at the first call and had promptly furnished a substitute He was fond of boasting he was doing double duty for his country not only was he represented in the army but he was doing a great work at home This work consisted in contracting for the government and cheating it at every turn Many a soldier who received shoddy clothing paper soled shoes and rotten meat had mister Harmon to thank for it But he was piling up money and was already known as one of the richest men in the county When he went out with the Home Guards he had no idea of getting near Morgan he would look out for that But his party ran into Morgan s advance unexpectedly and as has been related he was captured by Calhoun It was a most wonderful story he had to tell He had been beset by at least six of Morgan s men A desperate conflict followed and he had killed or at least desperately wounded three of his assailants and it was only after he had not a single shot left in his revolver and was surrounded that he had surrendered So enraged were they at my desperate defence said he that the officer in charge pulled me from my horse brutally kicked and struck me threatened to kill me and then appropriated my horse He is a desperate fellow Miss Joyce I would not keep him in the house a single moment Joyce who had listened to his account much amused for she had heard another version of it said I do not think mister Harmon he could have beaten you very hard for I see no marks on you and you seem to be pretty lively As for sending Lieutenant Pennington away the Doctor says it would be death to move him mister Harmon shifted uneasily in his chair as Joyce was saying this and then asked to see Calhoun as he wished to be sure whether he was the one who had captured him This Joyce consented to provided he would be careful not to disturb him Harmon promised and he was taken into the room Calhoun was tossing on his bed as he entered and no sooner did his wild eyes rest on Harmon than he burst into a loud laugh Oh the coward the coward he shouted take him away Harmon fled from the room white with rage Miss Joyce that fellow is shamming he fumed I demand he be delivered to the United States officials at once The Doctor thinks differently he says it will kill him to be moved she answered Let him die then It isn t your business to nurse wounded Rebels especially one of Morgan s cutthroats I do not have to come to you to learn what my business is answered Joyce haughtily and turned to leave the room mister Harmon saw that he had made a mistake Joyce Joyce don t go hear me he exclaimed You will find your horse in the stable was all she said as she passed out He left the house vowing vengeance and lost no time in informing the Federal authorities that the wounded officer at Crawford s was shamming and would give them the slip if not taken away Two deputy marshals came to investigate and went away satisfied when Doctor Hopkins promised to report as soon as his patient was well enough to be removed In due time Joyce received a letter from her father He had not heard that Morgan had come as far north as Columbiana County until after he was captured As all danger was now over he would not be home for some time The thousands who had been wounded in the great battle of Gettysburg were occupying his attention He also had to make a visit to Washington and Fortress Monroe and might go as far south as Hilton Head As for the wounded Rebel at his house Joyce had done right in not letting him die in the road but that he should be turned over to the military authorities at the earliest possible moment Little did mister Crawford think what the outcome of the affair would be Contrary to her aunt s protest Joyce insisted on taking most of the care of Calhoun during the day Margaret Goodsen was all the help she needed She had engaged a competent man to care for him nights Had not Mark told her to save the life of the man he had shot if possible CHAPTER XX CALHOUN AWAKES TO LIFE For two weeks Calhoun hovered between life and death but at last his rugged constitution conquered During this time Joyce was unremitting in her attention I must save him for the sake of Mark she would say I cannot bear to have his blood on Mark s hands In speaking to Joyce s aunt Matilda Goodsen said The poor child will hardly let me do anything she wants to do it all Miss Crawford fretted and fumed but it did no good In this Joyce would have her way Calhoun s fever had been growing less day by day and the time came when it left him and he lay in a quiet and restful slumber But his breathing was so faint Joyce was almost afraid it was the sleep which precedes death It was near the close of an August day The weather had been warm and sultry but a thunder shower had cooled and cleared the atmosphere and the earth was rejoicing in the baptism it had received The trees seemed to ripple with laughter as the breeze shook the raindrops from their leaves The grass was greener the flowers brighter on account of that same baptism The birds sang a sweeter song What is more beautiful than nature after a summer shower It was at such a time that Calhoun awoke to life and consciousness A delicious lethargy was over him He felt no pain and his bed was so soft he seemed to be resting on a fleecy cloud He tried to raise his hand and found to his surprise he could not move a finger Even his eyes for a time refused to open Slowly his memory came back to him how in the fierce conflict he tried to break through the line and sought to cut down an officer who opposed him Then there came a flash a shock and he remembered nothing more Where was he now Had he passed through that great change called death By a great effort he opened his eyes and was bewildered He was in a strange room By an open window sat a young girl She had been reading but the book was now lying idly in her lap and she was looking apparently into vacancy The rays of the setting sun streamed in through the windows and touched hair and face and clothes with its golden beams Calhoun thought he had never seen a being so lovely her beauty was such as he fancied could be found only in the realms above yet she was mortal He could not take his eyes from her She turned her head and saw him gazing at her Uttering a little exclamation of surprise she arose and came swiftly but noiselessly to his side Who are you Where am I Calhoun whispered faintly Hush hush she said in low sweet tones you must not talk You have been sick very sick You are better now She gave him a cordial He took it and with a gentle sigh closed his eyes and sank to sleep again Before he was quite gone it seemed to him that soft tremulous lips touched his forehead and a tear drop fell upon his cheek Its memory remained with him as a beautiful dream and it was long years before he knew it was not a dream Doctor Hopkins was delighted when he called in the evening and learned that his patient had awaked with his fever gone and in his right mind All that he needs now he said is careful nursing and he will get well But mind do not let him talk and tell him nothing of what has happened until he gains a little strength From that time Calhoun gained slowly but surely When he became strong enough to bear it Joyce told him all that had happened He could scarcely realize that over a month had passed since he had been wounded Then that stand of mine did not save Morgan said Calhoun sorrowfully No he was taken a few hours afterwards answered Joyce He and his officers are now in the penitentiary at Columbus Calhoun could hardly believe what he heard Then we are to be treated as felons are we he asked bitterly They are afraid he might escape from a military prison replied Joyce But the people are very bitter against him Some are clamoring that he be tried and executed They will not dare do that exclaimed Calhoun excitedly No I do not think there is any danger that way replied Joyce but they want to keep him safe Well they may but Morgan will yet make them trouble No prison will hold him long There there don t let us talk about it any more said Joyce it will worry you back into a fever You have saved my life said Calhoun fervently How can I ever repay you for what you have done Joyce did not reply Calhoun lay silent for some time and then suddenly said I am one of Morgan s hated officers and yet you are caring for me as for a brother What makes you do it Why shouldn t I said Joyce I have a dear brother in the army I am only doing by you as I would have him done by if he should fall wounded And then Joyce stopped she could not tell him it was her brother who had shot him A great light came to Calhoun Joyce Joyce he cried I now understand It was your brother who shot me Oh forgive him forgive him cried Joyce He told me it was to save his own life that he did it Why Joyce there is nothing to forgive Your brother is a brave a gallant officer Then he has been here Yes and knew you He bade me nurse you as I would nurse him in like condition Just like a brave soldier but are there none who find fault with my being here treated like a prince Yes one His name is Andrew Harmon It was his horse you were riding when you came here He seems to hate you and is doing all he can to have you taken to Columbus He says you treated him most brutally when he was captured I did kick him answered Calhoun laughing he was on the ground bellowing like a baby I never saw a more abject coward I kicked him and told him to get up He has a different story said Joyce smiling and then she told the wonderful story of Harmon s capture as related by himself His capacity for lying is equalled only by his cowardice said Calhoun indignantly Yet he is a man to be feared said Joyce for he is rich and has influence although every one knows him to be a coward The days that passed were the happiest Calhoun had ever spent He told Joyce of his Kentucky home of his cousin Fred how noble and true he was and of his own adventures in raiding with Morgan She never tired of listening Is it strange that these two hearts were drawn close to each other They lived in a sweet dream a dream which did not look to the future But almost unknown to them Cupid had come and shot his shafts and they had gone true The day came when Calhoun was able to be placed in an easy chair and drawn to an open window It was a proud day to him yet it was the beginning of sorrow The Doctor came and congratulated him on his improvement Doctor Hopkins how can I thank you for your kindness he said you have done so much for me You need not thank me thank that young lady there replied the Doctor pointing to Joyce She it was who saved your life I know no reward I could give would ever repay her answered Calhoun I can only offer to be her slave for life Your offer is not accepted you are well aware I do not believe in slavery replied Joyce with a merry laugh When the Doctor was ready to go he asked for a private interview with Joyce It was hard work for him to say what he had to say He choked and stammered but at last Joyce understood what he meant He had promised the government officials to inform them when Calhoun could be moved without endangering his life That time had come But said he as he noticed the white face of Joyce I shall recommend that he be allowed to remain two weeks longer as there is no danger of his running away in his weak condition But Joyce hardly heard him And and this means she whispered The penitentiary at Columbus Joyce shuddered And and there is no way to prevent this None God knows I would if I could Thank you Doctor I might have known this would have to come but it is so sudden The Doctor went out shaking his head I am afraid harm has been done he said to himself Just as he was getting into his gig to drive away Andrew Harmon came riding by He glanced up and saw Calhoun sitting by the window So your patient is able to sit up he exclaimed with a sneer About time he were in the penitentiary where he belongs isn t it I don t know how that concerns you replied the Doctor coldly as he drove away Oh ho my fine fellow I will show you whether it concerns me or not muttered Harmon looking after him That night Harmon wrote to the authorities at Columbus stating it as his opinion that there was a scheme on foot to detain Lieutenant Pennington until he was well enough to slip away He was not aware that Doctor Hopkins had reported on the condition of his patient every week and had already sent a letter saying he could be moved with safety but recommending he be allowed to remain two weeks longer on account of his weak condition Harmon not only wrote to Columbus but also to mister Crawford hinting that it was dangerous for his daughter to care for Calhoun longer You know he wrote that girls of the age of Joyce are inclined to be romantic As for Joyce when the Doctor left her she sank into a chair weak and faint She saw Andrew Harmon gazing up at the window where Calhoun was and a terror seized her She now knew that she loved Calhoun but with that knowledge also came the thought that her love was hopeless that even if Calhoun returned her love her father would never consent to their union He would rather see her dead than married to a Rebel especially a hated Morgan raider Long did she struggle with her own heart her sense of duty her ideas of patriotism and duty conquered She would give him up but she would save him It was evening before she could muster strength to have the desired interview with Calhoun When she did enter the room it was with a step so languid a face so pinched and drawn that Calhoun stared in amazement Joyce what is it he cried Are you sick Not sick only a little weary she answered as she sank into a chair and motioned for the nurse to leave them No sooner was she gone than Joyce told Calhoun what had happened Her voice was so passionless that Calhoun wondered if she cared wondered if he had been mistaken in thinking she loved him Joyce do you care if I go to prison he asked Care she cried The thought is terrible You shall not go I will save you Joyce Joyce tell me that you love me and it will make my cell in prison a heaven Don t you see that I love you that you saved my poor life only that I might give it to you Joyce say that you love me For answer she sank on her knees by his bedside and laid her head on his breast He put his weak arms around her and held her close For a while she remained still then gently disengaging his arms she arose There was a look on her face that Calhoun did not understand The first embrace and the last she sighed Oh Calhoun why did we ever meet What do you mean he asked his lips growing white I mean that our love is hopeless Father will never consent to our marriage I feel it know it Without his consent I shall never marry But save you from prison I will Joyce you do not love me said Calhoun bitterly As my life she cried Yet you say you can never marry me Without my father s consent I cannot Joyce let us not borrow trouble Even with your father s consent we could not marry now I am a prisoner The war is going on but it cannot last forever When it is over when peace is declared I will come to you Then and not till then will I ask your father for your hand Let us hope the skies will be brighter by that time that to be one of Morgan s men will not be a badge of dishonor even in the North Oh Calhoun if I could only hope I will hope Come to me after the war is over Father s consent may be won But now the prison the prison I must save you I have thought it all out How can you save me a poor weak mortal who cannot take a step without help asked Calhoun Put you in a carriage to morrow night and take you where they cannot find you So soon The Doctor said he would ask for two weeks Two more weeks with you Joyce I could afford to go to prison for that Don t talk foolishly I feel if I don t get you away to morrow night I cannot at all But you will it endanger you Joyce Not at all But how will you explain my disappearance Suppose you have been shamming better than we thought you were and so you gave us the slip A right mean trick said Calhoun No a Yankee trick a real good one Now listen Calhoun and I will tell you all about how I am going to get you away Some six miles from here a colored man lives whom my father has greatly befriended He will do anything for me I ask I shall tell him you are a sick soldier and for good reasons wish to remain in hiding until you get well Will he know I am one of Morgan s men asked Calhoun No he will think you are a Federal soldier Calhoun as much as you may hate it you must don the Union Blue That would make a spy of me No it wouldn t either if I kept clear of any military post That s good I have a Federal uniform in the house which will about fit you A friendless soldier died here a short time ago We took him in and cared for him during his last sickness He had been discharged for wounds received at Fair Oaks Here is the discharge I think it fits you close enough so it may be of use to you She handed him the discharge he took it and read James Brown age nineteen height five feet nine inches weight one hundred and sixty pounds complexion dark hair and eyes black Why Joyce with that in my pocket and wearing a Federal uniform I could travel anywhere in the North So I thought We will cheat that old prison yet But it is time you were asleep God bless you Joyce replied Calhoun Give me a kiss before you go She smiled and threw him one as she went out and he had to be content with that She had not stopped to consider what the result might be if she helped Calhoun to escape Her only thought was to save him from going to prison To do this she would dare anything The colored man of whom she spoke was to be at the farm in the morning to do some work A fear had seized her that she might be too late The fear was well grounded The authorities at Columbus had resolved to move Calhoun at once The request of Doctor Hopkins that he be allowed to remain two weeks longer although he said he could be removed without danger aroused their suspicion Not only that but the letter of Andrew Harmon to mister Crawford had alarmed that gentleman and he was already on his way home Abram Prather the colored man was seen by Joyce as soon as he made his appearance Missy Joyce I jes do enything fo yo Me an de ol woman will keep him all right So everything was arranged Joyce breathed freer yet she waited impatiently for the night CHAPTER XXI THE ESCAPE The day was a long and weary one to Calhoun Between the joy of knowing he was to be free and his misery over the thought that he must part with Joyce his soul was alternately swept with conflicting emotions Then he had seen so little of her during the day she seemed more distant than she did before she declared her love How he longed to take her in his arms to have her head rest on his breast once more But she had said that although it was the first it was to be the last time What did she mean Ah it must be that he could never embrace her again never touch her lips again until her father had consented to their marriage When the war was over he would wring that consent from him The thought brought contentment Yes it was better that they should part Then the news of the terrible battle of Chickamauga had just come and it had fired his very soul The South had won a great victory Surely this was the beginning of the end Independence was near the war would soon be at an end and he longed to be in at the finish The excitement of war was once more running riot through his veins He little thought of the sacrifice Joyce was making of the fierce conflicts she was having with her conscience She knew that she was doing wrong that she was proving a traitor to the flag she loved that she was aiding and abetting the enemy but it was one only one man and she loved him so Surely this one man sick and wounded could do no harm It was cruel to shut him up in prison Thus she reasoned to silence conscience but if her reasons had been ten times as weak love would have won All through the day she was making preparations for Calhoun s departure Fortunately the young man who had been engaged to nurse Calhoun during the night had been taken sick a couple of days before and as Calhoun rested well another had not been engaged Thus one of the greatest obstacles to the carrying out of Joyce s plans was out of the way She could easily manage Miss Goodsen Joyce s only confidant was the faithful Abe who obeyed her without question In his eyes Missy Joyce could do nothing wrong He had been drilled by Joyce until he knew just what to do He was to go home but as soon as it was dark he was to return being careful not to be seen After he was sure the household was asleep he was to harness a span of horses being careful to make no noise and have a carriage waiting in a grove a short distance back of the house Here he was to wait for further orders from Joyce Being well acquainted with the place and Joyce promising to see that the barn and the carriage house were left unlocked he would have no trouble in carrying out his instructions Night came and Joyce was in a fever of excitement Would anything happen to prevent her carrying out her plans If she had known that Andrew Harmon had hired a spy to watch the house she would have been in despair But the spy was to watch the window of Calhoun s room and was concealed in a corn field opposite the house If he had watched the back instead of the front of the house he would have seen some strange doings Margaret Goodsen was told that as Calhoun was so well she could lie down in an adjoining room If he needed anything he could ring a little bell which stood on a table by his side The nurse gladly availed herself of the opportunity to sleep When the nurse retired Joyce came into the room and speaking so that she could hear her said Good night Lieutenant Pennington I hope you will rest well Then she whispered Here is the Federal uniform Have you strength to put it on Yes but oh Joyce She made a swift gesture and pointed to the door of the nurse s room Here is some money she continued in the same low whisper Now don t refuse it you will need it I had plenty of money in a belt around me when I was wounded whispered Calhoun The belt oh I forgot The Doctor gave it to me for safe keeping Noiselessly she moved to the bureau opened a drawer and returned with the belt Joyce I shall not need your money now but I thank you for the offer It was nothing Be sure and be ready and she glided from the room The minutes were like hours to Calhoun At one time he had made up his mind not to accept his proffered liberty as it might bring serious trouble on Joyce but he concluded that he must accept As for Joyce she went to her room and threw herself down on a lounge Her heart was beating tumultuously every little noise startled her like the report of a gun She waited in fear and apprehension At length the clock struck eleven They must be all asleep by this time she thought She arose and softly went downstairs carrying blankets and pillows She stopped and listened as she stepped out of doors There was no moon it was slightly cloudy and darkness was over everything Without hesitating she made her way through the back yard and the barn lot to the grove where she had told Abe to be in waiting She found that the faithful fellow had everything in readiness Abe I want you to come with me now and get the sick soldier Drive through the lane until you reach the road then drive straight to your house The road is not much frequented and you will not be apt to meet any one at this time of night If you do say nothing Leave the soldier when you get home drive straight back the way you came Turn the horses into the pasture put the harness and carriage where you found them Be careful and make no noise When you have done this go home again and be sure you get there before daylight It s a hard night s work I have put on you Abe but I will pay you well for it Now take off your boots and come with me The obedient fellow did as he was bid and followed Joyce into the house and to Calhoun s room Take him to the carriage whispered Joyce The stalwart Abe took Calhoun in his arms as if he had been a child and carried him to the carriage Now Abe remember and do just as I told you said Joyce Yes Missy I member ebberyting She went to the side of the carriage arranged the pillows and comforts around Calhoun and then gave him her hand Good bye she whispered may God keep you safe The hand was cold as death and Calhoun felt that she was trembling violently Joyce Joyce is this to be our leave taking Yes she whispered Are you not coming to see me where I am going No I dare not we must not see each other again until until the war is over Without a kiss Joyce Joyce I Hush you have no right to ask for one I much less right to give it Come when the war is over and then Her voice broke and she turned and fled into the darkness How Joyce got back into the house she never knew She fell on her bed half unconscious The strain upon her had been terrible and the effect might have been serious if tears had not come to her relief After a violent paroxysm of sobbing she grew calmer and tired nature asserted itself and she fell asleep It was yet early morning when she was aroused by a cry from Miss Goodsen and that lady came rushing into her room wringing her hands and crying He is gone He is gone Who is gone asked Joyce springing up as if in amazement Miss Goodsen in her excitement did not notice that Joyce was fully dressed The wounded Rebel Lieutenant Pennington she fairly shrieked Oh what shall I do What shall I do and she wrung her hands in her distress Joyce ran to Calhoun s room sure enough it was empty Stop your noise she said sharply to Miss Goodsen If any one is to blame I am They will do nothing with you It may be he became delirious during the night and has wandered off We must have the house and premises searched The noise had aroused the whole household The utmost excitement prevailed Miss Crawford was frantic She was sure they would all be sent to prison and she upbraided Joyce for not getting another male nurse to watch him during the night The house and the premises were thoroughly searched but nothing was found of the missing man The neighborhood was aroused and a thorough search of the surrounding country began Joyce took to her room with a raging headache The afternoon brought a couple of deputy marshals from Columbus They had come to convey Calhoun to prison and were astonished when told that the prisoner had escaped Miss Goodsen was closely questioned She had looked in once during the night The Lieutenant was awake but said he was comfortable and wanted nothing She then went to sleep and did not awake until morning She found Joyce in her room who was overcome when told that her patient was gone She had not heard the slightest sound during the night Doctor Hopkins was summoned The old Doctor was thunderstruck when he heard the news He could scarcely believe it To add to the mystery Calhoun s Confederate uniform was found Apparently he had gone away with only his night clothes on Doctor Hopkins at once gave it as his opinion that Calhoun had been seized with a sudden delirium and had stolen out of the house and wandered away no doubt the body would be found somewhere His professional services were needed in the care of Joyce for she seemed to be completely prostrated and had a high fever Poor girl said the Doctor the excitement has been too much for her If he suspected anything he kept his secret well The spy employed by Andrew Harmon reported that he had not seen or heard anything suspicious during the night so that gentleman concluded to say nothing as he did not wish it to be known that he had had the house secretly watched mister Crawford returned the day after the escape He was greatly exercised over what had happened and blamed every one that Calhoun had been kept so long as he had Poor Joyce came in for her share but she wisely held her peace The country was scoured for miles around but nothing was seen or heard of the escaped prisoner and at last the excitement died out Joyce did not lack news from Calhoun The faithful Abe kept her fully informed Joyce told him that both of them would go to prison if it was known what they had done and he kept the secret well He reported that Calhoun was gaining rapidly and would soon be able to go his way He want to see yo awful bad befo he goes said Abe But Joyce resolutely refused It would not do either of them any good One day the negro brought her a letter It was from Calhoun telling her that when she received it he would be gone He thought it cruel that she had not come to see him just once He closed as follows Joyce I feel that my life is yours for you saved it Not only that but to you I now owe my liberty and I realize the struggle you have had to do as you have done But be of good cheer When the war is over the thunder of the last cannon will hardly have died away before I shall be at your side Till then adieu That letter was very precious to Joyce Before the war was over it was nearly worn out by being read and reread Shortly after mister Crawford s return he was asked by Andrew Harmon for permission to pay his addresses to his daughter Harmon hoped that if he had her father s permission to pay his addresses to her Joyce s coldness might disappear mister Crawford did not like the man but he was rich and had a certain amount of political influence mister Crawford was thinking of being a candidate for Congress at the approaching election and he did not wish to offend Harmon but he secretly hoped that Joyce would refuse him in this he was not disappointed She was indignant that her father had listened to Harmon even to the extent that he had Why father I have heard you call him cowardly and dishonest she exclaimed and to think that you told him you would leave it entirely to me I did not wish to offend him meekly replied mister Crawford and I had confidence in your judgment I was almost certain you would refuse him Will you always have such confidence in my judgment asked Joyce quickly What do you mean asked her father Suppose I should wish to marry one of whom you did not approve That is another proposition said mister Crawford You might have been so foolish as to fall in love with that Morgan Rebel and horse thief you took care of so long If so I had rather see you dead than married to him Poor Joyce Did her father suspect anything She caught her breath and came near falling Quickly recovering herself she answered At least he was a brave man But everybody says he is dead and mortals do not wed ghosts It is to be sincerely hoped he is dead replied mister Crawford for he had noticed his daughter s confusion and an uneasiness took possession of him But much to Joyce s relief he did not question her further Andrew Harmon was beside himself with rage when told by mister Crawford that while his daughter was sensible of the great honor he would bestow upon her she was still very young and had no idea of marrying any one at present Harmon determined to have revenge on Joyce and began slyly to circulate reports that Joyce Crawford if she chose could tell a great deal about the escape of the Rebel officer In fact half of his sickness was shammed These rumors came to the ears of Mark Crawford He had been promoted to a colonelcy for gallantry at Chickamauga During the winter while the army lay still around Chattanooga he had come home on furlough While at home he sought out Harmon and gave him as fine a thrashing as a man ever received warning him if he ever heard of him connecting his sister with the escape of Calhoun again he would break every bone in his body The only revenge Harmon durst take was to defeat mister Crawford in his aspirations for a nomination for Congress CHAPTER XXII PRISON DOORS ARE OPENED When Calhoun parted from Joyce he sank back in the carriage and gave himself up to the most gloomy thoughts The sorrow of parting from her took from him the joy of his escape During the journey his dusky driver did not speak a word The drive seemed a long one to Calhoun and he was thoroughly wearied when the carriage drew up by a log house surrounded by a small clearing Heah we be Massa said Abe as he alighted from his seat Hope Massa had a good ride The door of the house was opened by a motherly looking colored woman and Abe taking Calhoun once more in his arms carried him into the house Aunt Liza as the wife of Abe was called seeing Calhoun looking so pale and thin put her fat black hand on his forehead and said Po chile po chile don t yo worry Aunt Liza take good care ob yo Calhoun felt that he was among friends friends that would prove faithful and true He was carried up a ladder to a chamber The upper part of the house was all in one room rather low but the rough walls were whitewashed and everything was neat and clean He was placed on a snow white bed and soon sank into a peaceful slumber When he awoke the sun was shining in at the window and Aunt Liza appeared with a breakfast good enough to tempt the appetite of one far more particular than Calhoun The invalid remained with his kind friends two weeks treated like an honored guest and protected from every inquiring eye He gained strength rapidly and at the end of a week was able to walk out evenings when there was no danger of being seen Once men who were searching for him entered the house and Calhoun could hear every word that was said His heart beat painfully for it entered his mind that Abe and his wife might betray him for the sake of the reward offered But the thought did injustice to these simple minded people As for the searchers the loft of the house of a poor negro who had run away from slavery was the last place they thought of looking for an escaped Confederate Through Abe Calhoun often heard from Joyce She cheered him with words of love and comfort but absolutely refused to come and see him saying it would be dangerous In this she was right for Andrew Harmon was alert He believed that Joyce had had something to do with the disappearance of Calhoun and had her closely watched Fortunately his suspicions did not extend to Abe so that communication between Joyce and Calhoun was not interrupted At the end of two weeks he felt able to leave his place of concealment But where should he go He longed to be South in the midst of the strife but his heart was drawn toward Columbus where his comrades lay languishing in prison What could he do at Columbus He did not know but something might transpire that would enlighten him At least he would go and look over the field Once out of the neighborhood in his Federal uniform and with Brown s discharge in his pocket there would be little fear of detection He made his preparations to go wrote Joyce the letter which she prized so highly and bade his kind protectors farewell placing in their hands a hundred dollars Their surprise and joy over the gift were about equal De Lawd keep yo said Aunt Liza wiping her eyes Calhoun had determined to start early in the evening travel all night lie concealed during the day and travel the next night By that time he thought he would be so far away from the place of his escape that he could venture to take the cars without danger Aunt Liza had supplied him with ample provisions for the two days He carried out his programme and on the morning of the second day found himself near a small town where he concluded to take the cars but deemed it safer to wait for the night train The conductor eyed him sharply when he paid his fare instead of showing a pass for soldiers generally travelled on Federal transportation But the conductor took the money and passed on without remark Opposite Calhoun in the car sat a gentlemanly looking man and much to Calhoun s surprise when the conductor passed he saw the gentleman make the sign of recognition of the Knights of the Golden Circle and it was answered by the conductor When the conductor next passed Calhoun gave the sign The man stared but did not answer But he seemed to be troubled and passed through the cars frequently and Calhoun saw that he was watching him closely At length in passing the conductor bent down and whispered to the gentleman opposite Calhoun now knew another pair of eyes were observing him Watching his opportunity Calhoun gave this gentleman the sign of recognition The gentleman shifted uneasily in his seat but did not answer I will give you something stronger thought Calhoun and the next time he caught the gentleman s eye he gave the sign of distress This was a sign no true knight could afford to ignore Leaning over the gentleman said My boy you look pale Have you been sick Very and I now need friends answered Calhoun Come over here and tell me about it said the gentleman Calhoun took a seat by his side and the man whispered Are you a deserter and are they after you Yes said Calhoun Where are you going To Columbus That is a poor place to go to keep out of the hands of Lincoln s minions answered the man I am not afraid said Calhoun What I want to know is where I can find friends in Columbus whom I can trust true firm friends of the South My name is Pettis replied the man I reside in Columbus Once let me be satisfied as to who you are and what you are wearing that uniform for and I may be able to help you That is easily answered said Calhoun but first I must be fully satisfied as to you Let me prove you my brother Calhoun found that mister Pettis was high up in the order and was violent in his hatred of the Lincoln government He could be trusted I am not a Federal soldier said Calhoun after he had fully tested him I am wearing this uniform as a disguise I am a Confederate officer What escaped from Johnson s Island asked mister Pettis in astonishment No I am one of Morgan s officers mister Pettis nearly jumped off the seat in surprise Morgan s officers are all in the penitentiary he gasped One is not and never was answered Calhoun mister Pettis regarded him closely and then said It can t be but it must be Is your name Pennington It is replied Calhoun Why the papers have been full of your escape But the general opinion seemed to be that you wandered away in a delirium and died Which you see is not so said Calhoun with a smile How in the world did you get away That is a secret which I cannot tell even you Very well but mister Pennington you must come home with me You will find friends in Columbus many of them who will be delighted to meet you When Columbus was reached Calhoun on advice of mister Pettis bought a suit of citizen s clothes for said he We Knights hate the sight of that uniform it s the badge of tyranny Calhoun saw that he had found a friend indeed in mister Pettis No Southerner could be more bitter toward the Lincoln government than he He fairly worshipped Vallandigham and said if he would only return to Ohio he would be defended by a hundred thousand men He was especially indignant over the way Morgan and his officers were treated We have schemed and schemed how to help him said he but see no way except we storm that cursed penitentiary as the Bastille was stormed And he added with emphasis the day is fast approaching when we will do it For three days Calhoun remained at mister Pettis s wearying his brain as to how he might help his general but every plan proposed was rejected as impracticable On the third morning he happened to pick up a paper and glancing over its columns saw an advertisement which caused every nerve in his body to tingle It was an advertisement for a boy to work in the dining room and wait on the table at the penitentiary The advertisement stated that the sole duty of the boy was to wait on the table when the Confederate officers ate as they objected to being waited upon by convicts In less than five minutes Calhoun was in his Federal uniform and on his way to the penitentiary to apply for the position You do not look very strong said the warden kindly do you think you could fill the bill I am sure I can said Calhoun Only try me and see Well replied the warden I had rather hire a boy who has served his country as you have and I will give you a trial Thus to his great joy Calhoun found himself hired to wait upon his old comrades in arms With what feelings he commenced his duties can be imagined Would they recognize him and in their surprise give him away No he thought not They knew too well how to control themselves for that It was with a beating heart that Calhoun waited for the time of the first meal It came and the Confederate prisoners came marching in How Calhoun s heart thrilled at the sight of his old comrades But if they recognized him they did not show it by look or sign When the meal was finished and the prisoners marched out Calhoun managed to give Morgan a little slip of paper On it was written I am here to help you if I can Be of good cheer But how could Calhoun help them Even at meal time guards stood everywhere watching every move His duties did not take him out of the dining room Calhoun began by making a careful survey of the building in which the prisoners were confined Fortune favored him One day he made a remark to one of the employees of the prison that the floor of the building seemed to be remarkably dry and free from damp It should be was the reply there is an air chamber under the floor Like a flash there came to Calhoun a plan for escape If this air chamber could be reached a tunnel might be run out He took careful note of all the surroundings and drew a plan of the buildings and surrounding grounds These he managed to pass to Morgan unobserved At the next meal time as Morgan passed him he said as if to himself No tools This was a difficult matter Nothing of any size could be passed to them without discovery But in the hospital Calhoun found some large and finely tempered table knives He managed to conceal several of these around his person and one by one they were given to Morgan Calhoun now waited in feverish excitement for the success of the plan He had done all he could The rest depended on the prisoners themselves Through the shrewdness and indomitable energy of Captain Thomas H Hines the work was carried to a successful termination inside the prison wall General Morgan occupied a cell in the second tier and could do nothing Only those who occupied cells on the ground floor had any hopes of escaping Captain Hines with infinite labor made an opening through the floor of his cell into the air chamber Once in the air chamber they could work without being discovered With only the table knives to work with these men went through two solid walls one five feet and the other six feet in thickness Not only that but they went through eleven feet of grouting Then working from under they went through the floors of six cells leaving only a thin scale of cement which could be broken through by a pressure from the foot The work was commenced November four and finished November twenty four Thus in twenty days seven men working one at a time had accomplished what seemed almost impossible During these days Calhoun could only wait and hope As the prisoners passed him in the dining room all they could say was Progressing Not discovered yet All is well so far At last on the twenty fourth Calhoun heard the welcome words Finished First stormy night Calhoun now examined the time tables and found that a train left Columbus for Cincinnati at one fifteen A M arriving in Cincinnati before the prisoners were aroused in the morning So he wrote on a slip of paper Escape as soon after midnight as possible He believed that train could be taken with safety The afternoon of November twenty seven the weather became dark and stormy At supper time Calhoun heard the glad word To night As soon as his duties were done he hurried to the home of mister Pettis exchanged his uniform for citizen s clothes telling mister Pettis his work at the penitentiary was done and he had decided to leave Ask no questions it is better that you know nothing said Calhoun mister Pettis took his advice but he was not surprised in the morning when he heard that Morgan had escaped For General Morgan to escape it was necessary for him to occupy a lower cell His brother Captain Dick Morgan occupied the cell next to Captain Hines The Captain giving up his chance of escaping effected an exchange of cells with his brother This was easily accomplished as they were about of a size and it was quite dark in the cells when they were locked in The General had been allowed to keep his watch When a few minutes after twelve came he arose fixed a dummy in his bed to resemble a man sleeping and breaking through the thin crust over the opening with his foot slipped into the air chamber He gave the signal and was quickly joined by his companions Captain Morgan had made a ladder out of strips of bed clothing and by the aid of this ladder they hoped to scale two walls one twenty feet high which would stand between them and liberty after they had emerged from the tunnel A little before midnight Calhoun made his way as close as he durst to the place where he knew the wall must be scaled Not three hundred feet away several guards were gathered around a fire The night was cold and the guards kept close to the fire Slowly the minutes passed The city clocks struck half past twelve Would they never come Had their flight been detected Suddenly a dark spot appeared on top of the wall Then another and another until Calhoun counted seven They were all there Silently they slid down the rope ladder the talk and laughter of the guards ringing in their ears But noiselessly they glided away and the darkness hid them This way whispered Calhoun When out of hearing of the guards they stopped for consultation It would not do to keep together They decided to go two and two Calhoun handed each a sum of money There was a strong clasping of the hands a whispered farewell and they who had dared so much separated The next morning there was consternation in the penitentiary at Columbus The news of Morgan s escape was flashed over the country The Federal authorities were astonished dumbfounded A reward of five thousand dollars was offered for his recapture Every house in Columbus was searched but to no purpose John Morgan had flown Illustration ESCAPE OF MORGAN FROM PRISON CHAPTER XXIII THE FLIGHT TO THE SOUTH The one fifteen train from Columbus to Cincinnati was about to start All aboard shouted the conductor Two gentlemen sauntered into one of the cars to all appearances the most unconcerned of individuals They took different seats the younger just behind the older General Morgan and Calhoun had reached the train in safety had purchased tickets and taken their seats without exciting suspicion A moment more and they would be on their way South A Federal major came hurrying in and seated himself beside Morgan and the two entered into conversation On the way out of the city the train had to pass close to the penitentiary The major pointing to the grim dark pile and thinking he might be imparting some information said There is where they keep the notorious John Morgan May he always be kept as safe as he is now quickly replied the General Oh they will keep him safe enough said the major complacently stroking his chin The major better understood the Delphic answer of the General the next morning All went well until Dayton was reached where by some accident the train was held over an hour It was an anxious hour to Morgan and Calhoun It meant that the train would be late in Cincinnati that before they arrived there the Federal authorities of the city might be informed of the escape It would never do for them to ride clear into the city As the train slowed up as it entered the suburbs the General and Calhoun both dropped off without being noticed Morgan being well acquainted with the city they quickly made their way to a ferry and by the time the escape had been discovered at the penitentiary Morgan s feet were pressing the soil of Kentucky Calhoun s heart thrilled as he once more breathed the air of his native state He felt like a new being yet he knew that it was hundreds of miles to safety They must steal through the states of Kentucky and Tennessee like hunted beasts for the enemy was everywhere But friends there were too friends as true as steel And hardly had they set foot in Kentucky before they found such a friend one who took them in fed them and protected them He gave them horses and sent them on their way Slowly they made their way through the state travelling all night sent from the house of one friend to that of another At last they reached the Cumberland River near Burkesville where they had crossed it at the beginning of their raid To Calhoun it seemed that years had passed since then so much had happened On entering Tennessee their dangers thickened They did not know friend from foe On entering a house they did not know whether they would be protected or betrayed The country was swarming with Federal cavalry It was rumored that Morgan was in the country making his way south and every officer was eager to add to his laurels by capturing him In the mountains Morgan and Calhoun met a party of forty or fifty Confederates who were making their way to the Confederate lines In the party were a number of Morgan s old men who hailed their chief with the wildest delight Morgan assumed command of them But few of the party were mounted consequently their progress was slow and their dangers were augmented All went well until the Tennessee River was reached a few miles below Kingston The river was high and there was no means of crossing A rude raft was constructed and with the horses swimming they commenced crossing When about half were across a company of Federal cavalry appeared and attacked those who were still on the northern bank On the frail raft Morgan started to push across to their aid Are you crazy General cried Calhoun you can do no good and will only be killed or captured See the men have scattered already and are taking to the woods and mountains It was true and Morgan reluctantly rode away He had the satisfaction afterwards of learning that most of the men escaped The next day was the last day that Calhoun ever rode with Morgan but little did he realize it at the time Along in the afternoon they became aware of the close proximity of a squadron of Federal cavalry Morgan and those with him took shelter behind a thick growth of cedars while Calhoun rode ahead to investigate He discovered no enemy and was coming back when he ran squarely into the Federals The foremost of them were not ten feet from Morgan he still being screened from view by the cedars Without hesitation Calhoun cried This way Major Hurry up they have gone this way pointing the way he had come The major took Calhoun for a guide and giving the command Forward rode rapidly after Calhoun and Morgan was saved For half a mile they rode when a stream was reached and it was seen no horseman had crossed it The major drew rein and turned to Calhoun in fury You have deceived me you dog he cried Yes I am one of Morgan s men calmly replied Calhoun The anger of the major was terrible He grew purple in the face Yes and you have led me away from Morgan he hissed You will pay for this Calhoun still remained calm That was not Morgan he said I ought to know Morgan I have ridden with him for two years I know better roared the Major thoroughly beside himself you are a lying scoundrel I will fix you What are you going to do asked Calhoun with apparent calmness but a great fear coming over him Hang you you lying devil as sure as there is a God in heaven I would not have had Morgan slip through my fingers for ten thousand dollars It would mean a brigadier generalship for me if I had caught him String him up men One of the soldiers coolly took the halter off his horse fastened it around Calhoun s neck threw the other end over the projecting limb of a tree and stood awaiting orders Once more an ignominious death stared Calhoun in the face and there was no Captain Huffman near to rescue him It looked as if nothing could save him but his self possession did not forsake him Major before you commit this great outrage an outrage against all rules of civilized warfare let me say one word Calhoun s voice did not even tremble as he asked this favor Be quick about it then but don t think you can say anything that will save your cursed neck Major if that was General Morgan as you say and I have been one of Morgan s men as I have confessed ought I not to be hanged if I had betrayed him into your hands The fire of anger died out of the major s eyes He hesitated and then said You are right If that was General Morgan and you are one of his men you should be hanged for betraying him not for saving him Then to his men he said Boys take off that halter he is too brave and true a man to be hanged Calhoun drew a long breath He had appealed to the major s sense of honor and the appeal had not been made in vain The major kept Calhoun for three days and during that time treated him more like a brother than a prisoner Calhoun never forgot his kindness At the end of the three days Calhoun was placed under a strong guard with orders to be taken to Knoxville He resolved to escape before Knoxville was reached or die in the attempt Never would he live to be taken North in irons as he would be when it became known that he was one of Morgan s officers At the end of the first day s journey the prisoners of whom there were several were placed in the tower room of a deserted house Three guards with loaded muskets stood in the room another was just outside the door Calhoun watched his chance and when the guards inside the room were not looking he dashed through the door closing it after him The guard outside raised his musket and fired So close was he that the fire from the muzzle of the gun burned Calhoun s face yet he was not touched Another guard but a few feet away saw him running and fired The ball tore its way through the side of his coat But he was not yet out of danger He had to pass close to two picket posts and as he neared them he was saluted with a shower of balls But he ran on unharmed One of the pickets with fixed bayonet took after him He came so close that Calhoun could hear his heavy breathing Calhoun ran as he had never run before A turn in the road took him out of sight of his pursuers and he sprang to one side and began to climb the mountain A squad of cavalry dashed by in pursuit they had missed him With a thankful heart Calhoun saw them disappear But darkness came on and he had to feel his way up the mountain on his hands and knees His progress was so slow that when morning came he had only reached the top of the mountain He could hear the shouts of the soldiers searching for him Near him was a growth of high grass Going into this he lay down and here he remained all day At one time the soldiers in search of him came within twenty feet of where he lay It was the longest and dreariest day that Calhoun ever spent Hunger gnawed him and he was consumed with a fierce thirst It was midwinter and the cold crept into his very bones The warmth of his body thawed the frozen ground until he sank into it When night came it froze again and when he tried to rise he found he was frozen fast It was with difficulty that he released himself without sacrificing his clothing For the next seven days he hardly remembers how he existed Travelling by night and hiding by day begging a morsel of food here and there he at last reached the Confederate lines near Dalton CHAPTER XXIV CHIEF OF THE SECRET SERVICE Is this General Shackelford asked Calhoun of a distinguished looking Confederate officer It is what can I do for you my boy You look as if you had been seeing hard times I have answered Calhoun I have just escaped from the North I am one of Morgan s men Are you one of the officers who escaped with Morgan asked the General with much interest Yes and no I was not in prison with Morgan but I escaped South with him I had a nephew with Morgan continued the General We have not heard from him since Morgan was captured The report is that he was killed in the last fight that Morgan had before he was captured Poor Cal and the General sighed Uncle Dick do you not know me asked Calhoun in a broken voice General Shackelford stared at Calhoun in astonishment It cannot be yes it is Cal he exclaimed and the next moment he had Calhoun by the hand and was nearly shaking it off And you have been in a Northern prison have you asked the General No but I was wounded near unto death Fortunately I fell into kind hands But your looks Cal you are nothing but skin and bones No wonder I have not had enough to eat in the last seven days to keep a bird alive Then I was none too strong when I started on my journey south Tell me about it some other time said the General What you want now is rest and something to eat And rest and food Calhoun got When he came to tell his story it was listened to with wonder He was taken to General Joseph E Johnston then in command of the Confederate forces around Dalton and the story was repeated You know I presume said Johnston that Morgan escaped and is now in Richmond Yes I long to be with him answered Calhoun I feel as strong as ever now Do not be in a hurry to report said Johnston Wait until you hear from me In a few days Calhoun received a message from General Johnston saying he would like to see him Calhoun lost no time in obeying the summons He was received most cordially In the first place Captain said the General allow me to present you this and he handed him his commission as captain in the Confederate army Calhoun choked he could only stammer his thanks But what came next astonished him still more I now offer you the position of Chief of the Secret Service of my army said the General After listening to your story although you are young I believe there is no officer in the army more capable of filling it Calhoun knew not what to say it was a place of the greatest honor but he hated to leave Morgan Will you let me consult my uncle before I give an answer asked Calhoun Most certainly replied the General Accept it by all means Cal said General Shackelford when Calhoun appealed to him In the first place it is your duty to serve your country in the place where you can do the most good There is no question but that at the head of the Secret Service you can render the country vastly better service than you can riding with Morgan In the next place I fancy it will not be exactly with Morgan as it was before his unfortunate raid His famous raiders are prisoners or scattered It will be impossible for him to gather another such force They understood him he understood them This will not be the case with a new command Then this is for your ear alone Calhoun the authorities at Richmond are not satisfied with Morgan In invading the North he disobeyed orders and this those high in authority cannot overlook So with many regrets Calhoun decided to accept the offer of General Johnston but for many days his heart was with his old chieftain The time came when he saw the wisdom of his uncle s remarks General Morgan never regained his old prestige It is true the Confederate government gave him the department of Western Virginia but they so hampered him with orders that any great success was impossible In June eighteen sixty four Morgan made his last raid into Kentucky At first he was successful sweeping everything before him He had the pleasure of taking prisoner General Hobson the man who had tracked him all through his Northern raid But at Cynthiana he met with overwhelming defeat his prisoners being recaptured and he escaping with only a small remnant of his command On the morning of the fourth of September eighteen sixty four the end came General Morgan was slain in battle at Greenville East Tennessee Calhoun mourned him as a father when he heard of his death It was long months afterwards before he heard the full particulars and then they were told him by an officer who was with the General on that fatal morning We marched into Greenville said the officer and took possession of the place on the afternoon of the threed There was a small company of Yankees within four miles of us but there was no considerable body of Yankees nearer than Bull s Gap sixteen miles away The General established his headquarters at the house of a missus Williams the finest house in the little city In the evening a furious storm arose and continued most all night The rain fell in torrents The lightning flashed incessantly and there was a continual crash of thunder It seemed impossible that troops could move in such a storm and we felt perfectly safe But there were traitors in Greenville and they carried the news to the little company of Yankees four miles away that Morgan was in the city and told at what house he lodged Two daring young cavalrymen volunteered to carry the news to General Gillem at Bull s Gap Talk about the ride of Paul Revere compared to the ride of those two Yankees Buffeted by wind and rain one moment in a glaring light and the next in pitch darkness with the thunder crashing overhead in spite of wind and rain those two cavalrymen rode the sixteen miles by midnight The command was aroused What if the rain did pour and the elements warred with each other Morgan was the prize and by daylight Gillem s soldiers had reached Greenville So complete was the surprise that the house in which the General slept was surrounded before the alarm was given Then thinking only of joining his men the General leaped out of bed and without waiting to dress seized his sword and dashed out of the house seeking to escape by the way of the garden But he was seen by a soldier and shot dead The news that Morgan was killed seemed to go through the air It was known in an incredibly short time by both sides Now said the officer occurred one of the most singular circumstances I know of during the war There was no flag of truce no orders to cease firing yet the firing ceased The Confederates gathered together and marched out of the city the Federals marched in the two were close together within easy musket range but not a shot was fired It seemed as if both sides were conscious that a great man had fallen a gallant soul fled and that even grim war should stay his hand It is not within the scope of this book to follow Calhoun through the last year of the war Suffice it to say that in the enlarged sphere of his new position his genius found full scope He was all through the Atlantic campaign where for four months the thunder of cannon never ceased and where seventy five thousand men were offered as a sacrifice to the god of war He followed Hood in his raid to the rear of Sherman s army and then into Tennessee He was in that hell of fire at Franklin where fell so many of the bravest sons of the South At Nashville he was among those who tried to stem the tide of defeat and was among the last to leave that fatal field When the remnants of Hood s army were gathered and marched across the states of Alabama and Georgia into North Carolina hoping to stay the victorious progress of Sherman Calhoun was with them Not until the surrender of Lee and Johnston did Calhoun give up every hope of the independence of the South But the end came and in bitter anguish he laid down his arms He had given his young life to his country when only seventeen years of age For four years he had fought and hoped When the end came it seemed to him the sky was darkened that every hope had perished that everything worth living for was gone Oh the bitterness of defeat Strong men wept like children Even the victors stood in silence over the grief of those whom they had met so many times in battle They were brothers now and they took them by the hand and bade them be of good cheer and divided their rations with them The soldiers who had fought each other on so many bloody fields were the first to fraternize the first to forget When Calhoun gave his parole he met his cousin Fred who was on General Sherman s staff The meeting was a happy one for Calhoun for it served to dispel the gloom which depressed his spirits It seemed to be like old times to be with Fred again Nothing would satisfy Fred but that Calhoun should return home by the way of Washington He consented and was in Washington at the time of the Grand Review All day long he watched the mighty armies of Grant and Sherman as with steady tread they marched through the streets showered with flowers greeted with proud huzzahs And then he thought of the home coming of the ragged Confederates and the tears ran down his cheeks But as he looked upon the thousands and thousands as they marched along and remembered the depleted ranks of the Southern army his only wonder was that the South had held out so long as it did Defeated they were but their deeds are carved deep in the temple of fame never to be erased CHAPTER XXV THE LONE RAIDER It was near the close of a beautiful day in early June that Joyce Crawford was once more standing by the gate looking down the road It is nearly two years since we saw her last She has grown taller more womanly even more beautiful if that were possible The sound of war had ceased in the land No longer was the fierce raider abroad yet Joyce Crawford stood looking down that road as intently as she did that eventful evening when Calhoun Pennington came riding to the door She had not heard a word from him since his escape nor had she expected to hear All that she could do was to scan the papers for his name among the killed or captured Confederates But the Northern papers published few names of Confederates known to have been killed except the highest and most distinguished officers During these two years Joyce s heart had been true to her raider lover He had said that he would come when the war was over that the thunder of the last cannon would hardly have ceased to reverberate through the land before he would be by her side It was two months since Lee had surrendered yet he had not come That he had been untrue she would not admit if such a thought came to her she dismissed it as unworthy No Like his general he was lying in a soldier s grave or he might be sick wounded unable to come This June evening as she stood looking down the road her thoughts were in the past Once more in imagination Morgan s raiders came riding by she beheld the country terror stricken men women and children fleeing from they hardly knew what Once more she heard the sound of distant battle then down the road that little cloud of dust which grew larger and larger until the horse with its stricken rider came to view How vividly she remembered it all how real it seemed to her She actually held her breath and listened to catch the sound of battle she strained her eyes to catch a glimpse of that little cloud of dust Illustration SHE HELD HER BREATH AND LISTENED TO CATCH THE SOUND OF BATTLE No sound of battle came to her ears but away down the road as far as she could see arose a little cloud of dust Her heart gave a great throb why she could not tell for she had seen a thousand clouds of dust arise from that road as she watched and waited The little cloud grew larger Now she could see it was caused by a single horseman one who rode swiftly and sat his horse with rare grace She stood with hands pressed to her bosom her eyes dilating her breath coming in quick short gasps Before she realized it the rider had thrown himself from his horse and with the cry of Joyce Joyce had her in his arms kissing her hair her brow her lips For a minute she lay at rest in his arms then with burning brow and cheek and neck she disengaged herself from his embrace and stood looking at him with lovelit eyes Could this be he whom two years before she had taken in wounded nigh unto death How manly he had grown How well his citizen suit became him Were you watching for me Joyce asked Calhoun I have watched for you every night since Lee surrendered I began to think you had forgotten no not that I feared you had been slain she exclaimed in a trembling voice Death only could have kept me from you Joyce In camp and battle your image was in my heart The thought of seeing you has sweetened the bitterness of defeat The war did not end as I thought it would but it has brought me to you to you Now that the war is over there is nothing to separate us is there Joyce She grew as pale as death She had not thought of her father before he believed that the South had been treated too leniently that treason should be punished All that the South had suffered he believed to be a just punishment for her manifold sins If the Rebels lives were spared they should be thankful and ask nothing more Joyce knew how her father felt Not a word had ever passed between them relative to Calhoun since his escape but the father knew much more than Joyce thought He had kept still thinking that time would cure his daughter of her infatuation for he considered it nothing else Calhoun saw the change in Joyce how she drew from him how pale she had grown and he asked What is it Joyce Why you shrink from me and tremble like a leaf Tell me Joyce what is it My father she whispered Oh I fear I fear Fear what darling That he will drive you from me that he will forbid me seeing you For what Because you fought against your country because you were one of Morgan s men What would he do Hang me if he could asked Calhoun bitterly No no but oh Calhoun let us hope for the best Perhaps when he sees you it will be different You must see him He and aunt have gone to New Lisbon but they will be at home presently With many misgivings Calhoun allowed his horse to be put up and he and Joyce enjoyed an hour s sweet converse before her father and aunt returned When her father entered the room Joyce with a palpitating heart said Father let me introduce you to mister Calhoun Pennington of Danville Kentucky He is the young officer whom we cared for when wounded He has come to thank us for the kindness shown him mister Crawford bowed coldly and said without extending his hand mister Pennington need not have taken the trouble the incident has long since been forgotten But supper is ready I trust mister Pennington will honor us by remaining and partaking of the repast with us Calhoun could do nothing but accept yet he felt he was an unwelcome guest As for Joyce she knew not what to think she could only hope for the best The meal passed almost in silence mister Crawford was scrupulously polite but his manner was cold and constrained Poor Joyce tried to talk and appear merry but had to give it up as a failure Every one was glad when the meal was through As they arose from the table mister Crawford said Joyce remain with your aunt I wish to have a private conversation with mister Pennington Calhoun followed him into the parlor He knew that what was coming would try his soul more than charging up to the mouth of a flaming cannon The first question asked nearly took Calhoun s breath away it was so sudden and unexpected It was Young man why am I honored with this visit As your daughter said to thank you for the kindness I received while an enforced guest in your house answered Calhoun and then he mentally cursed himself for his cowardice Guests who leave as unceremoniously as you did do not generally return to express their thanks answered mister Crawford dryly It was a poor return you gave my daughter for her kindness What do you mean asked Calhoun in surprise I mean that leaving as you did subjected my daughter to much unjust criticism An honorable man would have gone to prison rather than subjected the young lady to whom he owed his life to idle remarks Calhoun felt every nerve in him tingle His hot blood rushed through his veins like fire he clenched his hands until his nails buried themselves in the palms How he longed to throttle him and force the insult down his throat But he was an old man he was Joyce s father Then as Joyce had never told him it was she who had planned the escape it was not for him to speak Controlling himself by a mighty effort he calmly said mister Crawford I am sorry you think so poorly of me for I came here to ask of you the greatest boon you have to give on earth that is your consent that I may pay my addresses to your daughter and in due time make her my wife I love her with my whole soul and have reason to know that my love is returned And I had rather see my daughter dead than married to a Rebel and traitor especially to one of Morgan s men You have my answer said mister Crawford angrily Why call me Rebel and traitor asked Calhoun Whatever I may have been I am not that now The government has pardoned can you not be as generous as the government as generous as your great generals Grant and Sherman And the government will find out its mistake Your punishment has not been what your sins deserve Your lands should be taken from you and given to the poor beings you have enslaved these centuries But we need not quarrel You have had my answer concerning my daughter Now go and never let me see you again mister Crawford said Calhoun rising you have been very outspoken with me and I will be equally so with you As to the terms you say should have been given the South I will say that had such been even hinted at every man woman and child in the South would have died on their hearthstones before yielding But this is idle talk as I trust there are but few in the North so remorseless as you Now as to your daughter if she is willing I shall marry her in spite of you There is one raider of Morgan still in the saddle and he will not cease his raid until he has carried away the fairest flower in Ohio Go cried mister Crawford losing his temper go before I am forced to use harsher means Before Calhoun could reply before he could take a step there was a swish of woman s garments and before the father s astonished eyes there stood his daughter by the side of her lover Her form was drawn to its full height her bosom was heaving her eyes were flashing Taking her lover s hand she cried Father what have you done I love this man love him with all my heart and soul and he is worthy of my love If I can never call him husband no other man shall ever call me wife The father staggered and grew deadly pale O God he moaned I have no daughter now Child child much as I love you would that you were lying beside your mother Leaving the side of Calhoun Joyce went to her father and taking his hands in hers said Father grant me but a few moments private interview with Captain Pennington and I promise I will never marry him without your free and full consent Nay more without your consent I will never see him again or correspond with him Joyce Joyce cried Calhoun what are you doing What are you promising and he started toward her but she motioned him back Father Father she wailed don t you hear mister Crawford looked up Joyce what did you say What do you mean he whispered Joyce repeated what she had said And you mean it Joyce you are to stay with me he asked eagerly Yes but I must have a private interview with Captain Pennington before he goes Then it is for you to say whether I shall ever meet him again or not Calhoun stood by while this conversation was going on the great drops of perspiration gathering on his forehead Was he going to lose Joyce after all The father arose and left the room No sooner was he gone than she turned and with a low cry sank into her lover s arms Joyce Joyce what have you done cried Calhoun Fly with me now Let me take you to my Kentucky home Father will welcome you You will not lack the love of a father Joyce raised her head her eyes swimming in tears but full of love and tenderness Hear me Calhoun she said and then you will not blame me We cannot marry now we are both too young You told me that you and your cousin were to go to Harvard That means four long years Before that time my father may give his consent to our union But you told him you would not see me would not even write That means banishment Not from my heart she whispered Calhoun for you to attempt to see me now or to write to me would be but to increase my father s opposition I trust to time and by filial obedience to win him It is a fearful thing Calhoun to be disowned by one s own father and by a father who loves one as I know my father loves me It would kill him if I left him and the knowledge would make me unhappy even with you Calhoun do you love me As my life he answered clasping her once more to his breast And to be banished entirely from your presence is more than I can bear It is cruel of you to ask it Calhoun did you love me when I aided you to escape You know I did why do you ask Yet you left me for two long years left me to fight for principles which you held dear What if for love of me I had asked you to resign from the army to forsake the cause for which you were fighting I couldn t have done it Joyce I couldn t have done it even for your love But you would not ask me to do such a craven act And yet you ask me to forsake my father to be false to what I know is right Joyce how can I answer you I am dumb before your logic But how can I pass the weary years which are to come You have passed two since we parted and your college years need not be weary They will not be weary Have faith When father learns how good how noble how true you are he will give his consent And Mark my brother Mark he will plead for me I know Joyce I am like a criminal awaiting pardon a pardon which may never come Don t say that Now Calhoun we must part Remember you are not to try to see me or write to me But the moment father relents I will say Come It will not be long Now go Calhoun clasped her once more in his arms pressed the farewell kiss on her lips and left her CHAPTER XXVI COME Calhoun found his life in the university delightful He was a good student and a popular one The black haired young Kentuckian who had ridden with Morgan was a favorite in society Many were the languishing glances cast upon him by the beauties of Cambridge and Boston but he was true to Joyce In the still hours of the night his thoughts were of her and he wondered when he would hear that word Come But months and years passed and no word came He heard that her father was still obdurate He would wait until his college course was finished and then come what would he would see Joyce and try to shake her resolution He would carry her off vi et armis if necessary The day of his graduation came It was a proud as well as a sad day to him Sad because friendships of four years must be broken in most cases never to be renewed and sadder yet because no word had come from Joyce She must know that he was now free that of all things he would long to come to her Why should she longer be held by that promise to her father For the first time he felt bitterness in his heart Twilight darkness came still he sat in his apartments brooding From without came the shouts and laughter of students happy in the thought of going home but their laughter found no echo in his heart A step was heard and his cousin Fred came dashing into the room Why Cal he exclaimed why sit here in the darkness especially on this day of all days We are through Cal we are going back to Old Kentucky Don t the thought stir your blood Go away and leave me Fred I am desperate to night I want to be alone replied Calhoun half despondently half angrily Fred whistled Look here old fellow he said kindly this won t do It s time we met the folks down at the hotel By the way here is a telegram for you A messenger boy handed it to me as I was coming up to the room Calhoun took the yellow envelope languidly while Fred lighted the gas but no sooner had he glanced at his telegram than he gave a whoop that would have done credit to a Comanche Indian Fred Fred he shouted dancing around as if crazy when does the first train leave for the west Tell the folks I can t meet them Well I never began Fred but Calhoun stopped him by shaking his telegram in his face It read Come Joyce That was all but it was enough to tell Calhoun that the long years of waiting were over that the little Puritan girl had been true to her lover true to her father and won at last The first train that steamed out of Boston west bore Calhoun as a passenger and an impatient passenger he was How had it fared with Joyce during these years If Calhoun had known all that she suffered all her heartaches he would not have been so happy at Harvard as he was The fear of losing his daughter being gone mister Crawford like Pharaoh hardened his heart He believed that in time Joyce would forget a pitiable mistake made by many fathers A woman like Joyce who truly loves never forgets It is said that men do but this I doubt The troublesome days of Reconstruction came on and mister Crawford felt more aggrieved than ever toward the South He believed that the facts bore out his views that the North had been too lenient As for Joyce she gave little thought to politics She believed that her father would surely relent before Calhoun had finished his college course but as the time for his graduation approached and her father was still obdurate her courage failed Her step grew languid her cheeks lost their roses the music of her voice in song was no longer heard Strange that her father did not notice it but there was one who did That was her brother Mark He was now a major in the Regular Army had been wounded in a fight with the Apaches and was home on leave of absence To him Joyce confided all her sorrows and found a ready sympathizer for he was as tender of heart as he was brave He went to his father and talked to him as he had never talked before Your opposition is all nonsense said Mark Young Pennington is in every way worthy of her I have taken pains to investigate The old gentleman fairly writhed under his son s censures and tried to excuse himself by saying Mark I have said I had rather see her dead than married to a Rebel one of Morgan s men Well you will see her dead and that very soon retorted Mark thoroughly aroused Have you no eyes Have you not noticed her pale cheeks her languid steps Is she the happy girl she was Your foolish cruel treatment is killing her mister Crawford groaned Mark Mark he cried I can t bear to hear you talk like that you my only son I have only done what I thought was right You must be mistaken about Joyce I am not look at her yourself Never was there a more dutiful daughter than Joyce She would rather die than break her promise to you Free her from it Make her happy by telling her she can see Pennington Mark don t ask too much Joyce is all I have to comfort me When I am gone you will be the head of the family You can then advise her as you please Better be kind to her and give her your blessing while you live said his son turning away believing that his words would bear fruit What Mark had said deeply troubled mister Crawford He now noticed Joyce closely and was surprised that he had not perceived the change in her He meant to speak to her but kept putting it off day by day until sickness seized him The doctor came and told him he had but a short time to live mister Crawford heard the verdict with composure The Puritan blood in his veins led him to meet death as he would meet any enemy in life But he would do justice to his daughter before he died Calling Joyce to him he took her hand in his and said Joyce you have been all that a daughter should be to me but to you I have been a hard cruel father No no you have been the kindest of fathers she cried her tears falling fast Father don t talk so or you will break my heart Listen Joyce I now know how much suffering I have caused you I drove from you the man you loved Do you still love him Joyce Father I love him I shall always love him but I have been true to my promise I There child broke in mister Crawford say no more I know how true you have been how sacred you have kept your word while I oh forgive me Joyce Don t father don t you only did what you thought was right But Pennington Joyce has he been true all these years I charged him not to see or write to me until I bade him and that was to be when I had your free and full consent Father have I that consent now Yes yes tell him to come With her feet winged with love Joyce flew to send the glad message But that night mister Crawford became much worse It was doubtful if he would live until Calhoun could arrive Once more the sun is sinking in the west again is Calhoun galloping up the road which leads to the Crawford residence But Joyce is not standing at the gate watching for him The little cloud of dust grows larger and larger but it is not noticed In the house a life is ebbing away going out with the sun Calhoun is met by Abe who takes his horse and points to the house Massa Crawford dyin is all he said He is met at the door by Joyce Come father wants to see you she says and leads him into the chamber where the dying man lies Father here is Calhoun she sobbed mister Crawford opened his eyes stretched forth a trembling hand and it was grasped by Calhoun In that hour all animosity all bitterness was forgotten Joyce came and stood by the side of her lover Her father took her hand and placed it in that of Calhoun God bless you both my children he whispered Forgive There is nothing to forgive replied Calhoun in a choking voice A look of great contentment came over the dying man s face Sit by me Joyce he whispered Let me hold your hand in mine Joyce did so her tears falling like rain For some time she held her father s hand and then his mind began to wander It was no longer Joyce s hand he held but the hand of her mother who had lain in the grave for so many years Once he opened his eyes and seeing the face of Joyce bending over him murmured Kiss me Mary Brushing aside her tears Joyce kissed him not once but again and again He smiled closed his eyes and then fell asleep A year has passed since the death of mister Crawford Calhoun has come to claim his beautiful bride He is making his last raid but this time no enemy glowers upon him Instead flowers are scattered in his path glad bells are ringing a joyful welcome He is fully aware that the war has left many bitter memories yet when the words are spoken which link his life to Joyce s forever and forever for true love ends not in the grave he clasps her to his heart and thanks God that Morgan made his raid into Ohio THE END PRINTED BY R R DONNELLEY AND SONS COMPANY AT THE LAKESIDE

General Information About Project Gutenberg electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg org This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks FINIS
