none	none	bowed the big fellow calmly as he struck a light Appropriate don t you think Calderwell did not answer He thought he could not Well silence gives consent they say laughed the other Anyhow you must have had some reason for calling me that Arkwright what does M J stand for demanded Calderwell Oh is that it smiled the man opposite Well I ll own those initials have been something of a puzzle to people One man declares they re Merely Jokes but another not so friendly says they stand for Mostly Jealousy of more fortunate chaps who have real names for a handle My small brothers and sisters discovering with the usual perspicacity of one s family on such matters that I never signed or called myself anything but M J dubbed me Mary Jane And there you have it Mary Jane You Arkwright smiled oddly Oh well what s the difference Would you deprive them of their innocent amusement And they do so love that Mary Jane Besides what s in a name anyway he went on eyeing the glowing tip of the cigar between his fingers A rose by any other name you ve heard that probably Names don t always signify my dear fellow For instance I know a Billy but he s a girl Calderwell gave a sudden start You don t mean Billy Neilson The other turned sharply Do you know Billy Neilson Calderwell gave his friend a glance from scornful eyes Do I know Billy Neilson he cried Does a fellow usually know the girl he s proposed to regularly once in three months Oh I know I m telling tales out of school of course he went on in response to the look that had come into the brown eyes opposite But what s the use Everybody knows it that knows us Billy herself got so she took it as a matter of course and refused as a matter of course too just as she would refuse a serving of apple pie at dinner if she hadn t wanted it Apple pie scouted Arkwright Calderwell shrugged his shoulders My dear fellow you don t seem to realize it but for the last six months you have been assisting at the obsequies of a dead romance Indeed And is it buried yet Oh no sighed Calderwell cheerfully I shall go back one of these days I ll warrant and begin the same old game again though I will acknowledge that the last refusal was so very decided that it s been a year almost since I received it I think I was really convinced for a while that that she didn t want that apple pie he finished with a whimsical lightness that did not quite coincide with the stern lines that had come to his mouth For a moment there was silence then Calderwell spoke again Where did you know Miss Billy Oh I don t know her at all I know of her through Aunt Hannah Calderwell sat suddenly erect Aunt Hannah Is she your aunt too

none	none	This is a little old world after all isn t it She isn t my aunt She s my mother s third cousin None of us have seen her for years but she writes to mother occasionally and of course for some time now her letters have been running over full of Billy She lives with her I believe doesn t she She does rejoined Calderwell with an unexpected chuckle I wonder if you know how she happened to live with her at first Why no I reckon not

none	none	You being a Mary Jane ought to appreciate it You see Billy was named for one William Henshaw her father s chum who promptly forgot all about her At eighteen Billy being left quite alone in the world wrote to Uncle William and asked to come and live with him Well But it wasn t well William was a forty year old widower who lived with two younger brothers an old butler and a Chinese cook in one of those funny old Beacon Street houses in Boston The Strata Bertram called it Bright boy Bertram The Strata Yes I wish you could see that house Arkwright It s a regular layer cake Cyril he s the second brother must be thirty four or five now lives on the top floor in a rugless curtainless music mad existence just a plain crank Below him comes William William collects things everything from tenpenny nails to teapots I should say and they re all there in his rooms Farther down somewhere comes Bertram He s the Bertram Henshaw you understand the artist Not the Face of a Girl Henshaw The same only of course four years ago he wasn t quite so well known as he is now Well to resume and go on It was into this house this masculine paradise ruled over by Pete and Dong Ling in the kitchen that Billy s naive request for a home came Great Scott breathed Arkwright appreciatively Yes Well the letter was signed Billy They took her for a boy naturally and after something of a struggle they agreed to let him come For his particular delectation they fixed up a room next to Bertram with guns and fishing rods and such ladylike specialties and William went to the station to meet the boy With never a suspicion With never a suspicion Gorry Well he came and she conquered I guess things were lively for a while though Oh there was a kitten too I believe Spunk who added to the gayety of nations But what did the Henshaws do Well I wasn t there of course but Bertram says they spun around like tops gone mad for a time but finally quieted down enough to summon a married sister for immediate propriety and to establish Aunt Hannah for permanency the next day So that s how it happened Well by George cried Arkwright Yes nodded the other So you see there are untold possibilities just in a name Remember that Just suppose you as Mary Jane should beg a home in a feminine household say in Miss Billy s for instance I d like to retorted Arkwright with sudden warmth Calderwell stared a little The other laughed shamefacedly Oh it s only that I happen to have a devouring curiosity to meet that special young lady I sing her songs you know she s written some dandies I ve heard a lot about her and I ve seen her picture He did not add that he had also purloined that same picture from his mother s bureau the picture being a gift from Aunt Hannah So you see I would indeed like to occupy a corner in the fair Miss Billy s household I could write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her you know eh Of course Why don t you Mary Jane laughed Calderwell Billy d take you all right She s had a little Miss Hawthorn a music teacher there for months She s always doing stunts of that sort Belle writes me that she s had a dozen forlornites there all this last summer two or three at a time tired widows lonesome old maids and crippled kids just to give them a royal good time So you see she d take you without a doubt Jove what a pair you d make Miss Billy and mister Mary Jane You d drive the suffragettes into conniption fits just by the sound of you Arkwright laughed quietly then he frowned But how about it he asked I thought she was keeping house with Aunt Hannah Didn t she stay at all with the Henshaws Oh yes a few months I never knew just why she did leave but I fancied from something Billy herself said once that she discovered she was creating rather too much of an upheaval in the Strata So she took herself off She went to school and travelled considerably She was over here when I met her first After that she was with us all one summer on the yacht A couple of years ago or so she went back to Boston bought a house and settled down with Aunt Hannah And she s not married or even engaged Wasn t the last I heard I haven t seen her since December and I ve heard from her only indirectly She corresponds with my sister and so do I intermittently I heard a month ago from Belle and she had a letter from Billy in August But I heard nothing of any engagement How about the Henshaws I should think there might be a chance there for a romance a charming girl and three unattached men Calderwell gave a slow shake of the head I don t think so William is let me see nearly forty five I guess by this time and he isn t a marrying man He buried his heart with his wife and baby years ago Cyril according to Bertram hates women and all other confusion so that ought to let him out As for Bertram himself Bertram is only Bertram He s always been that Bertram loves girls to paint but I can t imagine him making serious love to any one It would always be the tilt of a chin or the turn of a cheek that he was admiring to paint No there s no chance for a romance there I ll warrant But there s yourself Calderwell s eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch Oh of course I presume January or February will find me back there he admitted with a sigh and a shrug Then a little bitterly he added No Arkwright I shall keep away if I can I know there s no chance for me now Then you ll leave me a clear field bantered the other Of course Mary Jane retorted Calderwell with equal lightness Thank you Oh you needn t laughed Calderwell My giving you the right of way doesn t insure you a thoroughfare for yourself there are others you know Billy Neilson has had sighing swains about I her I imagine since she could walk and talk She is a wonderfully fascinating little bit of femininity and she has a heart of pure gold All is I envy the man who wins it for the man who wins that wins her There was no answer Arkwright sat with his eyes on the moving throng outside the window near them Perhaps he had not heard At all events when he spoke some time later it was of a matter far removed from Miss Billy Neilson or the way to her heart Nor was the young lady mentioned between them again that day Long hours later just before parting for the night Arkwright said Calderwell I m sorry but I believe after all I can t take that trip to the lakes with you I I m going home next week Home Hang it Arkwright I d counted on you Isn t this rather sudden Yes and no I ll own I ve been drifting about with you contentedly enough for the last six months to make you think mountain climbing and boat paddling were the end and aim of my existence But they aren t you know really Nonsense At heart you re as much of a vagabond as I am and you know it Perhaps But unfortunately I don t happen to carry your pocketbook You may if you like I ll hand it over any time grinned Calderwell Thanks You know well enough what I mean shrugged the other There was a moment s silence then Calderwell queried Arkwright how old are you Twenty four Good Then you re merely travelling to supplement your education see Oh yes I see But something besides my education has got to be supplemented now I reckon What are you going to do There was an almost imperceptible hesitation then a little shortly came the answer Hit the trail for Grand Opera and bring up probably in vaudeville Calderwell smiled appreciatively You can sing like the devil he admitted Thanks returned his friend with uplifted eyebrows Do you mind calling it an angel just for this occasion Oh the matinee girls will do that fast enough But I say Arkwright what are you going to do with those initials then Let em alone Oh no you won t And you won t be Mary Jane either Imagine a Mary Jane in Grand Opera I know what you ll be You ll be Senor Martini Johnini Arkwrightino By the way you didn t say what that M J really did stand for hinted Calderwell shamelessly Merely Jokes in your estimation evidently shrugged the other But my going isn t a joke Calderwell I m really going And I m going to work But how shall you manage Time will tell Calderwell frowned and stirred restlessly in his chair But honestly now to to follow that trail of yours will take money And er a faint red stole to his forehead don t they have er patrons for these young and budding geniuses Why can t I have a hand in this trail too or maybe you d call it a foot eh I d be no end glad to Arkwright Thanks old man The red was duplicated this time above the brown silky beard That was mighty kind of you and I appreciate it but it won t be necessary A generous but perhaps misguided bachelor uncle left me a few thousands a year or so ago and I m going to put them all down my throat or rather into it before I give up Where you going to study New York Again there was an almost imperceptible hesitation before the answer came I m not quite prepared to say Why not try it here Arkwright shook his head I did plan to when I came over but I ve changed my mind I believe I d rather work while longer in America Hm m murmured Calderwell There was a brief silence followed by other questions and other answers after which the friends said good night In his own room as he was dropping off to sleep Calderwell muttered drowsily By George I haven t found out yet what that blamed M J stands for CHAPTER II AUNT HANNAH GETS A LETTER In the cozy living room at Hillside Billy Neilson s pretty home on Corey Hill Billy herself sat writing at the desk Her pen had just traced the date October twenty fifth when missus Stetson entered with a letter in her hand Writing my dear Then don t let me disturb you She turned as if to go Billy dropped her pen sprang to her feet flew to the little woman s side and whirled her half across the room There she exclaimed as she plumped the breathless and scandalized Aunt Hannah into the biggest easy chair I feel better I just had to let off steam some way It s so lovely you came in just when you did Indeed I I m not so sure of that stammered the lady dropping the letter into her lap and patting with agitated fingers her cap her curls the two shawls about her shoulders and the lace at her throat My grief and conscience Billy Wors t you ever grow up Hope not purred Billy cheerfully dropping herself on to a low hassock at Aunt Hannah s feet But my dear you you re engaged Billy bubbled into a chuckling laugh As if I didn t know that when I ve just written a dozen notes to announce it And oh Aunt Hannah such a time as I ve had telling what a dear Bertram is and how I love love love him and what beautiful eyes he has and such a nose and Billy Aunt Hannah was sitting erect in pale horror Eh Billy s eyes were roguish You didn t write that in those notes Write it Oh no That s only what I wanted to write chuckled Billy What I really did write was as staid and proper as here let me show you she broke off springing to her feet and running over to her desk There this is about what I wrote to them all she finished whipping a note out of one of the unsealed envelopes on the desk and spreading it open before Aunt Hannah s suspicious eyes Hm m that is very good for you admitted the lady Well I like that after all my stern self control and self sacrifice to keep out all those things I wanted to write bridled Billy Besides they d have been ever so much more interesting reading than these will be she pouted as she took the note from her companion s hand I don t doubt it observed Aunt Hannah dryly Billy laughed and tossed the note back on the desk I m writing to Belle Calderwell now she announced musingly dropping herself again on the hassock I suppose she ll tell Hugh Poor boy He ll be disappointed Billy sighed but she uptilted her chin a little He ought not to be I told him long long ago the very first time that that I couldn t I know dear but they don t always understand Aunt Hannah sighed in sympathy with the far away Hugh Calderwell as she looked down at the bright young face near her There was a moment s silence then Billy gave a little laugh He will be surprised she said He told me once that Bertram wouldn t ever care for any girl except to paint To paint indeed As if Bertram didn t love me just me if he never saw another tube of paint I think he does my dear Again there was silence then from Billy s lips there came softly Just think we ve been engaged almost four weeks and to morrow it ll be announced I m so glad I didn t ever announce the other two The other two cried Aunt Hannah Billy laughed Oh I forgot You didn t know about Cyril Cyril Oh there didn t anybody know it either not even Cyril himself dimpled Billy mischievously I just engaged myself to him in imagination you know to see how I d like it I didn t like it But it didn t last anyhow very long just three weeks I believe Then I broke it off she finished with unsmiling mouth but dancing eyes Billy protested Aunt Hannah feebly But I am glad only the family knew about my engagement to Uncle William oh Aunt Hannah you don t know how good it does seem to call him Uncle again It was always slipping out anyhow all the time we were engaged and of course it was

none	none	then That only goes to prove my dear how entirely unsuitable it was from the start A bright color flooded Billy s face I know but if a girl will think a man is asking for a wife when all he wants is a daughter and if she blandly says Yes thank you I ll marry you I don t know what you can expect You can expect just what you got misery and almost a tragedy retorted Aunt Hannah severely A tender light came into Billy s eyes Dear Uncle William What a jewel he was all the way through And he d have marched straight to the altar too with never a flicker of an eyelid I know self sacrificing martyr that he was Martyr bristled Aunt Hannah with extraordinary violence for her I m thinking that term belonged somewhere else A month ago Billy Neilson you did not look as if you d live out half your days But I suppose you d have gone to the altar too with never a flicker of an eyelid But I thought I had to protested Billy I couldn t grieve Uncle William so after missus Hartwell had said how he he wanted me Aunt Hannah s lips grew stern at the corners There are times when when I think it would be wiser if missus Kate Hartwell would attend to her own affairs Aunt Hannah s voice fairly shook with wrath Why Aunt Hannah reproved Billy in mischievous horror I m shocked at you Aunt Hannah flushed miserably There there child forget I said it I ought not to have said it of course she murmured agitatedly Billy laughed You should have heard what Uncle William said But never mind We all found out the mistake before it was too late and everything is lovely now even to Cyril and Marie Did you ever see anything so beatifically happy as that couple are Bertram says he hasn t heard a dirge from Cyril s rooms for three weeks and that if anybody else played the kind of music he s been playing it would be just common garden ragtime Music Oh my grief and conscience That makes me think Billy If I m not actually forgetting what I came in here for cried Aunt Hannah fumbling in the folds of her dress for the letter that had slipped from her lap I ve had word from a young niece She s going to study music in Boston A niece Well not really you know She calls me Aunt just as you and the Henshaw boys do But I really am related to her for her mother and I are third cousins while it was my husband who was distantly related to the Henshaw family What s her name Mary Jane Arkwright Where is that letter Here it is on the floor reported Billy Were you going to read it to me she asked as she picked it up Yes if you don t mind I d love to hear it Then I ll read it It it rather annoys me in some ways I thought the whole family understood that I wasn t living by myself any longer that I was living with you I m sure I thought I wrote them that long ago But this sounds almost as if they didn t understand it at least as if this girl didn t How old is she I don t know but she must be some old to be coming here to Boston to study music alone singing I think she said You don t remember her then Aunt Hannah frowned and paused the letter half withdrawn from its envelope No but that isn t strange They live West I haven t seen any of them for years I know there are several children and I suppose I ve been told their names I know there s a boy the eldest I think who is quite a singer and there s a girl who paints I believe but I don t seem to remember a Mary Jane Never mind Suppose we let Mary Jane speak for herself suggested Billy dropping her chin into the small pink cup of her hand and settling herself to listen Very well sighed Aunt Hannah and she opened the letter and began to read DEAR AUNT HANNAH This is to tell you that I m coming to Boston to study singing in the school for Grand Opera and I m planning to look you up Do you object I said to a friend the other day that I d half a mind to write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her and my friend retorted Why don t you Mary Jane But that of course I should not think of doing But I know I shall be lonesome Aunt Hannah and I hope you ll let me see you once in a while anyway I plan now to come next week I ve already got as far as New York as you see by the address and I shall hope to see you soon All the family would send love I know M J ARKWRIGHT Grand Opera Oh how perfectly lovely cried Billy Yes but Billy do you think she is expecting me to invite her to make her home with me I shall have to write and explain that I can t if she does of course Billy frowned and hesitated Why it sounded a little that way but Suddenly her face cleared Aunt Hannah I ve thought of the very thing We will take her Oh Billy I couldn t think of letting you do that demurred Aunt Hannah You re very kind but oh no not that Why not I think it would be lovely and we can just as well as not After Marie is married in December she can have that room Until then she can have the little blue room next to me But but we don t know anything about her We know she s your niece and she s lonesome and we know she s musical I shall love her for every one of those things Of course we ll take her But I don t know anything about her age All the more reason why she should be looked out for then retorted Billy promptly Why Aunt Hannah just as if you didn t want to give this lonesome unprotected young girl a home Oh I do of course but Then it s all settled interposed Billy springing to her feet But what if we we shouldn t like her Nonsense What if she shouldn t like us laughed Billy However if you d feel better just ask her to come and stay with us a month We shall keep her all right afterwards See if we don t Slowly Aunt Hannah got to her feet Very well dear I ll write of course as you tell me to and it s lovely of you to do it Now I ll leave you to your letters I ve hindered you far too long as it is You ve rested me declared Billy flinging wide her arms Aunt Hannah fearing a second dizzying whirl impelled by those same young arms drew her shawls about her shoulders and backed hastily toward the hall door Billy laughed Oh I won t again to day she promised merrily Then as the lady reached the arched doorway Tell Mary Jane to let us know the day and train and we ll meet her Oh and Aunt Hannah tell her to wear a pink a white pink and tell her we will too she finished gayly CHAPTER III BILLY AND BERTRAM Bertram called that evening Before the open fire in the living room he found a pensive Billy awaiting him a Billy who let herself be kissed it is true and who even kissed back shyly adorably but a Billy who looked at him with wide almost frightened eyes Why darling what s the matter he demanded his own eyes growing wide and frightened Bertram it s done What s done What do you mean Our engagement It s announced I wrote stacks of notes to day and even now there are some left for to morrow And then there s the newspapers Bertram right away now everybody will know it Her voice was tragic Bertram relaxed visibly A tender light came to his eyes Well didn t you expect everybody would know it my dear Y yes but At her hesitation the tender light changed to a quick fear Billy you aren t sorry The pink glory that suffused her face answered him before her words did Sorry Oh never Bertram It s only that it won t be ours any longer that is it won t belong to just our two selves Everybody will know it And they ll bow and smile and say How lovely to our faces and Did you ever to our backs Oh no I m not sorry Bertram but I am afraid Afraid Billy Yes Billy sighed and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire Across Bertram s face swept surprise consternation and dismay Bertram had thought he knew Billy in all her moods and fancies but he did not know her in this one Why Billy he breathed Billy drew another sigh It seemed to come from the very bottoms of her small satin slippered feet Well I am You re the Bertram Henshaw You know lots and lots of people that I never even saw And they ll come and stand around and stare and lift their lorgnettes and say Is that the one Dear me Bertram gave a relieved laugh Nonsense sweetheart I should think you were a picture I d painted and hung on a wall I shall feel as if I were with all those friends of yours Bertram what if they don t like it Her voice had grown tragic again Like it Yes The picture me I mean They can t help liking it he retorted with the prompt certainty of an adoring lover Billy shook her head Her eyes had gone back to the fire Oh yes they can I can hear them What she Bertram Henshaw s wife a frivolous inconsequential Billy like that Bertram Billy turned fiercely despairing eyes on her lover Bertram sometimes I wish my name were Clarissa Cordelia or Arabella Maud or Hannah Jane anything that s feminine and proper Bertram s ringing laugh brought a faint smile to Billy s lips But the words that followed the laugh and the caressing touch of the man s hands sent a flood of shy color to her face Hannah Jane indeed As if I d exchange my Billy for her or any Clarissa or Arabella that ever grew I adore Billy flame nature and And naughtiness put in Billy herself Yes if there be any laughed Bertram fondly But see he added taking a tiny box from his pocket see what I ve brought for this same Billy to wear She d have had it long ago if she hadn t insisted on waiting for this announcement business Oh Bertram

none	none	did you say it was Thursday Half past four South Station Thursday at half past four Let me see that s the day of the Carletons At Home isn t it Oh my grief and conscience yes But I had forgotten it What shall we do Oh that will be easy We ll just go to the Carletons early and have John wait then take us from there to the South Station Meanwhile we ll make sure that the little blue room is all ready for her I put in my white enamel work basket yesterday and that pretty little blue case for hairpins and curling tongs that I bought at the fair I want the room to look homey to her you know As if it could look any other way if you had anything to do with it sighed Aunt Hannah admiringly Billy laughed If we get stranded we might ask the Henshaw boys to help us out Aunt Hannah They d probably suggest guns and swords That s the way they fixed up my room Aunt Hannah raised shocked hands of protest As if we would Mercy what a time that was Billy laughed again I never shall forget never my first glimpse of that room when missus Hartwell switched on the lights Oh Aunt Hannah I wish you could have seen it before they took out those guns and spiders As if I didn t see quite enough when I saw William s face that morning he came for me retorted Aunt Hannah spiritedly Dear Uncle William What an old saint he has been all the way through mused Billy aloud And Cyril who would ever have believed that the day would come when Cyril would say to me as he did last night that he felt as if Marie had been gone a month It s been just seven days you know I know She comes to morrow doesn t she Yes and I m glad I shall tell Marie she needn t leave Cyril on my hands again Bertram says that at home Cyril hasn t played a dirge since his engagement but I notice that up here where Marie might be but isn t his tunes would never be mistaken for ragtime By the way she added as she rose from the table that s another surprise in store for Hugh Calderwell He always declared that Cyril wasn t a marrying man either any more than Bertram You know he said Bertram only cared for girls to paint but She stopped and looked inquiringly at Rosa who had appeared at that moment in the hall doorway It s the telephone Miss Neilson mister Bertram Henshaw wants you A few minutes later Aunt Hannah heard Billy at the piano For fifteen twenty thirty minutes the brilliant scales and arpeggios rippled through the rooms and up the stairs to Aunt Hannah who knew by the very sound of them that some unusual nervousness was being worked off at the finger tips that played them At the end of forty five minutes Aunt Hannah went down stairs Billy my dear excuse me but have you forgotten what time it is Weren t you going out with Bertram Billy stopped playing at once but she did not turn her head Her fingers busied themselves with some music on the piano We aren t going Aunt Hannah she said Bertram can t Can t Well he didn t want to so of course I said not to He s been painting this morning on a new portrait and she said he might stay to luncheon and keep right on for a while this afternoon if he liked And he did like so he stayed Why how how Aunt Hannah stopped helplessly Oh no not at all interposed Billy lightly He told me all about it the other night It s going to be a very wonderful portrait and of course I wouldn t want to interfere with his work And again a brilliant scale rippled from Billy s fingers after a crashing chord in the bass Slowly Aunt Hannah turned and went up stairs Her eyes were troubled Not since Billy s engagement had she heard Billy play like that Bertram did not find a pensive Billy awaiting him that evening He found a bright eyed flushed cheeked Billy who let herself be kissed once but who did not kiss back a blithe elusive Billy who played tripping little melodies and sang jolly little songs instead of sitting before the fire and talking a Billy who at last turned and asked tranquilly Well how did the picture go Bertram rose then crossed the room and took Billy very gently into his arms Sweetheart you were a dear this noon to let me off like that he began in a voice shaken with emotion You don t know perhaps exactly what you did You see I was nearly wild between wanting to be with you and wanting to go on with my work And I was just at that point where one little word from you one hint that you wanted me to come anyway and I should have come But you didn t say it nor hint it Like the brave little bit of inspiration that you are you bade me stay and go on with my work The inspiration s head drooped a little lower but this only brought a wealth of soft bronze hair to just where Bertram could lay his cheek against it and Bertram promptly took advantage of his opportunity And so I stayed Billy and I did good work I know I did good work Why Billy Bertram stepped back now and held Billy by the shoulders at arms length Billy that s going to be the best work I ve ever done I can see it coming even now under my fingers Billy lifted her head and looked into her lover s face His eyes were glowing His cheeks were flushed His whole countenance was aflame with the soul of the artist who sees his vision taking shape before him And Billy looking at him felt suddenly ashamed Oh Bertram I m proud proud proud of you she breathed Come let s go over to the fire and talk CHAPTER V MARIE SPEAKS HER MIND Billy with John and Peggy met Marie Hawthorn at the station Peggy was short for Pegasus and was what Billy always called her luxurious seven seated touring car I simply won t call it automobile she had declared when she bought it In the first place it takes too long to say it and in the second place I don t want to add one more to the nineteen different ways to pronounce it that I hear all around me every day now As for calling it my car or my motor car I should expect to see a Pullman or one of those huge black trucks before my door if I ordered it by either of those names Neither will I insult the beautiful thing by calling it a machine Its name is Pegasus I shall call it Peggy And Peggy she called it John sniffed his disdain and Billy s friends made no secret of their amused tolerance but in an astonishingly short time half the automobile owners of her acquaintance were calling their own cars Peggy and even the dignified John himself was heard to order some gasoline for Peggy quite as a matter of course When Marie Hawthorn stepped from the train at the North Station she greeted Billy with affectionate warmth though at once her blue eyes swept the space beyond expectantly and eagerly Billy s lips curved in a mischievous smile No he didn t come she said He didn t want to a little bit Marie grew actually pale Didn t want to she stammered Billy gave her a spasmodic hug Goosey No he didn t a little bit but he did a great big bit As if you didn t know he was dying to come Marie But he simply couldn t something about his concert Monday night He told me over the telephone but between his joy that you were coming and his rage that he couldn t see you the first minute you did come I couldn t quite make out what was the trouble But he s coming to dinner to night so he ll doubtless tell you all about it Marie sighed her relief Oh that s all right then I was afraid he was sick when I didn t see him Billy laughed softly No he isn t sick Marie but you needn t go away again before the wedding not to leave him on my hands I wouldn t have believed Cyril Henshaw confirmed old bachelor and avowed woman hater could have acted the part of a love sick boy as he has the last week or two The rose flush on Marie s cheek spread to the roots of her fine yellow hair Billy dear he he didn t Marie dear he he did Marie laughed She did not say anything but the rose flush deepened as she occupied herself very busily in getting her trunk check from the little hand bag she carried Cyril was not mentioned again until the two girls veils tied and coats buttoned were snugly ensconced in the tonneau and Peggy s nose was turned toward home Then Billy asked Have you settled on where you re going to live Not quite We re going to talk of that to night but we do know that we aren t going to live at the Strata Marie Marie stirred uneasily at the obvious disappointment and reproach in her friend s voice But dear it wouldn t be wise I m sure she argued hastily There will be you and Bertram We sha n t be there for a year nearly cut in Billy with swift promptness Besides I think it would be lovely all together Marie smiled but she shook her head Lovely but not practical dear Billy laughed ruefully I know you re worrying about those puddings of yours You re afraid somebody is going to interfere with your making quite so many as you want to and Cyril is worrying for fear there ll be somebody else in the circle of his shaded lamp besides his little Marie with the light on her hair and the mending basket by her side Billy what are you talking about Billy threw a roguish glance into her friend s amazed blue eyes Oh just a little picture Cyril drew once for me of what home meant for him a room with a table and a shaded lamp and a little woman beside it with the light on her hair and a great basket of sewing by her side Marie s eyes softened Did he say that Yes Oh he declared he shouldn t want her to sit under that lamp all the time of course but he hoped she d like that sort of thing Marie threw a quick glance at the stolid back of John beyond the two empty seats in front of them Although she knew he could not hear her words instinctively she lowered her voice Did you know then about me she asked with heightened color No only that there was a girl somewhere who he hoped would sit under the lamp some day And when I asked him if the girl did like that sort of thing he said yes he thought so for she had told him once that the things she liked best of all to do were to mend stockings and make puddings Then I knew of course twas you for I d heard you say the same thing So I sent him right along out to you in the summer house The pink flush on Marie s face grew to a red one Her blue eyes turned again to John s broad back then drifted to the long imposing line of windowed walls and doorways on the right The automobile was passing smoothly along Beacon Street now with the Public Garden just behind them on the left After a moment Marie turned to Billy again I m so glad he wants just puddings and stockings she began a little breathlessly You see for so long I supposed he wouldn t want anything but a very brilliant talented wife who could play and sing beautifully a wife he d be proud of like you Me Nonsense laughed Billy Cyril never wanted me and I never wanted him only once for a few minutes so to speak when I thought I did In spite of our music we aren t a mite congenial I like people around he doesn t I like to go to plays he doesn t He likes rainy days and I abhor them Mercy Life with me for him would be one long jangling discord my love while with you it ll be one long sweet song Marie drew a deep breath Her eyes were fixed on a point far ahead up the curveless street I hope it will indeed she breathed Not until they were almost home did Billy say suddenly Oh did Cyril write you A young relative of Aunt Hannah s is coming to morrow to stay a while at the house Er yes Cyril told me admitted Marie Billy smiled Didn t like it I suppose eh she queried shrewdly N no I m afraid he didn t very well He said she d be one more to be around There what did I tell you dimpled Billy You can see what you re coming to when you do get that shaded lamp and the mending basket A moment later coming in sight of the house Billy saw a tall smooth shaven man standing on the porch The man lifted his hat and waved it gayly baring a slightly bald head to the sun It s Uncle William bless his heart cried Billy They re all coming to dinner then he and Aunt Hannah and Bertram and I are going down to the Hollis Street Theatre and let you and Cyril have a taste of what that shaded lamp is going to be I hope you won t be lonesome she finished mischievously as the car drew up before the door CHAPTER VI AT THE SIGN OF THE PINK After a week of beautiful autumn weather Thursday dawned raw and cold By noon an east wind had made the temperature still more uncomfortable At two o clock Aunt Hannah tapped at Billy s chamber door She showed a troubled face to the girl who answered her knock Billy would you mind very much if I asked you to go alone to the Carletons and to meet Mary Jane she inquired anxiously Why no that is of course I should mind dear because I always like to have you go to places with me But it isn t necessary You aren t sick are you N no not exactly but I have been sneezing all the morning and taking camphor and sugar to break it up if it is a cold But it is so raw and Novemberish out that Why of course you sha n t go you poor dear Mercy don t get one of those dreadful colds on to you before the wedding Have you felt a draft Where s another shawl Billy turned and cast searching eyes about the room Billy always kept shawls everywhere for Aunt Hannah s shoulders and feet Bertram had been known to say indeed that a room according to Aunt Hannah was not fully furnished unless it contained from one to four shawls assorted as to size and warmth Shawls certainly did seem to be a necessity with Aunt Hannah as she usually wore from one to three at the same time which again caused Bertram to declare that he always counted Aunt Hannah s shawls when he wished to know what the thermometer was No I m not cold and I haven t felt a draft said Aunt Hannah now I put on my thickest gray shawl this morning with the little pink one for down stairs and the blue one for breakfast so you see I ve been very careful But I have sneezed six times so I think twould be safer not to go out in this east wind You were going to stop for missus Granger anyway weren t you So you ll have her with you for the tea Yes dear don t worry I ll take your cards and explain to missus Carleton and her daughters And of course as far as Mary Jane is concerned I don t know her any more than you do so I couldn t be any help there sighed Aunt Hannah Not a bit smiled Billy cheerily Don t give it another thought my dear I sha n t have a bit of trouble All I ll have to do is to look for a girl alone with a pink Of course I ll have mine on too and she ll be watching for me So just run along and take your nap dear and be all rested and ready to welcome her when she comes finished Billy stooping to give the soft faintly pink cheek a warm kiss Well thank you my dear perhaps I will sighed Aunt Hannah drawing the gray shawl about her as she turned away contentedly missus Carleton s tea that afternoon was for Billy not an occasion of unalloyed joy It was the first time she had appeared at a gathering of any size since the announcement of her engagement and as she dolefully told Bertram afterwards she had very much the feeling of the picture hung on the wall And they did put up their lorgnettes and say Is that the one she declared and I know some of them finished with Did you ever too she sighed But Billy did not stay long in missus Carleton s softly lighted flower perfumed rooms At ten minutes past four she was saying good by to a group of friends who were vainly urging her to remain longer I can t I really can t she declared I m due at the South Station at half past four to meet a Miss Arkwright a young cousin of Aunt Hannah s whom I ve never seen before We re to meet at the sign of the pink she explained smilingly just touching the single flower she wore Her hostess gave a sudden laugh Let me see my dear if I remember rightly you ve had experience before meeting at this sign of the pink At least I have a very vivid recollection of mister William Henshaw s going once to meet a boy with a pink who turned out to be a girl Now to even things up your girl should turn out to be a boy Billy smiled and reddened Perhaps but I don t think to day will strike the balance she retorted backing toward the door This young lady s name is Mary Jane and I ll leave it to you to find anything very masculine in that It was a short drive from missus Carleton s Commonwealth Avenue home to the South Station and Peggy made as quick work of it as the narrow congested cross streets would allow In ample time Billy found herself in the great waiting room with John saying respectfully in her ear The man says the train comes in on Track Fourteen Miss an it s on time At twenty nine minutes past four Billy left her seat and walked down the train shed platform to Track Number Fourteen She had pinned the pink now to the outside of her long coat and it made an attractive dash of white against the dark blue velvet Billy was looking particularly lovely to day Framing her face was the big dark blue velvet picture hat with its becoming white plumes During the brief minutes wait before the clanging locomotive puffed into view far down the long track Billy s thoughts involuntarily went back to that other watcher beside a train gate not quite five years before Dear Uncle William she murmured tenderly Then suddenly she laughed so nearly aloud that a man behind her gave her a covert glance from curious eyes My but what a jolt I must have been to Uncle William Billy was thinking The next minute she drew nearer the gate and regarded with absorbed attention the long line of passengers already sweeping up the narrow aisle between the cars Hurrying men came first with long strides and eyes that looked straight ahead These Billy let pass with a mere glance The next group showed a sprinkling of women women whose trig hats and linen collars spelled promptness as well as certainty of aim and accomplishment To these also Billy paid scant attention Couples came next the men anxious eyed and usually walking two steps ahead of their companions the women plainly flustered and hurried and invariably buttoning gloves or gathering up trailing ends of scarfs or boas The crowd was thickening fast now and Billy s eyes were alert Children were appearing and young women walking alone One of these wore a bunch of violets Billy gave her a second glance Then she saw a pink but it was on the coat lapel of a tall young fellow with a brown beard so with a slight frown she looked beyond down the line Old men came now and old women fleshy women and women with small children and babies Couples came too dawdling couples plainly newly married the men were not two steps ahead and the women s gloves were buttoned and their furs in place Gradually the line thinned and soon there were left only an old man with a cane and a young woman with three children Yet nowhere had Billy seen a girl wearing a white carnation and walking alone With a deeper frown on her face Billy turned and looked about her She thought that somewhere in the crowd she had missed Mary Jane and that she would find her now standing near But there was no one standing near except the good looking young fellow with the little pointed brown beard who as Billy noticed a second time was wearing a white carnation As she glanced toward him their eyes met Then to Billy s unbounded amazement the man advanced with uplifted hat I beg your pardon but is not this Miss Neilson Billy drew back with just a touch of hauteur Y yes she murmured I thought so yet I was expecting to see you with Aunt Hannah I am M J Arkwright Miss Neilson For a brief instant Billy stared dazedly You don t mean Mary Jane she gasped I m afraid I do His lips twitched But I thought we were expecting She stopped helplessly For one more brief instant she stared then suddenly a swift change came to her face Her eyes danced Oh oh she chuckled How perfectly funny You have evened things up after all To think that Mary Jane should be a She paused and flashed almost angrily suspicious eyes into his face But mine was Billy she cried Your name isn t really Mary Jane I am often called that His brown eyes twinkled but they did not swerve from their direct gaze into her own But Billy hesitated and turned her eyes away She saw then that many curious glances were already being flung in her direction The color in her cheeks deepened With an odd little gesture she seemed to toss something aside Never mind she laughed a little hysterically If you ll pick up your bag please mister Mary Jane and come with me John and Peggy are waiting Or I forgot you have a trunk of course The man raised a protesting hand Thank you but Miss Neilson really I couldn t think of trespassing on your hospitality now you know But we we invited you stammered Billy He shook his head You invited Miss Mary Jane Billy bubbled into low laughter I beg your pardon but it is funny she sighed You see I came once just the same way and now to have the tables turned like this What will Aunt Hannah say what will everybody say Come I want them to begin to say it she chuckled irrepressibly Thank you but I shall go to a hotel of course Later if you ll be so good as to let me call and explain But I m afraid Aunt Hannah will think Billy stopped abruptly Some distance away she saw John coming toward them She turned hurriedly to the man at her side Her eyes still danced but her voice was mockingly serious Really mister Mary Jane I m afraid you ll have to come to dinner then you can settle the rest with Aunt Hannah John is almost upon us and I don t want to make explanations Do you John she said airily to the somewhat dazed chauffeur who had been told he was to meet a young woman take mister Arkwright s bag please and show him where Peggy is waiting It will be five minutes perhaps before I can come if you ll kindly excuse me she added to Arkwright with a flashing glance from merry eyes I have some telephoning to do All the way to the telephone booth Billy was trying to bring order out of the chaos of her mind but all the way too she was chuckling To think that this thing should have happened to me she said almost aloud And here I am telephoning just like Uncle William Bertram said Uncle William did telephone about me In due course Billy had Aunt Hannah at the other end of the wire Aunt Hannah listen I d never have believed it but it s happened Mary Jane is a man Billy heard a dismayed gasp and a muttered Oh my grief and conscience then a shaking Wha at I say Mary Jane is a man Billy was enjoying herself hugely A ma an Yes a great big man with a brown beard He s waiting now with John and I must go But Billy I don t understand chattered an agitated voice over the line He he called himself Mary Jane He hasn t any business to be a big man with a brown beard What shall we do We don t want a big man with a brown beard here Billy laughed roguishly I don t know You asked him How he will like that little blue room Aunt Hannah Billy s voice turned suddenly tragic For pity s sake take out those curling tongs and hairpins and the work basket I d never hear the last of it if he saw those I know He s just that kind A half stifled groan came over the wire Billy he can t stay here Billy laughed again No no dear he won t I know He says he s going to a hotel But I had to bring him home to dinner there was no other way under the circumstances He won t stay Don t you worry But good by I must go Remember those curling tongs And the receiver clicked sharply against the hook In the automobile some minutes later Billy and mister M J Arkwright were speeding toward Corey Hill It was during a slight pause in the conversation that Billy turned to her companion with a demure I telephoned Aunt Hannah mister Arkwright I thought she ought to be warned You are very kind What did she say if I may ask There was a brief moment of hesitation before Billy answered She said you called yourself Mary Jane and that you hadn t any business to be a big man with a brown beard Arkwright laughed I m afraid I owe Aunt Hannah an apology he said He hesitated glanced admiringly at the glowing half averted face near him then went on decisively He wore the air of a man who has set the match to his bridges I signed both letters M J Arkwright but in the first one I quoted a remark of a friend and in that remark I was addressed as Mary Jane I did not know but Aunt Hannah knew of the nickname Arkwright was speaking a little slowly now as if weighing his words But when she answered I saw that she did not for from something she said I realized that she thought I was a real Mary Jane For the joke of the thing I let it pass But if she noticed my letter carefully she saw that I did not accept your kind invitation to give Mary Jane a home Yes we noticed that nodded Billy merrily But we didn t think you meant it You see we pictured you as a shy young thing But really she went on with a low laugh you see your coming as a masculine Mary Jane was particularly funny for me for though perhaps you didn t know it I came once to this very same city wearing a pink and was expected to be Billy a boy And only to day a lady warned me that your coming might even things up But I didn t believe it would a Mary Jane Arkwright laughed Again he hesitated and seemed to be weighing his words Yes I heard about that coming of yours I might almost say that s why I let the mistake pass in Aunt Hannah s letter he said Billy turned with reproachful eyes Oh how could you But then it was a temptation She laughed suddenly What sinful joy you must have had watching me hunt for Mary Jane I didn t acknowledged the other with unexpected candor I felt ashamed And when I saw you were there alone without Aunt Hannah I came very near not speaking at all until I realized that that would be even worse under the circumstances Of course it would smiled Billy brightly so I don t see but I shall have to forgive you after all And here we are at home mister Mary Jane By the way what did you say that M J did stand for she asked as the car came to a stop The man did not seem to hear at least he did not answer He was helping his hostess to alight A moment later a plainly agitated Aunt Hannah her gray shawl topped with a huge black one opened the door of the house CHAPTER VII OLD FRIENDS AND NEW At ten minutes before six on the afternoon of Arkwright s arrival Billy came into the living room to welcome the three Henshaw brothers who as was frequently the case were dining at Hillside Bertram thought Billy had never looked prettier than she did this afternoon with the bronze sheen of her pretty house gown bringing out the bronze lights in her dark eyes and in the soft waves of her beautiful hair

none	none	Jove Billy he said low in her ear as he greeted her I wish I had a brush in my hand this minute I d have a Face of a Girl that would be worth while Billy laughed and dimpled her appreciation but down in her heart she was conscious of a vague unrest 
5968_55202_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Billy wished sometimes that she did not so often seem to Bertram a picture

none	none	Oh yes Marie s coming she smiled in answer to the quick shifting of Cyril s eyes to the hall doorway And Aunt Hannah too They re up stairs And Mary Jane demanded William a little anxiously Will s getting nervous volunteered Bertram airily He wants to see Mary Jane You see we ve told him that we shall expect him to see that she doesn t bother us four too much you know 
5968_55202_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He s expected always to remove her quietly but effectually whenever he sees that she is likely to interrupt a tete a tete

5968_55202_000013_000001	train-clean-360	This last was from Bertram spoken softly and with a hurried glance toward the hall 
5968_55202_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Billy dropped her hands and lifted her head 
5968_55202_000014_000001	train-clean-360	By heroic effort she pulled her face into sobriety all but her eyes and announced

none	none	Yes Oh Uncle William I know now just how you felt I know I know gurgled Billy incoherently There he stood with his pink just as I did only he had a brown beard and he didn t have Spunk and I had to telephone to prepare folks just as you did And the room the room I fixed the room too she babbled breathlessly only I had curling tongs and hair pins in it instead of guns and spiders Child child what are you talking about William s face was red A man Mary Jane Cyril was merely cross Billy what does this mean Bertram had grown a little white 
5968_55202_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Billy began to laugh again yet she was plainly trying to control herself 
none	none	I ll tell you 
5968_55202_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I must tell you 
none	none	Aunt Hannah is keeping him up stairs so I can tell you she panted
5968_55202_000025_000003	train-clean-360	 But it was so funny when I expected a girl you know to see him with his brown beard and he was so tall and big 
none	none	And of course it made me think how I came and was a girl when you expected a boy and missus Carleton had just said to day that maybe this girl would even things up 
5968_55202_000025_000005	train-clean-360	Oh it was so funny 
none	none	Billy my my dear remonstrated Uncle William mildly But what is his name demanded Cyril
5968_55202_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Did the creature sign himself Mary Jane exploded Bertram 
none	none	I don t know his name except that it s M J and that s how he signed the letters But he is called Mary Jane sometimes and in the letter he quoted somebody s speech I ve forgotten just how but in it he was called Mary Jane and of course Aunt Hannah took him for a girl explained Billy grown a little more coherent now
5968_55202_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t he write again asked William 
none	none	Yes Well why didn t he correct the mistake then demanded Bertram Billy chuckled He didn t want to I guess 
5968_55202_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He thought it was too good a joke 
5968_55202_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Joke scoffed Cyril 
5968_55202_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 But see here Billy he isn t going to live here now Bertram s voice was almost savage 
5968_55202_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no he isn t going to live here now interposed smooth tones from the doorway 
5968_55202_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Arkwright breathed Billy confusedly 
5968_55202_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Three crimson faced men sprang to their feet 
5968_55202_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The situation for a moment threatened embarrassed misery for all concerned but Arkwright with a cheery smile advanced straight toward Bertram and held out a friendly hand 
none	none	The proverbial fate of listeners he said easily but I don t blame you at all No he isn t going to live here he went on grasping each brother s hand in turn as Billy murmured faint introductions and what is more he hereby asks everybody s pardon for the annoyance his little joke has caused He might add that he s heartily ashamed of himself as well but if any of you Arkwright turned to the three tall men still standing by their chairs if any of you had suffered what he has at the hands of a swarm of youngsters for that name s sake you wouldn t blame him for being tempted to get what fun he could out of Mary Jane if there ever came a chance 
5968_55202_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Naturally after this there could be nothing stiff or embarrassing Billy laughed in relief and motioned mister Arkwright to a seat near her William said Of course of course and shook hands again 
5968_55202_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Bertram and Cyril laughed shamefacedly and sat down 
5968_55202_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Somebody said But what does the M 
none	none	J stand for anyhow Nobody answered this however perhaps because Aunt Hannah and Marie appeared just then in the doorway Dinner proved to be a lively meal In the newcomer Bertram met his match for wit and satire and mister Mary Jane as he was promptly called by every one but Aunt Hannah was found to be a most entertaining guest 
5968_55202_000043_000000	train-clean-360	After dinner somebody suggested music 
5968_55202_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Cyril frowned and got up abruptly 
none	none	Still frowning he turned to a bookcase near him and began to take down and examine some of the books 
5968_55202_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram twinkled and glanced at Billy 
none	none	Which is it Cyril he called with cheerful impertinence stool piano or audience that is the matter to night Only a shrug from Cyril answered
5968_55202_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 You see explained Bertram jauntily to Arkwright whose eyes were slightly puzzled Cyril never plays unless the piano and the pedals and the weather and your ears and my watch and his fingers are just right 
5968_55202_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense scorned Cyril dropping his book and walking back to his chair 
5968_55202_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t feel like playing to night that s all 
5968_55202_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 You see nodded Bertram again 
5968_55202_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I see bowed Arkwright with quiet amusement 
5968_55202_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe mister 
none	none	Mary Jane sings observed Billy at this point demurely Why yes of course chimed in Aunt Hannah with some nervousness That s what she I mean he was coming to Boston for to study music 
5968_55202_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Everybody laughed 
none	none	Won t you sing please asked Billy
5968_55202_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 Can you without your notes 
5968_55202_000055_000002	train-clean-360	I have lots of songs if you want them 
5968_55202_000056_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment but only a moment Arkwright hesitated then he rose and went to the piano 
none	none	With the easy sureness of the trained musician his fingers dropped to the keys and slid into preliminary chords and arpeggios to test the touch of the piano then with a sweetness and purity that made every listener turn in amazed delight a well trained tenor began the Thro the leaves the night winds moving of Schubert s Serenade 
5968_55202_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Cyril s chin had lifted at the first tone 
5968_55202_000058_000001	train-clean-360	He was listening now with very obvious pleasure 
5968_55202_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Bertram too was showing by his attitude the keenest appreciation 
none	none	William and Aunt Hannah resting back in their chairs were contentedly nodding their approval to each other Marie in her corner was motionless with rapture As to Billy Billy was plainly oblivious of everything but the song and the singer 
5968_55202_000058_000006	train-clean-360	She seemed scarcely to move or to breathe till the song s completion then there came a low Oh how beautiful through her parted lips 
5968_55202_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram looking at her was conscious of a vague irritation 
none	none	Arkwright you re a lucky dog he declared almost crossly
5968_55202_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish I could sing like that 
none	none	I wish I could paint a Face of a Girl smiled the tenor as he turned from the piano Oh but mister Arkwright don t stop objected Billy springing to her feet and going to her music cabinet by the piano There s a little song of Nevin s I want you to sing 
5968_55202_000062_000002	train-clean-360	There here it is 
5968_55202_000062_000003	train-clean-360	Just let me play it for you And she slipped into the place the singer had just left 
5968_55202_000063_000000	train-clean-360	It was the beginning of the end 
none	none	After Nevin came De Koven and after De Koven Gounod 
5968_55202_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Then came Nevin again Billy still playing the accompaniment 
5968_55202_000063_000003	train-clean-360	Next followed a duet 
5968_55202_000063_000004	train-clean-360	Billy did not consider herself much of a singer but her voice was sweet and true and not without training It blended very prettily with the clear pure tenor 
none	none	William and Aunt Hannah still smiled contentedly in their chairs though Aunt Hannah had reached for the pink shawl near her the music had sent little shivers down her spine Cyril with Marie had slipped into the little reception room across the hall ostensibly to look at some plans for a house although as everybody knew they were not intending to build for a year 
5968_55202_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram still sitting stiffly erect in his chair was not conscious of a vague irritation now 
none	none	He was conscious of a very real and a very decided one an irritation that was directed against himself against Billy and against this man Arkwright but chiefly against music per se He hated music He wished he could sing 
5968_55202_000065_000004	train-clean-360	He wondered how long it took to teach a man to sing anyhow and he wondered if a man could sing who never had sung 
5968_55202_000066_000000	train-clean-360	At this point the duet came to an end and Billy and her guest left the piano 
5968_55202_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Almost at once after this Arkwright made his very graceful adieus and went off with his suit case to the hotel where as he had informed Aunt Hannah his room was already engaged 
5968_55202_000067_000000	train-clean-360	William went home then and Aunt Hannah went up stairs 
none	none	Cyril and Marie withdrew into a still more secluded corner to look at their plans and Bertram found himself at last alone with Billy He forgot then in the blissful hour he spent with her before the open fire how he hated music though he did say just before he went home that night
5968_55202_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Billy how long does it take to learn to sing 
none	none	Why I don t know I m sure replied Billy abstractedly then with sudden fervor Oh Bertram hasn t mister Mary Jane a beautiful voice 
5968_55202_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Bertram wished then he had not asked the question but all he said was 
none	none	mister Mary Jane indeed 
5968_55202_000071_000002	train-clean-360	What an absurd name 
5968_55202_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 But doesn t he sing beautifully 
none	none	Eh 
5968_55202_000073_000001	train-clean-360	Oh yes he sings all right said Bertram s tongue 
none	none	Bertram s manner said Oh yes anybody can sing CHAPTER VIII M J OPENS THE GAME On the morning after Cyril s first concert of the season Billy sat sewing with Aunt Hannah in the little sitting room at the end of the hall upstairs Aunt Hannah wore only one shawl this morning which meant that she was feeling unusually well Marie ought to be here to mend these stockings remarked Billy as she critically examined a tiny break in the black silk mesh stretched across the darning egg in her hand only she d want a bigger hole She does so love to make a beautiful black latticework bridge across a yawning white china sea and you d think the safety of an army depended on the way each plank was laid too she concluded Aunt Hannah smiled tranquilly but she did not speak I suppose you don t happen to know if Cyril does wear big holes in his socks resumed Billy after a moment s silence If you ll believe it that thought popped into my head last night when Cyril was playing that concerto so superbly It did actually right in the middle of the adagio movement too And in spite of my joy and pride in the music I had all I could do to keep from nudging Marie right there and then and asking her whether or not the dear man was hard on his hose Billy gasped the shocked Aunt Hannah but the gasp broke at once into what in Aunt Hannah passed for a chuckle If I remember rightly when I was there at the house with you at first my dear William told me that Cyril wouldn t wear any sock after it came to mending Horrors Billy waved her stocking in mock despair That will never do in the world It would break Marie s heart You know how she dotes on darning Yes I know smiled Aunt Hannah By the way where is she this morning Billy raised her eyebrows quizzically Gone to look at an apartment in Cambridge I believe Really Aunt Hannah between her home hunting in the morning and her furniture and rug hunting in the afternoon and her poring over house plans in the evening I can t get her to attend to her clothes at all Never did I see a bride so utterly indifferent to her trousseau as Marie Hawthorn and her wedding less than a month away But she s been shopping with you once or twice since she came back hasn t she And she said it was for her trousseau Billy laughed Her trousseau Oh yes it was I ll tell you what she got for her trousseau that first day We started out to buy two hats some lace for her wedding gown some crepe de Chine and net for a little dinner frock and some silk for a couple of waists to go with her tailored suit and what did we get We purchased a new style egg beater and a set of cake tins Marie got into the kitchen department and I simply couldn t get her out of it But the next day I was not to be inveigled below stairs by any plaintive prayer for a nutmeg grater or a soda spoon She shopped that day and to some purpose We accomplished lots Aunt Hannah looked a little concerned But she must have some things started Oh she has most everything now I ve seen to that Of course her outfit is very simple anyway Marie hasn t much money you know and she simply won t let me do half what I want to Still she had saved up some money and I ve finally convinced her that a trousseau doesn t consist of egg beaters and cake tins and that Cyril would want her to look pretty That name will fetch her every time and I ve learned to use it beautifully I think if I told her Cyril approved of short hair and near sightedness she d I cut off her golden locks and don spectacles on the spot Aunt Hannah laughed softly What a child you are Billy Besides just as if Marie were the only one in the house who is ruled by a magic name The color deepened in Billy s cheeks Well of course any girl cares something for the man she loves Just as if I wouldn t do anything in the world I could for Bertram Oh that makes me think who was that young woman Bertram was talking with last evening just after he left us I mean Miss Winthrop Miss Marguerite Winthrop Bertram is is painting her portrait you know Oh is that the one murmured Aunt Hannah Hm m well she has a beautiful face Yes she has Billy spoke very cheerfully She even hummed a little tune as she carefully selected a needle from the cushion in her basket There s a peculiar something in her face mused Aunt Hannah aloud The little tune stopped abruptly ending in a nervous laugh Dear me I wonder how it feels to have a peculiar something in your face Bertram too says she has it He s trying to catch it he says I wonder now if he does catch it does she lose it Flippant as were the words the voice that uttered them shook a little Aunt Hannah smiled indulgently Aunt Hannah had heard only the flippancy not the shake I don t know my dear You might ask him this afternoon Billy made a sudden movement The china egg in her lap rolled to the floor Oh but I don t see him this afternoon she said lightly as she stooped to pick up the egg Why I m sure he told me Aunt Hannah s sentence ended in a questioning pause Yes I know nodded Billy brightly but he s told me something since He isn t going He telephoned me this morning Miss Winthrop wanted the sitting changed from to morrow to this afternoon He said he knew I d understand Why yes but Aunt Hannah did not finish her sentence The whir of an electric bell had sounded through the house A few moments later Rosa appeared in the open doorway It s mister Arkwright Miss He said as how he had brought the music she announced Tell him I ll be down at once directed the mistress of Hillside As the maid disappeared Billy put aside her work and sprang lightly to her feet Now wasn t that nice of him We were talking last night about some duets he had and he said he d bring them over I didn t know he d come so soon though Billy had almost reached the bottom of the stairway when a low familiar strain of music drifted out from the living room Billy caught her breath and held her foot suspended The next moment the familiar strain of music had become a lullaby one of Billy s own and sung now by a melting tenor voice that lingered caressingly and understandingly on every tender cadence Motionless and almost breathless Billy waited until the last low lul la by vibrated into silence then with shining eyes and outstretched hands she entered the living room Oh that was beautiful she breathed Arkwright was on his feet instantly His eyes too were alight I could not resist singing it just once here he said a little unsteadily as their hands met But to hear my little song sung like that I couldn t believe it was mine choked Billy still plainly very much moved You sang it as I ve never heard it sung before Arkwright shook his head slowly The inspiration of the room that is all he said It is a beautiful song All of your songs are beautiful Billy blushed rosily Thank you You know more of them then I think I know them all unless you have some new ones out Have you some new ones lately Billy shook her head No I haven t written anything since last spring But you re going to She drew a long sigh Yes oh yes I know that now With a swift biting of her lower lip Billy caught herself up in time As if she could tell this man this stranger what she had told Bertram that night by the fire that she knew that now now she would write beautiful songs with his love and his pride in her as incentives Oh yes I think I shall write more one of these days she finished lightly But come this isn t singing duets I want to see the music you brought They sang then one after another of the duets To Billy the music was new and interesting To Billy too it was new and interesting to hear her own voice blending with another s so perfectly to feel herself a part of such exquisite harmony Oh oh she breathed ecstatically after the last note of a particularly beautiful phrase I never knew before how lovely it was to sing duets Nor I replied Arkwright in a voice that was not quite steady Arkwright s eyes were on the enraptured face of the girl so near him It was well perhaps that Billy did not happen to turn and catch their expression Still it might have been better if she had turned after all But Billy s eyes were on the music before her Her fingers were busy with the fluttering pages searching for another duet Didn t you she murmured abstractedly I supposed you d sung them before but you see I never did until the other night There let s try this one This one was followed by another and another Then Billy drew a long breath There that must positively be the last she declared reluctantly I m so hoarse now I can scarcely croak You see I don t pretend to sing really Don t you You sing far better than some who do anyhow retorted the man warmly Thank you smiled Billy that was nice of you to say so for my sake and the others aren t here to care But tell me of yourself I haven t had a chance to ask you yet and I think you said Mary Jane was going to study for Grand Opera Arkwright laughed and shrugged his shoulders She is but as I told Calderwell she s quite likely to bring up in vaudeville Calderwell Do you mean Hugh Calderwell Billy s cheeks showed a deeper color The man gave an embarrassed little laugh He had not meant to let that name slip out just yet Yes He hesitated then plunged on recklessly We tramped half over Europe together last summer Did you Billy left her seat at the piano for one nearer the fire But this isn t telling me about your own plans she hurried on a little precipitately You ve studied before of course Your voice shows that Oh yes I ve studied singing several years and I ve had a year or two of church work besides a little concert practice of a mild sort Have you begun here yet Y yes I ve had my voice tried Billy sat erect with eager interest They liked it of course Arkwright laughed I m not saying that No but I am declared Billy with conviction They couldn t help liking it Arkwright laughed again Just how well they had liked it he did not intend to say Their remarks had been quite too flattering to repeat even to this very plainly interested young woman delightful and heart warming as was this same show of interest to himself Thank you was all he said Billy gave an excited little bounce in her chair And you ll begin to learn roles right away I already have some after a fashion before I came here Really How splendid Why then you ll be acting them next right on the Boston Opera House stage and we ll all go to hear you How perfectly lovely I can hardly wait Arkwright laughed but his eyes glowed with pleasure Aren t you hurrying things a little he ventured But they do let the students appear argued Billy I knew a girl last year who went on in Aida and she was a pupil at the School She sang first in a Sunday concert then they put her in the bill for a Saturday night She did splendidly so well that they gave her a chance later at a subscription performance Oh you ll be there and soon too Thank you I only wish the powers that could put me there had your flattering enthusiasm on the matter he smiled I don t worry any nodded Billy only please don t arrive too soon not before the wedding you know she added jokingly We shall be too busy to give you proper attention until after that A peculiar look crossed Arkwright s face The wedding he asked a little faintly Yes Didn t you know My friend Miss Hawthorn is to marry mister Cyril Henshaw next month The man opposite relaxed visibly Oh Miss Hawthorn No I didn t know he murmured then with sudden astonishment he added And to mister Cyril the musician did you say Yes You seem surprised I am Arkwright paused then went on almost defiantly You see Calderwell was telling me only last September how very unmarriageable all the Henshaw brothers were So I am surprised naturally finished Arkwright as he rose to take his leave A swift crimson stained Billy s face But surely you must know that that That he has a right to change his mind of course supplemented Arkwright smilingly coming to her rescue in the evident confusion that would not let her finish her sentence But Calderwell made it so emphatic you see about all the brothers He said that William had lost his heart long ago that Cyril hadn t any to lose and that Bertram But mister Arkwright Bertram is is Billy had moistened her lips and plunged hurriedly in to prevent Arkwright s next words But again was she unable to finish her sentence and again was she forced to listen to a very different completion from the smiling lips of the man at her side Is an artist of course said Arkwright That s what Calderwell declared that it would always be the tilt of a chin or the curve of a cheek that the artist loved to paint Billy drew back suddenly Her face paled As if now she could tell this man that Bertram Henshaw was engaged to her He would find it out soon of course for himself and perhaps he like Hugh Calderwell would think it was the curve of her cheek or the tilt of her chin Billy lifted her chin very defiantly now as she held out her hand in good by CHAPTER IX A RUG A PICTURE AND A GIRL AFRAID Thanksgiving came Once again the Henshaw brothers invited Billy and Aunt Hannah to spend the day with them This time however there was to be an additional guest present in the person of Marie Hawthorn And what a day it was for everything and everybody concerned First the Strata itself from Dong Ling s kitchen in the basement to Cyril s domain on the top floor the house was as spick and span as Pete s eager old hands could make it In the drawing room and in Bertram s den and studio great clusters of pink roses perfumed the air and brightened the sombre richness of the old time furnishings Before the open fire in the den a sleek gray cat adorned with a huge ribbon bow the exact shade of the roses Bertram had seen to that winked and blinked sleepy yellow eyes In Bertram s studio the latest Face of a Girl had made way for a group of canvases and plaques every one of which showed Billy Neilson in one pose or another Up stairs where William s chaos of treasures filled shelves and cabinets the place of honor was given to a small black velvet square on which rested a pair of quaint Battersea enamel mirror knobs In Cyril s rooms usually so austerely bare a handsome Oriental rug and several curtain draped chairs hinted at purchases made at the instigation of a taste other than his own When the doorbell rang Pete admitted the ladies with a promptness that was suggestive of surreptitious watching at some window On Pete s face the dignity of his high office and the delight of the moment were fighting for mastery The dignity held firmly through missus Stetson s friendly greeting but it fled in defeat when Billy Neilson stepped over the threshold with a cheery Good morning Pete Laws But it s good to be seein you here again stammered the man delight now in sole possession She ll be coming to stay one of these days Pete smiled the eldest Henshaw hurrying forward I wish she had now whispered Bertram who in spite of William s quick stride had reached Billy s side first From the stairway came the patter of a man s slippered feet The rug has come and the curtains too called a householder sort of voice that few would have recognized as belonging to Cyril Henshaw You must all come up stairs and see them after dinner The voice apparently spoke to everybody but the eyes of the owner of the voice plainly saw only the fair haired young woman who stood a little in the shadow behind Billy and who was looking about her now as at something a little fearsome but very dear You know I ve never been where you live before explained Marie Hawthorn in a low vibrant tone when Cyril bent over her to take the furs from her shoulders In Bertram s den a little later as hosts and guests advanced toward the fire the sleek gray cat rose stretched lazily and turned her head with majestic condescension Well Spunkie come here commanded Billy snapping her fingers at the slow moving creature on the hearthrug Spunkie when I am your mistress you ll have to change either your name or your nature As if I were going to have such a bunch of independent moderation as you masquerading as an understudy to my frisky little Spunk Everybody laughed William regarded his namesake with fond eyes as he said Spunkie doesn t seem to be worrying The cat had jumped into Billy s lap with a matter of course air that was unmistakable and to Bertram adorable Bertram s eyes as they rested on Billy were even fonder than were his brother s I don t think any one is worrying he said with quiet emphasis Billy smiled I should think they might be she answered Only think how dreadfully upsetting I was in the first place William s beaming face grew a little stern Nobody knew it but Kate and she didn t know it she only imagined it he said tersely Billy shook her head I m not so sure she demurred As I look back at it now I think I can discern a few evidences myself that I was upsetting I was a bother to Bertram in his painting I am sure You were an inspiration corrected Bertram Think of the posing you did for me A swift something like a shadow crossed Billy s face but before her lover could question its meaning it was gone And I know I was a torment to Cyril Billy had turned to the musician now Well I admit you were a little upsetting at times retorted that individual with something of his old imperturbable rudeness Nonsense cut in William sharply You were never anything but a comfort in the house Billy my dear and you never will be Thank you murmured Billy demurely I ll remember that when Pete and I disagree about the table decorations and Dong Ling doesn t like the way I want my soup seasoned An anxious frown showed on Bertram s face Billy he said in a low voice as the others laughed at her sally you needn t have Pete nor Dong Ling here if you don t want them Don t want them echoed Billy indignantly Of course I want them But Pete is old and Yes and where s he grown old For whom has he worked the last fifty years while he s been growing old I wonder if you think I d let Pete leave this house as long as he wants to stay As for Dong Ling A sudden movement of Bertram s hand arrested her words She looked up to find Pete in the doorway Dinner is served sir announced the old butler his eyes on his master s face William rose with alacrity and gave his arm to Aunt Hannah Well I m sure we re ready for dinner he declared It was a good dinner and it was well served It could scarcely have been otherwise with Dong Ling in the kitchen and Pete in the dining room doing their utmost to please But even had the turkey been tough instead of tender and even had the pies been filled with sawdust instead of with delicious mincemeat it is doubtful if four at the table would have known the difference Cyril and Marie at one end were discussing where to put their new sideboard in their dining room and Bertram and Billy at the other were talking of the next Thanksgiving when according to Bertram the Strata would have the dearest little mistress that ever was born As if under these circumstances the tenderness of the turkey or the toothsomeness of the mince pie mattered To Aunt Hannah and William in the centre of the table however it did matter so it was well of course that the dinner was a good one And now said Cyril when dinner was over suppose you come up and see the rug In compliance with this suggestion the six trailed up the long flights of stairs then Billy carrying an extra shawl for Aunt Hannah Cyril s rooms were always cool Oh yes I knew we should need it she nodded to Bertram as she picked up the shawl from the hall stand where she had left it when she came in That s why I brought it Oh my grief and conscience Cyril how can you stand it to climb stairs like this panted Aunt Hannah as she reached the top of the last flight and dropped breathlessly into the nearest chair from which Marie had rescued a curtain just in time Well I m not sure I could if I were always to eat a Thanksgiving dinner just before laughed Cyril Maybe I ought to have waited and let you rest an hour or two But twould have been too dark then to see the rug objected Marie It s a genuine Persian a Kirman you know and I m so proud of it she added turning to the others I wanted you to see the colors by daylight Cyril likes it better anyhow in the daytime Fancy Cyril liking any sort of a rug at any time chuckled Bertram his eyes on the rich softly blended colors of the rug before him Honestly Miss Marie he added turning to the little bride elect how did you ever manage to get him to buy any rug He won t have so much as a ravelling on the floor up here to walk on A startled dismay came into Marie s blue eyes Why I thought he wanted rugs she faltered I m sure he said Of course I want rugs interrupted Cyril irritably I want them everywhere except in my own especial den You don t suppose I want to hear other people clattering over bare floors all day do you Of course not Bertram s face was preternaturally grave as he turned to the little music teacher I hope Miss Marie that you wear rubber heels on your shoes he observed solicitously Even Cyril laughed at this though all he said was Come come I got you up here to look at the rug Bertram however was not to be silenced And another thing Miss Marie he resumed with the air of a true and tried adviser Just let me give you a pointer I ve lived with your future husband a good many years and I know what I m talking about Bertram be still growled Cyril Bertram refused to be still Whenever you want to know anything about Cyril listen to his playing For instance if after dinner you hear a dreamy waltz or a sleepy nocturne you may know that all is well But if on your ears there falls anything like a dirge or the wail of a lost spirit gone mad better look to your soup and see if it hasn t been scorched or taste of your pudding and see if you didn t put in salt instead of sugar Bertram will you be still cut in Cyril testily again After all judging from what Billy tells me resumed Bertram cheerfully what I ve said won t be so important to you for you aren t the kind that scorches soups or uses salt for sugar So maybe I d better put it to you this way if you want a new sealskin coat or an extra diamond tiara tackle him when he plays like this And with a swift turn Bertram dropped himself to the piano stool and dashed into a rollicking melody that half the newsboys of Boston were whistling What happened next was a surprise to every one Bertram very much as if he were a naughty little boy was jerked by a wrathful brother s hand off the piano stool The next moment the wrathful brother himself sat at the piano and there burst on five pairs of astonished ears a crashing dissonance which was but the prelude to music such as few of the party often heard Spellbound they listened while rippling runs and sonorous harmonies filled the room to overflowing as if under the fingers of the player there were not the keyboard of a piano but the violins flutes cornets trombones bass viols and kettledrums of a full orchestra Billy perhaps of them all best understood She knew that in those tripping melodies and crashing chords were Cyril s joy at the presence of Marie his wrath at the flippancy of Bertram his ecstasy at that for which the rug and curtains stood the little woman sewing in the radiant circle of a shaded lamp Billy knew that all this and more were finding voice at Cyril s finger tips The others too understood in a way but they unlike Billy were not in the habit of finding on a few score bits of wood and ivory a vent for their moods and fancies The music was softer now The resounding chords and purling runs had become a bell like melody that wound itself in and out of a maze of exquisite harmonies now hiding now coming out clear and unafraid like a mountain stream emerging into a sunlit meadow from the leafy shadows of its forest home In a breathless hush the melody quivered into silence It was Bertram who broke the pause with a long drawn By George Then a little unsteadily If it s I that set you going like that old chap I ll come up and play ragtime every day Cyril shrugged his shoulders and got to his feet If you ve seen all you want of the rug we ll go down stairs he said nonchalantly But we haven t chorussed several indignant voices And for the next few minutes not even the owner of the beautiful Kirman could find any fault with the quantity or the quality of the attention bestowed on his new possession But Billy under cover of the chatter said reproachfully in his ear Oh Cyril to think you can play like that and won t on demand I can t on demand shrugged Cyril again On the way down stairs they stopped at William s rooms I want you to see a couple of Batterseas I got last week cried the collector eagerly as he led the way to the black velvet square They re fine and I think she looks like you he finished turning to Billy and holding out one of the knobs on which was a beautifully executed miniature of a young girl with dark dreamy eyes Oh how pretty exclaimed Marie over Billy s shoulder But what are they The collector turned his face alight Mirror knobs I ve got lots of them Would you like to see them really They re right here The next minute Marie found herself looking into a cabinet where lay a score or more of round and oval discs of glass porcelain and metal framed in silver gilt and brass and mounted on long spikes Oh how pretty cried Marie again but how how queer Tell me about them please William drew a long breath His eyes glistened William loved to talk when he had a curio and a listener I will Our great grandmothers used them you know to support their mirrors or to fasten back their curtains he explained ardently Now here s another Battersea enamel but it isn t so good as my new ones that face is almost a caricature But what a beautiful ship on that round one exclaimed Marie And what s this one glass Yes but that s not so rare as the others Still it s pretty enough Did you notice this one with the bright red and blue and green on the white background regular Chinese mode of decoration that is Er any time William began Bertram mischievously but William did not seem to hear Now in this corner he went on warming to his subject are the enamelled porcelains They were probably made at the Worcester works England you know and I think many of them are quite as pretty as the Batterseas You see it was at Worcester that they invented that variation of the transfer printing process that they called bat printing where they used oil instead of ink and gelatine instead of paper Now engravings for that kind of printing were usually in stipple work dots you know so the prints on these knobs can easily be distinguished from those of the transfer printing See Now this one is Er of course William any time interposed Bertram again his eyes twinkling William stopped with a laugh Yes I know Tis time I talked of something else Bertram he conceded But twas lovely and I was interested really claimed Marie Besides there are such a lot of things here that I d like to see she finished turning slowly about These are what he was collecting last year murmured Billy hovering over a small cabinet where were some beautiful specimens of antique jewelry brooches necklaces armlets Rajah rings and anklets gorgeous in color and exquisite in workmanship Well here is something you will enjoy declared Bertram with an airy flourish Do you see those teapots Well we can have tea every day in the year and not use one of them but five times I ve counted There are exactly seventy three he concluded as he laughingly led the way from the room How about leap year quizzed Billy Ho Trust Will to find another Old Blue or a perfect treasure of a black basalt by that time shrugged Bertram Below William s rooms was the floor once Bertram s but afterwards given over to the use of Billy and Aunt Hannah The rooms were open to day and were bright with sunshine and roses but they were very plainly unoccupied And you don t use them yet remonstrated Billy as she paused at an open door No These are missus Bertram Henshaw s rooms said the youngest Henshaw brother in a voice that made Billy hurry away with a dimpling blush They were Billy s and they can never seem any one s but Billy s now declared William to Marie as they went down the stairs And now for the den and some good stories before the fire proposed Bertram as the six reached the first floor again But we haven t seen your pictures yet objected Billy Bertram made a deprecatory gesture There s nothing much he began but he stopped at once with an odd laugh Well I sha n t say that he finished flinging open the door of his studio and pressing a button that flooded the room with light The next moment as they stood before those plaques and panels and canvases on each of which was a pictured Billy they understood the change in his sentence and they laughed appreciatively Much indeed exclaimed William Oh how lovely breathed Marie My grief and conscience Bertram All these and of Billy I knew you had a good many but Aunt Hannah paused impotently her eyes going from Bertram s face to the pictures again But how when did you do them queried Marie Some of them from memory More of them from life A lot of them were just sketches that I did when she was here in the house four or five years ago answered Bertram like this for instance And he pulled into a better light a picture of a laughing dark eyed girl holding against her cheek a small gray kitten with alert bright eyes The original and only Spunk he announced What a dear little cat cried Marie You should have seen it in the flesh remarked Cyril dryly No paint nor painter could imprison that untamed bit of Satanic mischief on any canvas that ever grew Everybody laughed everybody but Billy Billy indeed of them all had been strangely silent ever since they entered the studio She stood now a little apart Her eyes were wide and a bit frightened Her fingers were twisting the corners of her handkerchief nervously She was looking to the right and to the left and everywhere she saw herself Sometimes it was her full face sometimes her profile sometimes there were only her eyes peeping from above a fan or peering from out brown shadows of nothingness Once it was merely the back of her head showing the mass of waving hair with its high lights of burnished bronze Again it was still the back of her head with below it the bare slender neck and the scarf draped shoulders In this picture the curve of a half turned cheek showed plainly and in the background was visible a hand holding four playing cards at which the pictured girl was evidently looking Sometimes it was a merry Billy with dancing eyes sometimes a demure Billy with long lashes caressing a flushed cheek Sometimes it was a wistful Billy with eyes that looked straight into yours with peculiar appeal But always it was Billy There I think the tilt of this chin is perfect It was Bertram speaking Billy gave a sudden cry Her face whitened She stumbled forward No no Bertram you you didn t mean the the tilt of the chin she faltered wildly The man turned in amazement Why Billy he stammered Billy what is it The girl fell back at once She tried to laugh lightly She had seen the dismayed questioning in her lover s eyes and in the eyes of William and the others N nothing she gesticulated hurriedly It was nothing at all truly But Billy it was something Bertram s eyes were still troubled Was it the picture I thought you liked this picture Billy laughed again this time more naturally Bertram I m ashamed of you expecting me to say I like any of this she scolded with a wave of her hands toward the omnipresent Billy Why I feel as if I were in a room with a thousand mirrors and that I d been discovered putting rouge on my cheeks and lampblack on my eyebrows William laughed fondly Aunt Hannah and Marie gave an indulgent smile Cyril actually chuckled Bertram only still wore a puzzled expression as he laid aside the canvas in his hands Billy examined intently a sketch she had found with its back to the wall It was not a pretty sketch it was not even a finished one and Billy did not in the least care what it was But her lips cried interestedly Oh Bertram what is this There was no answer Bertram was still engaged apparently in putting away some sketches Over by the doorway leading to the den Marie and Aunt Hannah followed by William and Cyril were just disappearing behind a huge easel In another minute the merry chatter of their voices came from the room beyond Bertram hurried then straight across the studio to the girl still bending over the sketch in the corner Bertram gasped Billy as a kiss brushed her cheek Pooh They re gone Besides what if they did see Billy what was the matter with the tilt of that chin Billy gave an hysterical little laugh at least Bertram tried to assure himself that it was a laugh though it had sounded almost like a sob Bertram if you say another word about about the tilt of that chin I shall scream she panted Why Billy With a nervous little movement Billy turned and began to reverse the canvases nearest her Come sir she commanded gayly Billy has been on exhibition quite long enough It is high time she was turned face to the wall to meditate and grow more modest Bertram did not answer Neither did he make a move to assist her His ardent gray eyes were following her slim graceful figure admiringly Billy it doesn t seem true yet that you re really mine he said at last in a low voice shaken with emotion Billy turned abruptly A peculiar radiance shone in her eyes and glorified her face As she stood she was close to a picture on an easel and full in the soft glow of the shaded lights above it Then you do want me she began just me not to she stopped short The man opposite had taken an eager step toward her On his face was the look she knew so well the look she had come almost to dread the painting look Billy stand just as you are he was saying Don t move Jove But that effect is perfect with those dark shadows beyond and just your hair and face and throat showing I declare I ve half a mind to sketch But Billy with a little cry was gone CHAPTER X A JOB FOR PETE AND FOR BERTRAM The early days in December were busy ones certainly in the little house on Corey Hill Marie was to be married the twelfth It was to be a home wedding and a very simple one according to Billy and according to what Marie had said it was to be Billy still serenely spoke of it as a simple affair but Marie was beginning to be fearful As the days passed bringing with them more and more frequent evidences either tangible or intangible of orders to stationers caterers and florists her fears found voice in a protest But Billy it was to be a simple wedding she cried And so it is But what is this I hear about a breakfast Billy s chin assumed its most stubborn squareness I don t know I m sure what you did hear she retorted calmly Billy Billy laughed The chin was just as stubborn but the smiling lips above it graced it with an air of charming concession There there dear coaxed the mistress of Hillside don t fret Besides I m sure I should think you of all people would want your guests fed But this is so elaborate from what I hear Nonsense Not a bit of it Rosa says there ll be salads and cakes and ices and I don t know what all Billy looked concerned Well of course Marie if you d rather have oatmeal and doughnuts she began with kind solicitude but she got no farther Billy besought the bride elect Won t you be serious And there s the cake in wedding boxes too I know but boxes are so much easier and cleaner than just fingers apologized an anxiously serious voice Marie answered with an indignant grieved glance and hurried on And the flowers roses dozens of them in December Billy I can t let you do all this for me Nonsense dear laughed Billy Why I love to do it Besides when you re gone just think how lonesome I ll be I shall have to adopt somebody else then now that Mary Jane has proved to be nothing but a disappointing man instead of a nice little girl like you she finished whimsically Marie did not smile The frown still lay between her delicate brows And for my trousseau there were so many things that you simply would buy I didn t get one of the egg beaters Billy reminded her anxiously Marie smiled now but she shook her head too Billy I cannot have you do all this for me Why not At the unexpectedly direct question Marie fell back a little Why because I I can t she stammered I can t get them for myself and and Don t you love me A pink flush stole to Marie s face Indeed I do dearly Don t I love you The flush deepened I I hope so Then why won t you let me do what I want to and be happy in it Money just money isn t any good unless you can exchange it for something you want And just now I want pink roses and ice cream and lace flounces for you Marie Billy s voice trembled a little I never had a sister till I had you and I have had such a good time buying things that I thought you wanted But of course if you don t want them The words ended in a choking sob and down went Billy s head into her folded arms on the desk before her Marie sprang to her feet and cuddled the bowed head in a loving embrace But I do want them dear I want them all every single one she urged Now promise me promise me that you ll do them all just as you d planned You will won t you There was the briefest of hesitations then came the muffled reply Yes if you really want them I do dear indeed I do I love pretty weddings and I I always hoped that I could have one if I ever married So you must know dear how I really do want all those things declared Marie fervently And now I must go I promised to meet Cyril at Park Street at three o clock And she hurried from the room and not until she was half way to her destination did it suddenly occur to her that she had been urging actually urging Miss Billy Neilson to buy for her pink roses ice cream and lace flounces Her cheeks burned with shame then But almost at once she smiled Now wasn t that just like Billy she was saying to herself with a tender glow in her eyes It was early in December that Pete came one day with a package for Marie from Cyril Marie was not at home and Billy herself went downstairs to take the package from the old man s hands mister Cyril said to give it to Miss Hawthorn stammered the old servant his face lighting up as Billy entered the room but I m sure he wouldn t mind your taking it I m afraid I ll have to take it Pete unless you want to carry it back with you she smiled I ll see that Miss Hawthorn has it the very first moment she comes in Thank you Miss It does my old eyes good to see your bright face He hesitated then turned slowly Good day Miss Billy Billy laid the package on the table Her eyes were thoughtful as she looked after the old man who was now almost to the door Something in his bowed form appealed to her strangely She took a quick step toward him You ll miss mister Cyril Pete she said pleasantly The old man stopped at once and turned He lifted his head a little proudly Yes Miss I I was there when he was born mister Cyril s a fine man Indeed he is Perhaps it s your good care that s helped some to make him so smiled the girl vaguely wishing that she could say something that would drive the wistful look from the dim old eyes before her For a moment Billy thought she had succeeded The old servant drew himself stiffly erect In his eyes shone the loyal pride of more than fifty years honest service Almost at once however the pride died away and the wistfulness returned Thank ye Miss but I don t lay no claim to that of course he said mister Cyril s a fine man and we shall miss him but I cal late changes must come to all of us Billy s brown eyes grew a little misty I suppose they must she admitted The old man hesitated then as if impelled by some hidden force he plunged on Yes and they ll be comin to you one of these days Miss and that s what I was wantin to speak to ye about I understand of course that when you get there you ll be wantin younger blood to serve ye My feet ain t so spry as they once was and my old hands blunder sometimes in spite of what my head bids em do So I wanted to tell ye that of course I shouldn t expect to stay I d go As he said the words Pete stood with head and shoulders erect his eyes looking straight forward but not at Billy Don t you want to stay The girlish voice was a little reproachful Pete s head drooped Not if I m not wanted came the husky reply With an impulsive movement Billy came straight to the old man s side and held out her hand Pete Amazement incredulity and a look that was almost terror crossed the old man s face then a flood of dull red blotted them all out and left only worshipful rapture With a choking cry he took the slim little hand in both his rough and twisted ones much as if he were possessing himself of a treasured bit of eggshell china Miss Billy Pete there aren t a pair of feet in Boston nor a pair of hands either that I d rather have serve me than yours no matter if they stumble and blunder all day I shall love stumbles and blunders if you make them Now run home and don t ever let me hear another syllable about your leaving They were not the words Billy had intended to say She had meant to speak of his long faithful service and of how much they appreciated it but to her surprise Billy found her own eyes wet and her own voice trembling and the words that she would have said she found fast shut in her throat So there was nothing to do but to stammer out something anything that would help to keep her from yielding to that absurd and awful desire to fall on the old servant s neck and cry Not another syllable she repeated sternly Miss Billy choked Pete again Then he turned and fled with anything but his usual dignity Bertram called that evening When Billy came to him in the living room her slender self was almost hidden behind the swirls of damask linen in her arms Bertram s eyes grew mutinous Do you expect me to hug all that he demanded Billy flashed him a mischievous glance Of course not You don t have to hug anything you know For answer he impetuously swept the offending linen into the nearest chair and drew the girl into his arms Oh And see how you ve crushed poor Marie s table cloth she cried with reproachful eyes Bertram sniffed imperturbably I m not sure but I d like to crush Marie he alleged Bertram I can t help it See here Billy He loosened his clasp and held the girl off at arm s length regarding her with stormy eyes It s Marie Marie Marie always If I telephone in the morning you ve gone shopping with Marie If I want you in the afternoon for something you re at the dressmaker s with Marie If I call in the evening I m here interrupted Billy with decision Oh yes you re here admitted Bertram aggrievedly and so are dozens of napkins miles of table cloths and yards upon yards of lace and flummydiddles you call doilies They all belong to Marie and they fill your arms and your thoughts full until there isn t an inch of room for me Billy when is this thing going to end Billy laughed softly Her eyes danced The twelfth that is there ll be a pause then Well I m thankful if eh broke off the man with a sudden change of manner What do you mean by a pause Billy cast down her eyes demurely Well of course this ends the twelfth with Marie s wedding but I ve sort of regarded it as an understudy for one that s coming next October you see Billy you darling breathed a supremely happy voice in a shell like ear Billy was not at arm s length now Billy smiled but she drew away with gentle firmness And now I must go back to my sewing she said Bertram s arms did not loosen His eyes had grown mutinous again That is she amended I must be practising my part of the understudy you know You darling breathed Bertram again this time however he let her go But honestly is it all necessary he sighed despairingly as she seated herself and gathered the table cloth into her lap Do you have to do so much of it all I do smiled Billy unless you want your brother to run the risk of leading his bride to the altar and finding her robed in a kitchen apron with an egg beater in her hand for a bouquet Bertram laughed Is it so bad as that No of course not quite But never have I seen a bride so utterly oblivious to clothes as Marie was till one day in despair I told her that Cyril never could bear a dowdy woman As if Cyril in the old days ever could bear any sort of woman scoffed Bertram merrily I know but I didn t mention that part smiled Billy I just singled out the dowdy one Did it work Billy made a gesture of despair Did it work It worked too well Marie gave me one horrified look then at once and immediately she became possessed with the idea that she was a dowdy woman And from that day to this she has pursued every lurking wrinkle and every fold awry until her dressmaker s life isn t worth the living and I m beginning to think mine isn t either for I have to assure her at least four times every day now that she is not a dowdy woman You poor dear laughed Bertram No wonder you don t have time to give to me A peculiar expression crossed Billy s face Oh but I m not the only one who at times is otherwise engaged sir she reminded him What do you mean There was yesterday and last Monday and last week Wednesday and Oh but you let me off then argued Bertram anxiously And you said That I didn t wish to interfere with your work which was quite true interrupted Billy in her turn smoothly By the way Billy was examining her stitches very closely now how is Miss Winthrop s portrait coming on Splendidly that is it was until she began to put off the sittings for her pink teas and folderols She s going to Washington next week too to be gone nearly a fortnight finished Bertram gloomily Aren t you putting more work than usual into this one and more sittings Well yes laughed Bertram a little shortly You see she s changed the pose twice already Changed it Yes Wasn t satisfied Fancied she wanted it different But can t you don t you have something to say about it Oh yes of course and she claims she ll yield to my judgment anyhow But what s the use She s been a spoiled darling all her life and in the habit of having her own way about everything Naturally under those circumstances I can t expect to get a satisfactory portrait if she s out of tune with the pose Besides I will own so far her suggestions have made for improvement probably because she s been happy in making them so her expression has been good Billy wet her lips I saw her the other night she said lightly If the lightness was a little artificial Bertram did not seem to notice it She is certainly very beautiful Yes Bertram got to his feet and began to walk up and down the little room His eyes were alight On his face the painting look was king It s going to mean a lot to me this picture Billy In the first place I m just at the point in my career where a big success would mean a lot and where a big failure would mean more And this portrait is bound to be one or the other from the very nature of the thing I is it Billy s voice was a little faint Yes First because of who the sitter is and secondly because of what she is She is of course the most famous subject I ve had and half the artistic world knows by this time that Marguerite Winthrop is being done by Henshaw You can see what it ll be if I fail But you won t fail Bertram The artist lifted his chin and threw back his shoulders No of course not but He hesitated frowned and dropped himself into a chair His eyes studied the fire moodily You see he resumed after a moment there s a peculiar elusive something about her expression Billy stirred restlessly and gave her thread so savage a jerk that it broke a something that isn t easily caught by the brush Anderson and Fullam big fellows both of them didn t catch it At least I ve understood that neither her family nor her friends are satisfied with their portraits And to succeed where Anderson and Fullam failed Jove Billy a chance like that doesn t come to a fellow twice in a lifetime Bertram was out of his chair again tramping up and down the little room Billy tossed her work aside and sprang to her feet Her eyes too were alight now But you aren t going to fail dear she cried holding out both her hands You re going to succeed Bertram caught the hands and kissed first one then the other of their soft little palms Of course I am he agreed passionately leading her to the sofa and seating himself at her side Yes but you must really feel it she urged feel the sure in yourself You have to to doing things That s what I told Mary Jane yesterday when he was running on about what he wanted to do in his singing you know Bertram stiffened a little A quick frown came to his face Mary Jane indeed Of all the absurd names to give a full grown six foot man Billy do for pity s sake call him by his name if he s got one Billy broke into a rippling laugh I wish I could dear she sighed ingenuously Honestly it bothers me because I can t think of him as anything but Mary Jane It seems so silly It certainly does when one remembers his beard Oh he s shaved that off now He looks rather better too Bertram turned a little sharply Do you see the fellow often Billy laughed merrily No He s about as disgruntled as you are over the way the wedding monopolizes everything He s been up once or twice to see Aunt Hannah and to get acquainted as he expresses it and once he brought up some music and we sang but he declares the wedding hasn t given him half a show Indeed Well that s a pity I m sure rejoined Bertram icily Billy turned in slight surprise Why Bertram don t you like Mary Jane Billy for heaven s sake Hasn t he got any name but that Billy clapped her hands together suddenly There that makes me think He told Aunt Hannah and me to guess what his name was and we never hit it once What do you think it is The initials are M J I couldn t say I m sure What is it Oh he didn t tell us You see he left us to guess it Did he Yes mused Billy abstractedly her eyes on the dancing fire The next minute she stirred and settled herself more comfortably in the curve of her lover s arm But there who cares what his name is I m sure I don t Nor I echoed Bertram in a voice that he tried to make not too fervent He had not forgotten Billy s surprised Why Bertram don t you like Mary Jane and he did not like to call forth a repetition of it Abruptly therefore he changed the subject By the way what did you do to Pete to day he asked laughingly He came home in a seventh heaven of happiness babbling of what an angel straight from the sky Miss Billy was Naturally I agreed with him on that point But what did you do to him Billy smiled Nothing only engaged him for our butler for life Oh I see That was dear of you Billy As if I d do anything else And now for Dong Ling I suppose some day Bertram chuckled Well maybe I can help you there he hinted You see his Celestial Majesty came to me himself the other day and said after sundry and various preliminaries that he should be velly much glad when the Little Missee came to live with me for then he could go back to China with a heart at rest as he had money velly much plenty and didn t wish to be Melican man any longer Dear me smiled Billy what a happy state of affairs for him But for you do you realize young man what that means for you A new wife and a new cook all at once And you know I m not Marie Ho I m not worrying retorted Bertram with a contented smile besides as perhaps you noticed it wasn t Marie that I asked to marry me CHAPTER XI A CLOCK AND AUNT HANNAH missus Kate Hartwell the Henshaw brothers sister from the West was expected on the tenth Her husband could not come she had written but she would bring with her little Kate the youngest child The boys Paul and Egbert would stay with their father Billy received the news of little Kate s coming with outspoken delight The very thing she cried We ll have her for a flower girl She was a dear little creature as I remember her Aunt Hannah gave a sudden low laugh Yes I remember she observed Kate told me after you spent the first day with her that you graciously informed her that little Kate was almost as nice as Spunk Kate did not fully appreciate the compliment I fear Billy made a wry face Did I say that Dear me I was a terror in those days wasn t I But then and she laughed softly really Aunt Hannah that was the prettiest thing I knew how to say for I considered Spunk the top notch of desirability I think I should have liked to know Spunk smiled Marie from the other side of the sewing table He was a dear declared Billy I had another most as good when I first came to Hillside but he got lost For a time it seemed as if I never wanted another but I ve about come to the conclusion now that I do and I ve told Bertram to find one for me if he can You see I shall be lonesome after you re gone Marie and I ll have to have something she finished mischievously Oh I don t mind the inference as long as I know your admiration of cats laughed Marie Let me see Kate writes she is coming the tenth murmured Aunt Hannah going back to the letter in her hand Good nodded Billy That will give time to put little Kate through her paces as flower girl Yes and it will give Big Kate time to try to make your breakfast a supper and your roses pinks or sunflowers cut in a new voice dryly Cyril chorussed the three ladies in horror adoration and amusement according to whether the voice belonged to Aunt Hannah Marie or Billy Cyril shrugged his shoulders and smiled I beg your pardon he apologized but Rosa said you were in here sewing and I told her not to bother I d announce myself Just as I got to the door I chanced to hear Billy s speech and I couldn t resist making the amendment Maybe you ve forgotten Kate s love of managing but I haven t he finished as he sauntered over to the chair nearest Marie No I haven t forgotten observed Billy meaningly Nor I nor anybody else declared a severe voice both the words and the severity being most extraordinary as coming from the usually gentle Aunt Hannah Oh well never mind spoke up Billy quickly Everything s all right now so let s forget it She always meant it for kindness I m sure Even when she told you in the first place what a er torment you were to us quizzed Cyril Yes flashed Billy She was being kind to you then Humph vouchsafed Cyril For a moment no one spoke Cyril s eyes were on Marie who was nervously trying to smooth back a few fluffy wisps of hair that had escaped from restraining combs and pins What s the matter with the hair little girl asked Cyril in a voice that was caressingly irritable You ve been fussing with that long suffering curl for the last five minutes Marie s delicate face flushed painfully It s got loose my hair she stammered and it looks so dowdy that way Billy dropped her thread suddenly She sprang for it at once before Cyril could make a move to get it She had to dive far under a chair to capture it which may explain why her face was so very red when she finally reached her seat again On the morning of the tenth Billy Marie and Aunt Hannah were once more sewing together this time in the little sitting room at the end of the hall up stairs Billy s fingers in particular were flying very fast I told John to have Peggy at the door at eleven she said after a time but I think I can finish running in this ribbon before then I haven t much to do to get ready to go I hope Kate s train won t be late worried Aunt Hannah I hope not replied Billy but I told Rosa to delay luncheon anyway till we get here I She stopped abruptly and turned a listening ear toward the door of Aunt Hannah s room which was open A clock was striking Mercy that can t be eleven now she cried But it must be it was ten before I came up stairs She got to her feet hurriedly Aunt Hannah put out a restraining hand No no dear that s half past ten But it struck eleven Yes I know It does at half past ten Why the little wretch laughed Billy dropping back into her chair and picking up her work again The idea of its telling fibs like that and frightening people half out of their lives I ll have it fixed right away Maybe John can do it he s always so handy about such things But I don t want it fixed demurred Aunt Hannah Billy stared a little You don t want it fixed Maybe you like to have it strike eleven when it s half past ten Billy s voice was merrily sarcastic Y yes I do stammered the lady apologetically You see I I worked very hard to fix it so it would strike that way Aunt Hannah Well I did retorted the lady with unexpected spirit I wanted to know what time it was in the night I m awake such a lot But I don t see Billy s eyes were perplexed Why must you make it tell fibs in order to to find out the truth she laughed Aunt Hannah elevated her chin a little Because that clock was always striking one One Yes half past you know and I never knew which half past it was But it must strike half past now just the same It does There was the triumphant ring of the conqueror in Aunt Hannah s voice But now it strikes half past on the hour and the clock in the hall tells me then what time it is so I don t care For one more brief minute Billy stared before a sudden light of understanding illumined her face Then her laugh rang out gleefully Oh Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah she gurgled If Bertram wouldn t call you the limit making a clock strike eleven so you ll know it s half past ten Aunt Hannah colored a little but she stood her ground Well there s only half an hour anyway now that I don t know what time it is she maintained for one or the other of those clocks strikes the hour every thirty minutes Even during those never ending three ones that strike one after the other in the middle of the night I can tell now for the hall clock has a different sound for the half hours you know so I can tell whether it s one or a half past Of course chuckled Billy I m sure I think it s a splendid idea chimed in Marie valiantly and I m going to write it to mother s Cousin Jane right away She s an invalid and she s always lying awake nights wondering what time it is The doctor says actually he believes she d get well if he could find some way of letting her know the time at night so she d get some sleep for she simply can t go to sleep till she knows She can t bear a light in the room and it wakes her all up to turn an electric switch or anything of that kind Why doesn t she have one of those phosphorous things questioned Billy Marie laughed quietly She did I sent her one and she stood it just one night Stood it Yes She declared it gave her the creeps and that she wouldn t have the spooky thing staring at her all night like that So it s got to be something she can hear and I m going to tell her missus Stetson s plan right away Well I m sure I wish you would cried that lady with prompt interest and she ll like it I m sure And tell her if she can hear a town clock strike it s just the same and even better for there aren t any half hours at all to think of there I will and I think it s lovely declared Marie Of course it s lovely smiled Billy rising but I fancy I d better go and get ready to meet missus Hartwell or the lovely thing will be telling me that it s half past eleven And she tripped laughingly from the room Promptly at the appointed time John with Peggy drew up before the door and Billy muffled in furs stepped into the car which with its protecting top and sides and glass wind shield was in its winter dress Yes m tis a little chilly Miss said John in answer to her greeting as he tucked the heavy robes about her Oh well I shall be very comfortable I m sure smiled Billy Just don t drive too rapidly specially coming home I shall have to get a limousine I think when my ship comes in John John s grizzled old face twitched So evident were the words that were not spoken that Billy asked laughingly Well John what is it John reddened furiously Nothing Miss I was only thinkin that if you didn t tend ter haulin in so many other folks s ships yours might get in sooner Why John Nonsense I I love to haul in other folks s ships laughed the girl embarrassedly Yes Miss I know you do grunted John Billy colored No no that is I mean I don t do it very much she stammered John did not answer apparently but Billy was sure she caught a low muttered indignant much as he snapped the door shut and took his place at the wheel To herself she laughed softly She thought she possessed the secret now of some of John s disapproving glances toward her humble guests of the summer before CHAPTER XII SISTER KATE At the station missus Hartwell s train was found to be gratifyingly on time and in due course Billy was extending a cordial welcome to a tall handsome woman who carried herself with an unmistakable air of assured competence Accompanying her was a little girl with big blue eyes and yellow curls I am very glad to see you both smiled Billy holding out a friendly hand to missus Hartwell and stooping to kiss the round cheek of the little girl Thank you you are very kind murmured the lady but are you alone Billy Where are the boys Uncle William is out of town and Cyril is rushed to death and sent his excuses Bertram did mean to come but he telephoned this morning that he couldn t after all I m sorry but I m afraid you ll have to make the best of just me condoled Billy They ll be out to the house this evening of course all but Uncle William He doesn t return until to morrow Oh doesn t he murmured the lady reaching for her daughter s hand Billy looked down with a smile And this is little Kate I suppose she said whom I haven t seen for such a long long time Let me see you are how old now I m eight I ve been eight six weeks Billy s eyes twinkled And you don t remember me I suppose The little girl shook her head No but I know who you are she added with shy eagerness You re going to be my Aunt Billy and you re going to marry my Uncle William I mean my Uncle Bertram Billy s face changed color missus Hartwell gave a despairing gesture Kate my dear I told you to be sure and remember that it was your Uncle Bertram now You see she added in a discouraged aside to Billy she can t seem to forget the first one But then what can you expect laughed missus Hartwell a little disagreeably Such abrupt changes from one brother to another are somewhat disconcerting you know Billy bit her lip For a moment she said nothing then a little constrainedly she rejoined Perhaps Still let us hope we have the right one now missus Hartwell raised her eyebrows Well my dear I m not so confident of that My choice has been and always will be William Billy bit her lip again This time her brown eyes flashed a little Is that so But you see after all you aren t making the the choice Billy spoke lightly gayly and she ended with a bright little laugh as if to hide any intended impertinence It was missus Hartwell s turn to bite her lip and she did it So it seems she rejoined frigidly after the briefest of pauses It was not until they were on their way to Corey Hill some time later that missus Hartwell turned with the question Cyril is to be married in church I suppose No They both preferred a home wedding Oh what a pity Church weddings are so attractive To those who like them amended Billy in spite of herself To every one I think corrected missus Hartwell positively Billy laughed She was beginning to discern that it did not do much harm nor much good to disagree with her guest It s in the evening then of course pursued missus Hartwell No at noon Oh how could you let them But they preferred it missus Hartwell What if they did retorted the lady sharply Can t you do as you please in your own home Evening weddings are so much prettier We can t change now of course with the guests all invited That is I suppose you do have guests missus Hartwell s voice was aggrievedly despairing Oh yes smiled Billy demurely We have guests invited and I m afraid we can t change the time No of course not but it s too bad I conclude there are announcements only as I got no cards Announcements only bowed Billy I wish Cyril had consulted me a little about this affair Billy did not answer She could not trust herself to speak just then Cyril s words of two days before were in her ears Yes and it will give Big Kate time to try to make your breakfast supper and your roses pinks or sunflowers In a moment missus Hartwell spoke again Of course a noon wedding is quite pretty if you darken the rooms and have lights you re going to do that I suppose Billy shook her head slowly I m afraid not missus Hartwell That isn t the plan now Not darken the rooms exclaimed missus Hartwell Why it won t She stopped suddenly and fell back in her seat The look of annoyed disappointment gave way to one of confident relief But then that can be changed she finished serenely Billy opened her lips but she shut them without speaking After a minute she opened them again You might consult Cyril about that she said in a quiet voice Yes I will nodded missus Hartwell brightly She was looking pleased and happy again I love weddings Don t you You can do so much with them Can you laughed Billy irrepressibly Yes Cyril is happy of course Still I can t imagine him in love with any woman I think Marie can I suppose so I don t seem to remember her much still I think I saw her once or twice when I was on last June Music teacher wasn t she Yes She is a very sweet girl Hm m I suppose so Still I think twould have been better if Cyril could have selected some one that wasn t musical say a more domestic wife He s so terribly unpractical himself about household matters Billy gave a ringing laugh and stood up The car had come to a stop before her own door Do you Just you wait till you see Marie s trousseau of egg beaters and cake tins she chuckled missus Hartwell looked blank Whatever in the world do you mean Billy she demanded fretfully as she followed her hostess from the car I declare aren t you ever going to grow beyond making those absurd remarks of yours Maybe sometime laughed Billy as she took little Kate s hand and led the way up the steps Luncheon in the cozy dining room at Hillside that day was not entirely a success At least there were not present exactly the harmony and tranquillity that are conceded to be the best sauce for one s food The wedding of course was the all absorbing topic of conversation and Billy between Aunt Hannah s attempts to be polite Marie s to be sweet tempered missus Hartwell s to be dictatorial and her own to be pacifying as well as firm had a hard time of it If it had not been for two or three diversions created by little Kate the meal would have been indeed a dismal failure But little Kate most of the time the personification of proper little girlhood had a disconcerting faculty of occasionally dropping a word here or a question there with startling effect As for instance when she asked Billy Who s going to boss your wedding and again when she calmly informed her mother that when she was married she was not going to have any wedding at all to bother with anyhow She was going to elope and she should choose somebody s chauffeur because he d know how to go the farthest and fastest so her mother couldn t catch up with her and tell her how she ought to have done it After luncheon Aunt Hannah went up stairs for rest and recuperation Marie took little Kate and went for a brisk walk for the same purpose This left Billy alone with her guest Perhaps you would like a nap too missus Hartwell suggested Billy as they passed into the living room There was a curious note of almost hopefulness in her voice missus Hartwell scorned naps and she said so very emphatically She said something else too Billy why do you always call me missus Hartwell in that stiff formal fashion You used to call me Aunt Kate But I was very young then Billy s voice was troubled Billy had been trying so hard for the last two hours to be the graciously cordial hostess to this woman Bertram s sister Very true Then why not Kate now Billy hesitated She was wondering why it seemed so hard to call missus Hartwell Kate Of course resumed the lady when you re Bertram s wife and my sister Why of course cried Billy in a sudden flood of understanding Curiously enough she had never before thought of missus Hartwell as her sister I shall be glad to call you Kate if you like Thank you I shall like it very much Billy nodded the other cordially Indeed my dear I m very fond of you and I was delighted to hear you were to be my sister If only it could have stayed William instead of Bertram But it couldn t smiled Billy It wasn t William that I loved But Bertram it s so absurd Absurd The smile was gone now Yes Forgive me Billy but I was about as much surprised to hear of Bertram s engagement as I was of Cyril s Billy grew a little white But Bertram was never an avowed woman hater like Cyril was he Woman hater dear me no He was a woman lover always As if his eternal Face of a Girl didn t prove that Bertram has always loved women to paint But as for his ever taking them seriously why Billy what s the matter Billy had risen suddenly If you ll excuse me please just a few minutes Billy said very quietly I want to speak to Rosa in the kitchen I ll be back soon In the kitchen Billy spoke to Rosa she wondered afterwards what she said Certainly she did not stay in the kitchen long enough to say much In her own room a minute later with the door fast closed she took from her table the photograph of Bertram and held it in her two hands talking to it softly but a little wildly I didn t listen I didn t stay Do you hear I came to you She shall not say anything that will make trouble between you and me I ve suffered enough through her already And she doesn t know she didn t know before and she doesn t now She s only imagining I will not not not believe that you love me just to paint No matter what they say all of them I will not Billy put the photograph back on the table then and went down stairs to her guest She smiled brightly though her face was a little pale I wondered if perhaps you wouldn t like some music she said pleasantly going straight to the piano Indeed I would agreed missus Hartwell Billy sat down then and played played as missus Hartwell had never heard her play before Why Billy you amaze me she cried when the pianist stopped and whirled about I had no idea you could play like that Billy smiled enigmatically Billy was thinking that missus Hartwell would indeed have been surprised if she had known that in that playing were herself the ride home the luncheon Bertram and the girl whom Bertram did not love only to paint CHAPTER XIII CYRIL AND A WEDDING The twelfth was a beautiful day Clear frosty air set the blood to tingling and the eyes to sparkling even if it were not your wedding day while if it were It was Marie Hawthorn s wedding day and certainly her eyes sparkled and her blood tingled as she threw open the window of her room and breathed long and deep of the fresh morning air before going down to breakfast They say Happy is the bride that the sun shines on she whispered softly to an English sparrow that cocked his eye at her from a neighboring tree branch As if a bride wouldn t be happy sun or no sun she scoffed tenderly as she turned to go down stairs As it happens however tingling blood and sparkling eyes are a matter of more than weather or even weddings as was proved a little later when the telephone bell rang Kate answered the ring Hullo is that you Kate called a despairing voice Yes Good morning Bertram Isn t this a fine day for the wedding Fine Oh yes I suppose so though I must confess I haven t noticed it and you wouldn t if you had a lunatic on your hands A lunatic Yes Maybe you have though Is Marie rampaging around the house like a wild creature and asking ten questions and making twenty threats to the minute Certainly not Don t be absurd Bertram What do you mean See here Kate that show comes off at twelve sharp doesn t it Show indeed retorted Kate indignantly The wedding is at noon sharp as the best man should know very well All right then tell Billy please to see that it is sharp or I won t answer for the consequences What do you mean What is the matter Cyril He s broken loose at last I ve been expecting it all along I ve simply marvelled at the meekness with which he has submitted himself to be tied up with white ribbons and topped with roses Nonsense Bertram Well it amounts to that Anyhow he thinks it does and he s wild I wish you could have heard the thunderous performance on his piano with which he woke me up this morning Billy says he plays everything his past present and future All is if he was playing his future this morning I pity the girl who s got to live it with him Bertram Bertram chuckled remorselessly Well I do But I ll warrant he wasn t playing his future this morning He was playing his present the wedding You see he s just waked up to the fact that it ll be a perfect orgy of women and other confusion and he doesn t like it All the samee I ve had to assure him just fourteen times this morning that the ring the license the carriage the minister s fee and my sanity are all O K When he isn t asking questions he s making threats to snake the parson up there an hour ahead of time and be off with Marie before a soul comes What an absurd idea Cyril doesn t think so Indeed Kate I ve had a hard struggle to convince him that the guests wouldn t think it the most delightful experience of their lives if they should come and find the ceremony over with and the bride gone Well you remind Cyril please that there are other people besides himself concerned in this wedding observed Kate icily I have purred Bertram and he says all right let them have it then He s gone now to look up proxy marriages I believe Proxy marriages indeed Come come Bertram I ve got something to do this morning besides to stand here listening to your nonsense See that you and Cyril get here on time that s all And she hung up the receiver with an impatient jerk She turned to confront the startled eyes of the bride elect What is it Is anything wrong with Cyril faltered Marie Kate laughed and raised her eyebrows slightly Nothing but a little stage fright my dear Stage fright Yes Bertram says he s trying to find some one to play his role I believe in the ceremony Mrs Hartwell At the look of dismayed terror that came into Marie s face missus Hartwell laughed reassuringly There there dear child don t look so horror stricken There probably never was a man yet who wouldn t have fled from the wedding part of his marriage if he could and you know how Cyril hates fuss and feathers The wonder to me is that he s stood it as long as he has I thought I saw it coming last night at the rehearsal and now I know I did Marie still looked distressed But he never said I thought She stopped helplessly Of course he didn t child He never said anything but that he loved you and he never thought anything but that you were going to be his Men never do till the wedding day Then they never think of anything but a place to run she finished laughingly as she began to arrange on a stand the quantity of little white boxes waiting for her But if he d told me in time I wouldn t have had a thing but the minister faltered Marie And when you think so much of a pretty wedding too Nonsense It isn t good for a man to give up to his whims like that Marie s cheeks grew a deeper pink Her nostrils dilated a little It wouldn t be a whim missus Hartwell and I should be glad to give up she said with decision missus Hartwell laughed again her amused eyes on Marie s face Dear me child don t you know that if men had their way they d well if men married men there d never be such a thing in the world as a shower bouquet or a piece of wedding cake There was no reply A little precipitately Marie turned and hurried away A moment later she was laying a restraining hand on Billy who was filling tall vases with superb long stemmed roses in the kitchen Billy please she panted couldn t we do without those Couldn t we send them to some some hospital and the wedding cake too and The wedding cake to some hospital No of course not to the hospital It would make them sick to eat it wouldn t it That there was no shadow of a smile on Marie s face showed how desperate indeed was her state of mind I only meant that I didn t want them myself nor the shower bouquet nor the rooms darkened nor little Kate as the flower girl and would you mind very much if I asked you not to be my maid of honor Marie Marie covered her face with her hands then and began to sob brokenly so there was nothing for Billy to do but to take her into her arms with soothing little murmurs and pettings By degrees then the whole story came out Billy almost laughed but she almost cried too Then she said Dearie I don t believe Cyril feels or acts half so bad as Bertram and Kate make out and anyhow if he did it s too late now to to send the wedding cake to the hospital or make any other of the little changes you suggest Billy s lips puckered into a half smile but her eyes were grave Besides there are your music pupils trimming the living room this minute with evergreen there s little Kate making her flower girl wreath and missus Hartwell stacking cake boxes in the hall to say nothing of Rosa gloating over the best china in the dining room and Aunt Hannah putting purple bows into the new lace cap she s counting on wearing Only think how disappointed they d all be if I should say Never mind stop that Marie s just going to have a minister No fuss no feathers Why dearie even the roses are hanging their heads for grief she went on mistily lifting with gentle fingers one of the full petalled pink beauties near her Besides there s your guests Oh of course I knew I couldn t really sighed Marie as she turned to go up stairs all the light and joy gone from her face Billy once assured that Marie was out of hearing ran to the telephone Bertram answered Bertram tell Cyril I want to speak to him please All right dear but go easy Better strike up your tuning fork to find his pitch to day You ll discover it s a high one all right A moment later Cyril s tersely nervous Good morning Billy came across the line Billy drew in her breath and cast a hurriedly apprehensive glance over her shoulder to make sure Marie was not near Cyril she called in a low voice if you care a shred for Marie for heaven s sake call her up and tell her that you dote on pink roses and pink ribbons and pink breakfasts and pink wedding cake But I don t Oh yes you do to day You would if you could see Marie now What do you mean Nothing only she overheard part of Bertram s nonsensical talk with Kate a little while ago and she s ready to cast the last ravelling of white satin and conventionality behind her and go with you to the justice of the peace Sensible girl Yes but she can t you know with fifty guests coming to the wedding and twice as many more to the reception Honestly Cyril she s broken hearted You must do something She s coming And the receiver clicked sharply into place Five minutes later Marie was called to the telephone Dejectedly wistful eyed she went Just what were the words that hummed across the wire into the pink little ear of the bride to be Billy never knew but a Marie that was anything but wistful eyed and dejected left the telephone a little later and was heard very soon in the room above trilling merry snatches of a little song Contentedly then Billy went back to her roses It was a pretty wedding a very pretty wedding Every one said that The pink and green of the decorations the soft lights Kate had had her way about darkening the rooms the pretty frocks and smiling faces of the guests all helped Then there were the dainty flower girl little Kate the charming maid of honor Billy the stalwart handsome best man Bertram to say nothing of the delicately beautiful bride who looked like some fairy visitor from another world in the floating shimmer of her gossamer silk and tulle There was too not quite unnoticed the bridegroom tall of distinguished bearing and with features that were clear cut and to day rather pale Then came the reception the women and confusion of Cyril s fears followed by the going away of the bride and groom with its merry warfare of confetti and old shoes At four o clock however with only William and Bertram remaining for guests something like quiet descended at last on the little house Well it s over sighed Billy dropping exhaustedly into a big chair in the living room And well over supplemented Aunt Hannah covering her white shawl with a warmer blue one Yes I think it was nodded Kate It was really a very pretty wedding With your help Kate eh teased William Well I flatter myself I did do some good bridled Kate as she turned to help little Kate take the flower wreath from her head Even if you did hurry into my room and scare me into conniption fits telling me I d be late laughed Billy Kate tossed her head Well how was I to know that Aunt Hannah s clock only meant half past eleven when it struck twelve she retorted Everybody laughed Oh well it was a pretty wedding declared William with a long sigh It ll do for an understudy said Bertram softly for Billy s ears alone Only the added color and the swift glance showed that Billy heard for when she spoke she said And didn t Cyril behave beautifully Most every time I looked at him he was talking to some woman Oh no he wasn t begging your pardon my dear objected Bertram I watched him too even more closely than you did and it was always the woman who was talking to Cyril Billy laughed Well anyhow she maintained he listened He didn t run away As if a bridegroom could cried Kate I m going to avowed Bertram his nose in the air Pooh scoffed Kate Then she added eagerly You must be married in church Billy and in the evening Bertram s nose came suddenly out of the air His eyes met Kate s squarely Billy hasn t decided yet how she does want to be married he said with unnecessary emphasis Billy laughed and interposed a quick change of subject I think people had a pretty good time too for a wedding don t you she asked I was sorry Mary Jane couldn t be here twould have been such a good chance for him to meet our friends As Mary Jane asked Bertram a little stiffly Really my dear murmured Aunt Hannah I think it would be more respectful to call him by his name By the way what is his name questioned William That s what we don t know laughed Billy Well you know the Arkwright don t you put in Bertram Bertram too laughed but it was a little forcedly I suppose if you knew his name was Methuselah you wouldn t call him that yet would you Billy clapped her hands and threw a merry glance at Aunt Hannah There we never thought of Methuselah she gurgled gleefully Maybe it is Methuselah now Methuselah John You see he s told us to try to guess it she explained turning to William but honestly I don t believe whatever it is I ll ever think of him as anything but Mary Jane Well as far as I can judge he has nobody but himself to thank for that so he can t do any complaining smiled William as he rose to go Well how about it Bertram I suppose you re going to stay a while to comfort the lonely eh boy Of course he is and so are you too Uncle William spoke up Billy with affectionate cordiality As if I d let you go back to a forlorn dinner in that great house to night Indeed no William smiled hesitated and sat down Well of course he began Yes of course finished Billy quickly I ll telephone Pete that you ll stay here both of you It was at this point that little Kate who had been turning interested eyes from one brother to the other interposed a clear high pitched question Uncle William didn t you want to marry my going to be Aunt Billy Kate gasped her mother didn t I tell you Her voice trailed into an incoherent murmur of remonstrance Billy blushed Bertram said a low word under his breath Aunt Hannah s Oh my grief and conscience was almost a groan William laughed lightly Well my little lady he suggested let us put it the other way and say that quite probably she didn t want to marry me Does she want to marry Uncle Bertram Kate gasped Billy and missus Hartwell together this time fearful of what might be coming next We ll hope so nodded Uncle William speaking in a cheerfully matter of fact voice intended to discourage curiosity The little girl frowned and pondered Her elders cast about in their minds for a speedy change of subject but their somewhat scattered wits were not quick enough It was little Kate who spoke next Uncle William would she have got Uncle Cyril if Aunt Marie hadn t nabbed him first Kate The word was a chorus of dismay this time missus Hartwell struggled to her feet Come come Kate we must go up stairs to bed she stammered The little girl drew back indignantly To bed Why mama I haven t had my supper yet What Oh sure enough the lights I forgot Well then come up to change your dress finished missus Hartwell as with a despairing look and gesture she led her young daughter from the room CHAPTER XIV M J MAKES ANOTHER MOVE Billy came down stairs on the thirteenth of December to find everywhere the peculiar flatness that always follows a day which for weeks has been the focus of one s aims and thoughts and labor It s just as if everything had stopped at Marie s wedding and there wasn t anything more to do she complained to Aunt Hannah at the breakfast table Everything seems so queer It won t long dear smiled Aunt Hannah tranquilly as she buttered her roll specially after Bertram comes back How long does he stay in New York Only three days but I m just sure it s going to seem three weeks now sighed Billy But he simply had to go else he wouldn t have gone I ve no doubt of it observed Aunt Hannah And at the meaning emphasis of her words Billy laughed a little After a minute she said aggrievedly I had supposed that I could at least have a sort of after the ball celebration this morning picking up and straightening things around But John and Rosa have done it all There isn t so much as a rose leaf anywhere on the floor Of course most of the flowers went to the hospital last night anyway As for Marie s room it looks as spick and span as if it had never seen a scrap of ribbon or an inch of tulle But the wedding presents All carried down to the kitchen and half packed now ready to go over to the new home John says he ll take them over in Peggy this afternoon after he takes missus Hartwell s trunk to Uncle William s Well you can at least go over to the apartment and work suggested Aunt Hannah hopefully Humph Can I scoffed Billy As if I could when Marie left strict orders that not one thing was to be touched till she got here They arranged everything but the presents before the wedding anyway and Marie wants to fix those herself after she gets back Mercy Aunt Hannah if I should so much as move a plate one inch in the china closet Marie would know it and change it when she got home laughed Billy as she rose from the table No I can t go to work over there But there s your music my dear You said you were going to write some new songs after the wedding I was sighed Billy walking to the window and looking listlessly at the bare brown world outside but I can t write songs when there aren t any songs in my head to write No of course not but they ll come dear in time You re tired now soothed Aunt Hannah as she turned to leave the room It s the reaction of course murmured Aunt Hannah to herself on the way up stairs She s had the whole thing on her hands dear child A few minutes later from the living room came a plaintive little minor melody Billy was at the piano Kate and little Kate had the night before gone home with William It had been a sudden decision brought about by the realization that Bertram s trip to New York would leave William alone Her trunk was to be carried there to day and she would leave for home from there at the end of a two or three days visit It began to snow at twelve o clock All the morning the sky had been gray and threatening and the threats took visible shape at noon in myriads of white snow feathers that filled the air to the blinding point and turned the brown bare world into a thing of fairylike beauty Billy however with a rare frown upon her face looked out upon it with disapproving eyes I was going in town and I believe I ll go now she cried Don t dear please don t begged Aunt Hannah See the flakes are smaller now and the wind is coming up We re in for a blizzard I m sure we are And you know you have some cold already All right sighed Billy Then it s me for the knitting work and the fire I suppose she finished with a whimsicality that did not hide the wistful disappointment of her voice She was not knitting however she was sewing with Aunt Hannah when at four o clock Rosa brought in the card Billy glanced at the name then sprang to her feet with a glad little cry It s Mary Jane she exclaimed as Rosa disappeared Now wasn t he a dear to think to come to day You ll be down won t you Aunt Hannah smiled even while she frowned Oh Billy she remonstrated Yes I ll come down of course a little later and I m glad Mr Arkwright came she said with reproving emphasis Billy laughed and threw a mischievous glance over her shoulder All right she nodded I ll go and tell Mr Arkwright you ll be down directly In the living room Billy greeted her visitor with a frankly cordial hand How did you know mister Arkwright that I was feeling specially restless and lonesome to day she demanded A glad light sprang to the man s dark eyes I didn t know it he rejoined I only knew that I was specially restless and lonesome myself Arkwright s voice was not quite steady The unmistakable friendliness in the girl s words and manner had sent a quick throb of joy to his heart Her evident delight in his coming had filled him with rapture He could not know that it was only the chill of the snowstorm that had given warmth to her handclasp the dreariness of the day that had made her greeting so cordial the loneliness of a maiden whose lover is away that had made his presence so welcome Well I m glad you came anyway sighed Billy contentedly though I suppose I ought to be sorry that you were lonesome but I m afraid I m not for now you ll know just how I felt so you won t mind if I m a little wild and erratic You see the tension has snapped she added laughingly as she seated herself Tension The wedding you know For so many weeks we ve been seeing just December twelfth that we d apparently forgotten all about the thirteenth that came after it so when I got up this morning I felt just as you do when the clock has stopped ticking But it was a lovely wedding mister Arkwright I m sorry you could not be here Thank you so am I though usually I will confess I m not much good at attending functions and meeting strangers As perhaps you ve guessed Miss Neilson I m not particularly a society chap Of course you aren t People who are doing things real things seldom are But we aren t the society kind ourselves you know not the capital S kind We like sociability which is vastly different from liking Society Oh we have friends to be sure who dote on pink teas and purple pageants as Cyril calls them and we even go ourselves sometimes But if you had been here yesterday mister Arkwright you d have met lots like yourself men and women who are doing things singing playing painting illustrating writing Why we even had a poet sir only he didn t have long hair so he didn t look the part a bit she finished laughingly Is long hair necessary for poets Arkwright s smile was quizzical Dear me no not now But it used to be didn t it And for painters too But now they look just like folks Arkwright laughed It isn t possible that you are sighing for the velvet coats and flowing ties of the past is it Miss Neilson I m afraid it is dimpled Billy I love velvet coats and flowing ties May singers wear them I shall don them at once anyhow at a venture declared the man promptly Billy smiled and shook her head I don t think you will You all like your horrid fuzzy tweeds and worsteds too well You speak with feeling One would almost suspect that you already had tried to bring about a reform and failed Perhaps mister Cyril now or mister Bertram Arkwright stopped with a whimsical smile Billy flushed a little As it happened she had indeed had a merry tilt with Bertram on that very subject and he had laughingly promised that his wedding present to her would be a velvet house coat for himself It was on the point of Billy s tongue now to say this to Arkwright but another glance at the provoking smile on his lips drove the words back in angry confusion For the second time in the presence of this man Billy found herself unable to refer to her engagement to Bertram Henshaw though this time she did not in the least doubt that Arkwright already knew of it With a little gesture of playful scorn she rose and went to the piano Come let us try some duets she suggested That s lots nicer than quarrelling over velvet coats and Aunt Hannah will be down presently to hear us sing Before she had ceased speaking Arkwright was at her side with an exclamation of eager acquiescence It was after the second duet that Arkwright asked a little diffidently Have you written any new songs lately No You re going to Perhaps if I find one to write You mean you have no words Yes and no I have some words both of my own and other people s but I haven t found in any one of them yet a melody Arkwright hesitated His right hand went almost to his inner coat pocket then fell back at his side The next moment he picked up a sheet of music Are you too tired to try this he asked A puzzled frown appeared on Billy s face Why no but Well children I ve come down to hear the music announced Aunt Hannah smilingly from the doorway only Billy will you run up and get my pink shawl too This room is colder than I thought and there s only the white one down here Of course cried Billy rising at once You shall have a dozen shawls if you like she laughed as she left the room What a cozy time it was the hour that followed after Billy returned with the pink shawl Outside the wind howled at the windows and flung the snow against the glass in sleety crashes Inside the man and the girl sang duets until they were tired then with Aunt Hannah they feasted royally on the buttered toast tea and frosted cakes that Rosa served on a little table before the roaring fire It was then that Arkwright talked of himself telling them something of his studies and of the life he was living After all you see there s just this difference between my friends and yours he said at last Your friends are doing things They ve succeeded Mine haven t yet they re only trying But they will succeed cried Billy Some of them amended the man Not all of them Billy looked a little troubled Arkwright shook his head slowly No They couldn t all of them you know Some haven t the talent some haven t the perseverance and some haven t the money But all that seems such a pity when they ve tried grieved Billy It is a pity Miss Neilson Disappointed hopes are always a pity aren t they Y yes sighed the girl But if there were only something one could do to help Arkwright s eyes grew deep with feeling but his voice when he spoke was purposely light I m afraid that would be quite too big a contract for even your generosity Miss Neilson to mend all the broken hopes in the world he prophesied I have known great good to come from great disappointments remarked Aunt Hannah a bit didactically So have I laughed Arkwright still determined to drive the troubled shadow from the face he was watching so intently For instance a fellow I know was feeling all cut up last Friday because he was just too late to get into Symphony Hall on the twenty five cent admission Half an hour afterwards his disappointment was turned to joy a friend who had an orchestra chair couldn t use his ticket that day and so handed it over to him Billy turned interestedly What are those twenty five cent tickets to the Symphony Then you don t know Not exactly I ve heard of them in a vague fashion Then you ve missed one of the sights of Boston if you haven t ever seen that long line of patient waiters at the door of Symphony Hall of a Friday morning Morning But the concert isn t till afternoon No but the waiting is retorted Arkwright You see those admissions are limited five hundred and five I believe and they re rush seats at that First come first served and if you re too late you aren t served at all So the first arrival comes bright and early I ve heard that he has been known to come at peep of day when there s a Paderewski or a Melba for a drawing card But I ve got my doubts of that Anyhow I never saw them there much before half past eight But many s the cold stormy day I ve seen those steps in front of the Hall packed for hours and a long line reaching away up the avenue Billy s eyes widened And they ll stand all that time and wait To be sure they will You see each pays twenty five cents at the door until the limit is reached then the rest are turned away Naturally they don t want to be turned away so they try to get there early enough to be among the fortunate five hundred and five Besides the earlier you are the better seat you are likely to get But only think of standing all that time Oh they bring camp chairs sometimes I ve heard and then there are the steps You don t know what a really fine seat a stone step is if you have a big enough bundle of newspapers to cushion it with They bring their luncheons too with books papers and knitting work for fine days I ve been told some of them All the comforts of home you see smiled Arkwright Why how how dreadful stammered Billy Oh but they don t think it s dreadful at all corrected Arkwright quickly For twenty five cents they can hear all that you hear down in your orchestra chair for which you ve paid so high a premium But who who are they Where do they come from Who would go and stand hours like that to get a twenty five cent seat questioned Billy Who are they Anybody everybody from anywhere everywhere people who have the music hunger but not the money to satisfy it he rejoined Students teachers a little milliner from South Boston a little dressmaker from Chelsea a housewife from Cambridge a stranger from the uttermost parts of the earth maybe a widow who used to sit down stairs or a professor who has seen better days Really to know that line you should see it for yourself Miss Neilson smiled Arkwright as he reluctantly rose to go Some Friday however before you take your seat just glance up at that packed top balcony and judge by the faces you see there whether their owners think they re getting their twenty five cents worth or not I will nodded Billy with a smile but the smile came from her lips only not her eyes Billy was wishing at that moment that she owned the whole of Symphony Hall to give away But that was like Billy When she was seven years old she had proposed to her Aunt Ella that they take all the thirty five orphans from the Hampden Falls Orphan Asylum to live with them so that little Sallie Cook and the other orphans might have ice cream every day if they wanted it Since then Billy had always been trying in a way to give ice cream to some one who wanted it Arkwright was almost at the door when he turned abruptly His face was an abashed red From his pocket he had taken a small folded paper Do you suppose in this you might find that melody he stammered in a low voice The next moment he was gone having left in Billy s fingers a paper upon which was written in a clear cut masculine hand six four line stanzas Billy read them at once hurriedly then more carefully Why they re beautiful she breathed just beautiful Where did he get them I wonder It s a love song and such a pretty one I believe there is a melody in it she exulted pausing to hum a line or two There is I know there is and I ll write it for Bertram she finished crossing joyously to the piano Half way down Corey Hill at that moment Arkwright was buffeting the wind and snow He too was thinking joyously of those stanzas joyously yet at the same time fearfully Arkwright himself had written those lines though not for Bertram CHAPTER XV mister BILLY AND MISS MARY JANE On the fourteenth of December Billy came down stairs alert interested and happy She had received a dear letter from Bertram mailed on the way to New York the sun was shining and her fingers were fairly tingling to put on paper the little melody that was now surging riotously through her brain Emphatically the restlessness of the day before was gone now Once more Billy s clock had begun to tick After breakfast Billy went straight to the telephone and called up Arkwright Even one side of the conversation Aunt Hannah did not hear very clearly but in five minutes a radiant faced Billy danced into the room Aunt Hannah just listen Only think Mary Jane wrote the words himself so of course I can use them Billy dear can t you say mister Arkwright pleaded Aunt Hannah Billy laughed and gave the anxious eyed little old lady an impulsive hug Of course I ll say His Majesty if you like dear she chuckled But did you hear did you realize They re his own words so there s no question of rights or permission or anything And he s coming up this afternoon to hear my melody and to make a few little changes in the words maybe Oh Aunt Hannah you don t know how good it seems to get into my music again Yes yes dear of course but Aunt Hannah s sentence ended in a vaguely troubled pause Billy turned in surprise Why Aunt Hannah aren t you glad You said you d be glad Yes dear and I am very glad It s only if it doesn t take too much time and if Bertram doesn t mind Billy flushed She laughed a little bitterly No it won t take too much time I fancy and so far as Bertram is concerned if what Sister Kate says is true Aunt Hannah he ll be glad to have me occupy a little of my time with something besides himself Fiddlededee bristled Aunt Hannah What did she mean by that Billy smiled ruefully Well probably I did need it She said it night before last just before she went home with Uncle William She declared that I seemed to forget entirely that Bertram belonged to his Art first before he belonged to me and that it was exactly as she had supposed it would be a perfect absurdity for Bertram to think of marrying anybody Fiddlededee ejaculated the irate Aunt Hannah even more sharply I hope you have too much good sense to mind what Kate says Billy Yes I know sighed the girl but of course I can see some things for myself and I suppose I did make a little fuss about his going to New York the other night And I will own that I ve had a real struggle with myself sometimes lately not to mind his giving so much time to his portrait painting And of course both of those are very reprehensible in an artist s wife she finished a little tremulously Humph Well I don t think I should worry about that observed Aunt Hannah with grim positiveness No I don t mean to smiled Billy wistfully I only told you so you d understand that it was just as well if I did have something to take up my mind besides Bertram And of course music would be the most natural thing Yes of course agreed Aunt Hannah And it seems actually almost providential that Mary I mean mister Arkwright is here to help me now that Cyril is gone went on Billy still a little wistfully Yes of course He isn t like a stranger murmured Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah s voice sounded as if she were trying to convince herself of something No indeed He seems just like one of the family to me almost as if he were really your niece Mary Jane laughed Billy Aunt Hannah moved restlessly Billy she hazarded he knows of course of your engagement Why of course he does Aunt Hannah everybody does Billy s eyes were plainly surprised Yes yes of course he must subsided Aunt Hannah confusedly hoping that Billy would not divine the hidden reason behind her question She was relieved when Billy s next words showed that she had not divined it I told you didn t I He s coming up this afternoon He can t get here till five though but he s so interested He s about as crazy over the thing as I am And it s going to be fine Aunt Hannah when it s done You just wait and see she finished gayly as she tripped from the room Left to herself Aunt Hannah drew a long breath I m glad she didn t suspect she was thinking I believe she d consider even the question disloyal to Bertram dear child And of course Mary Aunt Hannah corrected herself with cheeks aflame I mean mister Arkwright does know It was just here however that Aunt Hannah was mistaken mister Arkwright did not know He had not reached Boston when the engagement was announced He knew none of Billy s friends in town save the Henshaw brothers He had not heard from Calderwell since he came to Boston The very evident intimacy of Billy with the Henshaw brothers he accepted as a matter of course knowing the history of their acquaintance and the fact that Billy was mister William Henshaw s namesake As to Bertram being Billy s lover that idea had long ago been killed at birth by Calderwell s emphatic assertion that the artist would never care for any girl except to paint Since coming to Boston Arkwright had seen little of the two together His work his friends and his general mode of life precluded that Because of all this therefore Arkwright did not know which was a pity for Arkwright and for some others Promptly at five o clock that afternoon Arkwright rang Billy s doorbell and was admitted by Rosa to the living room where Billy was at the piano Billy sprang to her feet with a joyous word of greeting I m so glad you ve come she sighed happily I want you to hear the melody your pretty words have sung to me Though maybe after all you won t like it you know she finished with arch wistfulness As if I could help liking it smiled the man trying to keep from his voice the ecstatic delight that the touch of her hand had brought him Billy shook her head and seated herself again at the piano The words are lovely she declared sorting out two or three sheets of manuscript music from the quantity on the rack before her But there s one place the rhythm you know if you could change it There but listen First I m going to play it straight through to you And she dropped her fingers to the keyboard The next moment a tenderly sweet melody with only a chord now and then for accompaniment filled Arkwright s soul with rapture Then Billy began to sing very softly the words No wonder Arkwright s soul was filled with rapture They were his words wrung straight from his heart and they were being sung by the girl for whom they were written They were being sung with feeling too so evident a feeling that the man s pulse quickened and his eyes flashed a sudden fire Arkwright could not know of course that Billy in her own mind was singing that song to Bertram Henshaw The fire was still in Arkwright s eyes when the song was ended but Billy very plainly did not see it With a frowning sigh and a murmured There she began to talk of rhythm and accent and cadence and to point out with anxious care why three syllables instead of two were needed at the end of a certain line From this she passed eagerly to the accompaniment and Arkwright at once found himself lost in a maze of minor thirds and diminished sevenths until he was forced to turn from the singer to the song Still watching her a little later he noticed her absorbed face and eager enthusiasm her earnest pursuance of an elusive harmony and he wondered did she or did she not sing that song with feeling a little while before Arkwright had not settled this question to his own satisfaction when Aunt Hannah came in at half past five and he was conscious of a vague disappointment as he rose to greet her Billy however turned an untroubled face to the newcomer We re doing finely Aunt Hannah she cried Then suddenly she flung a laughing question to the man How about it sir Are we going to put on the title page Words by Mary Jane Arkwright or will you unveil the mystery for us now Have you guessed it he bantered No unless it s Methuselah John We did think of that the other day Wrong again he laughed Then it ll have to be Mary Jane retorted Billy with calm naughtiness refusing to meet Aunt Hannah s beseechingly reproving eyes Then suddenly she chuckled It would be a combination wouldn t it Words by Mary Jane Arkwright Music by Billy Neilson We d have sighing swains writing to Dear Miss Arkwright telling how touching were her words and lovelorn damsels thanking Mr Neilson for his soul inspiring music Billy my dear remonstrated Aunt Hannah faintly Yes yes I know that was bad and I won t again truly promised Billy But her eyes danced and the next moment she had whirled about on the piano stool and dashed into a Chopin waltz The room itself then seemed to be full of the twinkling feet of elves CHAPTER XVI A GIRL AND A BIT OF LOWESTOFT Immediately after breakfast the next morning Billy was summoned to the telephone
6000_55211_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh good morning Uncle William she called in answer to the masculine voice that replied to her Hullo 
none	none	Billy are you very busy this morning
6000_55211_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 No indeed not if you want me 
6000_55211_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I do my dear Uncle William s voice was troubled 
6000_55211_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 I want you to go with me if you can to see a missus Greggory 
6000_55211_000005_000002	train-clean-100	She s got a teapot I want 
none	none	It s a genuine Lowestoft Harlow says 
6000_55211_000005_000004	train-clean-100	Will you go 
6000_55211_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Of course I will

6000_55211_000007_000001	train-clean-100	She s at the West End 
none	none	I don t dare to put it off for fear I ll lose it Harlow says others will have to know of it of course 
6000_55211_000007_000004	train-clean-100	You see she s just made up her mind to sell it and asked him to find a customer 
6000_55211_000007_000005	train-clean-100	I wouldn t trouble you but he says they re peculiar the daughter especially and may need some careful handling 
none	none	That s why I wanted you though I wanted you to see the tea pot too it ll be yours some day you know Billy all alone at her end of the line blushed 
6000_55211_000008_000001	train-clean-100	That she was one day to be mistress of the Strata and all it contained was still anything but common to her 
none	none	I d love to see it and I ll come gladly but I m afraid I won t be much help Uncle William she worried
6000_55211_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll take the risk of that 
none	none	You see Harlow says that about half the time she isn t sure she wants to sell it after all Why how funny 
6000_55211_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Well I ll come 
none	none	At eleven you say at Park Street
6000_55211_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes and thank you my dear 
6000_55211_000012_000001	train-clean-100	I tried to get Kate to go too but she wouldn t 
none	none	By the way I m going to bring you home to luncheon 
6000_55211_000012_000003	train-clean-100	Kate leaves this afternoon you know and it s been so snowy she hasn t thought best to try to get over to the house 
none	none	Maybe Aunt Hannah would come too for luncheon Would she
6000_55211_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 I m afraid not returned Billy with a rueful laugh 
none	none	She s got three shawls on this morning and you know that always means that she s felt a draft somewhere poor dear I ll tell her though and I ll see you at eleven finished Billy as she hung up the receiver Promptly at the appointed time Billy met Uncle William at Park Street and together they set out for the West End street named on the paper in his pocket 
6000_55211_000014_000001	train-clean-100	But when the shabby house on the narrow little street was reached the man looked about him with a troubled frown 
6000_55211_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 I declare Billy I m not sure but we d better turn back he fretted I didn t mean to take you to such a place as this 
none	none	Billy shivered a little but after one glance at the man s disappointed face she lifted a determined chin Nonsense Uncle William 
6000_55211_000017_000001	train-clean-100	Of course you won t turn back 
none	none	I don t mind for myself but only think of the people whose homes are here she finished just above her breath missus Greggory was found to be living in two back rooms at the top of four flights of stairs up which William Henshaw toiled with increasing weariness and dismay punctuating each flight with a despairing Billy really I think we should turn back But Billy would not turn back and at last they found themselves in the presence of a white haired sweet faced woman who said yes she was missus Greggory yes she was Even as she uttered the words however she looked fearfully over her shoulders as if expecting to hear from the hall behind them a voice denying her assertion 
6000_55211_000020_000000	train-clean-100	missus Greggory was a cripple 
none	none	Her slender little body was poised on two once costly crutches Both the worn places on the crutches and the skill with which the little woman swung herself about the room testified that the crippled condition was not a new one 
6000_55211_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Billy s eyes were brimming with pity and dismay 
none	none	Mechanically she had taken the chair toward which missus Greggory had motioned her 
6000_55211_000021_000002	train-clean-100	She had tried not to seem to look about her but there was not one detail of the bare little room from its faded rug to the patched but spotless tablecloth that was not stamped on her brain 
none	none	missus Greggory had seated herself now and William Henshaw had cleared his throat nervously Billy did not know whether she herself were the more distressed or the more relieved to hear him stammer We er I came from Harlow missus Greggory He gave me to understand you had an er teapot that er With his eyes on the cracked white crockery pitcher on the table William Henshaw came to a helpless pause 
6000_55211_000024_000000	train-clean-100	A curious expression or rather series of expressions crossed missus Greggory s face 
6000_55211_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Terror joy dismay and relief seemed one after the other to fight for supremacy 
6000_55211_000024_000002	train-clean-100	Relief in the end conquered though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke 
none	none	The Lowestoft 
6000_55211_000025_000001	train-clean-100	Yes I m so glad that is of course I must be glad I ll get it Her voice broke as she pulled herself from her chair There was only despairing sorrow on her face now 
6000_55211_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The man rose at once 
none	none	But madam perhaps don t let me I he began stammeringly Of course Billy he broke off in an entirely different voice Jove What a beauty missus Greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector s chair disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot creamy in tint and exquisitely decorated in a rose design 
6000_55211_000028_000001	train-clean-100	Near it set a tray like plate of the same ware and decoration 
none	none	If you ll lift it down please yourself motioned missus Greggory
6000_55211_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 I don t like to with these she explained tapping the crutches at her side 
6000_55211_000030_000000	train-clean-100	With fingers that were almost reverent in their appreciation the collector reached for the teapot 
6000_55211_000030_000001	train-clean-100	His eyes sparkled 
6000_55211_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Billy look what a beauty 
6000_55211_000031_000001	train-clean-100	And it s a Lowestoft too the real thing the genuine true soft paste 
6000_55211_000031_000002	train-clean-100	And there s the tray did you notice he exulted turning back to the shelf 
none	none	You don t see that every day They get separated most generally you know
6000_55211_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 These pieces have been in our family for generations said missus Greggory with an accent of pride 
6000_55211_000032_000001	train-clean-100	 You ll find them quite perfect I think 
none	none	Perfect I should say they were cried the man
6000_55211_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 They are then valuable missus Greggory s voice shook 
none	none	Indeed they are 
6000_55211_000035_000001	train-clean-100	But you must know that 
6000_55211_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 I have been told so 
none	none	Yet to me their chief value of course lies in their association 
6000_55211_000036_000002	train-clean-100	My mother and my grandmother owned that teapot sir Again her voice broke 
6000_55211_000037_000000	train-clean-100	William Henshaw cleared his throat 
6000_55211_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 But madam if you do not wish to sell He stopped abruptly 
none	none	His longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china 
6000_55211_000039_000000	train-clean-100	missus Greggory gave a low cry 
6000_55211_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 But I do that is I must 
none	none	mister Harlow says that it is valuable and that it will bring in money and we need money She threw a quick glance toward the hall door though she did not pause in her remarks
6000_55211_000040_000002	train-clean-100	 I can t do much at work that pays 
none	none	I sew she nodded toward the machine by the window but with only one foot to make it go You see the other is is inclined to shirk a little she finished with a wistful whimsicality 
6000_55211_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Billy turned away sharply 
none	none	There was a lump in her throat and a smart in her eyes She was conscious suddenly of a fierce anger against she did not know what exactly but she fancied it was against the teapot or against Uncle William for wanting the teapot or for not wanting it if he did not buy it
6000_55211_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 And so you see I do very much wish to sell 
none	none	missus Greggory said then
6000_55211_000043_000001	train-clean-100	 Perhaps you will tell me what it would be worth to you she concluded tremulously 
6000_55211_000044_000000	train-clean-100	The collector s eyes glowed 
6000_55211_000044_000001	train-clean-100	He picked up the teapot with careful rapture and examined it 
6000_55211_000044_000002	train-clean-100	Then he turned to the tray 
6000_55211_000044_000003	train-clean-100	After a moment he spoke 
6000_55211_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 I have only one other in my collection as rare he said 
none	none	I paid
6000_55211_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 a hundred dollars 
none	none	for that I shall be glad to give you the same for this madam missus Greggory started visibly A hundred dollars 
6000_55211_000047_000001	train-clean-100	So much as that she cried almost joyously 
none	none	Why nothing else that we ve had has brought Of course if it s worth that to you She paused suddenly 
6000_55211_000047_000003	train-clean-100	A quick step had sounded in the hall outside 
6000_55211_000047_000004	train-clean-100	The next moment the door flew open and a young woman who looked to be about twenty three or twenty four years old burst into the room 
6000_55211_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Mother only think I ve 
6000_55211_000048_000001	train-clean-100	She stopped and drew back a little Her startled eyes went from one face to another then dropped to the Lowestoft teapot in the man s hands 
none	none	Her expression changed at once She shut the door quickly and hurried forward
6000_55211_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Mother what is it 
6000_55211_000049_000001	train-clean-100	Who are these people she asked sharply 
6000_55211_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Billy lifted her chin the least bit 
6000_55211_000050_000001	train-clean-100	She was conscious of a feeling which she could not name Billy was not used to being called these people in precisely that tone of voice 
none	none	William Henshaw too raised his chin 
6000_55211_000050_000003	train-clean-100	He also was not in the habit of being referred to as these people 
6000_55211_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 My name is Henshaw Miss Greggory I presume he said quietly 
none	none	I was sent here by mister Harlow About the teapot my dear you know stammered missus Greggory wetting her lips with an air of hurried apology and conciliation
6000_55211_000052_000001	train-clean-100	 This gentleman says he will be glad to buy it 
none	none	Er my daughter Alice mister Henshaw she hastened on in embarrassed introduction and Miss Neilson supplied the man as she looked at Billy and hesitated A swift red stained Alice Greggory s face With barely an acknowledgment of the introductions she turned to her mother
6000_55211_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes dear but that won t be necessary now 
none	none	As I started to tell you when I came in I have two new pupils and so turning to the man again I thank you for your offer but we have decided not to sell the teapot at present As she finished her sentence she stepped one side as if to make room for the strangers to reach the door 
6000_55211_000056_000000	train-clean-100	William Henshaw frowned angrily that was the man but his eyes the collector s eyes sought the teapot longingly 
none	none	Before either the man or the collector could speak however missus Greggory interposed quick words of remonstrance But Alice my dear she almost sobbed
6000_55211_000057_000001	train-clean-100	 You didn t wait to let me tell you 
none	none	mister Henshaw says it is worth a hundred dollars to him 
6000_55211_000057_000003	train-clean-100	He will give us a hundred dollars 
6000_55211_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 A hundred dollars echoed the girl faintly 
none	none	It was plain to be seen that she was wavering 
6000_55211_000059_000001	train-clean-100	Billy watching the little scene with mingled emotions saw the glance with which the girl swept the bare little room and she knew that there was not a patch or darn or poverty spot in sight or out of sight which that glance did not encompass 
none	none	Billy was wondering which she herself desired more that Uncle William should buy the Lowestoft or that he should not She knew she wished missus Greggory to have the hundred dollars 
6000_55211_000060_000002	train-clean-100	There was no doubt on that point 
none	none	Then Uncle William spoke His words carried the righteous indignation of the man who thinks he has been unjustly treated and the final plea of the collector who sees a coveted treasure slipping from his grasp I am very sorry of course if my offer has annoyed you he said stiffly I certainly should not have made it had I not had missus Greggory s assurance that she wished to sell the teapot 
6000_55211_000062_000000	train-clean-100	Alice Greggory turned as if stung 
none	none	Wished to sell She repeated the words with superb disdain She was plainly very angry Her blue gray eyes gleamed with scorn and her whole face was suffused with a red that had swept to the roots of her soft hair Do you think a woman wishes to sell a thing that she s treasured all her life a thing that is perhaps the last visible reminder of the days when she was living not merely existing
6000_55211_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Alice Alice my love protested the sweet faced cripple agitatedly 
none	none	I can t help it stormed the girl hotly
6000_55211_000065_000001	train-clean-100	 I know how much you think of that teapot that was grandmother s 
6000_55211_000065_000002	train-clean-100	I know what it cost you to make up your mind to sell it at all 
none	none	And then to hear these people talk about your wishing to sell it Perhaps they think too we wish to live in a place like this that we wish to have rugs that are darned and chairs that are broken and garments that are patches instead of clothes
6000_55211_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Alice gasped missus Greggory in dismayed horror 
6000_55211_000067_000000	train-clean-100	With a little outward fling of her two hands Alice Greggory stepped back 
6000_55211_000067_000001	train-clean-100	Her face had grown white again 
6000_55211_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 I beg your pardon of course she said in a voice that was bitterly quiet 
none	none	I should not have spoken so You are very kind mister Henshaw but I do not think we care to sell the Lowestoft to day Both words and manner were obviously a dismissal and with a puzzled sigh William Henshaw picked up his hat 
6000_55211_000069_000001	train-clean-100	His face showed very clearly that he did not know what to do or what to say but it showed too as clearly that he longed to do something or say something 
6000_55211_000069_000002	train-clean-100	During the brief minute that he hesitated however Billy sprang forward 
none	none	missus Greggory please won t you let me buy the teapot 
6000_55211_000070_000001	train-clean-100	And then won t you keep it for me here 
6000_55211_000070_000002	train-clean-100	I haven t the hundred dollars with me but I ll send it right away 
6000_55211_000070_000003	train-clean-100	You will let me do it won t you 
6000_55211_000071_000000	train-clean-100	It was an impulsive speech and a foolish one of course from the standpoint of sense and logic and reasonableness but it was one that might be expected perhaps from Billy 
6000_55211_000072_000000	train-clean-100	missus Greggory must have divined in a way the spirit that prompted it for her eyes grew wet and with a choking Dear child she reached out and caught Billy s hand in both her own even while she shook her head in denial 
6000_55211_000073_000000	train-clean-100	Not so her daughter 
6000_55211_000073_000001	train-clean-100	Alice Greggory flushed scarlet 
none	none	She drew herself proudly erect
6000_55211_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank you she said with crisp coldness but distasteful as darns and patches are to us we prefer them infinitely to charity 
6000_55211_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh but please I didn t mean you didn t understand faltered Billy 
none	none	For answer Alice Greggory walked deliberately to the door and held it open
6000_55211_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh Alice my dear pleaded missus Greggory again feebly 
6000_55211_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Come Billy 
none	none	We ll bid you good morning ladies said William Henshaw then decisively And Billy with a little wistful pat on missus Greggory s clasped hands went 
6000_55211_000079_000000	train-clean-100	Once down the long four flights of stairs and out on the sidewalk William Henshaw drew a long breath 
6000_55211_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Well by Jove 
6000_55211_000080_000001	train-clean-100	Billy the next time I take you curio hunting it won t be to this place he fumed 
6000_55211_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 Wasn t it awful choked Billy 
none	none	Awful 
6000_55211_000082_000001	train-clean-100	The girl was the most stubborn unreasonable vixenish little puss I ever saw 
none	none	I didn t want her old Lowestoft if she didn t want to sell it But to practically invite me there and then treat me like that scolded the collector his face growing red with anger Still I was sorry for the poor little old lady I wish somehow she could have that hundred dollars 
6000_55211_000082_000006	train-clean-100	It was the man who said this not the collector 
none	none	So do I rejoined Billy dolefully
6000_55211_000083_000001	train-clean-100	 But that girl was so so queer she sighed with a frown 
6000_55211_000083_000002	train-clean-100	Billy was puzzled 
none	none	For the first time perhaps in her life she knew what it was to have her proffered ice cream disdainfully refused CHAPTER XVII ONLY A LOVE SONG BUT Kate and little Kate left for the West on the afternoon of the fifteenth and Bertram arrived from New York that evening Notwithstanding the confusion of all this Billy still had time to give some thought to her experience of the morning with Uncle William The forlorn little room with its poverty stricken furnishings and its crippled mistress was very vivid in Billy s memory Equally vivid were the flashing eyes of Alice Greggory as she had opened the door at the last For as Billy explained to Bertram that evening after she had told him the story of the morning s adventure you see dear I had never been really turned out of a house before I should think not scowled her lover indignantly and it s safe to say you never will again The impertinence of it But then you won t see them any more sweetheart so we ll just forget it Forget it Why Bertram I couldn t You couldn t if you d been there Besides of course I shall see them again Bertram s jaw dropped Why Billy you don t mean that Will or you either would try again for that trumpery teapot Of course not flashed Billy heatedly It isn t the teapot it s that dear little missus Greggory Why dearie you don t know how poor they are Everything in sight is so old and thin and worn it s enough to break your heart The rug isn t anything but darns nor the tablecloth either except patches It s awful Bertram I know darling but you don t expect to buy them new rugs and new tablecloths do you Billy gave one of her unexpected laughs Mercy she chuckled Only picture Miss Alice s face if I should try to buy them rugs and tablecloths No dear she went on more seriously I sha n t do that of course though I d like to but I shall try to see missus Greggory again if it s nothing more than a rose or a book or a new magazine that I can take to her Or a smile which I fancy will be the best gift of the lot amended Bertram fondly Billy dimpled and shook her head Smiles my smiles are not so valuable I m afraid except to you perhaps she laughed Self evident facts need no proving retorted Bertram Well and what else has happened in all these ages I ve been away Billy brought her hands together with a sudden cry Oh and I haven t told you she exclaimed I m writing a new song a love song Mary Jane wrote the words They re beautiful Bertram stiffened Indeed And is Mary Jane a poet with all the rest he asked with affected lightness Oh no of course not smiled Billy but these words are pretty And they just sang themselves into the dearest little melody right away So I m writing the music for them Lucky Mary Jane murmured Bertram still with a lightness that he hoped would pass for indifference Bertram was ashamed of himself but deep within him was a growing consciousness that he knew the meaning of the vague irritation that he always felt at the mere mention of Arkwright s name And will the title page say Words by Mary Jane Arkwright he finished That s what I asked him laughed Billy I even suggested Methuselah John for a change Oh but dearie she broke off with shy eagerness I just want you to hear a little of what I ve done with it You see really all the time I suspect I ve been singing it to you she confessed with an endearing blush as she sprang lightly to her feet and hurried to the piano It was a bad ten minutes that Bertram Henshaw spent then How he could love a song and hate it at the same time he did not understand but he knew that he was doing exactly that To hear Billy carol Sweetheart my sweetheart with that joyous tenderness was bliss unspeakable until he remembered that Arkwright wrote the Sweetheart my sweetheart then it was Even in his thoughts Bertram bit the word off short He was not a swearing man When he looked at Billy now at the piano and thought of her singing as she said she had sung that song to him all through the last three days his heart glowed But when he looked at her and thought of Arkwright who had made possible that singing his heart froze with terror From the very first it had been music that Bertram had feared He could not forget that Billy herself had once told him that never would she love any man better than she loved her music that she was not going to marry All this had been at the first the very first He had boldly scorned the idea then and had said So it s music a cold senseless thing of spidery marks on clean white paper that is my only rival He had said too that he was going to win And he had won but not until after long weeks of fearing hoping striving and despairing this last when Kate s blundering had nearly made her William s wife Then on that memorable day in September Billy had walked straight into his arms and he knew that he had indeed won That is he had supposed that he knew until Arkwright came Very sharply now as he listened to Billy s singing Bertram told himself to be reasonable to be sensible that Billy did indeed love him Was she not according to her own dear assertion singing that song to him But it was Arkwright s song He remembered that too and grew faint at the thought True he had won when his rival music had been a cold senseless thing of spidery marks on paper but would that winning stand when music had become a thing of flesh and blood a man of undeniable charm good looks and winsomeness a man whose thoughts aims and words were the personification of the thing Billy in the long ago had declared she loved best of all music Bertram shivered as with a sudden chill then Billy rose from the piano There she breathed her face shyly radiant with the glory of the song Did you like it Bertram did his best but in his state of mind the very radiance of her face was only an added torture and his tongue stumbled over the words of praise and appreciation that he tried to say He saw then the happy light in Billy s eyes change to troubled questioning and grieved disappointment and he hated himself for a jealous brute More earnestly than ever now he tried to force the ring of sincerity into his voice but he knew that he had miserably failed when he heard her falter Of course dear I I haven t got it nearly perfected yet It ll be much better later But it s fine now sweetheart indeed it is protested Bertram hurriedly Well of course I m glad if you like it murmured Billy but the glow did not come back to her face CHAPTER XVIII SUGARPLUMS Those short December days after Bertram s return from New York were busy ones for everybody Miss Winthrop was not in town to give sittings for her portrait it is true but her absence only afforded Bertram time and opportunity to attend to other work that had been more or less delayed and neglected He was often at Hillside however and the lovers managed to snatch many an hour of quiet happiness from the rush and confusion of the Christmas preparations Bertram was assuring himself now that his jealous fears of Arkwright were groundless Billy seldom mentioned the man and as the days passed she spoke only once of his being at the house The song too she said little of and Bertram though he was ashamed to own it to himself breathed more freely The real facts of the case were that Billy had told Arkwright that she should have no time to give attention to the song until after Christmas and her manner had so plainly shown him that she considered himself synonymous with the song that he had reluctantly taken the hint and kept away I ll make her care for me sometime for something besides a song he told himself with fierce consolation but Billy did not know this Aside from Bertram Christmas filled all of Billy s thoughts these days There were such a lot of things she wished to do But after all they re only sugarplums you know that I m giving dear she declared to Bertram one day when he had remonstrated with with her for so taxing her time and strength I can t really do much Much scoffed Bertram But it isn t much honestly compared to what there is to do argued Billy You see dear it s just this she went on her bright face sobering a little There are such a lot of people in the world who aren t really poor That is they have bread and probably meat to eat and enough clothes to keep them warm But when you ve said that you ve said it all Books music fun and frosting on their cake they know nothing about except to long for them But there are the churches and the charities and all those long named Societies I thought that was what they were for declared Bertram still a little aggrievedly his worried eyes on Billy s tired face Oh but the churches and charities don t frost cakes nor give sugarplums smiled Billy And it s right that they shouldn t too she added quickly They have more than they can do now with the roast beef and coal and flannel petticoats that are really necessary And so it s just frosting and sugarplums is it these books and magazines and concert tickets and lace collars for the crippled boy the spinster lady the little widow and all the rest of those people who were here last summer Billy turned in confused surprise Why Bertram however in the world did you find out about all that I didn t I just guessed it and it seems the boy guessed right the very first time laughed Bertram teasingly but with a tender light in his eyes Oh and I suppose you ll be sending a frosted cake to the Lowestoft lady too eh Billy s chin rose to a defiant stubbornness I m going to try to if I can find out what kind of frosting she likes How about the Alice lady or perhaps I should say the Lady Alice smiled the man Billy relaxed visibly Yes I know she sighed There is the Lady Alice But anyhow she can t call a Christmas present charity not if it s only a little bit of frosting Billy s chin came up again And you re going to really dare to send her something Yes avowed Billy I m going down there one of these days in the morning You re going down there Billy not alone Yes Why not But dearie you mustn t It was a horrid place Will says So it was horrid to live in It was everything that was cheap and mean and forlorn But it was quiet and respectable Tisn t as if I didn t know the way Bertram and I m sure that where that poor crippled woman and daughter are safe I shall be missus Greggory is a lady Bertram well born and well bred I m sure and that s the pity of it to have to live in a place like that They have seen better days I know Those pitiful little worn crutches of hers were mahogany I m sure Bertram and they were silver mounted Bertram made a restless movement I know dear but if you had some one with you It wouldn t do for Will of course nor me under the circumstances But there s Aunt Hannah He paused hopefully Billy chuckled Bless your dear heart Aunt Hannah would call for a dozen shawls in that place if she had breath enough to call for any after she got to the top of those four flights Yes I suppose so rejoined Bertram with an unwilling smile Still well you can take Rosa he concluded decisively How Miss Alice would like that to catch me going slumming with my maid cried Billy righteous indignation in her voice Honestly Bertram I think even gentle missus Greggory wouldn t stand for that Then leave Rosa outside in the hall planned Bertram promptly and after a few more arguments Billy finally agreed to this It was with Rosa therefore that she set out the next morning for the little room up four flights on the narrow West End street Leaving the maid on the top stair of the fourth flight Billy tapped at missus Greggory s door To her joy missus Greggory herself answered the knock Oh Why why good morning murmured the lady in evident embarrassment Won t you come m Thank you May I just a minute smiled Billy brightly As she entered the room Billy threw a hasty look about her There was no one but themselves present With a sigh of satisfaction therefore the girl took the chair missus Greggory offered and began to speak I was down this way that is I came this way this morning she began a little hastily and I wanted just to come up and tell you how sorry I was about about that teapot the other day We didn t want it of course if you didn t want us to have it A swift change crossed missus Greggory s perturbed face Oh then you didn t come for it again to day she said I m so glad I didn t want to refuse you Indeed I didn t come for it and we sha n t again Don t worry about that please missus Greggory sighed I m afraid you thought me very rude and and impossible the other day she stammered And please let me take this opportunity right now to apologize for my daughter She was overwrought and excited She didn t know what she was saying or doing I m sure She was ashamed I think after you left Billy raised a quick hand of protest Don t please don t missus Greggory she begged But it was our fault that you came We asked you to come through mister Harlow rejoined the other hurriedly And mister Henshaw was that his name was so kind in every way I m glad of this chance to tell you how much we really did appreciate it and your offer too which we could not of course accept she finished the bright color flooding her delicate face Again Billy raised a protesting hand but the little woman in the opposite chair hurried on There was still more evidently that she wished to say I hope mister Henshaw did not feel too disappointed about the Lowestoft We didn t want to let it go if we could help it and we hope now to keep it Of course murmured Billy sympathetically My daughter knew you see how much I have always thought of it and she was determined that I should not give it up She said I should have that much left anyway You see my daughter is very unreconciled still to things as they are and no wonder perhaps They are so different from what they were Her voice broke a little Of course said Billy again and this time the words were tinged with impatient indignation If only there were something one could do to help Thank you my dear but there isn t indeed there isn t rejoined the other quickly and Billy looking into the proudly lifted face realized suddenly that daughter Alice had perhaps inherited some traits from mother We shall get along very well I am sure My daughter has still another pupil She will be home soon to tell you herself perhaps Billy rose with a haste so marked it was almost impolite as she murmured Will she I m afraid though that I sha n t see her after all for I must go And may I leave these please she added hurriedly unpinning the bunch of white carnations from her coat It seems a pity to let them wilt when you can put them in water right here Her studiously casual voice gave no hint that those particular pinks had been bought less than half an hour before of a Park Street florist so that missus Greggory might put them in water right there Oh oh how lovely breathed missus Greggory her face deep in the feathery bed of sweetness Before she could half say Thank you however she found herself alone CHAPTER XIX ALICE GREGGORY Christmas came and went and in a flurry of snow and sleet January arrived The holidays over matters and things seemed to settle down to the winter routine Miss Winthrop had prolonged her visit in Washington until after Christmas but she had returned to Boston now and with her she had brought a brand new idea for her portrait an idea that caused her to sweep aside with superb disdain all poses and costumes and sketches to date and announce herself with disarming winsomeness as all ready now to really begin Bertram Henshaw was vexed but helpless Decidedly he wished to paint Miss Marguerite Winthrop s portrait but to attempt to paint it when all matters were not to the lady s liking were worse than useless unless he wished to hang this portrait in the gallery of failures along with Anderson s and Fullam s and that was not the goal he had set for it As to the sordid money part of the affair the great J G Winthrop himself had come to the artist and in one terse sentence had doubled the original price and expressed himself as hopeful that Henshaw would put up with the child s notions It was the old financier s next sentence however that put the zest of real determination into Bertram for because of it the artist saw what this portrait was going to mean to the stern old man and how dear was the original of it to a heart that was commonly reported on the street to be made of stone Obviously then indeed there was nothing for Bertram Henshaw to do but to begin the new portrait And he began it though still it must be confessed with inward questionings Before a week had passed however every trace of irritation had fled and he was once again the absorbed artist who sees the vision of his desire taking palpable shape at the end of his brush It s all right he said to Billy then one evening I m glad she changed It s going to be the best the very best thing I ve ever done I think by the sketches I m so glad exclaimed Billy I m so glad The repetition was so vehement that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince herself as well as Bertram of something that was not true But it was true Billy told herself very indignantly that it was indeed it was Yet the very fact that she had to tell herself this caused her to know how perilously near she was to being actually jealous of that portrait of Marguerite Winthrop And it shamed her Very sternly these days Billy reminded herself of what Kate had said about Bertram s belonging first to his Art She thought with mortification too that it did look as if she were not the proper wife for an artist if she were going to feel like this always Very resolutely then Billy turned to her music This was all the more easily done for not only did she have her usual concerts and the opera to enjoy but she had become interested in an operetta her club was about to give also she had taken up the new song again Christmas being over mister Arkwright had been to the house several times He had changed some of the words and she had improved the melody The work on the accompaniment was progressing finely now and Billy was so glad when she was absorbed in her music she forgot sometimes that she was ever so unfit an artist s sweetheart as to be jealous of a portrait It was quite early in the month that the usually expected January thaw came and it was on a comparatively mild Friday at this time that a matter of business took Billy into the neighborhood of Symphony Hall at about eleven o clock in the morning Dismissing John and the car upon her arrival she said that she would later walk to the home of a friend near by where she would remain until it was time for the Symphony Concert This friend was a girl whom Billy had known at school She was studying now at the Conservatory of Music and she had often urged Billy to come and have luncheon with her in her tiny apartment which she shared with three other girls and a widowed aunt for housekeeper On this particular Friday it had occurred to Billy that owing to her business appointment at eleven and the Symphony Concert at half past two the intervening time would give her just the opportunity she had been seeking to enable her to accept her friend s invitation A question asked and enthusiastically answered in the affirmative over the telephone that morning therefore had speedily completed arrangements and she had agreed to be at her friend s door by twelve o clock or before As it happened business did not take quite so long as she had expected and half past eleven found her well on her way to Miss Henderson s home In spite of the warm sunshine and the slushy snow in the streets there was a cold raw wind and Billy was beginning to feel thankful that she had not far to go when she rounded a corner and came upon a long line of humanity that curved itself back and forth on the wide expanse of steps before Symphony Hall and then stretched itself far up the Avenue Why what she began under her breath then suddenly she understood It was Friday A world famous pianist was to play with the Symphony Orchestra that afternoon This must be the line of patient waiters for the twenty five cent balcony seats that mister Arkwright had told about With sympathetic interested eyes then Billy stepped one side to watch the line for a moment Almost at once two girls brushed by her and one was saying What a shame and after all our struggles to get here If only we hadn t lost that other train We re too late you no need to hurry the other wailed shrilly to a third girl who was hastening toward them The line is way beyond the Children s Hospital and around the corner now and the ones there never get in At the look of tragic disappointment that crossed the third girl s face Billy s heart ached Her first impulse of course was to pull her own symphony ticket from her muff and hurry forward with a Here take mine But that would hardly do she knew though she would like to see Aunt Hannah s aghast face if this girl in the red sweater and white tam o shanter should suddenly emerge from among the sumptuous satins and furs and plumes that afternoon and claim the adjacent orchestra chair But it was out of the question of course There was only one seat and there were three girls besides all those others With a sigh then Billy turned her eyes back to those others those many others that made up the long line stretching its weary length up the Avenue There were more women than men yet the men were there jolly young men who were plainly students older men whose refined faces and threadbare overcoats hinted at cultured minds and starved bodies other men who showed no hollows in their cheeks nor near holes in their garments It seemed to Billy that women of almost all sorts were there young old and middle aged students in tailored suits widows in crape and veil girls that were members of a merry party women that were plainly forlorn and alone Some in the line shuffled restlessly some stood rigidly quiet One had brought a camp stool many were seated on the steps Beyond where the line passed an open lot a wooden fence afforded a convenient prop One read a book another a paper Three were studying what was probably the score of the symphony or of the concerto they expected to hear that afternoon A few did not appear to mind the biting wind but most of them by turned up coat collars or bent heads testified to the contrary Not far from Billy a woman nibbled a sandwich furtively while beyond her a group of girls were hilariously merry over four triangles of pie which they held up where all might see Many of the faces were youthful happy and alert with anticipation but others carried a wistfulness and a weariness that made Billy s heart ache Her eyes indeed filled with quick tears Later she turned to go and it was then that she saw in the line a face that she knew a face that drooped with such a white misery of spent strength that she hurried straight toward it with a low cry Miss Greggory she exclaimed when she reached the girl You look actually ill Are you ill For a brief second only dazed questioning stared from the girl s blue gray eyes Billy knew when the recognition came for she saw the painful color stain the white face red Thank you no I am not ill Miss Neilson said the girl coldly But you look so tired out I have been standing here some time that is all Billy threw a hurried glance down the far reaching line that she knew had formed since the girl s two tired feet had taken their first position But you must have come so early It isn t twelve o clock yet she faltered A slight smile curved Alice Greggory s lips Yes it was early she rejoined a little bitterly but it had to be you know I wanted to hear the music and with this soloist and this weather I knew that many others would want to hear the music too But you look so white How much longer when will they let you in demanded Billy raising indignant eyes to the huge gray pillared building before her much as if she would pull down the walls if she could and make way for this tired girl at her side Miss Greggory s thin shoulders rose and fell in an expressive shrug Half past one Billy gave a dismayed cry Half past one almost two hours more But Miss Greggory you can t how can you stand it till then You ve shivered three times since I came and you look as if you were going to faint away Miss Greggory shook her head It is nothing really she insisted I am quite well It is only I didn t happen to feel like eating much breakfast this morning and that with no luncheon She let a gesture finish her sentence No luncheon Why oh you couldn t leave your place of course frowned Billy No and Alice Greggory lifted her head a little proudly I do not care to eat here Her scornful eyes were on one of the pieces of pie down the line no longer a triangle Of course not agreed Billy promptly She paused frowned and bit her lip Suddenly her face cleared There the very thing she exulted You shall have my ticket this afternoon Miss Greggory then you won t have to stay here another minute Meanwhile there is an excellent restaurant Thank you no I couldn t do that cut in the other sharply but in a low voice But you ll take my ticket begged Billy Miss Greggory shook her head Certainly not But I want you to please I shall be very unhappy if you don t grieved Billy The other made a peremptory gesture I should be very unhappy if I did she said with cold emphasis Really Miss Neilson she went on in a low voice throwing an apprehensive glance at the man ahead who was apparently absorbed in his newspaper I m afraid I shall have to ask you to let me go on in my own way You are very kind but there is nothing you can do nothing You were very kind too of course to send the book and the flowers to mother at Christmas but Never mind that please interrupted Billy hurriedly Billy s head was lifted now Her eyes were no longer pleading Her round little chin looked square and determined If you simply will not take my ticket this afternoon you must do this Go to some restaurant near here and get a good luncheon something that will sustain you I will take your place here Miss Neilson Billy smiled radiantly It was the first time she had ever seen Alice Greggory s haughtily cold reserve break into anything like naturalness the astonished incredulity of that Miss Neilson was plainly straight from the heart so too were the amazed words that followed You will stand here Certainly I will keep your place Don t worry You sha n t lose it Billy spoke with a smiling indifference that was meant to convey the impression that standing in line for a twenty five cent seat was a daily habit of hers There s a restaurant only a little way right down there she finished And before the dazed Alice Greggory knew quite what was happening she found herself outside the line and the other in her place But Miss Neilson I can t you mustn t she stammered then because of something in the unyieldingness of the square young chin above the sealskin coat and because she could not she knew use actual force to drag the owner of that chin out of the line she bowed her head in acquiescence Well then I will long enough for some coffee and maybe a sandwich And thank you she choked as she turned and hurried away Billy drew the deep breath of one who has triumphed after long struggles but the breath broke off short in a gasp of dismay coming straight up the Avenue toward her was the one person in the world Billy wished least to see at that moment Bertram Henshaw Billy remembered then that she had twice lately heard her lover speak of calling at the Boston Opera House concerning a commission to paint an ideal head to represent Music for some decorative purpose The Opera House was only a short distance up the Avenue Doubtless he was on his way there now He was very near by this time and Billy held her breath suspended There was a chance of course that he might not notice her and Billy was counting on that chance until a gust of wind whirled a loose half sheet of newspaper from the hands of the man in front of her and naturally attracted Bertram s eyes to its vicinity and to hers The next moment he was at her side and his dumfounded but softly breathed Billy was in her ears Billy bubbled into low laughter there were such a lot of funny situations in the world and of them all this one was about the drollest she thought Yes I know she gurgled You don t have to say it your face is saying even more than your tongue could This is just for a girl I know I m keeping her place Bertram frowned He looked as if he were meditating picking Billy up and walking off with her But Billy he protested just above his breath this isn t sugarplums nor frosting it s plain suicide standing out in this wind like this Besides He stopped with an angrily despairing glance at her surroundings Yes I know she nodded a little soberly understanding the look and answering that first it isn t pleasant nor comfortable in lots of ways but she s had it all the morning As for the cold I m as warm as toast It won t be long anyway she s just gone to get something to eat Then I m going to May Henderson s for luncheon Bertram sighed impatiently and opened his lips only to close them with the words unsaid There was nothing he could do and he had already said too much he thought with a savage glance at the man ahead who still had enough of his paper left to serve for a pretence at reading As Bertram could see however the man was not reading a word he was too acutely conscious of the handsome young woman in the long sealskin coat behind him Billy was already the cynosure of dozens of eyes and Bertram knew that his own arrival on the scene had not lessened the interest of the owners of those eyes He only hoped devoutly that no one in the line knew him ar Billy and that no one quite knew what had happened He did not wish to see himself and his fiancee the subject of inch high headlines in some evening paper figuring as Talented young composer and her famous artist lover take poor girl s place in a twenty five cent ticket line He shivered at the thought Are you cold worried Billy If you are don t stand here please He shook his head silently His eyes were searching the street for the only one whose coming could bring him relief It must have been but a coffee and sandwich luncheon for the girl for soon she came The man surmised that it was she as soon as he saw her and stepped back at once He had no wish for introductions A moment later the girl was in Billy s place and Billy herself was at his side That was Alice Greggory Bertram she told him as they walked on swiftly and Bertram she was actually almost crying when she took my place Humph Well I should think she d better be growled Bertram perversely Pooh It didn t hurt me any dearie laughed Billy with a conciliatory pat on his arm as they turned down the street upon which her friend lived And now can you come in and see May a minute I m afraid not regretted Bertram I wish I could but I m busier than busy to day and I was supposed to be already late when I saw you Jove Billy I just couldn t believe my eyes You looked it twinkled Billy It was worth a farm just to see your face I d want the farm if I was going through that again retorted the man grimly Bertram was still seeing that newspaper heading But Billy only laughed again CHAPTER XX ARKWRIGHT TELLS A STORY Arkwright called Monday afternoon by appointment and together he and Billy put the finishing touches to the new song It was when with Aunt Hannah they were having tea before the fire a little later that Billy told of her adventure the preceding Friday afternoon in front of Symphony Hall You knew the girl of course I think you said you knew the girl ventured Arkwright Oh yes She was Alice Greggory I met her with Uncle William first over a Lowestoft teapot Maybe you d like to know how I met her smiled Billy Alice Greggory Arkwright s eyes showed a sudden interest I used to know an Alice Greggory but it isn t the same one probably Her mother was a cripple Billy gave a little cry Why it is it must be My Alice Greggory s mother is a cripple Oh do you know them really Well it does look like it rejoined Arkwright showing even deeper interest I haven t seen them for four or five years They used to live in our town The mother was a little sweet faced woman with young eyes and prematurely white hair That describes my missus Greggory exactly cried Billy s eager voice And the daughter Alice Why as I said it s been four years since I ve seen her A touch of constraint had come into Arkwright s voice which Billy s keen ear was quick to detect She was nineteen then and very pretty About my height and with light brown hair and big blue gray eyes that look steely cold when she s angry questioned Billy I reckon that s about it acknowledged the man with a faint smile Then they are the ones declared the girl plainly excited Isn t that splendid Now we can know them and perhaps do something for them I love that dear little mother already and I think I should the daughter if she didn t put out so many prickers that I couldn t get near her But tell us about them How did they come here Why didn t you know they were here Are you good at answering a dozen questions at once asked Aunt Hannah turning smiling eyes from Billy to the man at her side Well I can try he offered To begin with they are Judge Greggory s widow and daughter They belong to fine families on both sides and they used to be well off really wealthy for a small town But the judge was better at money making than he was at money keeping and when he came to die his income stopped of course and his estate was found to be in bad shape through reckless loans and worthless investments That was eight years ago Things went from bad to worse then until there was almost nothing left I knew there was some such story as that back of them declared Billy But how do you suppose they came here To get away from everybody I suspect replied Arkwright That would be like them They were very proud and it isn t easy you know to be nobody where you ve been somebody It doesn t hurt quite so hard to be nobody where you ve never been anything but nobody I suppose so sighed Billy Still they must have had friends They did of course but when the love of one s friends becomes too highly seasoned with pity it doesn t make a pleasant morsel to swallow specially if you don t like the taste of the pity and there are people who don t you know The Greggorys were that kind They were morbidly so From their cheap little cottage where they did their own work they stepped out in their shabby garments and old fashioned hats with heads even more proudly erect than in the old days when their home and their gowns and their doings were the admiration and envy of the town You see they didn t want that pity I do see cried Billy her face aglow with sudden understanding and I don t believe pity would be nice Her own chin was held high as she spoke It must have been hard indeed murmured Aunt Hannah with a sigh as she set down her teacup It was nodded Arkwright Of course missus Greggory with her crippled foot could do nothing to bring in any money except to sew a little It all depended on Alice and when matters got to their worst she began to teach She was fond of music and could play the piano well and of course she had had the best instruction she could get from city teachers only twenty miles away from our home town Young as she was about seventeen when she began to teach I think she got a few beginners right away and in two years she had worked up quite a class meanwhile keeping on with her own studies herself They might have carried the thing through maybe continued Arkwright and never apparently known that the pity existed if it hadn t been for some ugly rumors that suddenly arose attacking the Judge s honesty in an old matter that somebody raked up That was too much Under this last straw their courage broke utterly Alice dismissed every pupil sold almost all their remaining goods they had lots of quite valuable heirlooms I suspect that s where your Lowestoft teapot came in and with the money thus gained they left town Until they could go they scarcely showed themselves once on the street they were never at home to callers and they left without telling one soul where they were going so far as we could ever learn Why the poor dears cried Billy How they must have suffered But things will be different now You ll go to see them of course and At the look that came into Arkwright s face she stopped in surprise You forget they wouldn t wish to see me demurred the man And again Billy noticed the odd constraint in his voice But they wouldn t mind you here argued Billy I m afraid they would In fact I m sure they d refuse entirely to see me Billy s eyes grew determined But they can t refuse if I bring about a meeting just casually you know she challenged Arkwright laughed Well I won t pretend to say as to the consequences of that he rejoined rising to his feet but they might be disastrous Wasn t it you yourself who were telling me a few minutes ago how steely cold Miss Alice s eyes got when she was angry Billy knew by the way the man spoke that for some reason he did not wish to prolong the subject of his meeting the Greggorys She made a quick shift therefore to another phase of the matter But tell me please before you go how did those rumors come out about Judge Greggory s honesty I mean Why I never knew exactly frowned Arkwright musingly Yet it seems too that mother did say in one letter while I was in Paris that some of the accusations had been found to be false and that there was a prospect that the Judge s good name might be saved after all Oh I wish it might sighed Billy Think what it would mean to those women Twould mean everything cried Arkwright warmly and I ll write to mother to night I will and find out just what there is to it if anything Then you can tell them he finished a little stiffly Yes or you nodded Billy lightly And because she began at once to speak of something else the first part of her sentence passed without comment The door had scarcely closed behind Arkwright when Billy turned to Aunt Hannah a beaming face Aunt Hannah did you notice she cried how Mary Jane looked and acted whenever Alice Greggory was spoken of There was something between them I m sure there was and they quarrelled probably Why no dear I didn t see anything unusual murmured the elder lady Well I did And I m going to be the fairy godmother that straightens everything all out too See if I m not They d make a splendid couple Aunt Hannah I m going right down there to morrow Billy my dear exclaimed the more conservative old lady aren t you taking things a little too much for granted Maybe they don t wish for for a fairy godmother Oh they won t know I m a fairy godmother not one of them and of course I wouldn t mention even a hint to anybody laughed Billy I m just going down to get acquainted with the Greggorys that s all Only think Aunt Hannah what they must have suffered And look at the place they re living in now gentlewomen like them Yes yes poor things poor things sighed Aunt Hannah I hope I ll find out that she s really good at teaching I mean the daughter resumed Billy after a moment s pause If she is there s one thing I can do to help anyhow I can get some of Marie s old pupils for her I know some of them haven t begun with a new teacher yet and missus Carleton told me last Friday that neither she nor her sister was at all satisfied with the one their girls have taken They d change I know in a minute at my recommendation that is of course if I can give the recommendation continued Billy with a troubled frown Anyhow I m going down to begin operations to morrow CHAPTER XXI A MATTER OF STRAIGHT BUSINESS True to her assertion Billy went down to the Greggorys the next day This time she did not take Rosa with her Even Aunt Hannah conceded that it would not be necessary She had not been gone ten minutes however when the telephone bell rang and Rosa came to say that mister Bertram Henshaw wanted to speak with missus Stetson Rosa says that Billy s not there called Bertram s aggrieved voice when Aunt Hannah had said Good morning my boy Dear me no Bertram She s in a fever of excitement this morning She ll probably tell you all about it when you come out here to night You are coming out to night aren t you Yes oh yes But what is it Where s she gone Aunt Hannah laughed softly Well she s gone down to the Greggorys The Greggorys What again Oh you might as well get used to it Bertram bantered Aunt Hannah for there ll be a good many agains I fancy Why Aunt Hannah what do you mean Bertram s voice was not quite pleased Oh she ll tell you It s only that the Greggorys have turned out to be old friends of mister Arkwright s Friends of Arkwright s Bertram s voice was decidedly displeased now Yes and there s quite a story to it all as well Billy is wildly excited as you d know she would be You ll hear all about it to night of course Yes of course echoed Bertram But there was no ring of enthusiasm in his voice neither then nor when he said good by a moment later Billy meanwhile on her way to the Greggory home was as Aunt Hannah had said wildly excited It seemed so strange and wonderful and delightful the whole affair that she should have found them because of a Lowestoft teapot that Arkwright should know them and that there should be the chance now that she might help them in some way though this last she knew could be accomplished only through the exercise of the greatest tact and delicacy She had not forgotten that Arkwright had told her of their hatred of pity In the sober second thought of the morning Billy was not sure now of a possible romance in connection with Arkwright and the daughter Alice but she had by no means abandoned the idea and she meant to keep her eyes open and if there should be a chance to bring such a thing about Meanwhile of course she should not mention the matter even to Bertram Just what would be her method of procedure this first morning Billy had not determined The pretty potted azalea in her hand would be excuse for her entrance into the room After that circumstances must decide for themselves missus Greggory was found to be alone at home as before and Billy was glad She would rather begin with one than two she thought The little woman greeted her cordially gave misty eyed thanks for the beautiful plant and also for Billy s kind thoughtfulness Friday afternoon From that she was very skilfully led to talk more of the daughter and soon Billy was getting just the information she wanted information concerning the character aims and daily life of Alice Greggory You see we have some money a very little explained missus Greggory after a time though to get it we have had to sell all our treasures but the Lowestoft with a quick glance into Billy s eyes We need not perhaps live in quite so poor a place but we prefer just now to spend the little money we have for something other than imitation comfort lessons for instance and an occasional concert My daughter is studying even while she is teaching She hopes to train herself for an accompanist and for a teacher She does not aspire to concert solo work She understands her limitations But she is probably very good at teaching Billy hesitated a little She is very good She has the best of recommendations A little proudly missus Greggory gave the names of two Boston pianists names that would carry weight anywhere Unconsciously Billy relaxed She did not know until that moment how she had worried for fear she could not conscientiously recommend this Alice Greggory Of course resumed the mother Alice s pupils are few and they pay low prices but she is gaining She goes to the houses of course She herself practises two hours a day at a house up on Pinckney Street She gives lessons to a little girl in return I see nodded Billy brightly and I ve been thinking missus Greggory maybe I know of some pupils she could get I have a friend who has just given hers up owing to her marriage Sometime soon I m going to talk to your daughter if I may and And here she is right now interposed missus Greggory as the door opened under a hurried hand Billy flushed and bit her lip She was disturbed and disappointed She did not particularly wish to see Alice Greggory just then She wished even less to see her when she noted the swift change that came to the girl s face at sight of herself Oh Why good morning Miss Neilson murmured Miss Greggory with a smile so forced that her mother hurriedly looked to the azalea in search of a possible peacemaker My dear see she stammered what Miss Neilson has brought me And it s so full of blossoms too And she says it ll remain so for a long long time if we ll only keep it wet Alice Greggory murmured a low something a something that she tried evidently very hard to make politely appropriate and appreciative Yet her manner as she took off her hat and coat and sat down so plainly said You are very kind of course but I wish you would keep yourself and your plants at home that missus Greggory began a hurried apology much as if the words had indeed been spoken My daughter is really ill this morning You mustn t mind that is I m afraid you ll think you see she took cold last week a bad cold and she isn t over it yet finished the little woman in painful embarrassment Of course she took cold standing all those hours in that horrid wind Friday cried Billy indignantly A quick red flew to Alice Greggory s face Billy saw it at once and fervently wished she had spoken of anything but that Friday afternoon It looked almost as if she were reminding them of what she had done that day In her confusion and in her anxiety to say something anything that would get their minds off that idea she uttered now the first words that came into her head As it happened they were the last words that sober second thought would have told her to say Never mind missus Greggory We ll have her all well and strong soon never fear Just wait till I send Peggy and Mary Jane to take her out for a drive one of these mild sunny days You have no idea how much good it will do her Alice Greggory got suddenly to her feet Her face was very white now Her eyes had the steely coldness that Billy knew so well Her voice when she spoke was low and sternly controlled Miss Neilson you will think me rude of course especially after your great kindness to me the other day but I can t help it It seems to me best to speak now before it goes any further Alice dear remonstrated missus Greggory extending a frightened hand The girl did not turn her head nor hesitate but she caught the extended hand and held it warmly in both her own with gentle little pats while she went on speaking I m sure mother agrees with me that it is best for the present that we keep quite to ourselves I cannot question your kindness of course after your somewhat unusual favor the other day but I am very sure that your friends Miss Peggy and Miss Mary Jane have no real desire to make my acquaintance nor if you ll pardon me have I under the circumstances any wish to make theirs Oh Alice Alice began the little mother in dismay but a rippling laugh from their visitor brought an angry flush even to her gentle face Billy understood the flush and struggled for self control Please please forgive me she choked But you see you couldn t of course know that Mary Jane and Peggy aren t girls They re just a man and an automobile An unwilling smile trembled on Alice Greggory s lips but she still stood her ground After all girls or men and automobiles Miss Neilson it makes little difference They re charity And it s not so long that we ve been objects of charity that we quite really enjoy it yet There was a moment s hush Billy s eyes had filled with tears I never even thought charity said Billy so gently that a faint red stole into the white cheeks opposite For a tense minute Alice Greggory held herself erect then with a complete change of manner and voice she released her mother s hand dropped into her own chair again and said wearily I know you didn t Miss Neilson It s all my foolish pride of course It s only that I was thinking how dearly I would love to meet girls again just as girls But I no longer have any business with pride of course I shall be pleased I m sure she went on dully to accept anything you may do for us from automobile rides to to red flannel petticoats Billy almost but not quite laughed Still the laugh would have been near to a sob had it been given Surprising as was the quick transition in the girl s manner and absurd as was the juxtaposition of automobiles and red flannel petticoats the white misery of Alice Greggory s face and the weary despair of her attitude were tragic specially to one who knew her story as did Billy Neilson And it was because Billy did know her story that she did not make the mistake now of offering pity Instead she said with a bright smile and a casual manner that gave no hint of studied labor Well as it happens Miss Greggory what I want to day has nothing whatever to do with automobiles or red flannel petticoats It s a matter of straight business How Billy blessed the thought that had so suddenly come to her Your mother tells me you play accompaniments Now a girls club of which I am a member is getting up an operetta for charity and we need an accompanist There is no one in the club who is able and at the same time willing to spend the amount of time necessary for practice and rehearsals So we had decided to hire one outside and I have been given the task of finding one It has occurred to me that perhaps you would be willing to undertake it for us Would you Billy knew at once from the quick change in the other s face and manner that she had taken exactly the right course to relieve the strain of the situation Despair and lassitude fell away from Alice Greggory almost like a garment Her countenance became alert and interested Indeed I would I should be glad to do it Good Then can you come out to my home sometime to morrow and go over the music with me Rehearsals will not begin until next week but I can give you the music and tell you something of what we are planning to do Yes I could come at ten in the morning for an hour or at three in the afternoon for two hours or more replied Miss Greggory after a moment s hesitation Suppose we call it in the afternoon then smiled Billy as she rose to her feet And now I must go and here s my address she finished taking out her card and laying it on the table near her For reasons of her own Billy went away that morning without saying anything more about the proposed new pupils New pupils were not automobile rides nor petticoats to be sure but she did not care to risk disturbing the present interested happiness of Alice Greggory s face by mentioning anything that might be construed as too officious an assistance On the whole Billy felt well pleased with her morning s work To Aunt Hannah upon her return she expressed herself thus It s splendid even better than I hoped I shall have a chance to morrow of course to see for myself just how well she plays and all that I m pretty sure though from what I hear that that part will be all right Then the operetta will give us a chance to see a good deal of her and to bring about a natural meeting between her and Mary Jane Oh Aunt Hannah I couldn t have planned it better and there the whole thing just tumbled into my hands I knew it had the minute I remembered about the operetta You know I m chairman and they left me to get the accompanist and like a flash it came to me when I was wondering what to say or do to get her out of that awful state she was in Ask her to be your accompanist And I did And I m so glad I did Oh Aunt Hannah it s coming out lovely I know it is CHAPTER XXII PLANS AND PLOTTINGS To Billy Alice Greggory s first visit to Hillside was in every way a delight and a satisfaction To Alice it was even more than that For the first time in years she found herself welcomed into a home of wealth culture and refinement as an equal and the frank cordiality and naturalness of her hostess s evident expectation of meeting a congenial companion was like balm to a sensitive soul rendered morbid by long years of superciliousness and snubbing No wonder that under the cheery friendliness of it all Alice Greggory s cold reserve vanished and that in its place came something very like her old ease and charm of manner By the time Aunt Hannah according to previous agreement came into the room the two girls were laughing and chatting over the operetta as if they had known each other for years Much to Billy s delight Alice Greggory as a musician proved to be eminently satisfactory She was quick at sight reading and accurate She played easily and with good expression Particularly was she a good accompanist possessing to a marked degree that happy faculty of accompanying a singer which means that she neither led the way nor lagged behind being always exactly in sympathetic step than which nothing is more soul satisfying to the singer It was after the music for the operetta had been well practised and discussed that Alice Greggory chanced to see one of Billy s own songs lying near her With a pleased smile she picked it up Oh you know this too she cried I played it for a lady only the other day It s so pretty I think all of hers are that I have seen Billy Neilson is a girl you know they say in spite of She stopped abruptly Her eyes grew wide and questioning Miss Neilson it can t be you don t mean is your name it is you she finished joyously as the telltale color dyed Billy s face The next moment her own cheeks burned scarlet And to think of my letting you stand in line for a twenty five cent admission she scorned Nonsense laughed Billy It didn t hurt me any more than it did you Come in looking about for a quick something to take her guest s attention Billy s eyes fell on the manuscript copy of her new song bearing Arkwright s name Yielding to a daring impulse she drew it hastily forward Here s a new one a brand new one not even printed yet Don t you think the words are pretty she asked As she had hoped Alice Greggory s eyes after they had glanced half way through the first page sought the name at the left side below the title Words by M J there was a visible start and a pause before the Arkwright was uttered in a slightly different tone Billy noted both the start and the pause and gloried in them Yes the words are by M J Arkwright she said with smooth unconcern but with a covert glance at the other s face Ever hear of him Alice Greggory gave a short little laugh Probably not this one I used to know an M J Arkwright long ago but he wasn t a poet so far as I know she finished with a little catch in her breath that made Billy long to take her into a warm embrace Alice Greggory turned then to the music She had much to say of this very much but she had nothing more whatever to say of mister M J Arkwright in spite of the tempting conversation bait that Billy dropped so freely After that Rosa brought in tea and toast and the little frosted cakes that were always such a favorite with Billy s guests Then Alice Greggory said good by her eyes full of tears that Billy pretended not to see There breathed Billy as soon as she had Aunt Hannah to herself again What did I tell you Did you see Miss Greggory s start and blush and hear her sigh just over the name of M J Arkwright Just as if Now I want them to meet only it must be casual Aunt Hannah casual And I d rather wait till Mary Jane hears from his mother if possible so if there is anything good to tell the poor girl he can tell it Yes of course Dear child I hope he can murmured Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah had ceased now trying to make Billy refrain from the reprehensible Mary Jane In fact if the truth were known Aunt Hannah herself in her thoughts and sometimes in her words called him Mary Jane But indeed my dear I didn t see anything stiff or or repelling about Miss Greggory as you said there was There wasn t to day smiled Billy Honestly Aunt Hannah I should never have known her for the same girl who showed me the door that first morning she finished merrily as she turned to go up stairs It was the next day that Cyril and Marie came home from their honeymoon They went directly to their pretty little apartment on Beacon Street Brookline within easy walking distance of Billy s own cozy home Cyril intended to build in a year or two Meanwhile they had a very pretty convenient home which was according to Bertram electrified to within an inch of its life and equipped with everything that was fireless smokeless dustless and laborless In it Marie had a spotlessly white kitchen where she might make puddings to her heart s content Marie had again according to Bertram a visiting acquaintance with a maid In other words a stout woman was engaged to come two days in the week to wash iron and scrub also to come in each night to wash the dinner dishes thus leaving Marie s evenings free for the shaded lamp Billy said Marie had not arrived at this to her delightful arrangement of a visiting acquaintance without some opposition from her friends Even Billy had stood somewhat aghast But my dear won t it be hard for you to do so much she argued one day You know you aren t very strong I know but it won t be hard as I ve planned it replied Marie specially when I ve been longing for years to do this very thing Why Billy if I had to stand by and watch a maid do all these things I want to do myself I should feel just like like a hungry man who sees another man eating up his dinner Oh of course she added plaintively after Billy s laughter had subsided I sha n t do it always I don t expect to Of course when we have a house I m not sure then though that I sha n t dress up the maid and order her to receive the calls and go to the pink teas while I make her puddings she finished saucily as Billy began to laugh again The bride and groom as was proper were soon after their arrival invited to dine at both William s and Billy s Then until Marie s At Homes should begin the devoted couple settled down to quiet days by themselves with only occasional visits from the family to interrupt interrupt was Bertram s word not Marie s Though it is safe to say it was not far different from the one Cyril used in his thoughts Bertram himself these days was more than busy Besides working on Miss Winthrop s portrait and on two or three other commissions he was putting the finishing touches to four pictures which he was to show in the exhibition soon to be held by a prominent Art Club of which he was the acknowledged star member Naturally therefore his time was well occupied Naturally too Billy knowing this lashed herself more sternly than ever into a daily reminder of Kate s assertion that he belonged first to his Art In pursuance of this idea Billy was careful to see that no engagement with herself should in any way interfere with the artist s work and that no word of hers should attempt to keep him at her side when ART called Billy always spelled that word now in her mind with tall black letters the way it had sounded when it fell from Kate s lips That these tactics on her part were beginning to fill her lover with vague alarm and a very definite unrest she did not once suspect Eagerly therefore even with conscientious delight she welcomed the new song words that Arkwright brought they would give her something else to take up her time and attention She welcomed them also for another reason they would bring Arkwright more often to the house and this would of course lead to that casual meeting between him and Alice Greggory when the rehearsals for the operetta should commence which would be very soon now And Billy did so long to bring about that meeting To Billy all this was but occupying her mind and playing Cupid s assistant to a worthy young couple torn cruelly apart by an unfeeling fate To Bertram to Bertram it was terror and woe and all manner of torture for in it Bertram saw only a growing fondness on the part of Billy for Arkwright Arkwright s music Arkwright s words and Arkwright s friends The first rehearsal for the operetta came on Wednesday evening There would be another on Thursday afternoon Billy had told Alice Greggory to arrange her pupils so that she could stay Wednesday night at Hillside if the crippled mother could get along alone and she could Alice had said Thursday forenoon therefore Alice Greggory would in all probability be at Hillside specially as there would doubtless be an appointment or two for private rehearsal with some nervous soloist whose part was not progressing well Such being the case Billy had a plan she meant to carry out She was highly pleased therefore when Thursday morning came and everything apparently was working exactly to her mind Alice was there She had an appointment at quarter of eleven with the leading tenor and another later with the alto After breakfast therefore Billy said decisively Now if you please Miss Greggory I m going to put you up stairs on the couch in the sewing room for a nap But I ve just got up remonstrated Miss Greggory I know you have smiled Billy but you were very late to bed last night and you ve got a hard day before you I insist upon your resting You will be absolutely undisturbed there and you must shut the door and not come down stairs till I send for you mister Johnson isn t due till quarter of eleven is he N no Then come with me directed Billy leading the way up stairs There now don t come down till I call you she went on when they had reached the little room at the end of the hall I m going to leave Aunt Hannah s door open so you ll have good air she isn t in there She s writing letters in my room Now here s a book and you may read but I should prefer you to sleep she nodded brightly as she went out and shut the door quietly Then like the guilty conspirator she was she went down stairs to wait for Arkwright It was a fine plan Arkwright was due at ten o clock Billy had specially asked him to come at that hour He would not know of course that Alice Greggory was in the house but soon after his arrival Billy meant to excuse herself for a moment slip up stairs and send Alice Greggory down for a book a pair of scissors a shawl for Aunt Hannah anything would do for a pretext anything so that the girl might walk into the living room and find Arkwright waiting for her alone And then What happened next was in Billy s mind very vague but very attractive as a nucleus for one s thoughts nevertheless All this was indeed a fine plan but If only fine plans would not so often have a but In Billy s case the but had to do with things so apparently unrelated as were Aunt Hannah s clock and a negro s coal wagon The clock struck eleven at half past ten and the wagon dumped itself to destruction directly in front of a trolley car in which sat mister M J Arkwright hurrying to keep his appointment with Miss Billy Neilson It was almost half past ten when Arkwright finally rang the bell at Hillside Billy greeted him so eagerly and at the same time with such evident disappointment at his late arrival that Arkwright s heart sang with joy But there s a rehearsal at quarter of eleven exclaimed Billy in answer to his hurried explanation of the delay and this gives so little time for for so little time you know she finished in confusion casting frantically about in her mind for an excuse to hurry up stairs and send Alice Greggory down before it should be quite too late No wonder that Arkwright noting the sparkle in her eye the agitation in her manner and the embarrassed red in her cheek took new courage For so long had this girl held him at the end of a major third or a diminished seventh for so long had she blithely accepted his every word and act as devotion to music not herself for so long had she done all this that he had come to fear that never would she do anything else No wonder then that now in the soft radiance of the strange new light on her face his own face glowed ardently and that he leaned forward with an impetuous rush of eager words But there is time Miss Billy if you d give me leave to say I m afraid I kept you waiting interrupted the hurried voice of Alice Greggory from the hall doorway I was asleep I think when a clock somewhere striking eleven Why mister Arkwright Not until Alice Greggory had nearly crossed the room did she see that the man standing by her hostess was not the tenor she had expected to find but an old acquaintance Then it was that the tremulous mister Arkwright fell from her lips Billy and Arkwright had turned at her first words At her last Arkwright with a half despairing half reproachful glance at Billy stepped forward Miss Greggory you are Miss Alice Greggory I am sure he said pleasantly At the first opportunity Billy murmured a hasty excuse and left the room To Aunt Hannah she flew with a woebegone face Oh Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah she wailed half laughing half crying that wretched little fib teller of a clock of yours spoiled it all Spoiled it Spoiled what child My first meeting between Mary Jane and Miss Greggory I had it all arranged that they were to have it alone but that miserable little fibber up stairs struck eleven at half past ten and Miss Greggory heard it and thought she was fifteen minutes late So down she hurried half awake and spoiled all my plans Now she s sitting in there with him in chairs the length of the room apart discussing the snowstorm last night or the moonrise this morning or some other such silly thing And I had it so beautifully planned Well well dear I m sorry I m sure smiled Aunt Hannah but I can t think any real harm is done Did Mary Jane have anything to tell her about her father I mean Only the faintest flicker of Billy s eyelid testified that the everyday accustomedness of that Mary Jane on Aunt Hannah s lips had not escaped her No nothing definite Yet there was a little Friends are still trying to clear his name and I believe are meeting with increasing success I don t know of course whether he ll say anything about it to day now To think I had to be right round under foot like that when they met went on Billy indignantly I shouldn t have been in a minute more though I was just trying to think up an excuse to come up and send down Miss Greggory when Mary Jane began to tell me something I haven t the faintest idea what then she appeared and it was all over And there s the doorbell and the tenor I suppose so of course it s all over now she sighed rising to go down stairs As it chanced however it was not the tenor but a message from him a message that brought dire consternation to the Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements The tenor had thrown up his part He could not take it it was too difficult He felt that this should be told at once rather than to worry along for another week or two and then give up So he had told it But what shall we do Miss Greggory appealed Billy It is a hard part you know but if mister Tobey can t take it I don t know who can We don t want to hire a singer for it if we can help it The profits are to go to the Home for Crippled Children you know she explained turning to Arkwright and we decided to hire only the accompanist An odd expression flitted across Miss Greggory s face mister Arkwright used to sing tenor she observed quietly As if he didn t now a perfectly glorious tenor retorted Billy But as if he would take this For only a brief moment did Arkwright hesitate then blandly he suggested Suppose you try him and see Billy sat suddenly erect Would you really Could you take the time and all she cried Yes I think I would under the circumstances he smiled I think I could too though I might not be able to attend all the rehearsals Still if I find I have to ask permission I ll endeavor to convince the powers that be that singing in this operetta will be just the stepping stone I need to success in Grand Opera Oh if you only would take it breathed Billy we d be so glad Well said Arkwright his eyes on Billy s frankly delighted face as I said before under the circumstances I think I would Thank you Then it s all beautifully settled rejoiced Billy with a happy sigh and unconsciously she gave Alice Greggory s hand near her a little pat In Billy s mind the circumstances of Arkwright s acceptance of the part were Alice Greggory and her position as accompanist of course Billy would have been surprised indeed and dismayed had she known that in Arkwright s mind the circumstances were herself and the fact that she too had a part in the operetta necessitating her presence at rehearsals and hinting at a delightful comradeship impossible perhaps otherwise CHAPTER XXIII THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM February came The operetta for which Billy was working so hard was to be given the twentieth The Art Exhibition for which Bertram was preparing his four pictures was to open the sixteenth 
177-55218-0001	train-other-500	with a private view for specially invited friends the evening before On the eleventh day of February missus Greggory and her daughter arrived at Hillside for a ten days visit Not until after a great deal of pleading and argument however had Billy been able to bring this about
177-55218-0002	train-other-500	But my dears both of you Billy had at last said to them just listen We shall have
none	none	 numberless rehearsals during those last ten days before the thing comes off They will be at all hours and of all lengths You Miss Greggory will have to be on hand for them all of course 
177-55218-0003	train-other-500	and will have to stay all night several times probably You missus Greggory
none	none	 ought not to be alone down here There is no sensible valid reason why you should not both come out to the house for those ten days and I shall feel seriously hurt and offended if you do not consent to do it But my pupils Alice Greggory had demurred You can go in town from my home at any time to give your lessons and a little shifting about and arranging for those ten days will enable you to set the hours conveniently one after another I am sure so you can attend to several on one trip Meanwhile your mother will be having a lovely time teaching Aunt Hannah how to knit a new shawl so you won t have to be worrying about her After all 
177-55218-0004	train-other-500	it had been the great good and pleasure which the visit would bring to missus Greggory that had been the final straw to tip the scales On the eleventh of February therefore in the company of the once scorned Peggy and Mary Jane Alice Greggory and her mother had arrived at Hillside
177-55218-0005	train-other-500	Ever since the first meeting of Alice Greggory and Arkwright Billy had been sorely troubled by the conduct of the two young people She had as she mournfully told herself
none	none	 been able to make nothing of it 
177-55218-0006	train-other-500	The two were civility itself to each other but very plainly they were not at ease in each other s company and Billy much to her surprise had to admit that Arkwright did not appear to appreciate the circumstances now that he had them The pair called each other ceremoniously
177-55218-0007	train-other-500	mister Arkwright and Miss Greggory but then that of course did not signify Billy declared to herself I suppose you don t ever call him Mary Jane she said to the girl a little mischievously one day Mary Jane mister Arkwright No I don t
177-55218-0008	train-other-500	rejoined Miss Greggory with an odd smile Then after a moment she added I believe his brothers and sisters used to however Yes I know laughed Billy We thought he was a real Mary Jane once And she told the story of his arrival
177-55218-0009	train-other-500	So you see she finished when Alice Greggory had done laughing over the tale
none	none	 he always will be Mary Jane to us By the way what is his name 
177-55218-0010	train-other-500	Miss Greggory looked up in surprise Why it s She stopped short her eyes questioning Why hasn t he ever told you she queried Billy lifted her chin No
none	none	 He told us to guess it and we have guessed everything we can think of even up to 
177-55218-0011	train-other-500	Methuselah John but he says we haven t hit it yet Methuselah John indeed laughed the other merrily
none	none	 Well I m sure that s a nice solid name defended Billy her chin still at a challenging tilt 
177-55218-0012	train-other-500	If it isn t Methuselah John what is it then But Alice Greggory shook her head She too it seemed could be firm on occasion And though she smiled brightly all she would say was If he hasn t told you I sha n t You ll have to go to him
177-55218-0013	train-other-500	Oh well I can still call him Mary Jane retorted Billy with airy disdain All this however so far as Billy could see was not in the least helping along the cause that had become so dear to her
none	none	 the reuniting of a pair of lovers It occurred to her then one day that perhaps after all they were not lovers and did not wish to be reunited At this disquieting thought Billy decided suddenly to go almost to headquarters She would speak to missus Greggory if ever the opportunity offered Great was her joy therefore when a day or two after the Greggorys arrived at the house missus Greggory s chance reference to Arkwright and her daughter gave Billy the opportunity she sought They used to know each other long ago mister Arkwright tells me Billy began warily 
177-55218-0014	train-other-500	Yes The quietly polite monosyllable was not very encouraging to be sure but Billy secure in her conviction that her cause was a righteous one refused to be daunted I think it was so romantic
177-55218-0015	train-other-500	their running across each other like this missus Greggory she murmured And there was a romance wasn t there I have just felt in my bones that there was a romance Billy held her breath It was what she had meant to say but now that she had said it the words seemed
177-55218-0016	train-other-500	very fearsome indeed to say to missus Greggory Then Billy remembered her Cause and took heart Billy was spelling it now with a capital C For a long minute missus Greggory did not answer for so long a minute
177-55218-0017	train-other-500	that Billy s breath dropped into a fluttering sigh and her Cause became suddenly IMPERTINENCE spelled in black capitals Then missus Greggory spoke slowly a little sadly I don t mind saying to you that I did hope
177-55218-0018	train-other-500	once that there would be a romance there They were the best of friends and they were well suited to each other in tastes and temperament I think indeed that the romance was well under way though there was never an engagement when missus Greggory paused and wet her lips
177-55218-0019	train-other-500	Her voice when she resumed carried the stern note so familiar to Billy in her first acquaintance with this woman and her daughter As I presume mister Arkwright has told you we have met with many changes in our life changes which necessitated a new home and a new mode of living
177-55218-0020	train-other-500	Naturally under those circumstances old friends and old romances must change too But missus Greggory stammered Billy I m sure mister Arkwright would want An up lifted hand silenced her peremptorily
177-55218-0021	train-other-500	mister Arkwright was very kind and a gentleman always interposed the lady coldly but Judge Greggory s daughter would not allow herself to be placed where apologies for her father would be necessary ever There please
177-55218-0022	train-other-500	dear Miss Neilson let us not talk of it any more begged missus Greggory brokenly No indeed of course not cried Billy but her heart rejoiced She understood it all now
177-55218-0023	train-other-500	Arkwright and Alice Greggory had been almost lovers when the charges against the Judge s honor had plunged the family into despairing humiliation Then had come the time when according to Arkwright s own story the two women had shut themselves indoors refused to see their friends and left town as soon as possible
177-55218-0024	train-other-500	Thus had come the breaking of whatever tie there was between Alice Greggory and Arkwright Not to have broken it would have meant for Alice the placing of herself in a position where sometime apologies must be made for her father
none	none	 This was what missus Greggory had meant 
177-55218-0025	train-other-500	and again as Billy thought of it Billy s heart rejoiced
none	none	 Was not her way clear now before her 
177-55218-0026	train-other-500	Did she not have it in her power possibly even probably to bring happiness where only sadness was before As if it would not be a simple thing to rekindle the old flame to make these two estranged hearts beat as one again
177-55218-0027	train-other-500	Not now was the Cause an IMPERTINENCE in tall black letters It was instead a shining beacon in letters of flame guiding straight to victory
177-55218-0028	train-other-500	Billy went to sleep that night making plans for Alice Greggory and Arkwright to be thrown together naturally just as a matter of course you know she said drowsily to herself all in the dark Some three or four miles away down Beacon Street at that moment
177-55218-0029	train-other-500	Bertram Henshaw in the Strata was as it happened not falling asleep He was lying broadly and unhappily awake Bertram very frequently lay broadly and unhappily awake these days or rather nights He told himself on these occasions
none	none	 that it was perfectly natural indeed it was that Billy should be 
177-55218-0030	train-other-500	with Arkwright and his friends the Greggorys so much There were the new songs and the operetta with its rehearsals as a cause for it all At the same time deep within his fearful soul was the consciousness that Arkwright the Greggorys and the operetta were but
177-55218-0031	train-other-500	Music Music the spectre that from the first had dogged his footsteps With Billy s behavior toward himself Bertram could find no fault She was always her sweet loyal lovable self eager to hear of his work
177-55218-0032	train-other-500	earnestly solicitous that it should be a success She even as he sometimes half irritably remembered had once told him that she realized he belonged to Art before he did to himself and when he had indignantly denied this she had only laughed and thrown a kiss at him
none	none	 with the remark that he ought to hear his sister Kate s opinion of that matter 
177-55218-0033	train-other-500	As if he wanted Kate s opinion on that or anything else that concerned him and Billy Once torn by jealousy and exasperated at the frequent interruptions of their quiet hours together he had complained openly Actually Billy it s worse than Marie s wedding he declared
none	none	 Then it was tablecloths and napkins that could be dumped in a chair Now it s a girl who wants to rehearse or a woman that wants a different wig or a telephone message that the sopranos have quarrelled again I loathe that operetta 
177-55218-0034	train-other-500	Billy laughed but she frowned too I know dear I don t like that part I wish they would let me alone when I m with you But as for the operetta it is really a good thing dear and you ll say so when you see it
none	none	 It s going to be a great success 
177-55218-0035	train-other-500	I can say that because my part is only a small one you know We shall make lots of money for the Home too I m sure But you re wearing yourself all out with it dear scowled Bertram
none	none	 Nonsense I like it 
177-55218-0036	train-other-500	besides when I m doing this I m not telephoning you to come and amuse me
none	none	 Just think what a lot of extra time you have for your work Don t want it 
177-55218-0037	train-other-500	avowed Bertram But the work may retorted Billy showing all her dimples
none	none	 Never mind though it ll all be over after the twentieth 
177-55218-0038	train-other-500	This isn t an understudy like Marie s wedding you know she finished demurely Thank heaven for that Bertram had breathed fervently But even as he said the words he grew sick with fear What if after all this were an understudy to what was to come later when Music
177-55218-0039	train-other-500	his rival had really conquered Bertram knew that however secure might seem Billy s affection for himself there was still in his own mind a horrid fear lest underneath that security were an unconscious
none	none	 growing fondness for something he could not give for 
177-55218-0040	train-other-500	some one that he was not a fondness that would one day cause Billy to awake
none	none	 As Bertram in his morbid fancy pictured it he realized only too well what that awakening would mean to himself CHAPTER XXIV THE ARTIST AND HIS ART The private view of the paintings and drawings of the Brush and Pencil Club on the evening of the fifteenth was a great success Society sent its fairest women in frocks that were pictures in themselves Art sent its severest critics and its most ardent devotees The Press sent reporters that the World might know what Art and Society were doing and how they did it Before the canvases signed with Bertram Henshaw s name there was always to be found an admiring group representing both Art and Society with the Press on the outskirts to report William Henshaw coming unobserved upon one such group paused a moment to smile at the various more or less disconnected comments What a lovely blue Marvellous color sense Now those shadows are He gets his high lights so I declare she looks just like Blanche Payton Every line there is full of meaning I suppose it s very fine but Now I say Henshaw is Is this by the man that s painting Margy Winthrop s portrait It s idealism man idealism I m going to have a dress just that shade of blue Isn t that just too sweet Now for realism I consider Henshaw There aren t many with his sensitive brilliant touch Oh what a pretty picture William moved on then Billy was rapturously proud of Bertram that evening He was of course the centre of congratulations and hearty praise At his side Billy with sparkling eyes welcomed each smiling congratulation and gloried in every commendatory word she heard Oh Bertram isn t it splendid I m so proud of you she whispered softly when a moment s lull gave her opportunity They re all words words idle words he laughed but his eyes shone Just as if they weren t all true she bridled turning to greet William who came up at that moment Isn t it fine Uncle William she beamed And aren t we proud of him We are indeed smiled the man But if you and Bertram want to get the real opinion of this crowd you should go and stand near one of his pictures five minutes As a sort of crazy quilt criticism it can t be beat I know laughed Bertram I ve done it in days long gone Bertram not really cried Billy Sure As if every young artist at the first didn t don goggles or a false mustache and study the pictures on either side of his own till he could paint them with his eyes shut And what did you hear demanded the girl What didn t I hear laughed her lover But I didn t do it but once or twice I lost my head one day and began to argue the question of perspective with a couple of old codgers who were criticizing a bit of foreshortening that was my special pet I forgot my goggles and sailed in The game was up then of course and I never put them on again But it was worth a farm to see their faces when I stood discovered as the stage folk say Serves you right sir listening like that scolded Billy Bertram laughed and shrugged his shoulders Well it cured me anyhow I haven t done it since he declared It was some time later on the way home that Bertram said It was gratifying of course Billy and I liked it It would be absurd to say I didn t like the many pleasant words of apparently sincere appreciation I heard to night But I couldn t help thinking of the next time always the next time The next time Billy s eyes were slightly puzzled That I exhibit I mean The Bohemian Ten hold their exhibition next month you know I shall show just one picture the portrait of Miss Winthrop Oh Bertram It ll be Oh Bertram then dear if it isn t a success he sighed I don t believe you realize yet what that thing is going to mean for me Well I should think I might retorted Billy a little tremulously after all I ve heard about it I should think everybody knew you were doing it Bertram Actually I m not sure Marie s scrub lady won t ask me some day how mister Bertram s picture is coming on That s the dickens of it in a way sighed Bertram with a faint smile I am amazed and a little frightened I ll admit at the universality of the interest You see the Winthrops have been pleased to spread it for one reason or another and of course many already know of the failures of Anderson and Fullam That s why if I should fail But you aren t going to fail interposed the girl resolutely No I know I m not I only said if fenced the man his voice not quite steady There isn t going to be any if settled Billy Now tell me when is the exhibition March twentieth the private view mister Winthrop is not only willing but anxious that I show it I wasn t sure that he d want me to in an exhibition But it seems he does His daughter says he has every confidence in the portrait and wants everybody to see it That s where he shows his good sense declared Billy Then with just a touch of constraint she asked And how is the new latest pose coming on Very well I think answered Bertram a little hesitatingly We ve had so many many interruptions though that it is surprising how slow it is moving In the first place Miss Winthrop is gone more than half the time she goes again to morrow for a week and in this portrait I m not painting a stroke without my model before me I mean to take no chances you see and Miss Winthrop is perfectly willing to give me all the sittings I wish for Of course if she hadn t changed the pose and costume so many times it would have been done long ago and she knows it Of course she knows it murmured Billy a little faintly but with a peculiar intonation in her voice And so you see sighed Bertram what the twentieth of March is going to mean for me It s going to mean a splendid triumph asserted Billy and this time her voice was not faint and it carried only a ring of loyal confidence You blessed comforter murmured Bertram giving with his eyes the caress that his lips would so much have preferred to give under more propitious circumstances CHAPTER XXV THE OPERETTA The sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth of February were for Billy and for all concerned in the success of the operetta days of hurry worry and feverish excitement as was to be expected of course Each afternoon and every evening saw rehearsals in whole or in parts A friend of the Club president s sister in law a woman whose husband was stage manager of a Boston theatre had consented to come and coach the performers At her appearance the performers promptly thrown into nervous spasms by this fearsome nearness to the real thing forgot half their cues and conducted themselves generally like frightened school children on piece day much to their own and every one else s despair Then on the evening of the nineteenth came the final dress rehearsal on the stage of the pretty little hall that had been engaged for the performance of the operetta The dress rehearsal like most of its kind was for every one nothing but a nightmare of discord discouragement and disaster Everybody s nerves were on edge everybody was sure the thing would be a flat failure The soprano sang off the key the alto forgot to shriek Beware beware until it was so late there was nothing to beware of the basso stepped on Billy s trailing frock and tore it even the tenor Arkwright himself seemed to have lost every bit of vim from his acting The chorus sang Oh be joyful with dirge like solemnity and danced as if legs and feet were made of wood The lovers after the fashion of amateur actors from time immemorial made love like sticks Billy when the dismal thing had dragged its way through the final note sat down front crying softly in the semi darkness while she was waiting for Alice Greggory to run it through just once more with a pair of tired faced fluffy skirted fairies who could not learn that a duet meant a duet not two solos independently hurried or retarded as one s fancy for the moment dictated To Billy just then life did not look to be even half worth the living Her head ached her throat was going to be sore her shoe hurt and her dress the trailing frock that had been under the basso s foot could not possibly be decently repaired before to morrow night she was sure Bad as these things were however they were only the intimate immediate woes Beyond and around them lay others many others To be sure Bertram and happiness were supposed to be somewhere in the dim and uncertain future but between her and them lay all these other woes chief of which was the unutterable tragedy of to morrow night It was to be a failure of course Billy had calmly made up her mind to that now But then she was used to failures she told herself Was she not plainly failing every day of her life to bring about even friendship between Alice Greggory and Arkwright Did they not emphatically and systematically refuse to be thrown together either naturally or unnaturally And yet whenever again could she expect such opportunities to further her Cause as had been hers the past few weeks through the operetta and its rehearsals Certainly never again It had been a failure like all the rest like the operetta in particular Billy did not mean that any one should know she was crying She supposed that all the performers except herself and the two earth bound fairies by the piano with Alice Greggory were gone She knew that John with Peggy was probably waiting at the door outside and she hoped that soon the fairies would decide to go home and go to bed and let other people do the same For her part she did not see why they were struggling so hard anyway Why needn t they go ahead and sing their duet like two solos if they wanted to As if a little thing like that could make a feather s weight of difference in the grand total of to morrow night s wretchedness when the final curtain should have been rung down on their shame Miss Neilson you aren t crying exclaimed a low voice and Billy turned to find Arkwright standing by her side in the dim light Oh no yes well maybe I was a little stammered Billy trying to speak very unconcernedly How warm it is in here Do you think it s going to rain that is outdoors of course I mean Arkwright dropped into the seat behind Billy and leaned forward his eyes striving to read the girl s half averted face If Billy had turned she would have seen that Arkwright s own face showed white and a little drawn looking in the feeble rays from the light by the piano But Billy did not turn She kept her eyes steadily averted and she went on speaking airy inconsequential words Dear me if those girls would only pull together But then what s the difference I supposed you had gone home long ago mister Arkwright Miss Neilson you are crying Arkwright s voice was low and vibrant As if anything or anybody in the world could make you cry Please you have only to command me and I will sally forth at once to slay the offender His words were light but his voice still shook with emotion Billy gave an hysterical little giggle Angrily she brushed the persistent tears from her eyes All right then I ll dub you my Sir Knight she faltered But I ll warn you you ll have your hands full You ll have to slay my headache and my throat ache and my shoe that hurts and the man who stepped on my dress and and everybody in the operetta including myself Everybody in the operetta Arkwright did look a little startled at this wholesale slaughter Yes Did you ever see such an awful awful thing as that was to night moaned the girl Arkwright s face relaxed Oh so that s what it is he laughed lightly Then it s only a bogy of fear that I ve got to slay after all and I ll despatch that right now with a single blow Dress rehearsals always go like that to night I ve been in a dozen and I never yet saw one go half decent Don t you worry The worse the rehearsal the better the performance every time Billy blinked off the tears and essayed a smile as she retorted Well if that s so then ours to morrow night ought to be a a A corker helped out Arkwright promptly and it will be too You poor child you re worn out and no wonder But don t worry another bit about the operetta Now is there anything else I can do for you Anything else I can slay Billy laughed tremulously N no thank you not that you can slay I fancy she sighed That is not that you will she amended wistfully with a sudden remembrance of the Cause for which he might do so much if he only would Arkwright bent a little nearer His breath stirred the loose curling hair behind Billy s ear His eyes had flashed into sudden fire But you don t know what I d do if I could he murmured unsteadily If you d let me tell you if you only knew the wish that has lain closest to my heart for Miss Neilson please called the despairing voice of one of the earth bound fairies Miss Neilson you are there aren t you Yes I m right here answered Billy wearily Arkwright answered too but not aloud which was wise Oh dear you re tired I know wailed the fairy but if you would please come and help us just a minute Could you Why yes of course Billy rose to her feet still wearily Arkwright touched her arm She turned and saw his face It was very white so white that her eyes widened in surprised questioning As if answering the unspoken words the man shook his head I can t now of course he said But there is something I want to say a story I want to tell you after to morrow perhaps May I To Billy the tremor of his voice the suffering in his eyes and the story he was begging to tell could have but one interpretation Alice Greggory Her face therefore was a glory of tender sympathy as she reached out her hand in farewell Of course you may she cried Come any time after to morrow night please she smiled encouragingly as she turned toward the stage Behind her Arkwright stumbled twice as he walked up the incline toward the outer door stumbled not because of the semi darkness of the little theatre but because of the blinding radiance of a girl s illumined face which he had a moment before read all unknowingly exactly wrong A little more than twenty four hours later Billy Neilson in her own room drew a long breath of relief It was twelve o clock on the night of the twentieth and the operetta was over To Billy life was eminently worth living to night Her head did not ache her throat was not sore her shoe did not hurt her dress had been mended so successfully by Aunt Hannah and with such comforting celerity that long before night one would never have suspected the filmy thing had known the devastating tread of any man s foot Better yet the soprano had sung exactly to key the alto had shrieked Beware to thrilling purpose Arkwright had shown all his old charm and vim and the chorus had been prodigies of joyousness and marvels of lightness Even the lovers had lost their stiffness while the two earth bound fairies of the night before had found so amiable a meeting point that their solos sounded to the uninitiated very like indeed a duet The operetta was in short a glorious and gratifying success both artistically and financially Nor was this all that to Billy made life worth the living Arkwright had begged permission that evening to come up the following afternoon to tell her his story and Billy who was so joyously confident that this story meant the final crowning of her Cause with victory had given happy consent Bertram was to come up in the evening and Billy was anticipating that too particularly it had been so long since they had known a really free comfortable evening together with nothing to interrupt Doubtless too after Arkwright s visit of the afternoon she would be in a position to tell Bertram the story of the suspended romance between Arkwright and Miss Greggory and perhaps something also of her own efforts to bring the couple together again On the whole life did indeed look decidedly worth the living as Billy with a contented sigh turned over to go to sleep CHAPTER XXVI ARKWRIGHT TELLS ANOTHER STORY Promptly at the suggested hour on the day after the operetta Arkwright rang Billy Neilson s doorbell Promptly too Billy herself came into the living room to greet him Billy was in white to day a soft creamy white wool with a touch of black velvet at her throat and in her hair The man thought she had never looked so lovely Arkwright was still under the spell wrought by the soft radiance of Billy s face the two times he had mentioned his story Until the night before the operetta Arkwright had been more than doubtful of the way that story would be received should he ever summon the courage to tell it Since then his fears had been changed to rapturous hopes It was very eagerly therefore that he turned now to greet Billy as she came into the room Suppose we don t have any music to day Suppose we give the whole time up to the story she smiled brightly as she held out her hand Arkwright s heart leaped but almost at once it throbbed with a vague uneasiness He would have preferred to see her blush and be a little shy over that story Still there was a chance of course that she did not know what the story was But if that were the case what of the radiance in her face What of Finding himself in a tangled labyrinth that led apparently only to disappointment and disaster Arkwright pulled himself up with a firm hand You are very kind he murmured as he relinquished her fingers and seated himself near her You are sure then that you wish to hear the story Very sure smiled Billy Arkwright hesitated Again he longed to see a little embarrassment in the bright face opposite Suddenly it came to him however that if Billy knew what he was about to say it would manifestly not be her part to act as if she knew With a lighter heart then he began his story You want it from the beginning By all means I never dip into books nor peek at the ending I don t think it s fair to the author Then I will indeed begin at the beginning smiled Arkwright for I m specially anxious that you shall be even more than fair to me His voice shook a little but he hurried on There s a girl in it a very dear lovely girl Of course if it s a nice story twinkled Billy And there s a man too It s a love story you see Again of course if it s interesting Billy laughed mischievously but she flushed a little Still the man doesn t amount to much after all perhaps I might as well own up at the beginning I m the man That will do for you to say as long as you re telling the story smiled Billy We ll let it pass for proper modesty on your part But I shall say the personal touch only adds to the interest Arkwright drew in his breath We ll hope it ll really be so he murmured There was a moment s silence Arkwright seemed to be hesitating what to say Well prompted Billy with a smile We have the hero and the heroine now what happens next Do you know she added I have always thought that part must bother the story writers to get the couple to doing interesting things after they d got them introduced Arkwright sighed Perhaps on paper but you see my story has been lived so far So it s quite different Very well then what did happen smiled Billy I was trying to think of the first thing You see it began with a picture a photograph of the girl Mother had it I saw it and wanted it and Arkwright had started to say and took it But he stopped with the last two words unsaid It was not time yet he deemed to tell this girl how much that picture had been to him for so many months past He hurried on a little precipitately You see I had heard about this girl a lot and I liked what I heard You mean you didn t know her at the first Billy s eyes were surprised Billy had supposed that Arkwright had always known Alice Greggory No I didn t know the girl till afterwards Before that I was always dreaming and wondering what she would be like Oh Billy subsided into her chair still with the puzzled questioning in her eyes Then I met her Yes And she was everything and more than I had pictured her And you fell in love at once Billy s voice had grown confident again Oh I was already in love sighed Arkwright I simply sank deeper Oh h breathed Billy sympathetically And the girl She didn t care or know for a long time I m not really sure she cares or knows even now Arkwright s eyes were wistfully fixed on Billy s face Oh but you can t tell always about girls murmured Billy hurriedly A faint pink had stolen to her forehead She was thinking of Alice Greggory and wondering if indeed Alice did care and if she Billy might dare to assure this man what she believed to be true that his sweetheart was only waiting for him to come to her and tell her that he loved her Arkwright saw the color sweep to Billy s forehead and took sudden courage He leaned forward eagerly A tender light came to his eyes The expression on his face was unmistakable Billy do you mean really that there is hope for me he begged brokenly Billy gave a visible start A quick something like shocked terror came to her eyes She drew back and would have risen to her feet had the thought not come to her that twice before she had supposed a man was making love to her when subsequent events proved that she had been mortifyingly mistaken once when Cyril had told her of his love for Marie and again when William had asked her to come back as a daughter to the house she had left desolate Telling herself sternly now not to be for the third time a foolish little simpleton she summoned all her wits forced a cheery smile to her lips and said Well really mister Arkwright of course I can t answer for the girl so I m not the one to give hope and But you are the one interrupted the man passionately You re the only one As if from the very first I hadn t loved you and No no not that not that I m mistaken I m not understanding what you mean pleaded a horror stricken voice Billy was on her feet now holding up two protesting hands palms outward Miss Neilson you don t mean that you haven t known all this time that it was you The man now was on his feet his eyes hurt and unbelieving looking into hers Billy paled She began slowly to back away Her eyes still fixed on his carried the shrinking terror of one who sees a horrid vision But you know you must know that I am not yours to win she reproached him sharply I m to be Bertram Henshaw s wife From Billy s shocked young lips the word dropped with a ringing force that was at once accusatory and prohibitive It was as if by the mere utterance of the word wife she had drawn a sacred circle about her and placed herself in sanctuary From the blazing accusation in her eyes Arkwright fell back Wife You are to be Bertram Henshaw s wife he exclaimed There was no mistaking the amazed incredulity on his face Billy caught her breath The righteous indignation in her eyes fled and a terrified appeal took its place You don t mean that you didn t know she faltered There was a moment s silence A power quite outside herself kept Billy s eyes on Arkwright s face and forced her to watch the change there from unbelief to belief and from belief to set misery No I did not know said the man then dully as he turned rested his arm on the mantel behind him and half shielded his face with his hand Billy sank into a low chair Her fingers fluttered nervously to her throat Her piteous beseeching eyes were on the broad back and bent head of the man before her But I I don t see how you could have helped knowing she stammered at last I don t see how such a thing could have happened that you shouldn t know I ve been trying to think myself returned the man still in a dull emotionless voice It s been so so much a matter of course I supposed everybody knew it maintained Billy Perhaps that s just it that it was so much a matter of course rejoined the man You see I know very few of your friends anyway who would be apt to mention it to me But the announcements oh you weren t here then moaned Billy But you must have known that that he came here a good deal that we were together so much To a certain extent yes sighed Arkwright But I took your friendship with him and his brothers as as a matter of course That was my matter of course you see he went on bitterly I knew you were mister William Henshaw s namesake and Calderwell had told me the story of your coming to them when you were left alone in the world Calderwell had said too that Arkwright paused then hurried on a little constrainedly well he said something that led me to think mister Bertram Henshaw was not a marrying man anyway Billy winced and changed color She had noticed the pause and she knew very well what it was that Calderwell had said to occasion that pause Must always she be reminded that no one expected Bertram Henshaw to love any girl except to paint But but mister Calderwell must know about the engagement now she stammered Very likely but I have not happened to hear from him since my arrival in Boston We do not correspond There was a long silence then Arkwright spoke again I think I understand now many things I wonder I did not see them before but I never thought of Bertram Henshaw s being If Calderwell hadn t said Again Arkwright stopped with his sentence half complete and again Billy winced I ve been a blind fool I was so intent on my own I ve been a blind fool that s all repeated Arkwright with a break in his voice Billy tried to speak but instead of words there came only a choking sob Arkwright turned sharply Miss Neilson don t please he begged There is no need that you should suffer too But I am so ashamed that such a thing could happen she faltered I m sure some way I must be to blame But I never thought I was blind too I was wrapped up in my own affairs I never suspected I never even thought to suspect I thought of course you knew It was just the music that brought us together I supposed and you were just like one of the family anyway I always thought of you as Aunt Hannah s She stopped with a vivid blush As Aunt Hannah s niece Mary Jane of course supplied Arkwright bitterly turning back to his old position And that was my own fault too My name Miss Neilson is Michael Jeremiah he went on wearily after a moment s hesitation his voice showing his utter abandonment to despair When a boy at school I got heartily sick of the Mike and the Jerry and the even worse Tom and Jerry that my young friends delighted in so as soon as possible I sought obscurity and peace in M J Much to my surprise and annoyance the initials proved to be little better for they became at once the biggest sort of whet to people s curiosity Naturally the more determined persistent inquirers were to know the name the more determined I became that they shouldn t All very silly and very foolish of course Certainly it seems so now he finished Billy was silent She was trying to find something anything to say when Arkwright began speaking again still in that dull hopeless voice that Billy thought would break her heart As for the Mary Jane that was another foolishness of course My small brothers and sisters originated it others followed on occasion even Calderwell Perhaps you did not know but he was the friend who by his laughing question Why don t you Mary Jane put into my head the crazy scheme of writing to Aunt Hannah and letting her think I was a real Mary Jane You see what I stooped to do Miss Neilson for the chance of meeting and knowing you Billy gave a low cry She had suddenly remembered the beginning of Arkwright s story For the first time she realized that he had been talking then about herself not Alice Greggory But you don t mean that you cared that I was the She could not finish Arkwright turned from the mantel with a gesture of utter despair Yes I cared then I had heard of you I had sung your songs I was determined to meet you So I came and met you After that I was more determined than ever to win you Perhaps you see now why I was so blind to to any other possibility But it doesn t do any good to talk like this I understand now Only please don t blame yourself he begged as he saw her eyes fill with tears The next moment he was gone Billy had turned away and was crying softly so she did not see him go CHAPTER XXVII THE THING THAT WAS THE TRUTH Bertram called that evening Billy had no story now to tell nothing of the interrupted romance between Alice Greggory and Arkwright Billy carefully indeed avoided mentioning Arkwright s name Ever since the man s departure that afternoon Billy had been frantically trying to assure herself that she was not to blame that she would not be supposed to know he cared for her that it had all been as he said it was his foolish blindness But even when she had partially comforted herself by these assertions she could not by any means escape the haunting vision of the man s stern set suffering face as she had seen it that afternoon nor could she keep from weeping at the memory of the words he had said and at the thought that never again could their pleasant friendship be quite the same if indeed there could be any friendship at all between them But if Billy expected that her red eyes pale cheeks and generally troubled appearance and unquiet manner were to be passed unnoticed by her lover s keen eyes that evening she found herself much mistaken Sweetheart what is the matter demanded Bertram resolutely at last when his more indirect questions had been evasively turned aside You can t make me think there isn t something the trouble because I know there is Well then there is dear smiled Billy tearfully but please just don t let us talk of it I I want to forget it Truly I do But I want to know so I can forget it persisted Bertram What is it Maybe I could help She shook her head with a little frightened cry No no you can t help really But sweetheart you don t know Perhaps I could Won t you tell me about it Billy looked distressed I can t dear truly You see it isn t quite mine to tell Not yours Not entirely But it makes you feel bad Yes very Then can t I know that part Oh no no indeed no You see it wouldn t be fair to the other Bertram stared a little Then his mouth set into stern lines Billy what are you talking about Seems to me I have a right to know Billy hesitated To her mind a girl who would tell of the unrequited love of a man for herself was unspeakably base To tell Bertram Arkwright s love story was therefore impossible Yet in some way she must set Bertram s mind at rest Dearest she began slowly her eyes wistfully pleading just what it is I can t tell you In a way it s another s secret and I don t feel that I have the right to tell it It s just something that I learned this afternoon But it has made you cry Yes It made me feel very unhappy Then it was something you couldn t help To Bertram s surprise the face he was watching so intently flushed scarlet No I couldn t help it now though I might have once Billy spoke this last just above her breath Then she went on beseechingly Bertram please please don t talk of it any more It it s just spoiling our happy evening together Bertram bit his lip and drew a long sigh All right dear you know best of course since I don t know anything about it he finished a little stiffly Billy began to talk then very brightly of Aunt Hannah and her shawls and of a visit she had made to Cyril and Marie that morning And do you know Aunt Hannah s clock has done a good turn at last and justified its existence Listen she cried gayly Marie had a letter from her mother s Cousin Jane Cousin Jane couldn t sleep nights because she was always lying awake to find out just what time it was so Marie had written her about Aunt Hannah s clock And now this Cousin Jane has fixed her clock and she sleeps like a top just because she knows there ll never be but half an hour that she doesn t know what time it is Bertram smiled and murmured a polite Well I m sure that s fine but the words were plainly abstracted and the frown had not left his brow Nor did it quite leave till some time later when Billy in answer to a question of his about another operetta cried with a shudder Mercy I hope not dear I don t want to hear the word operetta again for a year Bertram smiled then broadly He too would be quite satisfied not to hear the word operetta for a year Operetta to Bertram meant interruptions interferences and the constant presence of Arkwright the Greggorys and innumerable creatures who wished to rehearse or to change wigs all of which Bertram abhorred No wonder therefore that he smiled and that the frown disappeared from his brow He thought he saw ahead serene blissful days for Billy and himself As the days however began to pass one by one Bertram Henshaw found them to be anything but serene and blissful The operetta with its rehearsals and its interruptions was gone certainly but he was becoming seriously troubled about Billy Billy did not act natural Sometimes she seemed like her old self and he breathed more freely telling himself that his fears were groundless Then would come the haunting shadow to her eyes the droop to her mouth and the nervousness to her manner that he so dreaded Worse yet all this seemed to be connected in some strange way with Arkwright He found this out by accident one day She had been talking and laughing brightly about something when he chanced to introduce Arkwright s name By the way where is Mary Jane these days he asked then I don t know I m sure He hasn t been here lately murmured Billy reaching for a book on the table At a peculiar something in her voice he had looked up quickly only to find to his great surprise that her face showed a painful flush as she bent over the book in her hand He had said nothing more at the time but he had not forgotten Several times after that he had introduced the man s name and never had it failed to bring a rush of color a biting of the lip or a quick change of position followed always by the troubled eyes and nervous manner that he had learned to dread He noticed then that never of her own free will did she herself mention the man never did she speak of him with the old frank lightness as Mary Jane By casual questions asked from time to time Bertram had learned that Arkwright never came there now and that the song writing together had been given up Curiously enough this discovery which would once have filled Bertram with joy served now only to deepen his distress That there was anything inconsistent in the fact that he was more frightened now at the man s absence than he had been before at his presence did not occur to him He knew only that he was frightened and badly frightened Bertram had not forgotten the evening after the operetta and Billy s tear stained face on that occasion He dated the whole thing in fact from that evening He fell to wondering one day if that too had anything to do with Arkwright He determined then to find out Shamelessly for the good of the cause he set a trap for Billy s unwary feet Very adroitly one day he led the talk straight to Arkwright then he asked abruptly Where is the chap I wonder Why he hasn t shown up once since the operetta has he Billy always truthful and just now always embarrassed when Arkwright s name was mentioned walked straight into the trap Oh yes well he was here once the day after the operetta I haven t seen him since Bertram answered a light something but his face grew a little white Now that the trap had been sprung and the victim caught he almost wished that he had not set any trap at all He knew now it was true Arkwright had been with Billy the day after the operetta and her tears and her distress that evening had been caused by something Arkwright had said It was Arkwright s secret that she could not tell It was Arkwright to whom she must be fair It was Arkwright s sorrow that she could not help now Naturally with these tools in his hands and aided by days of brooding and nights of sleeplessness it did not take Bertram long to fashion The Thing that finally loomed before him as The Truth He understood it all now Music had conquered Billy and Arkwright had found that they loved each other On the day after the operetta they had met and had had some sort of scene together doubtless Arkwright had declared his love That was the secret that Billy could not tell and be fair Billy of course loyal little soul that she was had sent him away at once Was her hand not already pledged That was why she could not help it now Bertram writhed in agony at the thought Since that meeting Arkwright had not been near the house Billy had found however that her heart had gone with Arkwright hence the shadow in her eyes the nervousness in her manner and the embarrassment that she always showed at the mention of his name That Billy was still outwardly loyal to himself and that she still kept to her engagement did not surprise Bertram in the least That was like Billy Bertram had not forgotten how less than a year before this same Billy had held herself loyal and true to an engagement with William because a wretched mistake all around had caused her to give her promise to be William s wife under the impression that she was carrying out William s dearest wish Bertram remembered her face as it had looked all those long summer days while her heart was being slowly broken and he thought he could see that same look in her eyes now All of which only goes to prove with what woeful skill Bertram had fashioned this Thing that was looming before him as The Truth The exhibition of The Bohemian Ten was to open with a private view on the evening of the twentieth of March Bertram Henshaw s one contribution was to be his portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop the piece of work that had come to mean so much to him the piece of work upon which already he felt the focus of multitudes of eyes Miss Winthrop was in Boston now and it was during these early March days that Bertram was supposed to be putting in his best work on the portrait but unfortunately it was during these same early March days that he was engaged also in fashioning The Thing and the two did not harmonize The Thing indeed was a jealous creature and would brook no rival She filled his eyes with horrid visions and his brain with sickening thoughts Between him and his model she flung a veil of fear and she set his hand to trembling and his brush to making blunders with the paints on his palette Bertram saw The Thing and saw too the grievous result of her presence Despairingly he fought against her and her work but The Thing had become full grown now and was The Truth Hence she was not to be banished She even in a taunting way seemed sometimes to be justifying her presence for she reminded him After all what s the difference What do you care for this or anything again if Billy is lost to you But the artist told himself fiercely that he did care that he must care for his work and he struggled how he struggled to ignore the horrid visions and the sickening thoughts and to pierce the veil of fear so that his hand might be steady and his brush regain its skill And so he worked Sometimes he let his work remain Sometimes one hour saw only the erasing of what the hour before had wrought Sometimes the elusive something in Marguerite Winthrop s face seemed right at the tip of his brush on the canvas even He saw success then so plainly that for a moment it almost but not quite blotted out The Thing At other times that elusive something on the high bred face of his model was a veritable will o the wisp refusing to be caught and held even in his eye The artist knew then that his picture would be hung with Anderson s and Fullam s But the portrait was irrefutably nearing completion and it was to be exhibited the twentieth of the month Bertram knew these for facts CHAPTER XXVIII BILLY TAKES HER TURN If for Billy those first twenty days of March did not carry quite the tragedy they contained for Bertram they were nevertheless not really happy ones She was vaguely troubled by a curious something in Bertram s behavior that she could not name she was grieved over Arkwright s sorrow and she was constantly probing her own past conduct to see if anywhere she could find that she was to blame for that sorrow She missed too undeniably Arkwright s cheery presence and the charm and inspiration of his music Nor was she finding it easy to give satisfactory answers to the questions Aunt Hannah William and Bertram so often asked her as to where Mary Jane was Even her music was little comfort to her these days She was not writing anything There was no song in her heart to tempt her to write Arkwright s new words that he had brought her were out of the question of course They had been put away with the manuscript of the completed song which had not fortunately gone to the publishers Billy had waited intending to send them together She was so glad now that she had waited Just once since Arkwright s last call she had tried to sing that song But she had stopped at the end of the first two lines The full meaning of those words as coming from Arkwright had swept over her then and she had snatched up the manuscript and hidden it under the bottom pile of music in her cabinet And she had presumed to sing that love song to Bertram Arkwright had written Billy once a kind courteous manly note that had made her cry He had begged her again not to blame herself and he had said that he hoped he should be strong enough sometime to wish to call occasionally if she were willing and renew their pleasant hours with their music but for the present he knew there was nothing for him to do but to stay away He had signed himself Michael Jeremiah Arkwright and to Billy that was the most pathetic thing in the letter it sounded so hopeless and dreary to one who knew the jaunty M J Alice Greggory Billy saw frequently Billy and Aunt Hannah were great friends with the Greggorys now and had been ever since the Greggorys ten days visit at Hillside The cheery little cripple with the gentle tap tap tap of her crutches had won everybody s heart the very first day and Alice was scarcely less of a favorite after the sunny friendliness of Hillside had thawed her stiff reserve into naturalness Billy had little to say to Alice Greggory of Arkwright Billy was no longer trying to play Cupid s assistant The Cause for which she had so valiantly worked had been felled by Arkwright s own hand but that there were still some faint stirrings of life in it was evidenced by Billy s secret delight when one day Alice Greggory chanced to mention that Arkwright had called the night before upon her and her mother He brought us news of our old home she explained a little hurriedly to Billy He had heard from his mother and he thought some things she said would be interesting to us Of course murmured Billy carefully excluding from her voice any hint of the delight she felt but hoping all the while that Alice would continue the subject Alice however had nothing more to say and Billy was left in entire ignorance of what the news was that Arkwright had brought She suspected though that it had something to do with Alice s father certainly she hoped that it had for if Arkwright had called to tell it it must be good Billy had found a new home for the Greggorys although at first they had drawn sensitively back and had said that they preferred to remain where they were they had later gratefully accepted it A little couple from South Boston to whom Billy had given a two weeks outing the summer before had moved into town and taken a flat in the South End They had two extra rooms which they had told Billy they would like to let for light house keeping if only they knew just the right people to take into such close quarters with themselves Billy at once thought of the Greggorys and spoke of them The little couple were delighted and the Greggorys were scarcely less so when they at last became convinced that only a very little more money than they were already paying would give themselves a much pleasanter home and would at the same time be a real boon to two young people who were trying to meet expenses So the change was made and general happiness all round had resulted so much so that Bertram had said to Billy when he heard of it It looks as if this was a case where your cake is frosted on both sides Nonsense This isn t frosting it s business Billy had laughed And the new pupils you have found for Miss Alice they re business too I suppose Certainly retorted Billy with decision Then she had given a low laugh and said Mercy If Alice Greggory thought it was anything but business I verily believe she would refuse every one of the new pupils and begin to night to carry back the tables and chairs herself to those wretched rooms she left last month Bertram had smiled but the smile had been a fleeting one and the brooding look of gloom that Billy had noticed so frequently of late had come back to his eyes Billy was not a little disturbed over Bertram these days He did not seem to be his natural cheery self at all He talked little and what he did say seldom showed a trace of his usually whimsical way of putting things He was kindness itself to her and seemed particularly anxious to please her in every way but she frequently found his eyes fixed on her with a sombre questioning that almost frightened her The more she thought of it the more she wondered what the question was that he did not dare to ask and whether it was of herself or himself that he would ask it if he did dare Then with benumbing force one day a possible solution of the mystery came to her he had found out that it was true what all his friends had declared of him he did not really love any girl except to paint The minute this thought came to her Billy thrust it indignantly away It was disloyal to Bertram and unworthy of herself even to think such a thing She told herself then that it was only the portrait of Miss Winthrop that was troubling him She knew that he was worried over that He had confessed to her that actually sometimes he was beginning to fear his hand had lost its cunning As if that were not enough to bring the gloom to any man s face to any artist s No sooner however had Billy arrived at this point in her mental argument than a new element entered her old lurking jealousy of which she was heartily ashamed but which she had never yet been able quite to subdue her jealousy of the beautiful girl with the beautiful name not Billy whose portrait had needed so much time and so many sittings to finish What if Bertram had found that he loved her What if that were why his hand had lost its cunning because though loving her he realized that he was bound to another Billy herself This thought too Billy cast from her at once as again disloyal and unworthy But both thoughts having once entered her brain had made for themselves roads over which the second passing was much easier than the first as Billy found to her sorrow Certainly as the days went by and as Bertram s face and manner became more and more a tragedy of suffering Billy found it increasingly difficult to keep those thoughts from wearing their roads of suspicion into horrid deep ruts of certainty Only with William and Marie now could Billy escape from it all With William she sought new curios and catalogued the old With Marie she beat eggs and whipped cream in the shining kitchen and tried to think that nothing in the world mattered except that the cake in the oven should not fall CHAPTER XXIX KATE WRITES A LETTER Bertram feared that he knew before the portrait was hung that it was a failure He was sure that he knew it on the evening of the twentieth when he encountered the swiftly averted eyes of some of his artist friends and saw the perplexed frown on the faces of others But he knew afterwards that he did not really know it till he read the newspapers during the next few days There was praise oh yes the faint praise that kills There was some adverse criticism too but it was of the light insincere variety that is given to mediocre work by unimportant artists Then here and there appeared the signed critiques of the men whose opinion counted and Bertram knew that he had failed Neither as a work of art nor as a likeness was the portrait the success that Henshaw s former work would seem to indicate that it should have been Indeed as one caustic pen put it if this were to be taken as a sample of what was to follow then the famous originator of The Face of a Girl had a most distinguished future behind him Seldom if ever before had an exhibited portrait attracted so much attention As Bertram had said uncounted eyes were watching for it before it was hung because it was a portrait of the noted beauty Marguerite Winthrop and because two other well known artists had failed where he Bertram Henshaw was hoping to succeed After it was hung and the uncounted eyes had seen it either literally or through the eyes of the critics interest seemed rather to grow than to lessen for other uncounted eyes wanted to see what all the fuss was about anyway And when these eyes had seen their owners talked Nor did they by any means all talk against the portrait Some were as loud in its praise as were others in its condemnation all of which of course but helped to attract more eyes to the cause of it all For Bertram and his friends these days were naturally trying ones William finally dreaded to open his newspaper It had become the fashion when murders and divorces were scarce occasionally to feature somebody s opinion of the Henshaw portrait on the first page something that had almost never been known to happen before Cyril according to Marie played perfectly awful things on his piano every day now Aunt Hannah had said Oh my grief and conscience so many times that it melted now into a wordless groan whenever a new unfriendly criticism of the portrait met her indignant eyes Of all Bertram s friends Billy perhaps not unnaturally was the angriest Not only did she after a time refuse to read the papers but she refused even to allow certain ones to be brought into the house foolish and unreasonable as she knew this to be As to the artist himself Bertram s face showed drawn lines and his eyes sombre shadows but his words and manner carried a stolid indifference that to Billy was at once heartbreaking and maddening But Bertram why don t you do something Why don t you say something Why don t you act something she burst out one day The artist shrugged his shoulders But my dear what can I say or do or act he asked I don t know of course sighed Billy But I know what I d like to do I should like to go out and fight somebody So fierce were words and manner coupled as they were with a pair of gentle eyes ablaze and two soft little hands doubled into menacing fists that Bertram laughed What a fiery little champion it is to be sure he said tenderly But as if fighting could do any good in this case Billy s tense muscles relaxed Her eyes filled with tears No I don t suppose it would she choked beginning to cry so that Bertram had to turn comforter Come come dear he begged don t take it so to heart It s not so bad after all I ve still my good right hand left and we ll hope there s something in it yet that ll be worth while But this one isn t bad stormed Billy It s splendid I m sure I think it s a b beautiful portrait and I don t see what people mean by talking so about it Bertram shook his head His eyes grew sombre again Thank you dear But I know and you know really that it isn t a splendid portrait I ve done lots better work than that Then why don t they look at those and let this alone wailed Billy with indignation Because I deliberately put up this for them to see smiled the artist wearily Billy sighed and twisted in her chair What does mister Winthrop say she asked at last in a faint voice Bertram lifted his head mister Winthrop s been a trump all through dear He s already insisted on paying for this and he s ordered another Another Yes The old fellow never minces his words as you may know He came to me one day put his hand on my shoulder and said tersely Will you give me another same terms Go in boy and win Show em I lost the first ten thousand I made I didn t the next That s all he said Before I could even choke out an answer he was gone Gorry talk about his having a heart of stone I don t believe another man in the country would have done that and done it in the way he did in the face of all this talk finished Bertram his eyes luminous with feeling Billy hesitated Perhaps his daughter influenced him some Perhaps nodded Bertram She too has been very kind all the way through Billy hesitated again But I thought it was going so splendidly she faltered in a half stifled voice So it was at the first Then what ailed it at the last do you suppose Billy was holding her breath till he should answer The man got to his feet Billy don t don t ask me he begged Please don t let s talk of it any more It can t do any good I just flunked that s all My hand failed me Maybe I tried too hard Maybe I was tired Maybe something troubled me Never mind dear what it was It can do no good even to think of that now So just let s drop it please dear he finished his face working with emotion And Billy dropped it so far as words were concerned but she could not drop it from her thoughts specially after Kate s letter came Kate s letter was addressed to Billy and it said after speaking of various other matters And now about poor Bertram s failure Billy frowned In Billy s presence no one was allowed to say Bertram s failure but a letter has a most annoying privilege of saying what it pleases without let or hindrance unless one tears it up and a letter destroyed unread remains always such a tantalizing mystery of possibilities So Billy let the letter talk Of course we have heard of it away out here I do wish if Bertram must paint such famous people he would manage to flatter them up in the painting I mean of course enough so that it might pass for a success The technical part of all this criticism I don t pretend to understand in the least but from what I hear and read he must indeed have made a terrible mess of it and of course I m very sorry and some surprised too for usually he paints such pretty pictures Still on the other hand Billy I m not surprised William says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over something and as gloomy as an owl for weeks past and of course under those circumstances the poor boy could not be expected to do good work Now William being a man is not supposed to understand what the trouble is But I being a woman can see through a pane of glass when it s held right up before me and I can guess of course that a woman is at the bottom of it she always is and that you being his special fancy at the moment Billy almost did tear the letter now but not quite are that woman Now Billy you don t like such frank talk of course but on the other hand I know you do not want to ruin the dear boy s career So for heaven s sake if you two have been having one of those quarrels that lovers so delight in do please for the good of the cause make up quick or else quarrel harder and break it off entirely which honestly would be the better way I think all around There there my dear child don t bristle up I am very fond of you and would dearly love to have you for a sister if you d only take William as you should But as you very well know I never did approve of this last match at all for either of your sakes He can t make you happy my dear and you can t make him happy Bertram never was and never will be a marrying man He s too temperamental too thoroughly wrapped up in his Art Girls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint And they never will They can t He s made that way Listen I can prove it to you Up to this winter he s always been a care free happy jolly fellow and you know what beautiful work he has done Never before has he tied himself to any one girl till last fall Then you two entered into this absurd engagement Now what has it been since William wrote me himself not a fortnight ago that he d been worried to death over Bertram for weeks past he s been so moody so irritable so fretted over his work so unlike himself And his picture has failed dismally Of course William doesn t understand but I do I know you ve probably quarrelled or something You know how flighty and unreliable you can be sometimes Billy and I don t say that to mean anything against you either that s your way You re just as temperamental in your art music as Bertram is in his You re utterly unsuited to him If Bertram is to marry anybody it should be some quiet staid sensible girl who would be a help to him But when I think of you two flyaway flutterbudgets marrying Now for heaven s sake Billy do make up or something and do it now Don t for pity s sake let Bertram ever put out another such a piece of work to shame us all like this Do you want to ruin his career Faithfully yours KATE HARTWELL P S I think William s the one for you He s devoted to you and his quiet sensible affection is just what your temperament needs I always thought William was the one for you Think it over P S No two You can see by the above that it isn t you I m objecting to my dear It s just you and Bertram K CHAPTER XXX I VE HINDERED HIM Billy was shaking with anger and terror by the time she had finished reading Kate s letter Anger was uppermost at the moment and with one sweeping wrench of her trembling fingers she tore the closely written sheets straight through the middle and flung them into the little wicker basket by her desk Then she went down stairs and played her noisiest merriest Tarantella and tried to see how fast she could make her fingers fly But Billy could not of course play tarantellas all day and even while she did play them she could not forget that waste basket up stairs and the horror it contained The anger was still uppermost but the terror was prodding her at every turn and demanding to know just what it was that Kate had written in that letter anyway It is not strange then perhaps that before two hours passed Billy went up stairs took the letter from the basket matched together the torn half sheets and forced her shrinking eyes to read every word again just to satisfy that terror which would not be silenced At the end of the second reading Billy reminded herself with stern calmness that it was only Kate after all that nobody ought to mind what Kate said that certainly she Billy ought not after the experience she had already had with her unpleasant interference Kate did not know what she was talking about anyway This was only another case of her trying to manage She did so love to manage everything At this point Billy got out her pen and paper and wrote to Kate It was a formal cold little letter not at all the sort that Billy s friends usually received It thanked Kate for her advice and for her kind willingness to have Billy for a sister but it hinted that perhaps Kate did not realize that as long as Billy was the one who would have to live with the chosen man it would be pleasanter to take the one Billy loved which happened in this case to be Bertram not William As for any quarrel being the cause of whatever fancied trouble there was with the new picture the letter scouted that idea in no uncertain terms There had been no suggestion of a quarrel even once since the engagement Then Billy signed her name and took the letter out to post immediately For the first few minutes after the letter had been dropped into the green box at the corner Billy held her head high and told herself that the matter was now closed She had sent Kate a courteous dignified conclusive effectual answer and she thought with much satisfaction of the things she had said Very soon however she began to think not so much of what she had said but of what Kate had said Many of Kate s sentences were unpleasantly vivid in her mind They seemed indeed to stand out in letters of flame and they began to burn and burn and burn These were some of them William says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over something and as gloomy as an owl for weeks past A woman is at the bottom of it you are that woman You can t make him happy Bertram never was and never will be a marrying man Girls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint And they never will Up to this winter he s always been a carefree happy jolly fellow and you know what beautiful work he has done Never before has he tied himself to any one girl until last fall Now what has it been since He s been so moody so irritable so fretted over his work so unlike himself and his picture has failed dismally Do you want to ruin his career Billy began to see now that she had not really answered Kate s letter at all The matter was not closed Her reply had been perhaps courteous and dignified but it had not been conclusive nor effectual Billy had reached home now and she was crying Bertram had acted strangely of late Bertram had seemed troubled over something His picture had With a little shudder Billy tossed aside these thoughts and dug at her teary eyes with a determined hand Fiercely she told herself that the matter was settled Very scornfully she declared that it was only Kate after all and that she would not let Kate make her unhappy again Forthwith she picked up a current magazine and began to read As it chanced however even here Billy found no peace for the first article she opened to was headed in huge black type MARRIAGE AND THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT With a little cry Billy flung the magazine far from her and picked up another But even The Elusiveness of Chopin which she found here could not keep her thoughts nor her eyes from wandering to the discarded thing in the corner lying ignominiously face down with crumpled out flung leaves Billy knew that in the end she should go over and pick that magazine up and read that article from beginning to end She was not surprised therefore when she did it but she was not any the happier for having done it The writer of the article did not approve of marriage and the artistic temperament He said the artist belonged to his Art and to posterity through his Art The essay fairly bristled with many lettered words and high sounding phrases few of which Billy really understood She did understand enough however to feel guiltily when the thing was finished that already she had married Bertram and by so doing had committed a Crime She had slain Art stifled Ambition destroyed Inspiration and been a nuisance generally In consequence of which Bertram would henceforth and forevermore be doomed to Littleness Naturally in this state of mind and with this vision before her Billy was anything but her bright easy self when she met Bertram an hour or two later Naturally too Bertram still the tormented victim of the bugaboo his jealous fears had fashioned was just in the mood to place the worst possible construction on his sweetheart s very evident unhappiness With sighs unspoken questions and frequently averted eyes therefore the wretched evening passed a pitiful misery to them both During the days that followed Billy thought that the world itself must be in league with Kate so often did she encounter Kate s letter masquerading under some thin disguise She did not stop to realize that because she was so afraid she would find it she did find it In the books she read in the plays she saw in the chance words she heard spoken by friend or stranger always there was something to feed her fears in one way or another Even in a yellowed newspaper that had covered the top shelf in her closet she found one day a symposium on whether or not an artist s wife should be an artist and she shuddered but she read every opinion given Some writers said no and some yes and some said it all depended on the artist and his wife Billy found much food for thought some for amusement and a little that made for peace of mind On the whole it opened up a new phase of the matter perhaps At all events upon finishing it she almost sobbed One would think that just because I write a song now and then I was going to let Bertram starve and go with holes in his socks and no buttons on his clothes It was that afternoon that Billy went to see Marie but even there she did not escape for the gentle Marie all unknowingly added her mite to the woeful whole Billy found Marie in tears Why Marie she cried in dismay Sh h warned Marie turning agonized eyes toward the closed door of Cyril s den But dear what is it begged Billy with no less dismay but with greater caution Sh h admonished Marie again On tiptoe then she led the way to a room at the other end of the tiny apartment Once there she explained in a more natural tone of voice Cyril s at work on a new piece for the piano Well what if he is demanded Billy That needn t make you cry need it Oh no no indeed demurred Marie in a shocked voice Well then what is it Marie hesitated then with the abandon of a hurt child that longs for sympathy she sobbed It it s just that I m afraid after all that I m not good enough for Cyril Billy stared frankly Not good enough Marie Henshaw Whatever in the world do you mean Well not good for him then Listen To day I know in lots of ways I must have disappointed him First he put on some socks that I d darned They were the first since our marriage that I d found to darn and I d been so proud and and happy while I was darning them But but he took em off right after breakfast and threw em in a corner Then he put on a new pair and said that I I needn t darn any more that it made bunches Billy my darns bunches Marie s face and voice were tragic Nonsense dear Don t let that fret you comforted Billy promptly trying not to laugh too hard It wasn t your darns it was just darns anybody s darns Cyril won t wear darned socks Aunt Hannah told me so long ago and I said then there d be a tragedy when you found it out So don t worry over that Oh but that isn t all moaned Marie Listen You know how quiet he must have everything when he s composing and he ought to have it too But I forgot this morning and put on some old shoes that didn t have any rubber heels and I ran the carpet sweeper and I rattled tins in the kitchen But I never thought a thing until he opened his door and asked me please to change my shoes and let the the confounded dirt go and didn t I have any dishes in the house but what were made of that abominable tin s stuff she finished in a wail of misery Billy burst into a ringing laugh but Marie s aghast face and upraised hand speedily reduced it to a convulsive giggle You dear child Cyril s always like that when he s composing soothed Billy I supposed you knew it dear Don t you fret Run along and make him his favorite pudding and by night both of you will have forgotten there ever were such things in the world as tins and shoes and carpet sweepers that clatter Marie shook her head Her dismal face did not relax You don t understand she moaned It s myself I ve hindered him She brought out the word with an agony of slow horror And only to day I read here look she faltered going to the table and picking up with shaking hands a magazine Billy recognized it by the cover at once another like it had been flung not so long ago by her own hand into the corner She was not surprised therefore to see very soon at the end of Marie s trembling finger Marriage and the Artistic Temperament Billy did not give a ringing laugh this time She gave an involuntary little shudder though she tried valiantly to turn it all off with a light word of scorn and a cheery pat on Marie s heaving shoulders But she went home very soon and it was plain to be seen that her visit to Marie had not brought her peace Billy knew Kate s letter by heart now both in the original and in its different versions and she knew that despite her struggles she was being forced straight toward Kate s own verdict that she Billy was the cause in some way of the deplorable change in Bertram s appearance manner and work Before she would quite surrender to this heart sickening belief however she determined to ask Bertram himself Falteringly but resolutely therefore one day she questioned him Bertram once you hinted that the picture did not go right because you were troubled over something and I ve been wondering was it about me in any way that you were troubled Billy had her answer before the man spoke She had it in the quick terror that sprang to his eyes and the dull red that swept from his neck to his forehead His reply so far as words went did not count for it evaded everything and told nothing But Billy knew without words She knew too what she must do For the time being she took Bertram s evasive answer as he so evidently wished it to be taken but that evening after he had gone she wrote him a little note and broke the engagement So heartbroken was she and so fearful was she that he should suspect this that her note when completed was a cold little thing of few words which carried no hint that its very coldness was but the heart break in the disguise of pride This was like Billy in all ways Billy had she lived in the days of the Christian martyrs would have been the first to walk with head erect into the Arena of Sacrifice The arena now was just everyday living the lions were her own devouring misery and the cause was Bertram s best good From Bertram s own self she had it now that she had been the cause of his being troubled so she could doubt no longer The only part that was uncertain was the reason why he had been troubled Whether his bond to her had become irksome because of his love for another or because of his love for no girl except to paint Billy did not know But that it was irksome she did not doubt now Besides as if she were going to slay his Art stifle his Ambition destroy his Inspiration and be a nuisance generally just so that she might be happy Indeed no Hence she broke the engagement This was the letter DEAR BERTRAM You won t make the move so I must I knew from the way you spoke to day that it was about me that you were troubled even though you generously tried to make me think it was not And so the picture did not go well Now dear we have not been happy together lately You have seen it so have I I fear our engagement was a mistake so I m going to send back your ring to morrow and I m writing this letter to night Please don t try to see me just yet You know what I am doing is best all round Always your friend BILLY CHAPTER XXXI FLIGHT Billy feared if she did not mail the letter at once she would not have the courage to mail it at all So she slipped down stairs very quietly and went herself to the post box a little way down the street then she came back and sobbed herself to sleep though not until after she had sobbed awake for long hours of wretchedness When she awoke in the morning heavy eyed and unrested there came to her first the vague horror of some shadow hanging over her then the sickening consciousness of what that shadow was For one wild minute Billy felt that she must run to the telephone summon Bertram and beseech him to return unread the letter he would receive from her that day Then there came to her the memory of Bertram s face as it had looked the night before when she had asked him if she were the cause of his being troubled There came too the memory of Kate s scathing Do you want to ruin his career Even the hated magazine article and Marie s tragic I ve hindered him added their mite and Billy knew that she should not go to the telephone nor summon Bertram The one fatal mistake now would be to let Bertram see her own distress If once he should suspect how she suffered in doing this thing there would be a scene that Billy felt she had not the courage to face She must therefore manage in some way not to see Bertram not to let him see her until she felt more sure of her self control no matter what he said The easiest way to do this was of course to go away But where How She must think Meanwhile for these first few hours she would not tell any one even Aunt Hannah what had happened There must no one speak to her of it yet That she could not endure Aunt Hannah would of course shiver groan Oh my grief and conscience and call for another shawl and Billy just now felt as if she should scream if she heard Aunt Hannah say Oh my grief and conscience over that Billy went down to breakfast therefore with a determination to act exactly as usual so that Aunt Hannah should not know yet When people try to act exactly as usual they generally end in acting quite the opposite and Billy was no exception to the rule Hence her attempted cheerfulness became flippantness and her laughter giggles that rang too frequently to be quite sincere though from Aunt Hannah it all elicited only an affectionate smile at the dear child s high spirits A little later when Aunt Hannah was glancing over the morning paper now no longer barred from the door she gave a sudden cry Billy just listen to this she exclaimed reading from the paper in her hand A new tenor in The Girl of the Golden West Appearance of mister M J Arkwright at the Boston Opera House to night Owing to the sudden illness of Dubassi who was to have taken the part of Johnson tonight an exceptional opportunity has come to a young tenor singer one of the most promising pupils at the Conservatory school Arkwright is said to have a fine voice a particularly good stage presence and a purity of tone and smoothness of execution that few of his age and experience can show Only a short time ago he appeared as the duke at one of the popular priced Saturday night performances of Rigoletto and his extraordinary success on that occasion coupled with his familiarity with and fitness for the part of Johnson in The Girl of the Golden West led to his being chosen to take Dubassi s place to night His performance is awaited with the greatest of interest Now isn t that splendid for Mary Jane I m so glad beamed Aunt Hannah Of course we re glad cried Billy And didn t it come just in time This is the last week of opera anyway you know But it says he sang before on a Saturday night declared Aunt Hannah going back to the paper in her hand Now wouldn t you have thought we d have heard of it or read of it And wouldn t you have thought he d have told us Oh well maybe he didn t happen to see us so he could tell us returned Billy with elaborate carelessness I know it but it s so funny he hasn t seen us contended Aunt Hannah frowning You know how much he used to be here Billy colored and hurried into the fray Oh but he must have been so busy with all this you know And of course we didn t see it in the paper because we didn t have any paper at that time probably Oh yes that s my fault I know she laughed and I was silly I ll own But we ll make up for it now We ll go of course I wish it had been on our regular season ticket night but I fancy we can get seats somewhere and I m going to ask Alice Greggory and her mother too I ll go down there this morning to tell them and to get the tickets I ve got it all planned Billy had indeed got it all planned She had been longing for something that would take her away from the house and if possible away from herself This would do the one easily and might help on the other She rose at once I ll go right away she said But my dear frowned Aunt Hannah anxiously I don t believe I can go to night though I d love to dearly But why not I m tired and half sick with a headache this morning I didn t sleep and I ve taken cold somewhere sighed the lady pulling the top shawl a little higher about her throat Why you poor dear what a shame Won t Bertram go asked Aunt Hannah Billy shook her head but she did not meet Aunt Hannah s eyes Oh no I sha n t even ask him He said last night he had a banquet on for to night one of his art clubs I believe Billy s voice was casualness itself But you ll have the Greggorys that is missus Greggory can go can t she inquired Aunt Hannah Oh yes I m sure she can nodded Billy You know she went to the operetta and this is just the same only bigger Yes yes I know murmured Aunt Hannah Dear me How can she get about so on those two wretched little sticks She s a perfect marvel to me She is to me too sighed Billy as she hurried from the room Billy was indeed in a hurry To herself she said she wanted to get away away And she got away as soon as she could She had her plans all made She would go first to the Greggorys and invite them to attend the opera with her that evening Then she would get the tickets Just what she would do with the rest of the day she did not know She knew only that she would not go home until time to dress for dinner and the opera She did not tell Aunt Hannah this however when she left the house She planned to telephone it from somewhere down town later She told herself that she could not stay all day under the sharp eyes of Aunt Hannah but she managed nevertheless to bid that lady a particularly blithe and bright faced good by Billy had not been long gone when the telephone bell rang Aunt Hannah answered it Why Bertram is that you she called in answer to the words that came to her across the wire Why I hardly knew your voice Didn t you Well is is Billy there No she isn t She s gone down to see Alice Greggory Oh So evident was the disappointment in the voice that Aunt Hannah added hastily I m so sorry She hasn t been gone ten minutes But is there any message No thank you There s no message The voice hesitated then went on a little constrainedly How how is Billy this morning She she s all right isn t she Aunt Hannah laughed in obvious amusement Bless your dear heart yes my boy Has it been such a long time since last evening when you saw her yourself Yes she s all right In fact I was thinking at the breakfast table how pretty she looked with her pink cheeks and her bright eyes She seemed to be in such high spirits An inarticulate something that Aunt Hannah could not quite catch came across the line then a somewhat hurried All right Thank you Good by The next time Aunt Hannah was called to the telephone Billy spoke to her Aunt Hannah don t wait luncheon for me please I shall get it in town And don t expect me till five o clock I have some shopping to do All right dear replied Aunt Hannah Did you get the tickets Yes and the Greggorys will go Oh and Aunt Hannah Yes dear Please tell John to bring Peggy around early enough to night so we can go down and get the Greggorys I told them we d call for them Very well dear I ll tell him Thank you How s the poor head Better a little I think That s good Won t you repent and go too No oh no indeed All right then good by I m sorry So m I Good by sighed Aunt Hannah as she hung up the receiver and turned away It was after five o clock when Billy got home and so hurried were the dressing and the dinner that Aunt Hannah forgot to mention Bertram s telephone call till just as Billy was ready to start for the Greggorys There and I forgot she confessed Bertram called you up just after you left this morning my dear Did he Billy s face was turned away but Aunt Hannah did not notice that Yes Oh he didn t want anything special smiled the lady only well he did ask if you were all right this morning she finished with quiet mischief Did he murmured Billy again This time there was a little sound after the words which Aunt Hannah would have taken for a sob if she had not known that it must have been a laugh Then Billy was gone At eight o clock the doorbell rang and a minute later Rosa came up to say that mister Bertram Henshaw was down stairs and wished to see missus Stetson missus Stetson went down at once Why my dear boy she exclaimed as she entered the room Billy said you had a banquet on for to night Yes I know but I didn t go Bertram s face was pale and drawn His voice did not sound natural Why Bertram you look ill Are you ill The man made an impatient gesture No no I m not ill I m not ill at all Rosa says Billy s not here No she s gone to the opera with the Greggorys The opera There was a grieved hurt in Bertram s voice that Aunt Hannah quite misunderstood She hastened to give an apologetic explanation Yes She would have told you she would have asked you to join them I m sure but she said you were going to a banquet I m sure she said so Yes I did tell her so last night nodded Bertram dully Aunt Hannah frowned a little Still more anxiously she endeavored to explain to this disappointed lover why his sweetheart was not at home to greet him Well then of course my boy she d never think of your coming here to night and when she found mister Arkwright was going to sing Arkwright There was no listlessness in Bertram s voice or manner now Yes Didn t you see it in the paper Such a splendid chance for him His picture was there too No I didn t see it Then you don t know about it of course smiled Aunt Hannah But he s to take the part of Johnson in The Girl of the Golden West Isn t that splendid I m so glad And Billy was too She hurried right off this morning to get the tickets and to ask the Greggorys Oh Bertram got to his feet a little abruptly and held out his hand Well then I might as well say good by then I suppose he suggested with a laugh that Aunt Hannah thought was a bit forced Before she could remind him again though that Billy was really not to blame for not being there to welcome him he was gone And Aunt Hannah could only go up stairs and meditate on the unreasonableness of lovers in general and of Bertram in particular Aunt Hannah had gone to bed but she was still awake when Billy came home so she heard the automobile come to a stop before the door and she called to Billy when the girl came upstairs Billy dear come in here I m awake I want to hear about it Was it good Billy stopped in the doorway The light from the hall struck her face There was no brightness in her eyes now no pink in her cheeks Oh yes it was good very good she replied listlessly Why Billy how queer you answer What was the matter Wasn t Mary Jane all right Mary Jane Oh oh yes he was very good Aunt Hannah Very good indeed echoed the lady indignantly He must have been when you speak as if you d actually forgotten that he sang at all anyway Billy had forgotten almost Billy had found that in spite of her getting away from the house she had not got away from herself once all day She tried now however to summon her acting powers of the morning But it was splendid really Aunt Hannah she cried with some show of animation And they clapped and cheered and gave him any number of curtain calls We were so proud of him But you see I am tired she broke off wearily You poor child of course you are and you look like a ghost I won t keep you another minute Run along to bed Oh Bertram didn t go to that banquet after all He came here she added as Billy turned to go Bertram The girl wheeled sharply Yes He wanted you of course I found I didn t do at all chuckled Aunt Hannah Did you suppose I would There was no answer Billy had gone In the long night watches Billy fought it out with herself Billy had always fought things out with herself She must go away She knew that Already Bertram had telephoned and called He evidently meant to see her and she could not see him She dared not If she did Billy knew now how pitifully little it would take to make her actually willing to slay Bertram s Art stifle his Ambition destroy his Inspiration and be a nuisance generally if only she could have Bertram while she was doing it all Sternly then she asked herself if she had no pride if she had forgotten that it was because of her that the Winthrop portrait had not been a success because of her either for the reason that he loved now Miss Winthrop or else that he loved no girl except to paint Very early in the morning a white faced red eyed Billy appeared at Aunt Hannah s bedside Billy exclaimed Aunt Hannah plainly appalled Billy sat down on the edge of the bed Aunt Hannah she began in a monotonous voice as if she were reciting a lesson she had learned by heart please listen and please try not to be too surprised You were saying the other day that you would like to visit your old home town Well I think that s a very nice idea If you don t mind we ll go to day Aunt Hannah pulled herself half erect in bed To day child Yes nodded Billy unsmilingly We shall have to go somewhere to day and I thought you would like that place best But Billy what does this mean Billy sighed heavily Yes I understand You ll have to know the rest of course I ve broken my engagement I don t want to see Bertram That s why I m going away Aunt Hannah fell nervelessly back on the pillow Her teeth fairly chattered Oh my grief and conscience Billy Won t you please pull up that blanket she moaned Billy what do you mean Billy shook her head and got to her feet I can t tell any more now really Aunt Hannah Please don t ask me and don t talk You will go with me won t you And Aunt Hannah with her terrified eyes on Billy s piteously agitated face nodded her head and choked Why of course I ll go anywhere with you Billy but why did you do it why did you do it A little later Billy in her own room wrote this note to Bertram DEAR BERTRAM I m going away to day That ll be best all around You ll agree to that I m sure Please don t try to see me and please don t write It wouldn t make either one of us any happier You must know that As ever your friend BILLY Bertram when he read it grew only a shade more white a degree more sick at heart Then he kissed the letter gently and put it away with the other To Bertram the thing was very clear Billy had come now to the conclusion that it would be wrong to give herself where she could not give her heart And in this he agreed with her bitter as it was for him Certainly he did not want Billy if Billy did not want him he told himself He would now of course accede to her request He would not write to her and make her suffer more But to Bertram at that moment it seemed that the very sun in the heavens had gone out CHAPTER XXXII PETE TO THE RESCUE One by one the weeks passed and became a month Then other weeks became other months It was July when Billy homesick and weary came back to Hillside with Aunt Hannah Home looked wonderfully good to Billy in spite of the fact that she had so dreaded to see it Billy had made up her mind however that come sometime she must She could not of course stay always away Perhaps too it would be just as easy at home as it was away Certainly it could not be any harder She was convinced of that Besides she did not want Bertram to think Billy had received only meagre news from Boston since she went away Bertram had not written at all William had written twice hurt grieved puzzled questioning letters that were very hard to answer From Marie too had come letters of much the same sort By far the cheeriest epistles had come from Alice Greggory They contained indeed about the only comfort Billy had known for weeks for they showed very plainly to Billy that Arkwright s heart had been caught on the rebound and that in Alice Greggory he was finding the sweetest sort of balm for his wounded feelings From these letters Billy learned too that Judge Greggory s honor had been wholly vindicated and as Billy told Aunt Hannah anybody could put two and two together and make four now It was eight o clock on a rainy July evening that Billy and Aunt Hannah arrived at Hillside and it was only a little past eight that Aunt Hannah was summoned to the telephone When she came back to Billy she was crying and wringing her hands Billy sprang to her feet Why Aunt Hannah what is it What s the matter she demanded Aunt Hannah sank into a chair still wringing her hands Oh Billy Billy how can I tell you how can I tell you she moaned You must tell me Aunt Hannah what is it Oh oh oh Billy I can t I can t But you ll have to What is it Aunt Hannah It s B Bertram Bertram Billy s face grew ashen Quick quick what do you mean For answer Aunt Hannah covered her face with her hands and began to sob aloud Billy almost beside herself now with terror and anxiety dropped on her knees and tried to pull away the shaking hands Aunt Hannah you must tell me You must you must I can t Billy It s Bertram He s hurt choked Aunt Hannah hysterically Hurt How I don t know Pete told me Pete Yes Rosa had told him we were coming and he called me up He said maybe I could do something So he told me Yes yes But told you what That he was hurt How I couldn t hear all but I think twas an accident automobile And Billy Billy Pete says it s his arm his right arm and that maybe he can t ever p paint again Oh h Billy fell back as if the words had been a blow Not that Aunt Hannah not that That s what Pete said I couldn t get all of it but I got that And Billy he s been out of his head though he isn t now Pete says and and and he s been calling for you For me A swift change came to Billy s face Yes Over and over again he called for you while he was crazy you know That s why Pete told me He said he didn t rightly understand what the trouble was but he didn t believe there was any trouble really between you two anyway that you wouldn t think there was if you could hear him and know how he wanted you and why Billy Billy was on her feet now Her fingers were on the electric push button that would summon Rosa Her face was illumined The next moment Rosa appeared Tell John to bring Peggy to the door at once please directed her mistress Billy gasped Aunt Hannah again as the maid disappeared Billy was tremblingly putting on the hat she had but just taken off Billy what are you going to do Billy turned in obvious surprise Why I m going to Bertram of course To Bertram But it s nearly half past eight child and it rains and everything But Bertram wants me exclaimed Billy As if I d mind rain or time or anything else now But but oh my grief and conscience groaned Aunt Hannah beginning to wring her hands again Billy reached for her coat Aunt Hannah stirred into sudden action But Billy if you d only wait till to morrow she quavered putting out a feebly restraining hand To morrow The young voice rang with supreme scorn Do you think I d wait till to morrow after all this I say Bertram wants me Billy picked up her gloves But you broke it off dear you said you did and to go down there to night like this Billy lifted her head Her eyes shone Her whole face was a glory of love and pride That was before I didn t know He wants me Aunt Hannah Did you hear He wants me And now I won t even hinder him if he can t p paint again Billy s voice broke The glory left her face Her eyes brimmed with tears but her head was still bravely uplifted I m going to Bertram Blindly Aunt Hannah got to her feet Still more blindly she reached for her bonnet and cloak on the chair near her Oh will you go too asked Billy abstractedly hurrying to the window to look for the motor car Will I go too burst out Aunt Hannah s indignant voice Do you think I d let you go alone and at this time of night on such a wild goose chase as this I don t know I m sure murmured Billy still abstractedly peering out into the rain Don t know indeed Oh my grief and conscience groaned Aunt Hannah setting her bonnet hopelessly askew on top of her agitated head But Billy did not even answer now Her face was pressed hard against the window pane CHAPTER XXXIII BERTRAM TAKES THE REINS With stiffly pompous dignity Pete opened the door The next moment he fell back in amazement before the impetuous rush of a starry eyed flushed cheeked young woman who demanded Where is he Pete Miss Billy gasped the old man Then he saw Aunt Hannah Aunt Hannah with her bonnet askew her neck bow awry one hand bare and the other half covered with a glove wrong side out Aunt Hannah s cheeks too were flushed and her eyes starry but with dismay and anger the last because she did not like the way Pete had said Miss Billy s name It was one matter for her to object to this thing Billy was doing but quite another for Pete to do it Of course it s she retorted Aunt Hannah testily As if you yourself didn t bring her here with your crazy messages at this time of night Pete where is he interposed Billy Tell mister Bertram I am here or wait I ll go right in and surprise him Billy This time it was Aunt Hannah who gasped her name Pete had recovered himself by now but he did not even glance toward Aunt Hannah His face was beaming and his old eyes were shining Miss Billy Miss Billy you re an angel straight from heaven you are you are Oh I m so glad you came It ll be all right now all right He s in the den Miss Billy Billy turned eagerly but before she could take so much as one step toward the door at the end of the hall Aunt Hannah s indignant voice arrested her Billy stop You re not an angel you re a young woman and a crazy one at that Whatever angels do young women don t go unannounced and unchaperoned into young men s rooms Pete go tell your master that we are here and ask if he will receive us Pete s lips twitched The emphatic we and us were not lost on him But his face was preternaturally grave when he spoke mister Bertram is up and dressed ma am He s in the den I ll speak to him Pete once again the punctilious butler stalked to the door of Bertram s den and threw it wide open Opposite the door on a low couch lay Bertram his head bandaged and his right arm in a sling His face was turned toward the door but his eyes were closed He looked very white and his features were pitifully drawn with suffering mister Bertram began Pete but he got no further A flying figure brushed by him and fell on its knees by the couch with a low cry Bertram s eyes flew open Across his face swept such a radiant look of unearthly joy that Pete sobbed audibly and fled to the kitchen Dong Ling found him there a minute later polishing a silver teaspoon with a fringed napkin that had been spread over Bertram s tray In the hall above Aunt Hannah was crying into William s gray linen duster that hung on the hall rack Aunt Hannah s handkerchief was on the floor back at Hillside In the den neither Billy nor Bertram knew or cared what had become of Aunt Hannah and Pete There were just two people in their world two people and unutterable incredible overwhelming rapture and peace Then very gradually it dawned over them that there was after all something strange and unexplained in it all But dearest what does it mean you here like this asked Bertram then As if to make sure that she was here like this he drew her even closer Bertram was so thankful that he did have one arm that was usable Billy on her knees by the couch snuggled into the curve of the one arm with a contented little sigh Well you see just as soon as I found out to night that you wanted me I came she said You darling That was Bertram stopped suddenly A puzzled frown showed below the fantastic bandage about his head As soon as he quoted then scornfully Were you ever by any possible chance thinking I didn t want you Billy s eyes widened a little Why Bertram dear don t you see When you were so troubled that the picture didn t go well and I found out it was about me you were troubled I Well Bertram s voice was a little strained Why of of course stammered Billy I couldn t help thinking that maybe you had found out you didn t want me Didn t want you groaned Bertram his tense muscles relaxing May I ask why Billy blushed I wasn t quite sure why she faltered only of course I thought of of Miss Winthrop you know or that maybe it was because you didn t care for any girl only to paint oh oh Bertram Pete told us she broke off wildly beginning to sob Pete told you that I didn t care for any girl only to paint demanded Bertram angry and mystified No no sobbed Billy not that It was all the others that told me that Pete told Aunt Hannah about the accident you know and he said he said Oh Bertram I can t say it But that s one of the things that made me know I could come now you see because I I wouldn t hinder you nor slay your Art nor any other of those dreadful things if if you couldn t ever p paint again finished Billy in an uncontrollable burst of grief There there dear comforted Bertram patting the bronze gold head on his breast I haven t the faintest idea what you re talking about except the last but I know there can t be anything that ought to make you cry like that As for my not painting again you didn t understand Pete dearie That was what they were afraid of at first that I d lose my arm but that danger is all past now I m loads better Of course I m going to paint again and better than ever before now Billy lifted her head A look that was almost terror came to her eyes She pulled herself half away from Bertram s encircling arm Why Billy cried the man in pained surprise You don t mean to say you re sorry I m going to paint again No no Oh no Bertram never that she faltered still regarding him with fearful eyes It s only for me you know I can t go back now and not have you after this even if I do hinder you and Hinder me What are you talking about Billy Billy drew a quivering sigh Well to begin with Kate said Good heavens Is Kate in this too Bertram s voice was savage now Well she wrote a letter I ll warrant she did Great Scott Billy Don t you know Kate by this time Y yes I said so too But Bertram what she wrote was true I found it everywhere afterwards in magazines and papers and even in Marie Humph Well dearie I don t know yet what you found but I do know you wouldn t have found it at all if it hadn t been for Kate and I wish I had her here this minute Billy giggled hysterically I don t not right here she cooed nestling comfortably against her lover s arm But you see dear she never has approved of the marriage Well who s doing the marrying she or I That s what I said too only in another way sighed Billy But she called us flyaway flutterbudgets and she said I d ruin your career if I did marry you Well I can tell you right now Billy you will ruin it if you don t declared Bertram That s what ailed me all the time I was painting that miserable portrait I was so worried for fear I d lose you Lose me Why Bertram Henshaw what do you mean A shamed red crept to the man s forehead Well I suppose I might as well own up now as any time I was scared blue Billy with jealousy of Arkwright Billy laughed gayly but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover s eyes Arkwright Nonsense she cried Why he s going to marry Alice Greggory I know he is I can see it as plain as day in her letters He s there a lot And you never did think for a minute Billy that you cared for him Bertram s gaze searched Billy s face a little fearfully He had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids But Billy looked him now straight in the face it was a level frank gaze of absolute truth Never dear she said firmly Billy was so glad Bertram had turned the question on her love instead of Arkwright s There has never really been any one but you Thank God for that breathed Bertram as he drew the bright head nearer and held it close After a minute Billy stirred and sighed happily Aren t lovers the beat em for imagining things she murmured They certainly are You see I wasn t in love with mister Arkwright I see I hope And and you didn t care specially for for Miss Winthrop Eh Well no exploded Bertram Do you mean to say you really Billy put a soft finger on his lips Er people who live in glass houses you know she reminded him with roguish eyes Bertram kissed the finger and subsided Humph he commented There was a long silence then a little breathlessly Billy asked And you don t after all love me just to paint Well what is that Is that Kate too demanded Bertram grimly Billy laughed No oh she said it all right but you see everybody said that to me Bertram and that s what made me so so worried sometimes when you talked about the tilt of my chin and all that Well by Jove breathed Bertram There was another silence Then suddenly Bertram stirred Billy I m going to marry you to morrow he announced decisively Billy lifted her head and sat back in palpitating dismay Bertram What an absurd idea Well I am I don t know as I can trust you out of my sight till then You ll read something or hear something or get a letter from Kate after breakfast to morrow morning that will set you saving me again and I don t want to be saved that way I m going to marry you to morrow I ll get He stopped short with a sudden frown Confound that law I forgot Great Scott Billy I ll have to trust you five days after all There s a new law about the license We ve got to wait five days and maybe more counting in the notice and all Billy laughed softly Five days indeed sir I wonder if you think I can get ready to be married in five days Don t want you to get ready retorted Bertram promptly I saw Marie get ready and I had all I wanted of it If you really must have all those miles of tablecloths and napkins and doilies and lace rufflings we ll do it afterwards not before But Besides I need you to take care of me cut in Bertram craftily Bertram do you really The tender glow on Billy s face told its own story and Bertram s eager eyes were not slow to read it Sweetheart see here dear he cried softly tightening his good left arm And forthwith he began to tell her how much he did indeed need her Billy my dear It was Aunt Hannah s plaintive voice at the doorway a little later We must go home and William is here too and wants to see you Billy rose at once as Aunt Hannah entered the room Yes Aunt Hannah I ll come besides she glanced at Bertram mischievously I shall need all the time I ve got to prepare for my wedding Your wedding You mean it ll be before October Aunt Hannah glanced from one to the other uncertainly Something in their smiling faces sent a quick suspicion to her eyes Yes nodded Billy demurely It s next Tuesday you see Next Tuesday But that s only a week away gasped Aunt Hannah Yes a week But child your trousseau the wedding the the a week Aunt Hannah could not articulate further Yes I know that is a good while cut in Bertram airily We wanted it to morrow but we had to wait on account of the new license law Otherwise it wouldn t have been so long and But Aunt Hannah was gone With a low breathed Long Oh my grief and conscience William she had fled through the hall door Well it is long maintained Bertram with tender eyes as he reached out his hand to say good night End of Project
