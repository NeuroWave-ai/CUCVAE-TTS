ASCII START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS Produced by Laura J Hoelter COMMENTARY ON THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS fifteen thirty five By Martin Luther Translated by Theodore Graebner PREFACE The preparation of this edition of Luther s Commentary on Galatians was first suggested to me by mister P J Zondervan of the firm of publishers in March nineteen thirty seven The consultation had the twofold merit of definiteness and brevity Luther is still the greatest name in Protestantism We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther s for the general American market Will you do it I will on one condition And what is that The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the Lutheran Church actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans I illustrated the point by reading to mister Zondervan a few sentences from an English translation lately reprinted by an American publisher of one of Luther s outstanding reformatory essays The demonstration seemed to prove convincing for it was agreed that one may as well offer Luther in the original German or Latin as expect the American church member to read any translations that would adhere to Luther s German or Latin constructions and employ the Mid Victorian type of English characteristic of the translations now on the market And what book would be your choice There is one book that Luther himself likes better than any other Let us begin with that his Commentary on Galatians The undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive The Letter to the Galatians consists of six short chapters Luther s commentary fills seven hundred and thirty three octavo pages in the Weidman Edition of his works It was written in Latin We were resolved not to present this entire mass of exegesis It would have run to more than fifteen hundred pages ordinary octavo like this since it is impossible to use the compressed structure of sentences which is characteristic of Latin and particularly of Luther s Latin The work had to be condensed German and English translations are available but the most acceptable English version besides laboring under the handicaps of an archaic style had to be condensed into half its volume in order to accomplish the streamlining of the book Whatever merit the translation now presented to the reader may possess should be written to the credit of reverend Gerhardt Mahler of Geneva N Y who came to my assistance in a very busy season by making a rough draft of the translation and later preparing a revision of it which forms the basis of the final draft submitted to the printer A word should now be said about the origin of Luther s Commentary on Galatians The Reformer had lectured on this Epistle of saint Paul s in fifteen nineteen and again in fifteen twenty three It was his favorite among all the Biblical books In his table talks the saying is recorded The Epistle to the Galatians is my epistle To it I am as it were in wedlock It is my Katherine Much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his Latin works he remarked to his home circle If I had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine My Galatians for instance The lectures which are preserved in the works herewith submitted to the American public were delivered in fifteen thirty one They were taken down by George Roerer who held something of a deanship at Wittenberg University and who was one of Luther s aids in the translation of the Bible Roerer took down Luther s lectures and this manuscript has been preserved to the present day in a copy which contains also additions by Veit Dietrich and by Cruciger friends of Roerer s who with him attended Luther s lectures In other words these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of Galatians and Roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer A German translation by Justus Menius appeared in the Wittenberg Edition of Luther s writings published in fifteen thirty nine The importance of this Commentary on Galatians for the history of Protestantism is very great It presents like no other of Luther s writings the central thought of Christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ s merits alone We have permitted in the final revision of the manuscript many a passage to stand which seemed weak and ineffectual when compared with the trumpet tones of the Latin original But the essence of Luther s lectures is there May the reader accept with indulgence where in this translation we have gone too far in modernizing Luther s expression making him talk American At the end of his lectures in fifteen thirty one Luther uttered a brief prayer and then dictated two Scriptural texts which we shall inscribe at the end of these introductory remarks The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear let Him also give us the power to serve and to do LUKE two Glory to God in the highest And on earth peace Good will to men ISAIAH forty The Word of our God shall stand forever THEODORE GRAEBNER saint Louis Missouri FROM LUTHER S INTRODUCTION fifteen thirty eight In my heart reigns this one article faith in my dear Lord Christ the beginning middle and end of whatever spiritual and divine thoughts I may have whether by day or by night CHAPTER one VERSE one Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead saint Paul wrote this epistle because after his departure from the Galatian churches Jewish Christian fanatics moved in who perverted Paul s Gospel of man s free justification by faith in Christ Jesus The world bears the Gospel a grudge because the Gospel condemns the religious wisdom of the world Jealous for its own religious views the world in turn charges the Gospel with being a subversive and licentious doctrine offensive to God and man a doctrine to be persecuted as the worst plague on earth As a result we have this paradoxical situation The Gospel supplies the world with the salvation of Jesus Christ peace of conscience and every blessing Just for that the world abhors the Gospel These Jewish Christian fanatics who pushed themselves into the Galatian churches after Paul s departure boasted that they were the descendants of Abraham true ministers of Christ having been trained by the apostles themselves that they were able to perform miracles In every way they sought to undermine the authority of saint Paul They said to the Galatians You have no right to think highly of Paul He was the last to turn to Christ But we have seen Christ We heard Him preach Paul came later and is beneath us It is possible for us to be in error we who have received the Holy Ghost Paul stands alone He has not seen Christ nor has he had much contact with the other apostles Indeed he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time When men claiming such credentials come along they deceive not only the naive but also those who seemingly are well established in the faith This same argument is used by the papacy Do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church Or do you suppose that God would have left His Church floundering in error all these centuries The Galatians were taken in by such arguments with the result that Paul s authority and doctrine were drawn in question Against these boasting false apostles Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry Humble man that he was he will not now take a back seat He reminds them of the time when he opposed Peter to his face and reproved the chief of the apostles Paul devotes the first two chapters to a defense of his office and his Gospel affirming that he received it not from men but from the Lord Jesus Christ by special revelation and that if he or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than the one he had preached he shall be accursed The Certainty of Our Calling Every minister should make much of his calling and impress upon others the fact that he has been delegated by God to preach the Gospel As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of Christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men This is not vain glory but needful glorying Paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of God Writing to the Romans he declares Inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office i e I want to be received not as Paul of Tarsus but as Paul the apostle and ambassador of Jesus Christ in order that people might be more eager to hear Paul exalts his ministry out of the desire to make known the name the grace and the mercy of God VERSE one Paul an apostle not of men et cetera Paul loses no time in defending himself against the charge that he had thrust himself into the ministry He says to the Galatians My call may seem inferior to you But those who have come to you are either called of men or by man My call is the highest possible for it is by Jesus Christ and God the Father When Paul speaks of those called by men I take it he means those whom neither God nor man sent but who go wherever they like and speak for themselves When Paul speaks of those called by man I take it he means those who have a divine call extended to them through other persons God calls in two ways Either He calls ministers through the agency of men or He calls them directly as He called the prophets and apostles Paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man The most they could claim is that they were sent by others But as for me I was called neither of men nor by man but directly by Jesus Christ My call is in every respect like the call of the apostles In fact I am an apostle Elsewhere Paul draws a sharp distinction between an apostleship and lesser functions as in I Corinthians twelve twenty eight And God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God Matthias was called in this manner The apostles chose two candidates and then cast lots praying that God would indicate which one He would have To be an apostle he had to have his appointment from God In the same manner Paul was called as the apostle of the Gentiles The call is not to be taken lightly For a person to possess knowledge is not enough He must be sure that he is properly called Those who operate without a proper call seek no good purpose God does not bless their labors They may be good preachers but they do not edify Many of the fanatics of our day pronounce words of faith but they bear no good fruit because their purpose is to turn men to their perverse opinions On the other hand those who have a divine call must suffer a good deal of opposition in order that they may become fortified against the running attacks of the devil and the world This is our comfort in the ministry that ours is a divine office to which we have been divinely called Reversely what an awful thing it must be for the conscience if one is not properly called It spoils one s best work When I was a young man I thought Paul was making too much of his call I did not understand his purpose I did not then realize the importance of the ministry I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting We exalt our calling not to gain glory among men or money or satisfaction or favor but because people need to be assured that the words we speak are the words of God This is no sinful pride It is holy pride VERSE one And God the Father who raised him from the dead Paul is so eager to come to the subject matter of his epistle the righteousness of faith in opposition to the righteousness of works that already in the title he must speak his mind He did not think it quite enough to say that he was an apostle by Jesus Christ he adds and God the Father who raised him from the dead The clause seems superfluous on first sight Yet Paul had a good reason for adding it He had to deal with Satan and his agents who endeavored to deprive him of the righteousness of Christ who was raised by God the Father from the dead These perverters of the righteousness of Christ resist the Father and the Son and the works of them both In this whole epistle Paul treats of the resurrection of Christ By His resurrection Christ won the victory over law sin flesh world devil death hell and every evil And this His victory He donated unto us These many tyrants and enemies of ours may accuse and frighten us but they dare not condemn us for Christ whom God the Father has raised from the dead is our righteousness and our victory Do you notice how well suited to his purpose Paul writes He does not say By God who made heaven and earth who is Lord of the angels but Paul has in mind the righteousness of Christ and speaks to the point saying I am an apostle not of men neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead VERSE two And all the brethren which are with me This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles Paul s intention is to exalt his own ministry while discrediting theirs He adds for good measure the argument that he does not stand alone but that all the brethren with him attest to the fact that his doctrine is divinely true Although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself yet they are all of one mind with me think write and teach as I do VERSE two Unto the churches of Galatia Paul had preached the Gospel throughout Galatia founding many churches which after his departure were invaded by the false apostles The Anabaptists in our time imitate the false apostles They do not go where the enemies of the Gospel predominate They go where the Christians are Why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes bishops and doctors as we have done by the help of God These soft martyrs take no chances They go where the Gospel has a hold so that they may not endanger their lives The false apostles would not go to Jerusalem of Caiaphas or to the Rome of the Emperor or to any other place where no man had preached before as Paul and the other apostles did But they came to the churches of Galatia knowing that where men profess the name of Christ they may feel secure It is the lot of God s ministers not only to suffer opposition at the hand of a wicked world but also to see the patient indoctrination of many years quickly undone by such religious fanatics This hurts more than the persecution of tyrants We are treated shabbily on the outside by tyrants on the inside by those whom we have restored to the liberty of the Gospel and also by false brethren But this is our comfort and our glory that being called of God we have the promise of everlasting life We look for that reward which eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man Jerome raises the question why Paul called them churches that were no churches inasmuch as the Galatians had forsaken the grace of Christ for the law of Moses The proper answer is Although the Galatians had fallen away from the doctrine of Paul baptism the Gospel and the name of Christ continued among them Not all the Galatians had become perverted There were some who clung to the right view of the Word and the Sacraments These means cannot be contaminated They remain divine regardless of men s opinion Wherever the means of grace are found there is the Holy Church even though Antichrist reigns there So much for the title of the epistle Now follows the greeting of the apostle VERSE three Grace be to you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood But since we are explaining this epistle you will not mind if we repeat what we have so often explained elsewhere The article of justification must be sounded in our ears incessantly because the frailty of our flesh will not permit us to take hold of it perfectly and to believe it with all our heart The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing Grace remits sin and peace quiets the conscience Sin and conscience torment us but Christ has overcome these fiends now and forever Only Christians possess this victorious knowledge given from above These two terms grace and peace constitute Christianity Grace involves the remission of sins peace and a happy conscience Sin is not canceled by lawful living for no person is able to live up to the Law The Law reveals guilt fills the conscience with terror and drives men to despair Much less is sin taken away by man invented endeavors The fact is the more a person seeks credit for himself by his own efforts the deeper he goes into debt Nothing can take away sin except the grace of God In actual living however it is not so easy to persuade oneself that by grace alone in opposition to every other means we obtain the forgiveness of our sins and peace with God The world brands this a pernicious doctrine The world advances free will the rational and natural approach of good works as the means of obtaining the forgiveness of sin But it is impossible to gain peace of conscience by the methods and means of the world Experience proves this Various holy orders have been launched for the purpose of securing peace of conscience through religious exercises but they proved failures because such devices only increase doubt and despair We find no rest for our weary bones unless we cling to the word of grace The Apostle does not wish the Galatians grace and peace from the emperor or from kings or from governors but from God the Father He wishes them heavenly peace the kind of which Jesus spoke when He said Peace I leave unto you my peace I give unto you Worldly peace provides quiet enjoyment of life and possessions But in affliction particularly in the hour of death the grace and peace of the world will not deliver us However the grace and peace of God will They make a person strong and courageous to bear and to overcome all difficulties even death itself because we have the victory of Christ s death and the assurance of the forgiveness of our sins Men Should Not Speculate About the Nature of God The Apostle adds to the salutation the words and from our Lord Jesus Christ Was it not enough to say from God the Father It is a principle of the Bible that we are not to inquire curiously into the nature of God There shall no man see me and live Exodus thirty three twenty All who trust in their own merits to save them disregard this principle and lose sight of the Mediator Jesus Christ True Christian theology does not inquire into the nature of God but into God s purpose and will in Christ whom God incorporated in our flesh to live and to die for our sins There is nothing more dangerous than to speculate about the incomprehensible power wisdom and majesty of God when the conscience is in turmoil over sin To do so is to lose God altogether because God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend His infinite majesty We are to seek God as Paul tells us in I Corinthians one twenty three twenty four We preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God Begin with Christ He came down to earth lived among men suffered was crucified and then He died standing clearly before us so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon Him Thus we shall be kept from climbing into heaven in a curious and futile search after the nature of God If you ask how God may be found who justifies sinners know that there is no other God besides this man Christ Jesus Embrace Him and forget about the nature of God But these fanatics who exclude our Mediator in their dealings with God do not believe me Did not Christ Himself say I am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the Father but by me Without Christ there is no access to the Father but futile rambling no truth but hypocrisy no life but eternal death When you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like But when you deal with conscience and with righteousness over against the law sin death and the devil you must close your mind to all inquiries into the nature of God and concentrate upon Jesus Christ who says Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Doing this you will recognize the power and majesty condescending to your condition according to Paul s statement to the Colossians In Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily Paul in wishing grace and peace not alone from God the Father but also from Jesus Christ wants to warn us against the curious incursions into the nature of God We are to hear Christ who has been appointed by the Father as our divine Teacher Christ is God by Nature At the same time Paul confirms our creed that Christ is very God We need such frequent confirmation of our faith for Satan will not fail to attack it He hates our faith He knows that it is the victory which overcometh him and the world That Christ is very God is apparent in that Paul ascribes to Him divine powers equally with the Father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace This Jesus could not do unless He were God To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God who alone can create these blessings The angels cannot The apostles could only distribute these blessings by the preaching of the Gospel In attributing to Christ the divine power of creating and giving grace peace everlasting life righteousness and forgiveness of sins the conclusion is inevitable that Christ is truly God Similarly saint John concludes from the works attributed to the Father and the Son that they are divinely One Hence the gifts which we receive from the Father and from the Son are one and the same Otherwise Paul should have written Grace from God the Father and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ In combining them he ascribes them equally to the Father and the Son I stress this on account of the many errors emanating from the sects The Arians were sharp fellows Admitting that Christ had two natures and that He is called very God of very God they were yet able to deny His divinity The Arians took Christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by Him God created heaven and earth Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ But all their praise is mere palaver to deceive men Paul s language is different To paraphrase him You are established in this belief that Christ is very God because He gives grace and peace gifts which only God can create and bestow VERSE four Who gave himself for our sins Paul sticks to his theme He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle He does not say Who received our works but who gave Gave what Not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but Himself What for Not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins These words are like so many thunderclaps of protest from heaven against every kind and type of self merit Underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences How may we obtain remission of our sins Paul answers The man who is named Jesus Christ and the Son of God gave himself for our sins The heavy artillery of these words explodes papacy works merits superstitions For if our sins could be removed by our own efforts what need was there for the Son of God to be given for them Since Christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts This sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin The greatness of the ransom Christ the Son of God indicates this The vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins So vicious is sin that only the sacrifice of Christ could atone for sin When we reflect that the one little word sin embraces the whole kingdom of Satan and that it includes everything that is horrible we have reason to tremble But we are careless We make light of sin We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin This passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin Sin is an exacting despot who can be vanquished by no created power but by the sovereign power of Jesus Christ alone All this is of wonderful comfort to a conscience troubled by the enormity of sin Sin cannot harm those who believe in Christ because He has overcome sin by His death Armed with this conviction we are enlightened and may pass judgment upon the papists monks nuns priests Mohammedans Anabaptists and all who trust in their own merits as wicked and destructive sects that rob God and Christ of the honor that belongs to them alone Note especially the pronoun our and its significance You will readily grant that Christ gave Himself for the sins of Peter Paul and others who were worthy of such grace But feeling low you find it hard to believe that Christ gave Himself for your sins Our feelings shy at a personal application of the pronoun our and we refuse to have anything to do with God until we have made ourselves worthy by good deeds This attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto God with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sins This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others Such readily confess that they are frequent sinners but they regard their sins as of no such importance that they cannot easily be dissolved by some good action or that they may not appear before the tribunal of Christ and demand the reward of eternal life for their righteousness Meantime they pretend great humility and acknowledge a certain degree of sinfulness for which they soulfully join in the publican s prayer God be merciful to me a sinner But the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them The genius of Christianity takes the words of Paul who gave himself for our sins as true and efficacious We are not to look upon our sins as insignificant trifles On the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair Learn to believe that Christ was given not for picayune and imaginary transgressions but for mountainous sins not for one or two but for all not for sins that can be discarded but for sins that are stubbornly ingrained Practice this knowledge and fortify yourself against despair particularly in the last hour when the memory of past sins assails the conscience Say with confidence Christ the Son of God was given not for the righteous but for sinners If I had no sin I should not need Christ No Satan you cannot delude me into thinking I am holy The truth is I am all sin My sins are not imaginary transgressions but sins against the first table unbelief doubt despair contempt hatred ignorance of God ingratitude towards Him misuse of His name neglect of His Word et cetera and sins against the second table dishonor of parents disobedience of government coveting of another s possessions et cetera Granted that I have not committed murder adultery theft and similar sins in deed nevertheless I have committed them in the heart and therefore I am a transgressor of all the commandments of God Because my transgressions are multiplied and my own efforts at self justification rather a hindrance than a furtherance therefore Christ the Son of God gave Himself into death for my sins To believe this is to have eternal life Let us equip ourselves against the accusations of Satan with this and similar passages of Holy Scripture If he says Thou shalt be damned you tell him No for I fly to Christ who gave Himself for my sins In accusing me of being a damnable sinner you are cutting your own throat Satan You are reminding me of God s fatherly goodness toward me that He so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life In calling me a sinner Satan you really comfort me above measure With such heavenly cunning we are to meet the devil s craft and put from us the memory of sin saint Paul also presents a true picture of Christ as the virgin born Son of God delivered into death for our sins To entertain a true conception of Christ is important for the devil describes Christ as an exacting and cruel judge who condemns and punishes men Tell him that his definition of Christ is wrong that Christ has given Himself for our sins that by His sacrifice He has taken away the sins of the whole world Make ample use of this pronoun our Be assured that Christ has canceled the sins not of certain persons only but your sins Do not permit yourself to be robbed of this lovely conception of Christ Christ is no Moses no law giver no tyrant but the Mediator for sins the Giver of grace and life We know this Yet in the actual conflict with the devil when he scares us with the Law when he frightens us with the very person of the Mediator when he misquotes the words of Christ and distorts for us our Savior we so easily lose sight of our sweet High Priest For this reason I am so anxious for you to gain a true picture of Christ out of the words of Paul who gave himself for our sins Obviously Christ is no judge to condemn us for He gave Himself for our sins He does not trample the fallen but raises them He comforts the broken hearted Otherwise Paul should lie when he writes who gave himself for our sins I do not bother my head with speculations about the nature of God I simply attach myself to the human Christ and I find joy and peace and the wisdom of God in Him These are not new truths I am repeating what the apostles and all teachers of God have taught long ago Would to God we could impregnate our hearts with these truths VERSE four That he might deliver us from this present evil world Paul calls this present world evil because everything in it is subject to the malice of the devil who reigns over the whole world as his domain and fills the air with ignorance contempt hatred and disobedience of God In this devil s kingdom we live As long as a person is in the world he cannot by his own efforts rid himself of sin because the world is bent upon evil The people of the world are the slaves of the devil If we are not in the Kingdom of Christ it is certain we belong to the kingdom of Satan and we are pressed into his service with every talent we possess Take the talents of wisdom and integrity Without Christ wisdom is double foolishness and integrity double sin because they not only fail to perceive the wisdom and righteousness of Christ but hinder and blaspheme the salvation of Christ Paul justly calls it the evil or wicked world for when the world is at its best the world is at its worst The grossest vices are small faults in comparison with the wisdom and righteousness of the world These prevent men from accepting the Gospel of the righteousness of Christ The white devil of spiritual sin is far more dangerous than the black devil of carnal sin because the wiser the better men are without Christ the more they are likely to ignore and oppose the Gospel With the words that he might deliver us Paul argues that we stand in need of Christ No other being can possibly deliver us from this present evil world Do not let the fact disturb you that a great many people enjoy excellent reputations without Christ Remember what Paul says that the world with all its wisdom might and righteousness is the devil s own God alone is able to deliver us from the world Let us praise and thank God for His mercy in delivering us from the captivity of Satan when we were unable to do so by our own strength Let us confess with Paul that all our work righteousness is loss and dung Let us condemn as filthy rags all talk about free will all religious orders masses ceremonies vows fastings and the like In branding the world the devil s kingdom of iniquity ignorance error sin death and everlasting despair Paul at the same time declares the Kingdom of Christ to be a kingdom of equity light grace remission of sin peace saving health and everlasting life into which we are translated by our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever In this passage Paul contends against the false apostles for the article of Justification Christ says Paul has delivered us from this wicked kingdom of the devil and the world according to the good will the pleasure and commandment of the Father Hence we are not delivered by our own will or shrewdness or wisdom but by the mercy and love of God as it is written I John four ten Herein is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins Another reason why Paul like John emphasizes the Father s will is Christ s habit of directing attention to the Father For Christ came into the world to reconcile God with us and to draw us to the Father Not by curious inquiries into the nature of God shall we know God and His purpose for our salvation but by taking hold of Christ who according to the will of the Father has given Himself into death for our sins When we understand this to be the will of the Father in Christ then shall we know God to be merciful and not angry We shall realize that He loved us wretched sinners so much indeed that He gave us His only begotten Son into death for us The pronoun our refers to both God and Father He is our God and our Father Christ s Father and our Father are one and the same Hence Christ said to Mary Magdalene Go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my Father and your Father and to my God and your God God is our Father and our God but only in Christ Jesus VERSE five To whom be glory for ever and ever Amen Hebrew writing is interspersed with expressions of praise and gratitude This peculiarity can be traced in the apostolic writings particularly in those of Paul The name of the Lord is to be mentioned with great reverence and thanksgiving VERSE six I marvel How patiently Paul deals with his seduced Galatians He does not pounce on them but like a father he fairly excuses their error With motherly affection he talks to them yet he does it in a way that at the same time he also reproves them On the other hand he is highly indignant at the seducers whom he blames for the apostasy of the Galatians His anger bursts forth in elemental fury at the beginning of his epistle If any may he cries preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed Later on in the fifth chapter he threatens the false apostles with damnation He that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be He pronounces a curse upon them I would they were even cut off which trouble you He might have addressed the Galatians after this fashion I am ashamed of you Your ingratitude grieves me I am angry with you But his purpose was to call them back to the Gospel With this purpose in his mind he speaks very gently to them He could not have chosen a milder expression than this I marvel It indicates his sorrow and his displeasure Paul minds the rule which he himself lays down in a later chapter where he says Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted Toward those who have been misled we are to show ourselves parentally affectionate so that they may perceive that we seek not their destruction but their salvation Over against the devil and his missionaries the authors of false doctrines and sects we ought to be like the Apostle impatient and rigorously condemnatory as parents are with the dog that bites their little one but the weeping child itself they soothe The right spirit in Paul supplies him with an extraordinary facility in handling the afflicted consciences of the fallen The Pope and his bishops inspired by the desire to lord it over men s souls crack out thunders and curses upon miserable consciences They have no care for the saving of men s souls They are interested only in maintaining their position VERSE six That ye are so soon Paul deplores the fact that it is difficult for the mind to retain a sound and steadfast faith A man labors for a decade before he succeeds in training his little church into orderly religion and then some ignorant and vicious poltroon comes along to overthrow in a minute the patient labor of years By the grace of God we have effected here in Wittenberg the form of a Christian church The Word of God is taught as it should be the Sacraments are administered and everything is prosperous This happy condition secured by many years of arduous labors some lunatic might spoil in a moment This happened in the churches of Galatia which Paul had brought into life in spiritual travail Soon after his departure however these Galatian churches were thrown into confusion by the false apostles The church is a tender plant It must be watched People hear a couple of sermons scan a few pages of Holy Writ and think they know it all They are bold because they have never gone through any trials of faith Void of the Holy Spirit they teach what they please as long as it sounds good to the common people who are ever ready to join something new We have to watch out for the devil lest he sow tares among the wheat while we sleep No sooner had Paul turned his back on the churches of Galatia than the false apostles went to work Therefore let us watch over ourselves and over the whole church VERSE six I marvel that ye are so soon removed Again the Apostle puts in a gentle word He does not berate the Galatians I marvel that ye are so unsteady unfaithful He says I marvel that ye are so soon removed He does not address them as evildoers He speaks to them as people who have suffered great loss He condemns those who removed them rather than the Galatians At the same time he gently reproves them for permitting themselves to be removed The criticism is implied that they should have been rather a little more settled in their beliefs If they had taken better hold of the Word they could not have been removed so easily Jerome thinks that Paul is playing upon the name Galatians deriving it from the Hebrew word Galath which means fallen or carried away as though Paul wanted to say You are true Galatians i e fallen away in name and in fact Some believe that the Germans are descended from the Galatians There may be something to that For the Germans are not unlike the Galatians in their lack of constancy At first we Germans are very enthusiastic but presently our emotions cool and we become slack When the light of the Gospel first came to us many were zealous heard sermons greedily and held the ministry of God s Word in high esteem But now that religion has been reformed many who formerly were such earnest disciples have discarded the Word of God have become sow bellies like the foolish and inconsistent Galatians VERSE six From him that called you into the grace of Christ The reading is a little doubtful The sentence may be construed to read From that Christ that called you into grace or it may be construed to read From God that called you into the grace of Christ I prefer the former for it seems to me that Paul s purpose is to impress upon us the benefits of Christ This reading also preserves the implied criticism that the Galatians withdrew themselves from that Christ who had called them not unto the law but unto grace With Paul we decry the blindness and perverseness of men in that they will not receive the message of grace and salvation or having received it they quickly let go of it in spite of the fact that the Gospel bestows all good things spiritual forgiveness of sins true righteousness peace of conscience everlasting life and all good things temporal good judgment good government and peace Why does the world abhor the glad tidings of the Gospel and the blessings that go with it Because the world is the devil s Under his direction the world persecutes the Gospel and would if it could nail again Christ the Son of God to the Cross although He gave Himself into death for the sins of the world The world dwells in darkness The world is darkness Paul accentuates the point that the Galatians had been called by Christ unto grace I taught you the doctrine of grace and of liberty from the Law from sin and wrath that you should be free in Christ and not slaves to the hard laws of Moses Will you allow yourselves to be carried away so easily from the living fountain of grace and life VERSE six Unto another gospel Note the resourcefulness of the devil Heretics do not advertise their errors Murderers adulterers thieves disguise themselves So the devil masquerades all his devices and activities He puts on white to make himself look like an angel of light He is astoundingly clever to sell his patent poison for the Gospel of Christ Knowing Satan s guile Paul sardonically calls the doctrine of the false apostles another gospel as if he would say You Galatians have now another gospel while my Gospel is no longer esteemed by you We infer from this that the false apostles had depreciated the Gospel of Paul among the Galatians on the plea that it was incomplete Their objection to Paul s Gospel is identical to that recorded in the fifteenth chapter of the Book of Acts to the effect that it was not enough for the Galatians to believe in Christ or to be baptized but that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses for except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses ye cannot be saved As though Christ were a workman who had begun a building and left it for Moses to finish Today the Anabaptists and others finding it difficult to condemn us accuse us Lutherans of timidity in professing the whole truth They grant that we have laid the foundation in Christ but claim that we have failed to go through with the building In this way these perverse fanatics parade their cursed doctrine as the Word of God and flying the flag of God s name they deceive many The devil knows better than to appear ugly and black He prefers to carry on his nefarious activities in the name of God Hence the German proverb All mischief begins in the name of God When the devil sees that he cannot hurt the cause of the Gospel by destructive methods he does it under the guise of correcting and advancing the cause of the Gospel He would like best of all to persecute us with fire and sword but this method has availed him little because through the blood of martyrs the church has been watered Unable to prevail by force he engages wicked and ungodly teachers who at first make common cause with us then claim that they are particularly called to teach the hidden mysteries of the Scriptures to superimpose upon the first principles of Christian doctrine that we teach This sort of thing brings the Gospel into trouble May we all cling to the Word of Christ against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places VERSE seven Which is not another but there be some that trouble you Here again the apostle excuses the Galatians while he blames the false apostles for disturbing their consciences and for stealing them out of his hand How angry he gets at these deceivers He calls them troublemakers seducers of poor consciences This passage adduces further evidence that the false apostles defamed Paul as an imperfect apostle and a weak and erroneous preacher They condemn Paul Paul condemns them Such warfare of condemnation is always going on in the church The papists and the fanatics hate us condemn our doctrine and want to kill us We in turn hate and condemn their cursed doctrine In the meanwhile the people are uncertain whom to follow and which way to turn for it is not given to everybody to judge these matters But the truth will win out So much is certain we persecute no man neither does our doctrine trouble men On the contrary we have the testimony of many good men who thank God on their knees for the consolation that our doctrine has brought them Like Paul we are not to blame that the churches have trouble The fault lies with the Anabaptists and other fanatics Every teacher of work righteousness is a trouble maker Has it never occurred to you that the pope cardinals bishops monks and that the whole synagogue of Satan are trouble makers The truth is they are worse than false apostles The false apostles taught that in addition to faith in Christ the works of the Law of God were necessary unto salvation But the papists omit faith altogether and teach self devised traditions and works that are not commanded of God indeed are contrary to the Word of God and for these traditions they demand preferred attention and obedience Paul calls the false apostles troublers of the church because they taught circumcision and the keeping of the Law as needful unto salvation They insisted that the Law must be observed in every detail They were supporters in this contention by the Jews with the result that those who were not firmly established in faith were easily persuaded that Paul was not a sincere teacher of God because he ignored the Law The Jews were offended at the idea that the Law of God should be entirely ignored by Paul and that the Gentiles former idol worshippers should gratuitously attain to the station of God s people without circumcision without the penitentiary performance of the law by grace alone through faith in Christ Jesus These criticisms were amplified by the false apostles They accused Paul of designs to abolish the law of God and the Jewish dispensation contrary to the law of God contrary to their Jewish heritage contrary to apostolic example contrary to Paul s own example They demanded that Paul be shunned as a blasphemer and a rebel while they were to be heard as true teachers of the Gospel and authentic disciples of the apostles Thus Paul stood defamed among the Galatians He was forced to attack the false apostles He did so without hesitation VERSE seven And would pervert the gospel of Christ To paraphrase this sentence These false apostles do not merely trouble you they abolish Christ s Gospel They act as if they were the only true Gospel preachers For all that they muddle Law and Gospel As a result they pervert the Gospel Either Christ must live and the Law perish or the Law remains and Christ must perish Christ and the Law cannot dwell side by side in the conscience It is either grace or law To muddle the two is to eliminate the Gospel of Christ entirely It seems a small matter to mingle the Law and Gospel faith and works but it creates more mischief than man s brain can conceive To mix Law and Gospel not only clouds the knowledge of grace it cuts out Christ altogether The words of Paul and would pervert the gospel of Christ also indicate how arrogant these false apostles were They were shameless boasters Paul simply had to exalt his own ministry and Gospel VERSE eight But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed Paul s zeal for the Gospel becomes so fervent that it almost leads him to curse angels I would rather that I my brethren yes the angels of heaven be anathematized than that my gospel be overthrown The Greek word anathema Hebrew herem means to accurse execrate to damn Paul first hypothetically curses himself Knowing persons first find fault with themselves in order that they may all the more earnestly reprove others Paul maintains that there is no other gospel besides the one he had preached to the Galatians He preached not a gospel of his own invention but the very same Gospel God had long ago prescribed in the Sacred Scriptures No wonder Paul pronounces curses upon himself and upon others upon the angels of heaven if anyone should dare to preach any other gospel than Christ s own VERSE nine As we said before so say I now again If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed Paul repeats the curse directing it now upon other persons Before he cursed himself his brethren and an angel from heaven Now he says if there are any others who preach a gospel different from that you have received from us let them also be accursed Paul herewith curses and excommunicates all false teachers including his opponents He is so worked up that he dares to curse all who pervert his Gospel Would to God that this terrible pronouncement of the Apostle might strike fear into the hearts of all who pervert the Gospel of Paul The Galatians might say Paul we do not pervert the Gospel you have brought unto us We did not quite understand it That is all Now these teachers who came after you have explained everything so beautifully This explanation the Apostle refuses to accept They must add nothing they must correct nothing What you received from me is the genuine Gospel of God Let it stand If any man brings any other gospel than the one I brought you or promises to deliver better things than you have received from me let him be accursed In spite of this emphatic denunciation so many accept the pope as the supreme judge of the Scriptures The Church they say chose only four gospels The Church might have chosen more Ergo the Church is above the Gospel With equal force one might argue I approve the Scriptures Ergo I am above the Scriptures John the Baptist confessed Christ Hence he is above Christ Paul subordinates himself all preachers all the angels of heaven everybody to the Sacred Scriptures We are not the masters judges or arbiters but witnesses disciples and confessors of the Scriptures whether we be pope Luther Augustine Paul or an angel from heaven VERSE ten For do I now persuade men or God With the same vehemence Paul continues You Galatians ought to be able to tell from my preaching and from the many afflictions which I have endured whether I serve men or God Everybody can see that my preaching has stirred up persecution against me everywhere and has earned for me the cruel hatred of my own people in fact the hatred of all men This should convince you that by my preaching I do not seek the favor and praise of men but the glory of God No man can say that we are seeking the favor and praise of men with our doctrine We teach that all men are naturally depraved We condemn man s free will his strength wisdom and righteousness We say that we obtain grace by the free mercy of God alone for Christ s sake This is no preaching to please men This sort of preaching procures for us the hatred and disfavor of the world persecutions excommunications murders and curses Can t you see that I seek no man s favor by my doctrine asks Paul If I were anxious for the favor of men I would flatter them But what do I do I condemn their works I teach things only that I have been commanded to teach from above For that I bring down upon my head the wrath of Jews and Gentiles My doctrine must be right It must be divine Any other doctrine cannot be better than mine Any other doctrine must be false and wicked With Paul we boldly pronounce a curse upon every doctrine that does not agree with ours We do not preach for the praise of men or the favor of princes We preach for the favor of God alone whose grace and mercy we proclaim Whosoever teaches a gospel contrary to ours or different from ours let us be bold to say that he is sent of the devil VERSE ten Or do I seek to please men Do I serve men or God Paul keeps an eye on the false apostles those flatterers of men They taught circumcision to avoid the hatred and persecution of men To this day you will find many who seek to please men in order that they may live in peace and security They teach whatever is agreeable to men no matter whether it is contrary to God s Word or their own conscience But we who endeavor to please God and not men stir up hell itself We must suffer reproach slanders death For those who go about to please men we have a word from Christ recorded in the fifth chapter of saint John How can ye believe which receive honor one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from God alone VERSE ten For if I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ Observe the consummate cleverness with which the false apostles went about to bring Paul into disrepute They combed Paul s writings for contradictions our opponents do the same to accuse him of teaching contradictory things They found that Paul had circumcised Timothy according to the Law that Paul had purified himself with four other men in the Temple at Jerusalem that Paul had shaven his head at Cenchrea The false apostles slyly suggested that Paul had been constrained by the other apostles to observe these ceremonial laws We know that Paul observed these decora out of charitable regard for the weak brethren He did not want to offend them But the false apostles turned Paul s charitable regard to his disadvantage If Paul had preached the Law and circumcision if he had commended the strength and free will of man he would not have been so obnoxious to the Jews On the contrary they would have praised his every action VERSES eleven twelve But I certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man For I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ This passage constitutes Paul s chief defense against the accusations of his opponents He maintains under oath that he received his Gospel not from men but by the revelation of Jesus Christ In declaring that his Gospel is not after man Paul does not merely wish to state that his Gospel is not mundane The false apostles made the same claim for their gospel Paul means to say that he learned his Gospel not in the usual and accepted manner through the agency of men by hearing reading or writing He received the Gospel by special revelation directly from Jesus Christ Paul received his Gospel on the way to Damascus when Christ appeared to him saint Luke furnishes an account of the incident in the ninth chapter of the Book of Acts Arise said Christ to Paul and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do Christ did not send Paul into the city to learn the Gospel from Ananias Ananias was only to baptize Paul to lay his hands on Paul to commit the ministry of the Word unto Paul and to recommend him to the Church Ananias recognized his limited assignment when he said to Paul Brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost Paul did not receive instruction from Ananias Paul had already been called enlightened and taught by Christ in the road His contact with Ananias was merely a testimonial to the fact that Paul had been called by Christ to preach the Gospel Paul was forced to speak of his conversion to combat the slanderous contention of the false apostles to the effect that this apostleship was inferior to that of the other apostles If it were not for the example of the Galatian churches I would never have thought it possible that anybody who had received the Word of God with such eagerness as they had could so quickly let go of it Good Lord what terrible mischief one single false statement can create The article of justification is fragile Not in itself of course but in us I know how quickly a person can forfeit the joy of the Gospel I know in what slippery places even those stand who seem to have a good footing in the matters of faith In the midst of the conflict when we should be consoling ourselves with the Gospel the Law rears up and begins to rage all over our conscience I say the Gospel is frail because we are frail What makes matters worse is that one half of ourselves our own reason stands against us The flesh resists the spirit or as Paul puts it The flesh lusteth against the Spirit Therefore we teach that to know Christ and to believe in Him is no achievement of man but the gift of God God alone can create and preserve faith in us God creates faith in us through the Word He increases strengthens and confirms faith in us through His word Hence the best service that anybody can render God is diligently to hear and read God s Word On the other hand nothing is more perilous than to be weary of the Word of God Thinking he knows enough a person begins little by little to despise the Word until he has lost Christ and the Gospel altogether Let every believer carefully learn the Gospel Let him continue in humble prayer We are molested not by puny foes but by mighty ones foes who never grow tired of warring against us These our enemies are many Our own flesh the world the Law sin death the wrath and judgment of God and the devil himself The arguments which the false apostles advanced impress people to this day Who are you to dissent from the fathers and the entire Church and to bring a contradictory doctrine Are you wiser than so many holy men wiser than the whole Church When Satan abetted by our own reason advances these arguments against us we lose heart unless we keep on saying to ourselves I don t care if Cyprian Ambrose Augustine Peter Paul John or an angel from heaven teaches so and so I know that I teach the truth of God in Christ Jesus When I first took over the defense of the Gospel I remembered what Doctor Staupitz said to me I like it well he said that the doctrine which you proclaim gives glory to God alone and none to man For never can too much glory goodness and mercy be ascribed unto God These words of the worthy Doctor comforted and confirmed me The Gospel is true because it deprives men of all glory wisdom and righteousness and turns over all honor to the Creator alone It is safer to attribute too much glory unto God than unto man You may argue that the Church and the fathers are holy Yet the Church is compelled to pray Forgive us our trespasses I am not to be believed nor is the Church to be believed or the fathers or the apostles or an angel from heaven if they teach anything contrary to the Word of God Let the Word of God abide forever Peter erred in life and in doctrine Paul might have dismissed Peter s error as a matter of no consequence But Paul saw that Peter s error would lead to the damage of the whole Church unless it were corrected Therefore he withstood Peter to his face The Church Peter the apostles angels from heaven are not to be heard unless they teach the genuine Word of God This argument is not always to our advantage People ask Whom then shall we believe Our opponents maintain that they teach the pure Word of God We do not believe them They in turn hate and persecute us for vile heretics What can we do about it With Paul we glory in the Gospel of Jesus Christ What do we gain We are told that our glorying is idle vanity and unadulterated blasphemy The moment we abase ourselves and give in to the rage of our opponents Papists and Anabaptists grow arrogant The Anabaptists hatch out some new monstrosity The Papists revive their old abominations What to do Let everybody become sure of his calling and doctrine that he may boldly say with Paul But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than ye have received let him be accursed VERSES thirteen fourteen For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God and wasted it And profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation This passage does not contain doctrine Paul adduces his own case for an example I have he says at one time defended the traditions of the Pharisees more fiercely than any of your false apostles Now if the righteousness of the Law had been worth anything I would never have forsaken it So carefully did I live up to the Law that I excelled many of my companions So zealous was I in defense of the Law that I wasted the church of God VERSE fourteen Being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers Speaking now of the Mosaic Law Paul declares that he was wrapped up in it To the Philippians he wrote As touching the law a Pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless He means to say I can compare myself with the best and holiest of all those who are of the circumcision Let them show me if they can a more earnest defender of the Mosaic Law than I was at one time This fact O Galatians should have put you on your guard against these deceivers who make so much of the Law If anybody ever had reason to glory in the righteousness of the Law it was I I too may say that before I was enlightened by the Gospel I was as zealous for the papistical laws and traditions of the fathers as ever a man was I tried hard to live up to every law as best I could I punished myself with fasting watching praying and other exercises more than all those who today hate and persecute me I was so much in earnest that I imposed upon my body more than it could stand I honored the pope as a matter of conscience Whatever I did I did with a single heart to the glory of God But our opponents well fed idlers that they are will not believe what I and many others have endured VERSES fifteen sixteen seventeen But when it pleased God who separated me from my mother s womb and called me by his grace To reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the heathen immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus Here Paul relates that immediately upon being called by God to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles he went into Arabia without consulting a single person When it had pleased God he writes I did not deserve it I had been an enemy of Christ I had blasphemed His Gospel I had shed innocent blood In the midst of my frenzy I was called Why On account of my outrageous cruelty Indeed not My gracious God who shows mercy unto whom He will pardoned all mine iniquities He bestowed His grace upon me and called me for an apostle We also have come to the knowledge of the truth by the same kindness of God I crucified Christ daily in my cloistered life and blasphemed God by my wrong faith Outwardly I kept myself chaste poor and obedient I was much given to fasting watching praying saying of masses and the like Yet under the cloak of my outward respectability I continually mistrusted doubted feared hated and blasphemed God My righteousness was a filthy puddle Satan loves such saints They are his darlings for they quickly destroy their body and soul by depriving them of the blessings of God s generous gifts I tell you I stood in awe of the pope s authority To dissent from him I considered a crime worthy of eternal death I thought of John Huss as a cursed heretic I counted it a sin even to think of him I would gladly have furnished the wood to burn him I would have felt I had done God a real service In comparison with these sanctimonious hypocrites of the papacy publicans and harlots are not bad They at least feel remorse They at least do not try to justify their wicked deeds But these pretended saints so far from acknowledging their errors justify them and regard them as acceptable sacrifices unto God VERSE fifteen When it pleased God By the favor of God I a wicked and cursed wretch a blasphemer persecutor and rebel was spared Not content to spare me God granted unto me the knowledge of His salvation His Spirit His Son the office of an apostle everlasting life Paul speaking God not only pardoned our iniquities but in addition overwhelmed us with blessings and spiritual gifts Many however are ungrateful Worse by opening again a window to the devil many begin to loathe God s Word and end by perverting the Gospel VERSE fifteen Who separated me from my mother s womb This is a Hebrew expression meaning to sanctify ordain prepare Paul is saying When I was not yet born God ordained me to be an apostle and in due time confirmed my apostleship before the world Every gift be it small or great spiritual or temporal and every good thing I should ever do God has ordained while I was yet in my mother s womb where I could neither think nor perform any good thing After I was born God supported me Heaping mercy upon mercy He freely forgave my sins replenishing me with His grace to enable me to learn what great things are ours in Christ To crown it all He called me to preach the Gospel to others VERSE fifteen And called me by his grace Did God call me on account of my holy life Or on account of my pharisaical religion Or on account of my prayers fastings and works Never Well then it is certain God did not call me on account of my blasphemies persecutions oppressions What prompted Him to call me His grace alone VERSE sixteen To reveal his Son to me We now hear what kind of doctrine was committed to Paul The doctrine of the Gospel the doctrine of the revelation of the Son of God This doctrine differs greatly from the Law The Law terrorizes the conscience The Law reveals the wrath and judgment of God The Gospel does not threaten The Gospel announces that Christ is come to forgive the sins of the world The Gospel conveys to us the inestimable treasures of God VERSE sixteen That I might preach him among the heathen It pleased God says the Apostle to reveal himself in me Why For a twofold purpose That I personally should believe in the Son of God and that I should reveal Him to the Gentiles Paul does not mention the Jews for the simple reason that he was the called and acknowledged apostle of the Gentiles although he preached Christ also to the Jews We can hear the Apostle saying to himself I will not burden the Gentiles with the Law because I am their apostle and not their lawgiver Not once did you Galatians hear me speak of the righteousness of the Law or of works My job was to bring you the Gospel Therefore you ought to listen to no teachers of the Law but the Gospel not Moses but the Son of God not the righteousness of works but the righteousness of faith must be proclaimed to the Gentiles That is the right kind of preaching for Gentiles VERSE sixteen Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood Once Paul had received the Gospel from Christ he conferred with nobody in Damascus He asked no man to teach him He did not go up to Jerusalem to sit at the feet of Peter and the other apostles At once he preached Jesus Christ in Damascus VERSE seventeen Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus I went to Arabia before I saw any of the apostles I took it upon myself to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles without delay because Christ had called me for that purpose This statement refutes the assertion of the false apostles that Paul had been a pupil of the apostles from which the false apostles inferred that Paul had been instructed in the obedience of the Law that therefore the Gentiles also ought to keep the Law and submit to circumcision VERSES eighteen nineteen Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him fifteen days But other of the apostles saw I none save James the Lord s brother Paul minutely recounts his personal history to stop the cavil of the false apostles Paul does not deny that he had been with some of the apostles He went to Jerusalem uninvited not to be instructed but to visit with Peter Luke reports the occasion in the ninth chapter of the Book of Acts Barnabas introduced Paul to the apostles and related to them how Paul had met the Lord Jesus on the way to Damascus also how Paul had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus Paul says that he saw Peter and James but he denies that he learned anything from them Why does Paul harp on this seemingly unimportant fact To convince the churches of Galatia that his Gospel was the true Word of Christ which he learned from Christ Himself and from no man Paul was forced to affirm and re affirm this fact His usefulness to all the churches that had used him as their pastor and teacher was at stake VERSE twenty Now the things which I write unto you behold before God I lie not Was it necessary for Paul to go under oath Yes Paul is reporting personal history How else would the churches believe him The false apostles might say Who knows whether Paul is telling the truth Paul the elect vessel of God was held in so little esteem by his own Galatians to whom he had preached Christ that it was necessary for him to swear an oath that he spoke the truth If this happened to Paul what business have we to complain when people doubt our words or hold us in little regard we who cannot begin to compare ourselves with the Apostle VERSE twenty one Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia Syria and Cilicia are adjacent countries Paul traces his movements carefully in order to convince the Galatians that he had never been the disciple of any apostle VERSES twenty two twenty three twenty four And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ But they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed And they glorified God in me In Syria and Cilicia Paul won the indorsement of all the churches of Judea by his preaching All the churches everywhere even those of Judea could testify that he had preached the same faith everywhere And Paul adds these churches glorified God in me not because I taught that circumcision and the law of Moses should be observed but because I urged upon all faith in the Lord Jesus Christ CHAPTER two VERSE one Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem Paul taught justification by faith in Christ Jesus without the deeds of the Law He reported this to the disciples at Antioch Among the disciples were some that had been brought up in the ancient customs of the Jews These rose against Paul in quick indignation accusing him of propagating a gospel of lawlessness Great dissension followed Paul and Barnabas stood up for the truth They testified Wherever we preached to the Gentiles the Holy Ghost came upon those who received the Word This happened everywhere We preached not circumcision we did not require observance of the Law We preached faith in Jesus Christ At our preaching of faith God gave to the hearers the Holy Ghost From this fact Paul and Barnabas inferred that the Holy Ghost approved the faith of the Gentiles without the Law and circumcision If the faith of the Gentiles had not pleased the Holy Ghost He would not have manifested His presence in the uncircumcised hearers of the Word Unconvinced the Jews fiercely opposed Paul asserting that the Law ought to be kept and that the Gentiles ought to be circumcised or else they could not be saved When we consider the obstinacy with which Romanists cling to their traditions we can very well understand the zealous devotion of the Jews for the Law After all they had received the Law from God We can understand how impossible it was for recent converts from Judaism suddenly to break with the Law For that matter God did bear with them as He bore with the infirmity of Israel when the people halted between two religions Was not God patient with us also while we were blindfolded by the papacy God is longsuffering and full of mercy But we dare not abuse the patience of the Lord We dare no longer continue in error now that the truth has been revealed in the Gospel The opponents of Paul had his own example to prefer against him Paul had circumcised Timothy Paul defended his action on the ground that he had circumcised Timothy not from compulsion but from Christian love lest the weak in faith should be offended His opponents would not accept Paul s explanation When Paul saw that the quarrel was getting out of hand he obeyed the direction of God and left for Jerusalem there to confer with the other apostles He did this not for his own sake but for the sake of the people VERSE one With Barnabas and took Titus with me also Paul chose two witnesses Barnabas and Titus Barnabas had been Paul s preaching companion to the Gentiles Barnabas was an eye witness of the fact that the Holy Ghost had come upon the Gentiles in response to the simple preaching of faith in Jesus Christ Barnabas stuck to Paul on this point that it was not necessary for the Gentiles to be bothered with the Law as long as they believed in Christ Titus was superintendent of the churches in Crete having been placed in charge of the churches by Paul Titus was a former Gentile VERSE two And I went up by revelation If God had not ordered Paul to Jerusalem Paul would never have gone there VERSE two And communicated unto them that gospel After an absence of fourteen years respectively eighteen years Paul returned to Jerusalem to confer with the other apostles VERSE two Which I preach among the Gentiles Among the Jews Paul allowed Law and circumcision to stand for the time being So did all the apostles Nevertheless Paul held fast to the liberty of the Gospel On one occasion he said to the Jews Through this man Christ is preached unto you forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses Acts thirteen thirty nine Always remembering the weak Paul did not insist that they break at once with the Law Paul admits that he conferred with the apostles concerning his Gospel But he denies that the conference benefited or taught him anything The fact is he resisted those who wanted to force the practice of the Law upon the Gentiles They did not overcome him he overcame them Your false apostles lie when they say that I circumcised Timothy shaved my head in Cenchrea and went up to Jerusalem at the request of the apostles I went to Jerusalem at the request of God What is more I won the indorsement of the apostles My opponents lost out The matter upon which the apostles deliberated in conference was this Is the observance of the Law requisite unto justification Paul answered I have preached faith in Christ to the Gentiles and not the Law If the Jews want to keep the Law and be circumcised very well as long as they do so from a right motive VERSE two But privately to them which were of reputation This is to say I conferred not only with the brethren but with the leaders among them VERSE two Lest by any means I should run or had run in vain Not that Paul himself ever thought he had run in vain However many did think that Paul had preached the Gospel in vain because he kept the Gentiles free from the yoke of the Law The opinion that obedience to the Law was mandatory unto salvation was gaining ground Paul meant to remedy this evil By this conference he hoped to establish the identity of his Gospel with that of the other apostles to stop the talk of his opponents that he had been running around in vain VERSE three But neither Titus who was with me being a Greek was compelled to be circumcised The word compelled acquaints us with the outcome of the conference It was resolved that the Gentiles should not be compelled to be circumcised Paul did not condemn circumcision in itself Neither by word nor deed did he ever inveigh against circumcision But he did protest against circumcision being made a condition for salvation He cited the case of the Fathers The fathers were not justified by circumcision It was to them a sign and seal of righteousness They looked upon circumcision as a confession of their faith The believing Jews however could not get it through their heads that circumcision was not necessary for salvation They were encouraged in their wrong attitude by the false apostles The result was that the people were up in arms against Paul and his doctrine Paul did not condemn circumcision as if it were a sin to receive it But he insisted and the conference upheld him that circumcision had no bearing upon salvation and was therefore not to be forced upon the Gentiles The conference agreed that the Jews should be permitted to keep their ancient customs for the time being so long as they did not regard those customs as conveying God s justification of the sinner The false apostles were dissatisfied with the verdict of the conference They did not want to rest circumcision and the practice of the Law in Christian liberty They insisted that circumcision was obligatory unto salvation As the opponents of Paul so our own adversaries Luther s the enemies of the Reformation contend that the traditions of the Fathers dare not be neglected without loss of salvation Our opponents will not agree with us on anything They defend their blasphemies They go as far to enforce them with the sword Paul s victory was complete Titus who was with Paul was not compelled to be circumcised although he stood in the midst of the apostles when this question of circumcision was debated This was a blow to the false apostles With the living fact that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised Paul was able to squelch his adversaries VERSES forty five And that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage To whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you Paul here explains his motive for going up to Jerusalem He did not go to Jerusalem to be instructed or confirmed in his Gospel by the other apostles He went to Jerusalem in order to preserve the true Gospel for the Galatian churches and for all the churches of the Gentiles When Paul speaks of the truth of the Gospel he implies by contrast a false gospel The false apostles also had a gospel but it was an untrue gospel In holding out against them says Paul I conserved the truth of the pure Gospel Now the true Gospel has it that we are justified by faith alone without the deeds of the Law The false gospel has it that we are justified by faith but not without the deeds of the Law The false apostles preached a conditional gospel So do the papists They admit that faith is the foundation of salvation But they add the conditional clause that faith can save only when it is furnished with good works This is wrong The true Gospel declares that good works are the embellishment of faith but that faith itself is the gift and work of God in our hearts Faith is able to justify because it apprehends Christ the Redeemer Human reason can think only in terms of the Law It mumbles This I have done this I have not done But faith looks to Jesus Christ the Son of God given into death for the sins of the whole world To turn one s eyes away from Jesus means to turn them to the Law True faith lays hold of Christ and leans on Him alone Our opponents cannot understand this In their blindness they cast away the precious pearl Christ and hang onto their stubborn works They have no idea what faith is How can they teach faith to others Not satisfied with teaching an untrue gospel the false apostles tried to entangle Paul They went about says Paul to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage When Paul saw through their scheme he attacked the false apostles He says We did not let go of the liberty which we have in Christ Jesus We routed them by the judgment of the apostles and we would not give in to them no not an inch We too were willing to make all kinds of concessions to the papists Yes we are willing to offer them more than we should But we will not give up the liberty of conscience which we have in Christ Jesus We refuse to have our conscience bound by any work or law so that by doing this or that we should be righteous or leaving this or that undone we should be damned Since our opponents will not let it stand that only faith in Christ justifies we will not yield to them On the question of justification we must remain adamant or else we shall lose the truth of the Gospel It is a matter of life and death It involves the death of the Son of God who died for the sins of the world If we surrender faith in Christ as the only thing that can justify us the death and resurrection of Jesus are without meaning that Christ is the Savior of the world would be a myth God would be a liar because He would not have fulfilled His promises Our stubbornness is right because we want to preserve the liberty which we have in Christ Only by preserving our liberty shall we be able to retain the truth of the Gospel inviolate Some will object that the Law is divine and holy Let it be divine and holy The Law has no right to tell me that I must be justified by it The Law has the right to tell me that I should love God and my neighbor that I should live in chastity temperance patience et cetera The Law has no right to tell me how I may be delivered from sin death and hell It is the Gospel s business to tell me that I must listen to the Gospel It tells me not what I must do but what Jesus Christ the Son of God has done for me To conclude Paul refused to circumcise Titus for the reason that the false apostles wanted to compel him to circumcise Titus Paul refused to accede to their demands If they had asked it on the plea of brotherly love Paul would not have denied them But because they demanded it on the ground that it was necessary for salvation Paul defied them and prevailed Titus was not circumcised VERSE six But of those who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me This is a good point in Paul s refutation Paul disparages the authority and dignity of the true apostles He says of them Which seemed to be somewhat The authority of the apostles was indeed great in all the churches Paul did not want to detract from their authority but he had to speak disparagingly of their authority in order to conserve the truth of the Gospel and the liberty of conscience The false apostles used this argument against Paul The apostles lived with Christ for three years They heard His sermons They witnessed His miracles They themselves preached and performed miracles while Christ was on earth Paul never saw Jesus in the flesh Now whom ought you to believe Paul who stands alone a mere disciple of the apostles one of the last and least or will you believe those grand apostles who were sent and confirmed by Christ Himself long before Paul What could Paul say to that He answered What they say has no bearing on the argument If the apostles were angels from heaven that would not impress me We are not now discussing the excellency of the apostles We are talking about the Word of God now and the truth of the Gospel That Gospel is more excellent than all apostles VERSE six God accepteth no man s person Paul is quoting Moses Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor nor honor the person of the mighty Lev nineteen fifteen This quotation from Moses ought to shut the mouths of the false apostles Don t you know that God is no respecter of persons cries Paul The dignity or authority of men means nothing to God The fact is that God often rejects just such who stand in the odor of sanctity and in the aura of importance In doing so God seems unjust and harsh But men need deterring examples For it is a vice with us to esteem personality more highly than the Word of God God wants us to exalt His Word and not men There must be people in high office of course But we are not to deify them The governor the mayor the preacher the teacher the scholar father mother are persons whom we are to love and revere but not to the extent that we forget God Least we attach too much importance to the person God leaves with important persons offenses and sins sometimes astounding shortcomings to show us that there is a lot of difference between any person and God David was a good king But when the people began to think too well of him down he fell into horrible sins adultery and murder Peter excellent apostle that he was denied Christ Such examples of which the Scriptures are full ought to warn us not to repose our trust in men In the papacy appearance counts for everything Indeed the whole papacy amounts to nothing more than a mere kowtowing of persons and outward mummery But God alone is to be feared and honored I would honor the Pope I would love his person if he would leave my conscience alone and not compel me to sin against God But the Pope wants to be adored himself and that cannot be done without offending God Since we must choose between one or the other let us choose God The truth is we are commissioned by God to resist the Pope for it is written We ought to obey God rather than men Acts five twenty nine We have seen how Paul refutes the argument of the false apostles concerning the authority of the apostles In order that the truth of the Gospel may continue in order that the Word of God and the righteousness of faith may be kept pure and undefiled let the apostles let an angel from heaven let Peter let Paul let them all perish VERSE six For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me The Apostle repeats I did not so confer with the apostles that they taught me anything What could they possibly teach me since Christ by His revelation had taught me all things It was but a conference and no disputation I learned nothing neither did I defend my cause I only stated what I had done that I had preached to the Gentiles faith in Christ without the Law and that in response to my preaching the Holy Ghost came down upon the Gentiles When the apostles heard this they were glad that I had taught the truth If Paul would not give in to the false apostles much less ought we to give in to our opponents I know that a Christian should be humble but against the Pope I am going to be proud and say to him You Pope I will not have you for my boss for I am sure that my doctrine is divine Such pride against the Pope is imperative for if we are not stout and proud we shall never succeed in defending the article of the righteousness of faith If the Pope would concede that God alone by His grace through Christ justifies sinners we would carry him in our arms we would kiss his feet But since we cannot obtain this concession we will give in to nobody not to all the angels in heaven not to Peter not to Paul not to a hundred emperors not to a thousand popes not to the whole world If in this matter we were to humble ourselves they would take from us the God who created us and Jesus Christ who has redeemed us by His blood Let this be our resolution that we will suffer the loss of all things the loss of our good name of life itself but the Gospel and our faith in Jesus Christ we will not stand for it that anybody take them from us VERSES seven eight But contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles Here the Apostle claims for himself the same authority which the false apostles attributed to the true apostles Paul simply inverts their argument To bolster their evil cause says he the false apostles quote the authority of the great apostles against me I can quote the same authority against them for the apostles are on my side They gave me the right hand of fellowship They approved my ministry O my Galatians do not believe the counterfeit apostles What does Paul mean by saying that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto him and that of the circumcision to Peter Did not Paul preach to the Jews while Peter preached to the Gentiles also Peter converted the Centurion Paul s custom was to enter into the synagogues of the Jews there to preach the Gospel Why then should he call himself the apostle of the Gentiles while he calls Peter the apostle of the circumcision Paul refers to the fact that the other apostles remained in Jerusalem until the destruction of the city became imminent But Paul was especially called the apostle of the Gentiles Even before the destruction of Jerusalem Jews dwelt here and there in the cities of the Gentiles Coming to a city Paul customarily entered the synagogues of the Jews and first brought to them as the children of the kingdom the glad tidings that the promises made unto the fathers were fulfilled in Jesus Christ When the Jews refused to hear these glad tidings Paul turned to the Gentiles He was the apostle of the Gentiles in a special sense as Peter was the apostle of the Jews Paul reiterates that Peter James and John the accepted pillars of the Church taught him nothing nor did they commit unto him the office of preaching the Gospel unto the Gentiles Both the knowledge of the Gospel and the commandment to preach it to the Gentiles Paul received directly from God His case was parallel to that of Peter s who was particularly commissioned to preach the Gospel to the Jews The apostles had the same charge the identical Gospel Peter did not proclaim a different Gospel nor had he appointed his fellow apostles They were equals They were all taught of God None was greater than the other none could point to prerogatives above the other To justify his usurped primacy in the Church the Pope claims that Peter was the chief of the apostles This is an impudent falsehood VERSE eight For he that wrought effectually in Peter With these words Paul refutes another argument of the false apostles What reason have the false apostles to boast that the Gospel of Peter was mighty that he converted many that he wrought great miracles and that his very shadow healed the sick These reports are true enough But where did Peter acquire this power God gave him the power I have the same power I received my power not from Peter but from the same God the same Spirit who was mighty in Peter was mighty in me also Luke corroborates Paul s statement in the words And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them Acts nineteen eleven twelve To conclude Paul is not going to be inferior to the rest of the apostles Some secular writers put Paul s boasting down as carnal pride But Paul had no personal interest in his boasting It was with him a matter of faith and doctrine The controversy was not about the glory of Paul but the glory of God the Word of God the true worship of God true religion and the righteousness of faith VERSE nine And when James Cephas and John who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision The fact is when the apostles heard that I had received the charge to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles from Christ when they heard that God had wrought many miracles through me that great numbers of the Gentiles had come to the knowledge of Christ through my ministry when they heard that the Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost without Law and circumcision by the simple preaching of faith when they heard all this they glorified God for His grace in me Hence Paul was justified in concluding that the apostles were for him and not against him VERSE nine The right hands of fellowship As if the apostles had said to him We Paul do agree with you in all things We are companions in doctrine We have the same Gospel with this difference that to you is committed the Gospel for the uncircumcised while the Gospel for the circumcision is committed unto us But this difference ought not to hinder our friendship since we preach one and the same Gospel VERSE ten Only they would that we should remember the poor the same which I also was forward to do Next to the preaching of the Gospel a true and faithful pastor will take care of the poor Where the Church is there must be the poor for the world and the devil persecute the Church and impoverish many faithful Christians Speaking of money nobody wants to contribute nowadays to the maintenance of the ministry and the erection of schools When it comes to establishing false worship and idolatry no cost is spared True religion is ever in need of money while false religions are backed by wealth VERSE eleven But when Peter was come to Antioch I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed Paul goes on in his refutation of the false apostles by saying that in Antioch he withstood Peter in the presence of the whole congregation As he stated before Paul had no small matter in hand but the chief article of the Christian religion When this article is endangered we must not hesitate to resist Peter or an angel from heaven Paul paid no regard to the dignity and position of Peter when he saw this article in danger It is written He that loveth father or mother or his own life more than me is not worthy of me Matt ten thirty seven For defending the truth in our day we are called proud and obstinate hypocrites We are not ashamed of these titles The cause we are called to defend is not Peter s cause or the cause of our parents or that of the government or that of the world but the cause of God In defense of that cause we must be firm and unyielding When he says to his face Paul accuses the false apostles of slandering him behind his back In his presence they dared not to open their mouths He tells them I did not speak evil of Peter behind his back but I withstood him frankly and openly Others may debate here whether an apostle might sin I claim that we ought not to make Peter out as faultless Prophets have erred Nathan told David that he should go ahead and build the Temple of the Lord But his prophecy was afterwards corrected by the Lord The apostles erred in thinking of the Kingdom of Christ as a worldly state Peter had heard the command of Christ Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature But if it had not been for the heavenly vision and the special command of Christ Peter would never have gone to the home of Cornelius Peter also erred in this matter of circumcision If Paul had not publicly censured him all the believing Gentiles would have been compelled to receive circumcision and accept the Jewish law We are not to attribute perfection to any man Luke reports that the contention between Paul and Barnabas was so sharp that they departed asunder one from the other The cause of their disagreement could hardly have been small since it separated these two who had been joined together for years in a holy partnership Such incidents are recorded for our consolation After all it is a comfort to know that even saints might and do sin Samson David and many other excellent men fell into grievous sins Job and Jeremiah cursed the day of their birth Elijah and Jonah became weary of life and prayed for death Such offenses on the part of the saints the Scriptures record for the comfort of those who are near despair No person has ever sunk so low that he cannot rise again On the other hand no man s standing is so secure that he may not fall If Peter fell I may fall If he rose again I may rise again We have the same gifts that they had the same Christ the same baptism and the same Gospel the same forgiveness of sins They needed these saving ordinances just as much as we do VERSE twelve For before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles The Gentiles who had been converted to faith in Christ ate meats forbidden by the Law Peter visiting some of these Gentiles ate meat and drank wine with them although he knew that these things were forbidden in the Law Paul declared that he did likewise that he became as a Jew to the Jews and to them that were without law as without law He ate and drank with the Gentiles unconcerned about the Jewish Law When he was with the Jews however he abstained from all things forbidden in the Law for he labored to serve all men that he might by all means save some Paul does not reprove Peter for transgressing the Law but for disguising his attitude to the Law VERSE twelve But when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision Paul does not accuse Peter of malice or ignorance but of lack of principle in that he abstained from meats because he feared the Jews that came from James Peter s weak attitude endangered the principle of Christian liberty It is the deduction rather than the fact which Paul reproves To eat and to drink or not to eat and drink is immaterial But to make the deduction If you eat you sin if you abstain you are righteous this is wrong Meats may be refused for two reasons First they may be refused for the sake of Christian love There is no danger connected with a refusal of meats for the sake of charity To bear with the infirmity of a brother is a good thing Paul himself taught and exemplified such thoughtfulness Secondly meats may be refused in the mistaken hope of thereby obtaining righteousness When this is the purpose of abstaining from meats we say let charity go To refrain from meats for this latter reason amounts to a denial of Christ If we must lose one or the other let us lose a friend and brother rather than God our Father Jerome who understood not this passage nor the whole epistle for that matter excuses Peter s action on the ground that it was done in ignorance But Peter offended by giving the impression that he was indorsing the Law By his example he encouraged Gentiles and Jews to forsake the truth of the Gospel If Paul had not reproved him there would have been a sliding back of Christians into the Jewish religion and a return to the burdens of the Law It is surprising that Peter excellent apostle that he was should have been guilty of such vacillation In a former council at Jerusalem he practically stood alone in defense of the truth that salvation is by faith without the Law Peter at that time valiantly defended the liberty of the Gospel But now by abstaining from meats forbidden in the Law he went against his better judgment You have no idea what danger there is in customs and ceremonies They so easily tend to error in works VERSE thirteen And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation It is marvelous how God preserved the Church by one single person Paul alone stood up for the truth for Barnabas his companion was lost to him and Peter was against him Sometimes one lone person can do more in a conference than the whole assembly I mention this to urge all to learn how properly to differentiate between the Law and the Gospel in order to avoid dissembling When it come to the article of justification we must not yield if we want to retain the truth of the Gospel When the conscience is disturbed do not seek advice from reason or from the Law but rest your conscience in the grace of God and in His Word and proceed as if you had never heard of the Law The Law has its place and its own good time While Moses was in the mountain where he talked with God face to face he had no law he made no law he administered no law But when he came down from the mountain he was a lawgiver The conscience must be kept above the Law the body under the Law Paul reproved Peter for no trifle but for the chief article of Christian doctrine which Peter s hypocrisy had endangered For Barnabas and other Jews followed Peter s example It is surprising that such good men as Peter Barnabas and others should fall into unexpected error especially in a matter which they knew so well To trust in our own strength our own goodness our own wisdom is a perilous thing Let us search the Scriptures with humility praying that we may never lose the light of the Gospel Lord increase our faith VERSE fourteen But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel No one except Paul had his eyes open Consequently it was his duty to reprove Peter and his followers for swerving from the truth of the Gospel It was no easy task for Paul to reprimand Peter To the honor of Peter it must be said that he took the correction No doubt he freely acknowledged his fault The person who can rightly divide Law and Gospel has reason to thank God He is a true theologian I must confess that in times of temptation I do not always know how to do it To divide Law and Gospel means to place the Gospel in heaven and to keep the Law on earth to call the righteousness of the Gospel heavenly and the righteousness of the Law earthly to put as much difference between the righteousness of the Gospel and that of the Law as there is difference between day and night If it is a question of faith or conscience ignore the Law entirely If it is a question of works then lift high the lantern of works and the righteousness of the Law If your conscience is oppressed with a sense of sin talk to your conscience Say You are now groveling in the dirt You are now a laboring ass Go ahead and carry your burden But why don t you mount up to heaven There the Law cannot follow you Leave the ass burdened with laws behind in the valley But your conscience let it ascend with Isaac into the mountain In civil life obedience to the law is severely required In civil life Gospel conscience grace remission of sins Christ Himself do not count but only Moses with the lawbooks If we bear in mind this distinction neither Gospel nor Law shall trespass upon each other The moment Law and sin cross into heaven i e your conscience kick them out On the other hand when grace wanders unto the earth i e into the body tell grace You have no business to be around the dreg and dung of this bodily life You belong in heaven By his compromising attitude Peter confused the separation of Law and Gospel Paul had to do something about it He reproved Peter not to embarrass him but to conserve the difference between the Gospel which justifies in heaven and the Law which justifies on earth The right separation between Law and Gospel is very important to know Christian doctrine is impossible without it Let all who love and fear God diligently learn the difference not only in theory but also in practice When your conscience gets into trouble say to yourself There is a time to die and a time to live a time to learn the Law and a time to unlearn the Law a time to hear the Gospel and a time to ignore the Gospel Let the Law now depart and let the Gospel enter for now is the right time to hear the Gospel and not the Law However when the conflict of conscience is over and external duties must be performed close your ears to the Gospel and open them wide to the Law VERSE fourteen I said unto Peter before them all If thou being a Jew livest after the manner of Gentiles and not as do the Jews why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews To live as a Jew is nothing bad To eat or not to eat pork what difference does it make But to play the Jew and for conscience sake to abstain from certain meats is a denial of Christ When Paul saw that Peter s attitude tended to this he withstood Peter and said to him You know that the observance of the Law is not needed unto righteousness You know that we are justified by faith in Christ You know that we may eat all kinds of meats Yet by your example you obligate the Gentiles to forsake Christ and to return to the Law You give them reason to think that faith is not sufficient unto salvation Peter did not say so but his example said quite plainly that the observance of the Law must be added to faith in Christ if men are to be saved From Peter s example the Gentiles could not help but draw the conclusion that the Law was necessary unto salvation If this error had been permitted to pass unchallenged Christ would have lost out altogether The controversy involved the preservation of pure doctrine In such a controversy Paul did not mind if anybody took offense VERSE fifteen We who are Jews by nature and not sinners of the Gentiles When we Jews compare ourselves with the Gentiles we look pretty good We have the Law we have good works Our rectitude dates from our birth because the Jewish religion is natural to us But all this does not make us righteous before God Peter and the others lived up to the requirements of the Law They had circumcision the covenant the promises the apostleship But because of these advantages they were not to think themselves righteous before God None of these prerogatives spell faith in Christ which alone can justify a person We do not mean to imply that the Law is bad We do not condemn the Law circumcision et cetera for their failure to justify us Paul spoke disparagingly of these ordinances because the false apostles asserted that mankind is saved by them without faith Paul could not let this assertion stand for without faith all things are deadly VERSE sixteen Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of Jesus Christ 
5245-3984-0000	train-other-500	For the sake of argument let us suppose that you could fulfill the Law in the spirit of the first commandment of God Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart It would do you no good
5245-3984-0001	train-other-500	A person simply is not justified by the works of the Law The works of the Law according to Paul include the whole Law judicial ceremonial moral
5245-3984-0002	train-other-500	Now if the performance of the moral law cannot justify how can circumcision justify when circumcision is part of the ceremonial law The demands of the Law may be fulfilled before and after justification
5245-3984-0003	train-other-500	There were many excellent men among the pagans of old men who never heard of justification They lived moral lives But that fact did not justify them Peter Paul

none	none	 yet am I not hereby justified I Cor four four 
5245-3984-0005	train-other-500	The nefarious opinion of the papists which attributes the merit of grace and the remission of sins to works must here be emphatically rejected The papists say that a good work performed before grace
5245-3984-0006	train-other-500	has been obtained is able to secure grace for a person because it is no more than right that God should reward a good deed When grace has already been obtained
5245-3984-0007	train-other-500	any good work deserves everlasting life as a due payment and reward for merit For the first God is no debtor they say
5245-3984-0008	train-other-500	but because God is good and just it is no more than right they say that He should reward a good work by granting grace for the service But when grace has already been obtained they continue God is in the position of a debtor
5245-3984-0009	train-other-500	and is in duty bound to reward a good work with the gift of eternal life This is the wicked teaching of the papacy Now if I could perform any work acceptable to God and deserving of grace
5245-3984-0010	train-other-500	and once having obtained grace my good works would continue to earn for me the right and reward of eternal life why should I stand in need of the grace of God and the suffering and death of Christ
5245-3984-0011	train-other-500	Christ would be of no benefit to me Christ s mercy would be of no use to me This shows how little insight the pope and the whole of his religious coterie have into spiritual matters
5245-3984-0012	train-other-500	and how little they concern themselves with the spiritual health of their forlorn flocks They cannot believe that the flesh is unable to think speak or do anything except against God
5245-3984-0013	train-other-500	If they could see evil rooted in the nature of man they would never entertain such silly dreams about man s merit or worthiness With Paul we absolutely deny the possibility of self merit
5245-3984-0014	train-other-500	God never yet gave to any person grace and everlasting life as a reward for merit The opinions of the papists are the intellectual pipe dreams of idle pates
5245-3984-0015	train-other-500	that serve no other purpose but to draw men away from the true worship of God The papacy is founded upon hallucinations The true way of salvation is this
5245-3984-0016	train-other-500	First a person must realize that he is a sinner the kind of a sinner who is congenitally unable to do any good thing Whatsoever is not of faith is sin
5245-3984-0017	train-other-500	Those who seek to earn the grace of God by their own efforts are trying to please God with sins They mock God and provoke His anger The first step on the way to salvation is to repent
5245-3984-0018	train-other-500	The second part is this God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we may live through His merit He was crucified and killed for us
5245-3984-0019	train-other-500	By sacrificing His Son for us God revealed Himself to us as a merciful Father who donates remission of sins
none	none	 righteousness and life everlasting 
5245-3984-0020	train-other-500	for Christ s sake God hands out His gifts freely unto all men That is the praise and glory of His mercy The scholastics explain the way of salvation in this manner
5245-3984-0021	train-other-500	When a person happens to perform a good deed God accepts it and as a reward for the good deed God pours charity into that person They call it charity infused This charity is supposed to remain in the heart
5245-3984-0022	train-other-500	They get wild when they are told that this quality of the heart cannot justify a person They also claim that we are able to love God by our own natural strength to love God above all things
5245-3984-0023	train-other-500	at least to the extent that we deserve grace And say the scholastics because God is not satisfied with a literal performance of the Law but expects us to fulfill the Law according to the mind of the Lawgiver
5245-3984-0024	train-other-500	therefore we must obtain from above a quality above nature a quality which they call formal righteousness We say faith apprehends Jesus Christ Christian faith is not an inactive quality in the heart
5245-3984-0025	train-other-500	If it is true faith it will surely take Christ for its object Christ apprehended by faith and dwelling in the heart constitutes Christian righteousness for which God gives eternal life
5245-3984-0026	train-other-500	In contrast to the doting dreams of the scholastics we teach this First a person must learn to know himself from the Law With the prophet he will then confess All have sinned
5245-3984-0027	train-other-500	and come short of the glory of God And there is none that doeth good no not one And against thee thee only have I sinned Having been humbled by the Law
5245-3984-0028	train-other-500	and having been brought to a right estimate of himself a man will repent He finds out that he is so depraved that no strength no works no merits of his own will ever deliver him from his guilt
5245-3984-0029	train-other-500	He will then understand the meaning of Paul s words I am sold under sin and they are all under sin At this state a person begins to lament Who is going to help me
5245-3984-0030	train-other-500	In due time comes the Word of the Gospel and says Son thy sins are forgiven thee Believe in Jesus Christ who was crucified for your sins Remember your sins have been imposed upon Christ
5245-3984-0031	train-other-500	In this way are we delivered from sin In this way are we justified and made heirs of everlasting life In order to have faith you must paint a true portrait of Christ The scholastics caricature Christ
5245-3984-0032	train-other-500	into a judge and tormentor But Christ is no law giver He is the Lifegiver He is the Forgiver of sins You must believe that Christ might have atoned for the sins of the world with one single drop of His blood
5245-3984-0033	train-other-500	Instead He shed His blood abundantly in order that He might give abundant satisfaction for our sins Here let me say that these three things faith Christ and imputation of righteousness
5245-3984-0034	train-other-500	are to be joined together Faith takes hold of Christ God accounts this faith for righteousness This imputation of righteousness we need very much because we are far from perfect
5245-3984-0035	train-other-500	As long as we have this body sin will dwell in our flesh Then too we sometimes drive away the Holy Spirit we fall into sin like Peter David and other holy men
5245-3984-0036	train-other-500	Nevertheless we may always take recourse to this fact that our sins are covered and that God will not lay them to our charge
none	none	 Sin is not held against us for Christ s sake 
5245-3984-0037	train-other-500	Where Christ and faith are lacking there is no remission or covering of sins but only condemnation After we have taught faith in Christ we teach good works
5245-3984-0038	train-other-500	Since you have found Christ by faith we say begin now to work and do well Love God and your neighbor Call upon God give thanks unto Him praise Him confess Him
5245-3984-0039	train-other-500	These are good works Let them flow from a cheerful heart because you have remission of sin in Christ When crosses and afflictions come our way we bear them patiently For Christ s yoke is easy
5245-3984-0040	train-other-500	and His burden is light When sin has been pardoned and the conscience has been eased of its dreadful load a Christian can endure all things in Christ To give a short definition of a Christian
none	none	 A Christian is not somebody who chalks sp sin 
5245-3984-0041	train-other-500	because of his faith in Christ This doctrine brings comfort to consciences in serious trouble When a person is a Christian he is above law and sin
5245-3984-0042	train-other-500	When the Law accuses him and sin wants to drive the wits out of him a Christian looks to Christ A Christian is free He has no master except Christ A Christian is greater than the whole world
5245-3984-0043	train-other-500	VERSE sixteen Even we have believed in Jesus Christ that we might be justified The true way of becoming a Christian is to be justified by faith in Jesus Christ
5245-3984-0044	train-other-500	and not by the works of the Law We know that we must also teach good works but they must be taught in their proper turn when the discussion is concerning works
5245-3984-0045	train-other-500	and not the article of justification Here the question arises by what means are we justified We answer with Paul By faith only in Christ are we pronounced righteous and not by works
5245-3984-0046	train-other-500	Not that we reject good works Far from it But we will not allow ourselves to be removed from the anchorage of our salvation The Law is a good thing But when the discussion is about justification

5245-3984-0047	train-other-500	That we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the Law We do not mean to say that the Law is bad Only it is not able to justify us To be at peace with God
5245-3984-0048	train-other-500	we have need of a far better mediator than Moses or the Law We must know that we are nothing We must understand that we are merely beneficiaries and recipients of the treasures of Christ
5245-3984-0049	train-other-500	So far the words of Paul were addressed to Peter Now Paul turns to the Galatians and makes this summary statement VERSE sixteen
5245-3984-0050	train-other-500	For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified By the term flesh Paul does not understand manifest vices Such sins he usually calls by their proper names as adultery
5245-3984-0051	train-other-500	fornication et cetera By flesh Paul understands what Jesus meant in the third chapter of John That which is born of the flesh is flesh John three six Flesh here
5245-3984-0052	train-other-500	means the whole nature of man inclusive of reason and instincts This flesh says Paul is not justified by the works of the law
none	none	 The papists do not believe this 
5245-3984-0053	train-other-500	They say A person who performs this good deed or that deserves the forgiveness of his sins A person who joins this or that holy order has the promise of everlasting life
5245-3984-0054	train-other-500	To me it is a miracle that the Church so long surrounded by vicious sects has been able to survive at all God must have been able to call a few who in their failure to discover any good in themselves
5245-3984-0055	train-other-500	to cite against the wrath and judgment of God simply took to the suffering and death of Christ and were saved by this simple faith Nevertheless God has punished the contempt of the Gospel

5245-3984-0058	train-other-500	This is then our general conclusion By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified VERSE seventeen But if while we seek to be justified by Christ
5245-3984-0059	train-other-500	we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore Christ the minister of sin God forbid Either we are not justified by Christ or we are not justified by the Law
5245-3984-0060	train-other-500	The fact is we are justified by Christ Hence we are not justified by the Law If we observe the Law in order to be justified or after having been justified by Christ we think we must further be justified by the Law
5245-3984-0061	train-other-500	we convert Christ into a legislator and a minister of sin What are these false apostles doing Paul cries They are turning Law into grace and grace into Law
5245-3984-0062	train-other-500	They are changing Moses into Christ and Christ into Moses By teaching that besides Christ and His righteousness the performance of the Law is necessary unto salvation they put the Law in the place

5245-3984-0064	train-other-500	With His own words they deny Christ and abolish faith in Him Christ is made to lose His good name His office and His glory and is demoted to the status of a law enforcer reproving terrifying
5245-3984-0065	train-other-500	and chasing poor sinners around The proper office of Christ is to raise the sinner and extricate him from his sins Papists and Anabaptists deride us because we so earnestly require faith
5245-3984-0066	train-other-500	Faith they say makes men reckless What do these law workers know about faith when they are so busy calling people back from baptism from faith from the promises of Christ to the Law
5245-3984-0067	train-other-500	With their doctrine these lying sects of perdition deface the benefits of Christ to this day They rob Christ of His glory as the Justifier of mankind and cast Him into the role of a minister of sin
5245-3984-0068	train-other-500	They are like the false apostles There is not a single one among them who knows the difference between law and grace We can tell the difference We do not here and now argue whether we ought to do good works
5245-3984-0069	train-other-500	or whether the Law is any good or whether the Law ought to be kept at all We will discuss these questions some other time We are now concerned with justification Our opponents refuse to make this distinction
5245-3984-0070	train-other-500	All they can do is to bellow that good works ought to be done We know that We know that good works ought to be done but we will talk about that when the proper time comes Now we are dealing with justification
5245-3984-0071	train-other-500	and here good works should not be so much as mentioned Paul s argument has often comforted me He argues If we who have been justified by Christ are counted unrighteous
5245-3984-0072	train-other-500	why seek justification in Christ at all If we are justified by the Law tell me what has Christ achieved by His death by His preaching by His victory over sin and death
5245-3984-0073	train-other-500	Either we are justified by Christ or we are made worse sinners by Him The Sacred Scriptures particularly those of the New Testament make frequent mention of faith in Christ

5245-3984-0075	train-other-500	He that believeth in Christ is condemned because he has faith without works Our opponents turn everything topsy turvy They make Christ over into a murderer and Moses into a savior

5245-3984-0079	train-other-500	that to gain heaven a person must suffer afflictions and follow the example of Christ and of the saints is a minister of the Law of sin wrath and of death

5245-3984-0081	train-other-500	What will not the Law do in the case of the wicked who do not even have the Holy Spirit The Law requires perfect obedience It condemns all who do not accomplish the will of God
5245-3984-0082	train-other-500	But show me a person who is able to render perfect obedience The Law cannot justify It can only condemn according to the passage
5245-3984-0083	train-other-500	Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them Paul has good reason for calling the minister of the Law the minister of sin for the Law reveals our sinfulness
5245-3984-0084	train-other-500	The realization of sin in turn frightens the heart and drives it to despair Therefore all exponents of the Law and of works deserve to be called tyrants and oppressors
5245-3984-0085	train-other-500	The purpose of the Law is to reveal sin That this is the purpose of the Law can be seen from the account of the giving of the Law as reported in the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of Exodus
5245-3984-0086	train-other-500	Moses brought the people out of their tents to have God speak to them personally from a cloud But the people trembled with fear fled and standing aloof they begged Moses Speak thou with us and we will hear
5245-3984-0087	train-other-500	but let not God speak with us lest we die The proper office of the Law is to lead us out of our tents in other words out of the security of our self trust into the presence of God
5245-3984-0088	train-other-500	that we may perceive His anger at our sinfulness All who say that faith alone in Christ does not justify a person convert Christ into a minister of sin a teacher of the Law and a cruel tyrant
5245-3984-0089	train-other-500	who requires the impossible All merit seekers take Christ for a new lawgiver In conclusion if the Law is the minister of sin it is at the same time the minister of wrath and death
5245-3984-0090	train-other-500	As the Law reveals sin it fills a person with the fear of death and condemnation Eventually the conscience wakes up to the fact that God is angry If God is angry with you He will destroy and condemn you forever

5245-3984-0095	train-other-500	I have not preached to the end that I build again the things which I destroyed If I should do so I would not only be laboring in vain but I would make myself guilty of a great wrong
5245-3984-0096	train-other-500	By the ministry of the Gospel I have destroyed sin heaviness of heart wrath and death I have abolished the Law so that it should not bother your conscience any more

5245-3984-0098	train-other-500	Instead of righteousness and life I would restore sin and death By the grace of God we know that we are justified through faith in Christ alone We do not mingle law and grace
5245-3984-0099	train-other-500	faith and works We keep them far apart Let every true Christian mark the distinction between law and grace and mark it well
5245-3984-0100	train-other-500	We must not drag good works into the article of justification as the monks do who maintain that not only good works but also the punishment which evildoers suffer for their wicked deeds deserve everlasting life

5245-3984-0105	train-other-500	faith or the merit of Christ are never mentioned In their writings they play up the merits of man
none	none	 as can readily be seen from the following form of absolution used among the monks 
5245-3984-0106	train-other-500	God forgive thee brother The merit of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ
none	none	 and of the blessed Saint Mary 
5245-3984-0107	train-other-500	always a virgin and of all the saints the merit of thy order the strictness of thy religion the humility of thy profession the contrition of thy heart

none	none	 the increase of thy worth and grace and the reward of everlasting life 
5245-3984-0109	train-other-500	Amen True the merit of Christ is mentioned in this formula of absolution But if you look closer you will notice that Christ s merit is belittled while monkish merits are aggrandized
5245-3984-0110	train-other-500	They confess Christ with their lips and at the same time deny His power to save I myself was at one time entangled in this error
5245-3984-0111	train-other-500	I thought Christ was a judge and had to be pacified by a strict adherence to the rules of my order But now I give thanks unto God the Father of all mercies
5245-3984-0112	train-other-500	who has called me out of darkness into the light of His glorious Gospel and has granted unto me the saving knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord We conclude with Paul that we are justified by faith in Christ without the Law

none	none	 and the Holy Spirit will not permit a person to remain idle but will put him to work and stir him up to the love of God to patient suffering in affliction to prayer thanksgiving to the habit of charity towards all men VERSE nineteen For I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God This cheering form of speech is frequently met with in the Scriptures particularly in the writings of saint Paul when the Law is set against the Law and sin is made to oppose sin and death is arrayed against death and hell is turned loose against hell as in the following quotations Thou hast led captivity captive Psalm sixty eight eighteen O death I will be thy plagues O grave I will be thy destruction Hosea thirteen fourteen And for sin condemned sin in the flesh Romans eight three Here Paul plays the Law against the Law as if to say The Law of Moses condemns me but I have another law the law of grace and liberty which condemns the accusing Law of Moses On first sight Paul seems to be advancing a strange and ugly heresy He says I am dead to the law that I might live unto God The false apostles said the very opposite They said If you do not live to the law you are dead unto God The doctrine of our opponents is similar to that of the false apostles in Paul s day Our opponents teach If you want to live unto God you must live after the Law for it is written Do this and thou shalt live Paul on the other hand teaches We cannot live unto God unless we are dead unto the Law If we are dead unto the Law the Law can have no power over us Paul does not only refer to the Ceremonial Law but to the whole Law We are not to think that the Law is wiped out It stays It continues to operate in the wicked But a Christian is dead to the Law For example Christ by His resurrection became free from the grave and yet the grave remains Peter was delivered from prison yet the prison remains The Law is abolished as far as I am concerned when it has driven me into the arms of Christ Yet the Law continues to exist and to function But it no longer exists for me I have nothing to do with the Law cries Paul He could not have uttered anything more devastating to the prestige of the Law He declares that he does not care for the Law that he does not intend ever to be justified by the Law To be dead to the Law means to be free of the Law What right then has the Law to accuse me or to hold anything against me When you see a person squirming in the clutches of the Law say to him Brother get things straight You let the Law talk to your conscience Make it talk to your flesh Wake up and believe in Jesus Christ the Conqueror of Law and sin Faith in Christ will lift you high above the Law into the heaven of grace Though Law and sin remain they no longer concern you because you are dead to the Law and dead to sin Blessed is the person who knows how to use this truth in times of distress He can talk He can say mister Law go ahead and accuse me as much as you like I know I have committed many sins and I continue to sin daily But that does not bother me You have got to shout louder mister Law I am deaf you know Talk as much as you like I am dead to you If you want to talk to me about my sins go and talk to my flesh Belabor that but don t talk to my conscience My conscience is a lady and a queen and has nothing to do with the likes of you because my conscience lives to Christ under another law a new and better law the law of grace We have two propositions To live unto the Law is to die unto God To die unto the Law is to live unto God These two propositions go against reason No law worker can ever understand them But see to it that you understand them The Law can never justify and save a sinner The Law can only accuse terrify and kill him Therefore to live unto the Law is to die unto God Vice versa to die unto the Law is to live unto God If you want to live unto God bury the Law and find life through faith in Christ Jesus We have enough arguments right here to conclude that justification is by faith alone How can the Law effect our justification when Paul so plainly states that we must be dead to the Law if we want to live unto God If we are dead to the Law and the Law is dead to us how can it possibly contribute anything to our justification There is nothing left for us but to be justified by faith alone This nineteenth verse is loaded with consolation It fortifies a person against every danger It allows you to argue like this I confess I have sinned Then God will punish you No He will not do that Why not Does not the Law say so I have nothing to do with the Law How so I have another law the law of liberty What do you mean liberty The liberty of Christ for Christ has made me free from the Law that held me down That Law is now in prison itself held captive by grace and liberty By faith in Christ a person may gain such sure and sound comfort that he need not fear the devil sin death or any evil Sir Devil he may say I am not afraid of you I have a Friend whose name is Jesus Christ in whom I believe He has abolished the Law condemned sin vanquished death and destroyed hell for me He is bigger than you Satan He has licked you and holds you down You cannot hurt me This is the faith that overcomes the devil Paul manhandles the Law He treats the Law as if it were a thief and a robber He treats the Law as contemptible to the conscience in order that those who believe in Christ may take courage to defy the Law and say mister Law I am a sinner What are you going to do about it Or take death Christ is risen from death Why should we now fear the grave Against my death I set another death or rather life my life in Christ Oh the sweet names of Jesus He is called my law against the Law my sin against sin my death against death Translated it means that He is my righteousness my life my everlasting salvation For this reason was He made the law of the Law the sin of sin the death of death that He might redeem me from the curse of the Law He permitted the Law to accuse Him sin to condemn Him and death to take Him to abolish the Law to condemn sin and to destroy death for me This peculiar form of speech sounds much sweeter than if Paul had said I through liberty am dead to the law By putting it in this way I through the law am dead to the law he opposes one law with another law and has them fight it out In this masterly fashion Paul draws our attention away from the Law sin death and every evil and centers it upon Christ VERSE twenty I am crucified with Christ Christ is Lord over the Law because He was crucified unto the Law I also am lord over the Law because by faith I am crucified with Christ Paul does not here speak of crucifying the flesh but he speaks of that higher crucifying wherein sin devil and death are crucified in Christ and in me By my faith in Christ I am crucified with Christ Hence these evils are crucified and dead unto me VERSE twenty Nevertheless I live I do not mean to create the impression as though I did not live before this But in reality I first live now now that I have been delivered from the Law from sin and death Being crucified with Christ and dead unto the Law I may now rise unto a new and better life We must pay close attention to Paul s way of speaking He says that we are crucified and dead unto the Law The fact is the Law is crucified and dead unto us Paul purposely speaks that way in order to increase the portion of our comfort VERSE twenty Yet not I Paul explains what constitutes true Christian righteousness True Christian righteousness is the righteousness of Christ who lives in us We must look away from our own person Christ and my conscience must become one so that I can see nothing else but Christ crucified and raised from the dead for me If I keep on looking at myself I am gone If we lose sight of Christ and begin to consider our past we simply go to pieces We must turn our eyes to the brazen serpent Christ crucified and believe with all our heart that He is our righteousness and our life For Christ on whom our eyes are fixed in whom we live who lives in us is Lord over Law sin death and all evil VERSE twenty But Christ liveth in me Thus I live the Apostle starts out But presently he corrects himself saying Yet not I but Christ liveth in me He is the form of my perfection He embellishes my faith Since Christ is now living in me He abolishes the Law condemns sin and destroys death in me These foes vanish in His presence Christ abiding in me drives out every evil This union with Christ delivers me from the demands of the Law and separates me from my sinful self As long as I abide in Christ nothing can hurt me Christ domiciling in me the old Adam has to stay outside and remain subject to the Law Think what grace righteousness life peace and salvation there is in me thanks to that inseparable conjunction between Christ and me through faith Paul has a peculiar style a celestial way of speaking I live he says I live not I am dead I am not dead I am a sinner I am not a sinner I have the Law I have no Law When we look at ourselves we find plenty of sin But when we look at Christ we have no sin Whenever we separate the person of Christ from our own person we live under the Law and not in Christ we are condemned by the Law dead before God Faith connects you so intimately with Christ that He and you become as it were one person As such you may boldly say I am now one with Christ Therefore Christ s righteousness victory and life are mine On the other hand Christ may say I am that big sinner His sins and his death are mine because he is joined to me and I to him Whenever remission of sins is freely proclaimed people misinterpret it according to Romans three eight Let us do evil that good may come As soon as people hear that we are not justified by the Law they reason maliciously Why then let us reject the Law If grace abounds where sin abounds let us abound in sin that grace may all the more abound People who reason thus are reckless They make sport of the Scriptures and slander the sayings of the Holy Ghost However there are others who are not malicious only weak who may take offense when told that Law and good works are unnecessary for salvation These must be instructed as to why good works do not justify and from what motives good works must be done Good works are not the cause but the fruit of righteousness When we have become righteous then first are we able and willing to do good The tree makes the apple the apple does not make the tree VERSE twenty And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul does not deny the fact that he is living in the flesh He performs the natural functions of the flesh But he says that this is not his real life His life in the flesh is not a life after the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God he says My speech is no longer directed by the flesh but by the Holy Ghost My sight is no longer governed by the flesh but by the Holy Ghost My hearing is no longer determined by the flesh but by the Holy Ghost I cannot teach write pray or give thanks without the instrumentality of the flesh yet these activities do not proceed from the flesh but from God A Christian uses earthly means like any unbeliever Outwardly they look alike Nevertheless there is a great difference between them I may live in the flesh but I do not live after the flesh I do my living now by the faith of the Son of God Paul had the same voice the same tongue before and after his conversion Before his conversion his tongue uttered blasphemies But after his conversion his tongue spoke a spiritual heavenly language We may now understand how spiritual life originates It enters the heart by faith Christ reigns in the heart with His Holy Spirit who sees hears speaks works suffers and does all things in and through us over the protest and the resistance of the flesh VERSE twenty Who loved me and gave himself for me The sophistical papists assert that a person is able by natural strength to love God long before grace has entered his heart and to perform works of real merit They believe they are able to fulfill the commandments of God They believe they are able to do more than God expects of them so that they are in a position to sell their superfluous merits to laymen thereby saving themselves and others They are saving nobody On the contrary they abolish the Gospel they deride deny and blaspheme Christ and call upon themselves the wrath of God This is what they get for living in their own righteousness and not in the faith of the Son of God The papists will tell you to do the best you can and God will give you His grace They have a rhyme for it God will no more require of man Than of himself perform he can This may hold true in ordinary civic life But the papists apply it to the spiritual realm where a person can perform nothing but sin because he is sold under sin Our opponents go even further than that They say nature is depraved but the qualities of nature are untainted Again we say This may hold true in everyday life but not in the spiritual life In spiritual matters a person is by nature full of darkness error ignorance malice and perverseness in will and in mind In view of this Paul declares that Christ began and not we He loved me and gave Himself for me He found in me no right mind and no good will But the good Lord had mercy upon me Out of pure kindness He loved me loved me so that He gave Himself for me that I should be free from the Law from sin devil and death The words The Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me are so many thunderclaps and lightning bolts of protest from heaven against the righteousness of the Law The wickedness error darkness ignorance in my mind and my will were so great that it was quite impossible for me to be saved by any other means than by the inestimable price of Christ s death Let us count the price When you hear that such an enormous price was paid for you will you still come along with your cowl your shaven pate your chastity your obedience your poverty your works your merits What do you want with all these trappings What good are the works of all men and all the pains of the martyrs in comparison with the pains of the Son of God dying on the Cross so that there was not a drop of His precious blood but it was all shed for your sins If you could properly evaluate this incomparable price you would throw all your ceremonies vows works and merits into the ash can What awful presumption to imagine that there is any work good enough to pacify God when to pacify God required the invaluable price of the death and blood of His own and only Son VERSE twenty For me Who is this me I wretched and damnable sinner dearly beloved of the Son of God If I could by work or merit love the Son of God and come to Him why should He have sacrificed Himself for me This shows how the papists ignore the Scriptures particularly the doctrine of faith If they had paid any attention at all to these words that it was absolutely necessary for the Son of God to be given into death for me they would never have invented so many hideous heresies I always say there is no remedy against the sects no power to resist them except this article of Christian righteousness If we lose this article we shall never be able to combat errors or sects What business have they to make such a fuss about works or merits If I a condemned sinner could have been purchased and redeemed by any other price why should the Son of God have given Himself for me Just because there was no other price in heaven and on earth big and good enough was it necessary for the Son of God to be delivered for me This He did out of His great love for me for the Apostle says Who loved me Did the Law ever love me Did the Law ever sacrifice itself for me Did the Law ever die for me On the contrary it accuses me it frightens me it drives me crazy Somebody else saved me from the Law from sin and death unto eternal life That Somebody is the Son of God to whom be praise and glory forever Hence Christ is no Moses no tyrant no lawgiver but the Giver of grace the Savior full of mercy In short He is no less than infinite mercy and ineffable goodness bountifully giving Himself for us Visualize Christ in these His true colors I do not say that it is easy Even in the present diffusion of the Gospel light I have much trouble to see Christ as Paul portrays Him So deeply has the diseased opinion that Christ is a lawgiver sunk into my bones You younger men are a good deal better off than we who are old You have never become infected with the nefarious errors on which I suckled all my youth until at the mention of the name of Christ I shivered with fear You I say who are young may learn to know Christ in all His sweetness For Christ is Joy and Sweetness to a broken heart Christ is a Lover of poor sinners and such a Lover that He gave Himself for us Now if this is true and it is true then are we never justified by our own righteousness Read the words me and for me with great emphasis Print this me with capital letters in your heart and do not ever doubt that you belong to the number of those who are meant by this me Christ did not only love Peter and Paul The same love He felt for them He feels for us If we cannot deny that we are sinners we cannot deny that Christ died for our sins VERSE twenty one I do not frustrate the grace of God Paul is now getting ready for the second argument of his Epistle to the effect that to seek justification by works of the Law is to reject the grace of God I ask you what sin can be more horrible than to reject the grace of God and to refuse the righteousness of Christ It is bad enough that we are wicked sinners and transgressors of all the commandments of God on top of that to refuse the grace of God and the remission of sins offered unto us by Christ is the worst sin of all the sin of sins That is the limit There is no sin which Paul and the other apostles detested more than when a person despises the grace of God in Christ Jesus Still there is no sin more common That is why Paul can get so angry at the Antichrist because he snubs Christ rebuffs the grace of God and refuses the merit of Christ What else would you call it but spitting in Christ s face pushing Christ to the side usurping Christ s throne and to say I am going to justify you people I am going to save you By what means By masses pilgrimages pardons merits et cetera For this is Antichrist s doctrine Faith is no good unless it is reinforced by works By this abominable doctrine Antichrist has spoiled darkened and buried the benefit of Christ and in place of the grace of Christ and His Kingdom he has established the doctrine of works and the kingdom of ceremonies We despise the grace of God when we observe the Law for the purpose of being justified The Law is good holy and profitable but it does not justify To keep the Law in order to be justified means to reject grace to deny Christ to despise His sacrifice and to be lost VERSE twenty one For if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain Did Christ die or did He not die Was His death worth while or was it not If His death was worth while it follows that righteousness does not come by the Law Why was Christ born anyway Why was He crucified Why did He suffer Why did He love me and give Himself for me It was all done to no purpose if righteousness is to be had by the Law Or do you think that God spared not His Son but delivered Him for us all for the fun of it Before I would admit anything like that I would consign the holiness of the saints and of the angels to hell To reject the grace of God is a common sin of which everybody is guilty who sees any righteousness in himself or in his deeds And the Pope is the sole author of this iniquity Not content to spoil the Gospel of Christ he has filled the world with his cursed traditions e g his bulls and indulgences We will always affirm with Paul that either Christ died in vain or else the Law cannot justify us But Christ did not suffer and die in vain Hence the Law does not justify If my salvation was so difficult to accomplish that it necessitated the death of Christ then all my works all the righteousness of the Law are good for nothing How can I buy for a penny what cost a million dollars The Law is a penny s worth when you compare it with Christ Should I be so stupid as to reject the righteousness of Christ which cost me nothing and slave like a fool to achieve the righteousness of the Law which God disdains Man s own righteousness is in the last analysis a despising and rejecting of the grace of God No combination of words can do justice to such an outrage It is an insult to say that any man died in vain But to say that Christ died in vain is a deadly insult To say that Christ died in vain is to make His resurrection His victory His glory His kingdom heaven earth God Himself of no purpose and benefit whatever That is enough to set any person against the righteousness of the Law and all the trimmings of men s own righteousness the orders of monks and friars and their superstitions Who would not detest his own vows his cowls his shaven crown his bearded traditions yes the very Law of Moses when he hears that for such things he rejected the grace of God and the death of Christ It seems that such a horrible wickedness could not enter a man s heart that he should reject the grace of God and despise the death of Christ And yet this atrocity is all too common Let us be warned Everyone who seeks righteousness without Christ either by works merits satisfactions actions or by the Law rejects the grace of God and despises the death of Christ CHAPTER three VERSE one zero foolish Galatians THE Apostle Paul manifests his apostolic care for the Galatians Sometimes he entreats them then again he reproaches them in accordance with his own advice to Timothy Preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort In the midst of his discourse on Christian righteousness Paul breaks off and turns to address the Galatians O foolish Galatians he cries I have brought you the true Gospel and you received it with eagerness and gratitude Now all of a sudden you drop the Gospel What has got into you Paul reproves the Galatians rather sharply when he calls them fools bewitched and disobedient Whether he is indignant or sorry I cannot say He may be both It is the duty of a Christian pastor to reprove the people committed to his charge Of course his anger must not flow from malice but from affection and a real zeal for Christ There is no question that Paul is disappointed It hurts him to think that his Galatians showed so little stability We can hear him say I am sorry to hear of your troubles and disappointed in you for the disgraceful part you played I say rather much on this point to save Paul from the charge that he railed upon the churches contrary to the spirit of the Gospel A certain distance and coolness can be noted in the title with which the Apostle addresses the Galatians He does not now address them as his brethren as he usually does He addresses them as Galatians in order to remind them of their national trait to be foolish We have here an example of bad traits that often cling to individual Christians and entire congregations Grace does not suddenly transform a Christian into a new and perfect creature Dregs of the old and natural corruption remain The Spirit of God cannot at once overcome human deficiency Sanctification takes time Although the Galatians had been enlightened by the Holy Spirit through the preaching of faith something of their national trait of foolishness plus their original depravity clung to them Let no man think that once he has received faith he can presently be converted into a faultless creature The leavings of old vices will stick to him be he ever so good a Christian VERSE one Who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth Paul calls the Galatians foolish and bewitched In the fifth chapter he mentions sorcery among the works of the flesh declaring that witchcraft and sorcery are real manifestations and legitimate activities of the devil We are all exposed to the influence of the devil because he is the prince and god of the world in which we live Satan is clever He does not only bewitch men in a crude manner but also in a more artful fashion He bedevils the minds of men with hideous fallacies Not only is he able to deceive the self assured but even those who profess the true Christian faith There is not one among us who is not at times seduced by Satan into false beliefs This accounts for the many new battles we have to wage nowadays But the attacks of the old Serpent are not without profit to us for they confirm our doctrine and strengthen our faith in Christ Many a time we were wrestled down in these conflicts with Satan but Christ has always triumphed and always will triumph Do not think that the Galatians were the only ones to be bewitched by the devil Let us realize that we too may be seduced by Satan VERSE one Who hath bewitched you In this sentence Paul excuses the Galatians while he blames the false apostles for the apostasy of the Galatians As if he were saying I know your defection was not willful The devil sent the false apostles to you and they tallied you into believing that you are justified by the Law With this our epistle we endeavor to undo the damage which the false apostles have inflicted upon you Like Paul we struggle with the Word of God against the fanatical Anabaptists of our day and our efforts are not entirely in vain The trouble is there are many who refuse to be instructed They will not listen to reason they will not listen to the Scriptures because they are bewitched by the tricky devil who can make a lie look like the truth Since the devil has this uncanny ability to make us believe a lie until we would swear a thousand times it were the truth we must not be proud but walk in fear and humility and call upon the Lord Jesus to save us from temptation Although I am a doctor of divinity and have preached Christ and fought His battles for a long time I know from personal experience how difficult it is to hold fast to the truth I cannot always shake off Satan I cannot always apprehend Christ as the Scriptures portray Him Sometimes the devil distorts Christ to my vision But thanks be to God who keeps us in His Word in faith and in prayer The spiritual witchery of the devil creates in the heart a wrong idea of Christ Those who share the opinion that a person is justified by the works of the Law are simply bewitched Their belief goes against faith and Christ VERSE one That ye should not obey the truth Paul incriminates the Galatians in worse failure You are so bewitched that you no longer obey the truth I fear many of you have strayed so far that you will never return to the truth The apostasy of the Galatians is a fine indorsement of the Law all right You may preach the Law ever so fervently if the preaching of the Gospel does not accompany it the Law will never produce true conversion and heartfelt repentance We do not mean to say that the preaching of the Law is without value but it only serves to bring home to us the wrath of God The Law bows a person down It takes the Gospel and the preaching of faith in Christ to raise and save a person VERSE one Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth Paul s increasing severity becomes apparent as he reminds the Galatians that they disobeyed the truth in defiance of the vivid description he had given them of Christ So vividly had he described Christ to them that they could almost see and handle Him As if Paul were to say No artist with all his colors could have pictured Christ to you as vividly as I have pictured Him to you by my preaching Yet you permitted yourselves to be seduced to the extent that you disobeyed the truth of Christ VERSE one Crucified among you You have not only rejected the grace of God you have shamefully crucified Christ among you Paul employs the same phraseology in Hebrews six six Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame It should make any person afraid to hear Paul say that those who seek to be justified by the Law not only deny Christ but also crucify Him anew If those who seek to be justified by the Law and its works are crucifiers of Christ what are they I like to know who seek salvation by the filthy rags of their own work righteousness Can there be anything more horrible than the papacy an alliance of people who crucify Christ in themselves in the Church and in the hearts of the believers Of all the diseased and vicious doctrines of the papacy the worst is this If you want to serve God you must earn your own remission of sins and everlasting life and in addition help others to obtain salvation by giving them the benefit of your extra work holiness Monks friars and all the rest of them brag that besides the ordinary requirements common to all Christians they do the works of supererogation i e the performance of more than is required This is certainly a fiendish illusion No wonder Paul employs such sharp language in his effort to recall the Galatians from the doctrine of the false apostles He says to them Don t you realize what you have done You have crucified Christ anew because you seek salvation by the Law True Christ can no longer be crucified in person but He is crucified in us when we reject grace faith free remission of sins and endeavor to be justified by our own works or by the works of the Law The Apostle is incensed at the presumptuousness of any person who thinks he can perform the Law of God to his own salvation He charges that person with the atrocity of crucifying anew the Son of God VERSE two This only would I learn of you Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith There is a touch of irony in these words of the Apostle Come on now my smart Galatians you who all of a sudden have become doctors while I seem to be your pupil Received ye the Holy Ghost by the works of the Law or by the preaching of the Gospel This question gave them something to think about because their own experience contradicted them You cannot say that you received the Holy Spirit by the Law As long as you were servants of the Law you never received the Holy Ghost Nobody ever heard of the Holy Ghost being given to anybody be he doctor or dunce as a result of the preaching of the Law In your own case you have not only learned the Law by heart you have labored with all your might to perform it You most of all should have received the Holy Ghost by the Law if that were possible You cannot show me that this ever happened But as soon as the Gospel came your way you received the Holy Ghost by the simple hearing of faith before you ever had a chance to do a single good deed Luke verifies this statement of Paul in the Book of Acts While Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word Acts ten forty four And as I began to speak the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning Acts eleven fifteen Try to appreciate the force of Paul s argument which is so often repeated in the Book of Acts That Book was written for the express purpose of verifying Paul s assertion that the Holy Ghost comes upon men not in response to the preaching of the Law but in response to the preaching of the Gospel When Peter preached Christ at the first Pentecost the Holy Ghost fell upon the hearers and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls Cornelius received the Holy Ghost while Peter was speaking of Christ The Holy Ghost fell on all of them which heard the word These are actual experiences that cannot very well be denied When Paul and Barnabas returned to Jerusalem and reported what they had been able to accomplish among the Gentiles the whole Church was astonished particularly when it heard that the uncircumcised Gentiles had received the Holy Ghost by the preaching of faith in Christ Now as God gave the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles without the Law by the simple preaching of the Gospel so He gave the Holy Ghost also to the Jews without the Law through faith alone If the righteousness of the Law were necessary unto salvation the Holy Ghost would never have come to the Gentiles because they did not bother about the Law Hence the Law does not justify but faith in Christ justifies How was it with Cornelius Cornelius and his friends whom he had invited over to his house do nothing but sit and listen Peter is doing the talking They just sit and do nothing The Law is far removed from their thoughts They burn no sacrifices They are not at all interested in circumcision All they do is to sit and listen to Peter Suddenly the Holy Ghost enters their hearts His presence is unmistakable for they spoke with tongues and magnified God Right here we have one more difference between the Law and the Gospel The Law does not bring on the Holy Ghost The Gospel however brings on the gift of the Holy Ghost because it is the nature of the Gospel to convey good gifts The Law and the Gospel are contrary ideas They have contrary functions and purposes To endow the Law with any capacity to produce righteousness is to plagiarize the Gospel The Gospel brings donations It pleads for open hands to take what is being offered The Law has nothing to give It demands and its demands are impossible Our opponents come back at us with Cornelius Cornelius they point out was a devout man and one that feared God with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed God always Because of these qualifications he merited the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost So reason our opponents I answer Cornelius was a Gentile You cannot deny it As a Gentile he was uncircumcised As a Gentile he did not observe the Law He never gave the Law any thought For all that he was justified and received the Holy Ghost How can the Law avail anything unto righteousness Our opponents are not satisfied They reply Granted that Cornelius was a Gentile and did not receive the Holy Ghost by the Law yet the text plainly states that he was a devout man who feared God gave alms and prayed Don t you think he deserved the gift of the Holy Ghost I answer Cornelius had the faith of the fathers who were saved by faith in the Christ to come If Cornelius had died before Christ he would have been saved because he believed in the Christ to come But because the Messiah had already come Cornelius had to be apprized of the fact Since Christ has come we cannot be saved by faith in the Christ to come but we must believe that he has come The object of Peter s visit was to acquaint Cornelius with the fact that Christ was no longer to be looked for because He is here As to the contention of our opponents that Cornelius deserved grace and the gift of the Holy Ghost because he was devout and just we say that these attributes are the characteristics of a spiritual person who already has faith in Christ and not the characteristics of a Gentile or of natural man Luke first praises Cornelius for being a devout and God fearing man and then Luke mentions the good works the alms and prayers of Cornelius Our opponents ignore the sequence of Luke s words They pounce on this one sentence which gave much alms to the people because it serves their assertion that merit precedes grace The fact is that Cornelius gave alms and prayed to God because he had faith And because of his faith in the Christ to come Peter was delegated to preach unto Cornelius faith in the Christ who had already come This argument is convincing enough Cornelius was justified without the Law therefore the Law cannot justify Take the case of Naaman the Syrian who was a Gentile and did not belong to the race of Moses Yet his flesh was cleansed the God of Israel was revealed unto him and he received the Holy Ghost Naaman confessed his faith Behold now I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel II Kings five fifteen Naaman does not do a thing He does not busy himself with the Law He was never circumcised That does not mean that his faith was inactive He said to the Prophet Elisha Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing What did the Prophet tell him Go in peace The Jews do not like to hear the prophet say this What they exclaim should this heathen be justified without the Law Should he be made equal to us who are circumcised Long before the time of Moses God justified men without the Law He justified many kings of Egypt and Babylonia He justified Job Nineveh that great city was justified and received the promise of God that He would not destroy the city Why was Nineveh spared Not because it fulfilled the Law but because Nineveh believed the word of God The Prophet Jonah writes So the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth They repented Nowhere in the Book of Jonah do you read that the Ninevites received the Law of Moses or that they were circumcised or that they offered sacrifices All this happened long before Christ was born If the Gentiles were justified without the Law and quietly received the Holy Spirit at a time when the Law was in full force why should the Law count unto righteousness now now that Christ has fulfilled the Law And yet many devote much time and labor to the Law to the decrees of the fathers and to the traditions of the Pope Many of these specialists have incapacitated themselves for any kind of work good or bad by their rigorous attention to rules and laws All the same they could not obtain a quiet conscience and peace in Christ But the moment the Gospel of Christ touches them certainty comes to them and joy and a right judgment I have good reason for enlarging upon this point The heart of man finds it difficult to believe that so great a treasure as the Holy Ghost is gotten by the mere hearing of faith The hearer likes to reason like this Forgiveness of sins deliverance from death the gift of the Holy Ghost everlasting life are grand things If you want to obtain these priceless benefits you must engage in correspondingly great efforts And the devil says Amen We must learn that forgiveness of sins Christ and the Holy Ghost are freely granted unto us at the preaching of faith in spite of our sinfulness We are not to waste time thinking how unworthy we are of the blessings of God We are to know that it pleased God freely to give us His unspeakable gifts If He offers His gifts free of charge why not take them Why worry about our lack of worthiness Why not accept gifts with joy and thanksgiving Right away foolish reason is once more offended It scolds us When you say that a person can do nothing to obtain the grace of God you foster carnal security People become shiftless and will do no good at all Better not preach this doctrine of faith Rather urge the people to exert and to exercise themselves in good works so that the Holy Ghost will feel like coming to them What did Jesus say to Martha when she was very careful and troubled about many things and could hardly stand to see her sister Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus just listening Martha Martha Jesus said thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her A person becomes a Christian not by working but by hearing The first step to being a Christian is to hear the Gospel When a person has accepted the Gospel let him first give thanks unto God with a glad heart and then let him get busy on the good works to strive for works that really please God and not man made and self chosen works Our opponents regard faith as an easy thing but I know from personal experience how hard it is to believe That the Holy Ghost is received by faith is quickly said but not so quickly done All believers experience this difficulty They would gladly embrace the Word with a full faith but the flesh deters them You see our reason always thinks it is too easy and cheap to have righteousness the Holy Spirit and life everlasting by the mere hearing of the Gospel VERSE three Are ye so foolish having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh Paul now begins to warn the Galatians against a twofold danger The first danger is Are ye so foolish that after ye have begun in the Spirit ye would now end in the flesh Flesh stands for the righteousness of reason which seeks justification by the accomplishment of the Law I am told that I began in the spirit under the papacy but am ending up in the flesh because I got married As though single life were a spiritual life and married life a carnal life They are silly All the duties of a Christian husband e g to love his wife to bring up his children to govern his family et cetera are the very fruits of the Spirit The righteousness of the Law which Paul also terms the righteousness of the flesh is so far from justifying a person that those who once had the Holy Spirit and lost Him end up in the Law to their complete destruction VERSE four Have ye suffered so many things in vain The other danger against which the Apostle warns the Galatians is this Have ye suffered so many things in vain Paul wants to say Consider not only the good start you had and lost but consider also the many things you have suffered for the sake of the Gospel and for the name of Christ You have suffered the loss of your possessions you have borne reproaches you have passed through many dangers of body and life You endured much for the name of Christ and you endured it faithfully But now you have lost everything the Gospel faith and the spiritual benefit of your sufferings for Christ s sake What a miserable thing to endure so many afflictions for nothing VERSE four If it be yet in vain The Apostle adds the afterthought If it be yet in vain I do not despair of all hope for you But if you continue to look to the Law for righteousness I think you should be told that all your past true worship of God and all the afflictions that you have endured for Christ s sake are going to help you not at all I do not mean to discourage you altogether I do hope you will repent and amend VERSE five He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith This argument based on the experience of the Galatians pleased the Apostle so well that he returns to it after he had warned them against their twofold danger You have not only received the Spirit by the preaching of the Gospel but by the same Gospel you were enabled to do things What things we ask Miracles At least the Galatians had manifested the striking fruits of faith which true disciples of the Gospel manifested in those days On one occasion the Apostle wrote The kingdom of God is not in word but in power This power revealed itself not only in readiness of speech but in demonstrations of the supernatural ability of the Holy Spirit When the Gospel is preached unto faith hope love and patience God gives His wonder working Spirit Paul reminds the Galatians of this God had not only brought you to faith by my preaching He had also sanctified you to bring forth the fruits of faith And one of the fruits of your faith was that you loved me so devotedly that you were willing to pluck out your eyes for me To love a fellow man so devotedly as to be ready to bestow upon him money goods eyes in order to secure his salvation such love is the fruit of the Holy Spirit These products of the Spirit you enjoyed before the false apostles misled you the Apostle reminds the Galatians But you haven t manifested any of these fruits under the regime of the Law How does it come that you do not grow the same fruits now You no longer teach truly you do not believe boldly you do not live well you do not work hard you do not bear things patiently Who has spoiled you that you no longer love me that you are not now ready to pluck out your eyes for me What has happened to cool your personal interest in me The same thing happened to me When I began to proclaim the Gospel there were many very many who were delighted with our doctrine and had a good opinion of us And now Now they have succeeded in making us so odious to those who formerly loved us that they now hate us like poison Paul argues Your experience ought to teach you that the fruits of love do not grow on the stump of the Law You had not virtue prior to the preaching of the Gospel and you have no virtues now under the regime of the false apostles We too may say to those who misname themselves evangelical and flout their new found liberty Have you put down the tyranny of the Pope and obtained liberty in Christ through the Anabaptists and other fanatics Or have you obtained your freedom from us who preach faith in Christ Jesus If there is any honesty left in them they will have to confess that their freedom dates from the preaching of the Gospel VERSE six Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness The Apostle next adduces the example of Abraham and reviews the testimony of the Scriptures concerning faith The first passage is taken from Genesis sixteen six And he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness The Apostle makes the most of this passage Abraham may have enjoyed a good standing with men for his upright life but not with God In the sight of God Abraham was a condemned sinner That he was justified before God was not due to his own exertions but due to his faith The Scriptures expressly state Abraham believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness Paul places the emphasis upon the two words Abraham believed Faith in God constitutes the highest worship the prime duty the first obedience and the foremost sacrifice Without faith God forfeits His glory wisdom truth and mercy in us The first duty of man is to believe in God and to honor Him with his faith Faith is truly the height of wisdom the right kind of righteousness the only real religion This will give us an idea of the excellence of faith To believe in God as Abraham did is to be right with God because faith honors God Faith says to God I believe what you say When we pay attention to reason God seems to propose impossible matters in the Christian Creed To reason it seems absurd that Christ should offer His body and blood in the Lord s Supper that Baptism should be the washing of regeneration that the dead shall rise that Christ the Son of God was conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary et cetera Reason shouts that all this is preposterous Are you surprised that reason thinks little of faith Reason thinks it ludicrous that faith should be the foremost service any person can render unto God Let your faith supplant reason Abraham mastered reason by faith in the Word of God Not as though reason ever yields meekly It put up a fight against the faith of Abraham Reason protested that it was absurd to think that Sarah who was ninety years old and barren by nature should give birth to a son But faith won the victory and routed reason that ugly beast and enemy of God Everyone who by faith slays reason the world s biggest monster renders God a real service a better service than the religions of all races and all the drudgery of meritorious monks can render Men fast pray watch suffer They intend to appease the wrath of God and to deserve God s grace by their exertions But there is no glory in it for God because by their exertions these workers pronounce God an unmerciful slave driver an unfaithful and angry Judge They despise God make a liar out of Him snub Christ and all His benefits in short they pull God from His throne and perch themselves on it Faith truly honors God And because faith honors God God counts faith for righteousness Christian righteousness is the confidence of the heart in God through Christ Jesus Such confidence is accounted righteousness for Christ s sake Two things make for Christian righteousness Faith in Christ which is a gift of God and God s acceptance of this imperfect faith of ours for perfect righteousness Because of my faith in Christ God overlooks my distrust the unwillingness of my spirit my many other sins Because the shadow of Christ s wing covers me I have no fear that God will cover all my sins and take my imperfections for perfect righteousness God winks at my sins and covers them up God says Because you believe in My Son I will forgive your sins until death shall deliver you from the body of sin Learn to understand the constitution of your Christian righteousness Faith is weak but it means enough to God that He will not lay sin to our charge He will not punish nor condemn us for it He will forgive our sins as though they amount to nothing at all He will do it not because we are worthy of such mercy He will do it for Jesus sake in whom we believe Paradoxically a Christian is both right and wrong holy and profane an enemy of God and a child of God These contradictions no person can harmonize who does not understand the true way of salvation Under the papacy we were told to toil until the feeling of guilt had left us But the authors of this deranged idea were frequently driven to despair in the hour of death It would have happened to me if Christ had not mercifully delivered me from this error We comfort the afflicted sinner in this manner Brother you can never be perfect in this life but you can be holy He will say How can I be holy when I feel my sins I answer You feel sin That is a good sign To realize that one is ill is a step and a very necessary step toward recovery But how will I get rid of my sin he will ask I answer See the heavenly Physician Christ who heals the broken hearted Do not consult that Quackdoctor Reason Believe in Christ and your sins will be pardoned His righteousness will become your righteousness and your sins will become His sins On one occasion Jesus said to His disciples The Father loveth you Why Not because the disciples were Pharisees or circumcised or particularly attentive to the Law Jesus said The Father loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from God It pleased you to know that the Father sent me into the world And because you believed it the Father loves you On another occasion Jesus called His disciples evil and commanded them to ask for forgiveness A Christian is beloved of God and a sinner How can these two contradictions be harmonized I am a sinner and deserve God s wrath and punishment and yet the Father loves me Christ alone can harmonize these contradictions He is the Mediator Do you now see how faith justifies without works Sin lingers in us and God hates sin A transfusion of righteousness therefore becomes vitally necessary This transfusion of righteousness we obtain from Christ because we believe in Him VERSE seven Know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham This is the main point of Paul s argument against the Jews The children of Abraham are those who believe and not those who are born of Abraham s flesh and blood This point Paul drives home with all his might because the Jews attached saving value to the genealogical fact We are the seed and children of Abraham Let us begin with Abraham and learn how this friend of God was justified and saved Not because he left his country his relatives his father s house not because he was circumcised not because he stood ready to sacrifice his own son Isaac in whom he had the promise of posterity Abraham was justified because he believed Paul s argumentation runs like this Since this is the unmistakable testimony of Holy Writ why do you take your stand upon circumcision and the Law Was not Abraham your father of whom you make so much justified and saved without circumcision and the Law by faith alone Paul therefore concludes They which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham Abraham was the father of the faithful In order to be a child of the believing Abraham you must believe as he did Otherwise you are merely the physical offspring of the procreating Abraham i e you were conceived and born in sin unto wrath and condemnation Ishmael and Isaac were both the natural children of Abraham By rights Ishmael should have enjoyed the prerogatives of the firstborn if physical generation had any special value Nevertheless he was left out in the cold while Isaac was called This goes to prove that the children of faith are the real children of Abraham Some find fault with Paul for applying the term faith in Genesis fifteen six to Christ They think Paul s use of the term too wide and general They think its meaning should be restricted to the context They claim Abraham s faith had no more in it than a belief in the promise of God that he should have seed We reply Faith presupposes the assurance of God s mercy This assurance takes in the confidence that our sins are forgiven for Christ s sake Never will the conscience trust in God unless it can be sure of God s mercy and promises in Christ Now all the promises of God lead back to the first promise concerning Christ And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel The faith of the fathers in the Old Testament era and our faith in the New Testament are one and the same faith in Christ Jesus although times and conditions may differ Peter acknowledged this in the words Which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they Acts lfive ten eleven And Paul writes And did all drink the spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them and that Rock was Christ I Cor ten four And Christ Himself declared Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad John eight fifty six The faith of the fathers was directed at the Christ who was to come while ours rests in the Christ who has come Time does not change the object of true faith or the Holy Spirit There has always been and always will be one mind one impression one faith concerning Christ among true believers whether they live in times past now or in times to come We too believe in the Christ to come as the fathers did in the Old Testament for we look for Christ to come again on the last day to judge the quick and the dead VERSE seven Know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham Paul is saying You know from the example of Abraham and from the plain testimony of the Scriptures that they are the children of Abraham who have faith in Christ regardless of their nationality regardless of the Law regardless of works regardless of their parentage The promise was made unto Abraham Thou shalt be a father of many nations again And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed To prevent the Jews from misinterpreting the word nations the Scriptures are careful to say many nations The true children of Abraham are the believers in Christ from all nations VERSE eight And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith Your boasting does not get you anywhere says Paul to the Galatians because the Sacred Scriptures foresaw and foretold long before the Law was ever given that the heathen should be justified by the blessed seed of Abraham and not by the Law This promise was made four hundred and thirty years before the Law was given Because the Law was given so many years after Abraham it could not abolish the promised blessing This argument is strong because it is based on the exact factor of time Why should you boast of the Law my Galatians when the Law came four hundred and thirty years after the promise The false apostles glorified the Law and despised the promise made unto Abraham although it antedated the Law by many years It was after Abraham was accounted righteous because of his faith that the Scriptures first make mention of circumcision The Scriptures says Paul meant to forestall your infatuation for the righteousness of the Law by installing the righteousness of faith before circumcision and the Law ever were ordained VERSE eight Preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying In thee shall all nations be blessed The Jews misconstrue this passage They want the term to bless to mean to praise They want the passage to read In thee shall all the nations of the earth be praised But this is a perversion of the words of Holy Writ With the words Abraham believed Paul describes a spiritual Abraham renewed by faith and regenerated by the Holy Ghost that he should be the spiritual father of many nations In that way all the Gentiles could be given to him for an inheritance The Scriptures ascribe no righteousness to Abraham except through faith The Scriptures speak of Abraham as he stands before God a man justified by faith Because of his faith God extends to him the promise In thee shall all nations be blessed VERSE nine So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham The emphasis lies on the words with faithful Abraham Paul distinguishes between Abraham and Abraham There is a working and there is a believing Abraham With the working Abraham we have nothing to do Let the Jews glory in the generating Abraham we glory in the believing Abraham of whom the Scriptures say that he received the blessing of righteousness by faith not only for himself but for all who believe as he did The world was promised to Abraham because he believed The whole world is blessed if it believes as Abraham believed The blessing is the promise of the Gospel That all nations are to be blessed means that all nations are to hear the Gospel All nations are to be declared righteous before God through faith in Christ Jesus To bless simply means to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ s salvation This is the office of the New Testament Church which distributes the promised blessing by preaching the Gospel by administering the sacraments by comforting the broken hearted in short by dispensing the benefits of Christ The Jews exhibited a working Abraham The Pope exhibits a working Christ or an exemplary Christ The Pope quotes Christ s saying recorded in John thirteen fifteen I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you We do not deny that Christians ought to imitate the example of Christ but mere imitation will not satisfy God And bear in mind that Paul is not now discussing the example of Christ but the salvation of Christ That Abraham submitted to circumcision at the command of God that he was endowed with excellent virtues that he obeyed God in all things was certainly admirable of him To follow the example of Christ to love one s neighbor to do good to them that persecute you to pray for one s enemies patiently to bear the ingratitude of those who return evil for good is certainly praiseworthy But praiseworthy or not such virtues do not acquit us before God It takes more than that to make us righteous before God We need Christ Himself not His example to save us We need a redeeming not an exemplary Christ to save us Paul is here speaking of the redeeming Christ and the believing Abraham not of the model Christ or the sweating Abraham The believing Abraham is not to lie buried in the grave He is to be dusted off and brought out before the world He is to be praised to the sky for his faith Heaven and earth ought to know about him and about his faith in Christ The working Abraham ought to look pretty small next to the believing Abraham Paul s words contain the implication of contrast When he quotes Scripture to the effect that all nations that share the faith of faithful Abraham are to be blessed Paul means to imply the contrast that all nations are accursed without faith in Christ VERSE ten For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse The curse of God is like a flood that swallows everything that is not of faith To avoid the curse we must hold on to the promise of the blessing in Christ The reader is reminded that all this has no bearing upon civil laws customs or political matters Civil laws and ordinances have their place and purpose Let every government enact the best possible laws But civil righteousness will never deliver a person from the condemnation of God s Law I have good reason for calling your attention to this People easily mistake civil righteousness for spiritual righteousness In civil life we must of course pay attention to laws and deeds but in the spiritual life we must not think to be justified by laws and works but always keep in mind the promise and blessing of Christ our only Savior According to Paul everything that is not of faith is sin When our opponents hear us repeat this statement of Paul they make it appear as if we taught that governments should not be honored as if we favored rebellion against the constituted authorities as if we condemned all laws Our opponents do us a great wrong for we make a clear cut distinction between civil and spiritual affairs Governmental laws and ordinances are blessings of God for this life only As for everlasting life temporal blessings are not good enough Unbelievers enjoy more temporal blessings than the Christians Civil or legal righteousness may be good enough for this life but not for the life hereafter Otherwise the infidels would be nearer heaven than the Christians for infidels often excel in civil righteousness VERSE ten For it is written Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them Paul goes on to prove from this quotation out of the Book of Deuteronomy that all men who are under the Law are under the sentence of sin of the wrath of God and of everlasting death Paul produces his proof in a roundabout way He turns the negative statement Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them into a positive statement As many as are of the works of the law are under the curse These two statements one by Paul and the other by Moses appear to conflict Paul declares Whosoever shall do the works of the Law is accursed Moses declares Whosoever shall not do the works of the Law is accursed How can these two contradictory statements be reconciled How can the one statement prove the other No person can hope to understand Paul unless he understands the article of justification These two statements are not at all inconsistent We must bear in mind that to do the works of the Law does not mean only to live up to the superficial requirements of the Law but to obey the spirit of the Law to perfection But where will you find the person who can do that Let him step forward and we will praise him Our opponents have their answer ready made They quote Paul s own statement in Romans two thirteen The doers of the law shall be justified Very well But let us first find out who the doers of the law are They call a doer of the Law one who performs the Law in its literal sense This is not to do the Law This is to sin When our opponents go about to perform the Law they sin against the first the second and the third commandments in fact they sin against the whole Law For God requires above all that we worship Him in spirit and in faith In observing the Law for the purpose of obtaining righteousness without faith in Christ these law workers go smack against the Law and against God They deny the righteousness of God His mercy and His promises They deny Christ and all His benefits In their ignorance of the true purpose of the Law the exponents of the Law abuse the Law as Paul says Romans ten three For they being ignorant of God s righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God In their folly our opponents rush into the Scriptures pick out a sentence here and a sentence there about the Law and imagine they know all about it Their work righteousness is plain idolatry and blasphemy against God No wonder they abide under the curse of God Because God saw that we could not fulfill the Law He provided a way of salvation long before the Law was ever given a salvation that He promised to Abraham saying In thee shall all nations be blessed The very first thing for us to do is to believe in Christ First we must receive the Holy Spirit who enlightens and sanctifies us so that we can begin to do the Law i e to love God and our neighbor Now the Holy Ghost is not obtained by the Law but by faith in Christ In the last analysis to do the Law means to believe in Jesus Christ The tree comes first and then come the fruits The scholastics admit that a mere external and superficial performance of the Law without sincerity and good will is plain hypocrisy Judas acted like the other disciples What was wrong with Judas Mark what Rome answers Judas was a reprobate His motives were perverse therefore his works were hypocritical and no good Well well Rome does admit after all that works in themselves do not justify unless they issue from a sincere heart Why do our opponents not profess the same truth in spiritual matters There above all faith must precede everything The heart must be purified by faith before a person can lift a finger to please God There are two classes of doers of the Law true doers and hypocritical doers The true doers of the Law are those who are moved by faith in Christ to do the Law The hypocritical doers of the Law are those who seek to obtain righteousness by a mechanical performance of good works while their hearts are far removed from God They act like the foolish carpenter who starts with the roof when he builds a house Instead of doing the Law these law conscious hypocrites break the Law They break the very first commandment of God by denying His promise in Christ They do not worship God in faith They worship themselves No wonder Paul was able to foretell the abominations that Antichrist would bring into the Church That Antichrists would come Christ Himself prophesied Matthew twenty four five For many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many Whoever seeks righteousness by works denies God and makes himself God He is an Antichrist because he ascribes to his own works the omnipotent capability of conquering sin death devil hell and the wrath of God An Antichrist lays claim to the honor of Christ He is an idolater of himself The law righteous person is the worst kind of infidel Those who intend to obtain righteousness by their own efforts do not say in so many words I am God I am Christ But it amounts to that They usurp the divinity and office of Christ The effect is the same as if they said I am Christ I am a Savior I save myself and others This is the impression the monks give out The Pope is the Antichrist because he is against Christ because he takes liberties with the things of God because he lords it over the temple of God I cannot tell you in words how criminal it is to seek righteousness before God without faith in Christ by the works of the Law It is the abomination standing in the holy place It deposes the Creator and deifies the creature The real doers of the Law are the true believers The Holy Spirit enables them to love God and their neighbor But because we have only the first fruits of the Spirit and not the tenth fruits we do not observe the Law perfectly This imperfection of ours however is not imputed to us for Christ s sake Hence the statement of Moses Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them is not contrary to Paul Moses requires perfect doers of the Law But where will you find them Nowhere Moses himself confessed that he was not a perfect doer of the Law He said to the Lord Pardon our iniquity and our sin Christ alone can make us innocent of any transgression How so First by the forgiveness of our sins and the imputation of His righteousness Secondly by the gift of the Holy Ghost who engenders new life and activity in us Objections to the Doctrine of Faith Disproved Here we shall take the time to enter upon the objections which our opponents raise against the doctrine of faith There are many passages in the Bible that deal with works and the reward of works which our opponents cite against us in the belief that these will disprove the doctrine of faith which we teach The scholastics grant that according to the reasonable order of nature being precedes doing They grant that any act is faulty unless it proceeds from a right motive They grant that a person must be right before he can do right Why don t they grant that the right inclination of the heart toward God through faith in Christ must precede works In the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews we find a catalogue of various works and deeds of the saints of the Bible David who killed a lion and a bear and defeated Goliath is mentioned In the heroic deeds of David the scholastic can discover nothing more than outward achievement But the deeds of David must be evaluated according to the personality of David When we understand that David was a man of faith whose heart trusted in the Lord we shall understand why he could do such heroic deeds David said The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine Again Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts the God of the armies of Israel whom thou hast defied This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take thine head from thee I Samuel seventeen thirty seven forty five forty six Before David could achieve a single heroic deed he was already a man beloved of God strong and constant in faith Of Abel it is said in the same Epistle By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain When the scholastics come upon the parallel passage in Genesis four four they get no further than the words And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering Aha they cry See God has respect to offerings Works do justify With mud in their eyes they cannot see that the text says in Genesis that the Lord had respect to the person of Abel first Abel pleased the Lord because of his faith Because the person of Abel pleased the Lord the offering of Abel pleased the Lord also The Epistle to the Hebrews expressly states By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice In our dealings with God the work is worth nothing without faith for without faith it is impossible to please him Hebrews eleven six The sacrifice of Abel was better than the sacrifice of Cain because Abel had faith As to Cain he had no faith or trust in God s grace but strutted about in his own fancied worth When God refused to recognize Cain s worth Cain got angry at God and at Abel The Holy Spirit speaks of faith in different ways in the Sacred Scriptures Sometimes He speaks of faith independently of other matters When the Scriptures speak of faith in the absolute or abstract faith refers to justification directly But when the Scripture speaks of rewards and works it speaks of compound or relative faith We will furnish some examples Galatians five six Faith which worketh by love Leviticus eighteen five Which if a man do he shall live in them Matthew nineteen seventeen If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments Psalm thirty seven twenty seven Depart from evil and do good In these and other passages where mention is made of doing the Scriptures always speak of a faithful doing a doing inspired by faith Do this and thou shalt live means First have faith in Christ and Christ will enable you to do and to live In the Word of God all things that are attributed to works are attributable to faith Faith is the divinity of works Faith permeates all the deeds of the believer as Christ s divinity permeated His humanity Abraham was accounted righteous because faith pervaded his whole personality and his every action When you read how the fathers prophets and kings accomplished great deeds remember to explain them as the Epistle to the Hebrews accounts for them Who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions Hebrews eleven thirty three In this way will we correctly interpret all those passages that seem to support the righteousness of works The Law is truly observed only through faith Hence every holy moral law worker is accursed Supposing that this explanation will not satisfy the scholastics supposing that they should completely wrap me up in their arguments they cannot do it I would rather be wrong and give all credit to Christ alone Here is Christ Paul Christ s apostle declares that Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us Gal three thirteen I hear with my own ears that I cannot be saved except by the blood and death of Christ I conclude therefore that it is up to Christ to overcome my sins and not up to the Law or my own efforts If He is the price of my redemption if He was made sin for my justification I don t give a care if you quote me a thousand Scripture passages for the righteousness of works against the righteousness of faith I have the Author and Lord of the Scriptures on my side I would rather believe Him than all that riffraff of pious law workers VERSE eleven But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for The just shall live by faith The Apostle draws into his argument the testimony of the Prophet Habakkuk The just shall live by his faith This passage carries much weight because it eliminates the Law and the deeds of the Law as factors in the process of our justification The scholastics misconstrue this passage by saying The just shall live by faith if it is a working faith or a faith formed and performed by charitable works Their annotation is a forgery To speak of formed or unformed faith a sort of double faith is contrary to the Scriptures If charitable works can form and perfect faith I am forced to say eventually that charitable deeds constitute the essential factor in the Christian religion Christ and His benefits would be lost to us VERSE twelve And the law is not of faith In direct opposition to the scholastics Paul declares The law is not of faith What is this charity the scholastics talk so much about Does not the Law command charity The fact is the Law commands nothing but charity as we may gather from the following Scripture passages Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might Deut six five Strewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments Exodus twenty six On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets Matt twenty two forty If the law requires charity charity is part of the Law and not of faith Since Christ has displaced the Law which commands charity it follows that charity has been abrogated with the Law as a factor in our justification and only faith is left VERSE twelve But The man that doeth them shall live in them Paul undertakes to explain the difference between the righteousness of the Law and the righteousness of faith The righteousness of the Law is the fulfillment of the Law according to the passage The man that doeth them shall live in them The righteousness of faith is to believe the Gospel according to the passage The just shall live by faith The Law is a statement of debit the Gospel a statement of credit By this distinction Paul explains why charity which is the commandment of the Law cannot justify because the Law contributes nothing to our justification Indeed works do follow after faith but faith is not therefore a meritorious work Faith is a gift The character and limitations of the Law must be rigidly maintained When we believe in Christ we live by faith When we believe in the Law we may be active enough but we have no life The function of the Law is not to give life the function of the Law is to kill True the Law says The man that doeth them shall live in them But where is the person who can do them i e love God with all his heart soul and mind and his neighbor as himself Paul has nothing against those who are justified by faith and therefore are true doers of the Law He opposes those who think they can fulfill the Law when in reality they can only sin against the Law by trying to obtain righteousness by the Law The Law demands that we fear love and worship God with a true faith The law workers fail to do this Instead they invent new modes of worship and new kinds of works which God never commanded They provoke His anger according to the passage But in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men Matthew fifteen nine Hence the law righteous workers are downright rebels against God and idolaters who constantly sin against the first commandment In short they are no good at all though outwardly they seem to be extremely solicitous of the honor of God We who are justified by faith as the saints of old may be under the Law but we are not under the curse of the Law because sin is not imputed to us for Christ s sake If the Law cannot be fulfilled by the believers if sin continues to cling to them despite their love for God what can you expect of people who are not yet justified by faith who are still enemies of God and His Word like the unbelieving law workers It goes to show how impossible it is for those who have not been justified by faith to fulfill the Law VERSE thirteen Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree Jerome and his present day followers rack their miserable brains over this comforting passage in an effort to save Christ from the fancied insult of being called a curse They say This quotation from Moses does not apply to Christ Paul is taking liberties with Moses by generalizing the statements in Deuteronomy twenty one twenty three Moses has he that is hanged Paul puts it every one that hangeth On the other hand Paul omits the words of God in his quotation from Moses For he that is hanged is accursed of God Moses speaks of a criminal who is worthy of death How our opponents ask can this passage be applied to the holy Christ as if He were accursed of God and worthy to be hanged This piece of exegesis may impress the naive as a zealous attempt to defend the honor and glory of Christ Let us see what Paul has in mind Paul does not say that Christ was made a curse for Himself The accent is on the two words for us Christ is personally innocent Personally He did not deserve to be hanged for any crime of His own doing But because Christ took the place of others who were sinners He was hanged like any other transgressor The Law of Moses leaves no loopholes It says that a transgressor should be hanged Who are the other sinners We are The sentence of death and everlasting damnation had long been pronounced over us But Christ took all our sins and died for them on the Cross He was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors Isaiah fifty three twelve All the prophets of old said that Christ should be the greatest transgressor murderer adulterer thief blasphemer that ever was or ever could be on earth When He took the sins of the whole world upon Himself Christ was no longer an innocent person He was a sinner burdened with the sins of a Paul who was a blasphemer burdened with the sins of a Peter who denied Christ burdened with the sins of a David who committed adultery and murder and gave the heathen occasion to laugh at the Lord In short Christ was charged with the sins of all men that He should pay for them with His own blood The curse struck Him The Law found Him among sinners He was not only in the company of sinners He had gone so far as to invest Himself with the flesh and blood of sinners So the Law judged and hanged Him for a sinner In separating Christ from us sinners and holding Him up as a holy exemplar errorists rob us of our best comfort They misrepresent Him as a threatening tyrant who is ready to slaughter us at the slightest provocation I am told that it is preposterous and wicked to call the Son of God a cursed sinner I answer If you deny that He is a condemned sinner you are forced to deny that Christ died It is not less preposterous to say the Son of God died than to say the Son of God was a sinner John the Baptist called Him the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world Being the unspotted Lamb of God Christ was personally innocent But because He took the sins of the world His sinlessness was defiled with the sinfulness of the world Whatever sins I you all of us have committed or shall commit they are Christ s sins as if He had committed them Himself Our sins have to be Christ s sins or we shall perish forever Isaiah declares of Christ The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all We have no right to minimize the force of this declaration God does not amuse Himself with words What a relief for a Christian to know that Christ is covered all over with my sins your sins and the sins of the whole world The papists invented their own doctrine of faith They say charity creates and adorns their faith By stripping Christ of our sins by making Him sinless they cast our sins back at us and make Christ absolutely worthless to us What sort of charity is this If that is a sample of their vaunted charity we want none of it Our merciful Father in heaven saw how the Law oppressed us and how impossible it was for us to get out from under the curse of the Law He therefore sent His only Son into the world and said to Him You are now Peter the liar Paul the persecutor David the adulterer Adam the disobedient the thief on the cross You My Son must pay the world s iniquity The Law growls All right If Your Son is taking the sin of the world I see no sins anywhere else but in Him He shall die on the Cross And the Law kills Christ But we go free The argument of the Apostle against the righteousness of the Law is impregnable If Christ bears our sins we do not bear them But if Christ is innocent of our sins and does not bear them we must bear them and we shall die in our sins But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ Let us see how Christ was able to gain the victory over our enemies The sins of the whole world past present and future fastened themselves upon Christ and condemned Him But because Christ is God He had an everlasting and unconquerable righteousness These two the sin of the world and the righteousness of God met in a death struggle Furiously the sin of the world assailed the righteousness of God Righteousness is immortal and invincible On the other hand sin is a mighty tyrant who subdues all men This tyrant pounces on Christ But Christ s righteousness is unconquerable The result is inevitable Sin is defeated and righteousness triumphs and reigns forever In the same manner was death defeated Death is emperor of the world He strikes down kings princes all men He has an idea to destroy all life But Christ has immortal life and life immortal gained the victory over death Through Christ death has lost her sting Christ is the Death of death The curse of God waged a similar battle with the eternal mercy of God in Christ The curse meant to condemn God s mercy But it could not do it because the mercy of God is everlasting The curse had to give way If the mercy of God in Christ had lost out God Himself would have lost out which of course is impossible Christ says Paul spoiled principalities and powers He made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it colonel two fifteen They cannot harm those who hide in Christ Sin death the wrath of God hell the devil are mortified in Christ Where Christ is near the powers of evil must keep their distance saint John says And this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith I John five four You may now perceive why it is imperative to believe and confess the divinity of Christ To overcome the sin of a whole world and death and the wrath of God was no work for any creature The power of sin and death could be broken only by a greater power God alone could abolish sin destroy death and take away the curse of the Law God alone could bring righteousness life and mercy to light In attributing these achievements to Christ the Scriptures pronounce Christ to be God forever The article of justification is indeed fundamental If we remain sound in this one article we remain sound in all the other articles of the Christian faith When we teach justification by faith in Christ we confess at the same time that Christ is God I cannot get over the blindness of the Pope s theologians To imagine that the mighty forces of sin death and the curse can be vanquished by the righteousness of man s paltry works by fasting pilgrimages masses vows and such gewgaws These blind leaders of the blind turn the poor people over to the mercy of sin death and the devil What chance has a defenseless human creature against these powers of darkness They train sinners who are ten times worse than any thief whore murderer The divine power of God alone can destroy sin and death and create righteousness and life When we hear that Christ was made a curse for us let us believe it with joy and assurance By faith Christ changes places with us He gets our sins we get His holiness By faith alone can we become righteous for faith invests us with the sinlessness of Christ The more fully we believe this the fuller will be our joy If you believe that sin death and the curse are void why they are null zero Whenever sin and death make you nervous write it down as an illusion of the devil There is no sin now no curse no death no devil because Christ has done away with them This fact is sure There is nothing wrong with the fact The defect lies in our lack of faith In the Apostolic Creed we confess I believe in the holy Christian Church That means I believe that there is no sin no curse no evil in the Church of God Faith says I believe that But if you want to believe your eyes you will find many shortcomings and offenses in the members of the holy Church You see them succumb to temptation you see them weak in faith you see them giving way to anger envy and other evil dispositions How can the Church be holy you ask It is with the Christian Church as it is with the individual Christian If I examine myself I find enough unholiness to shock me But when I look at Christ in me I find that I am altogether holy And so it is with the Church Holy Writ does not say that Christ was under the curse It says directly that Christ was made a curse In II Corinthians five twenty one Paul writes For he God hath made him Christ to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Although this and similar passages may be properly explained by saying that Christ was made a sacrifice for the curse and for sin yet in my judgment it is better to leave these passages stand as they read Christ was made sin itself Christ was made the curse itself When a sinner gets wise to himself he does not only feel miserable he feels like misery personified he does not only feel like a sinner he feels like sin itself To finish with this verse All evils would have overwhelmed us as they shall overwhelm the unbelievers forever if Christ had not become the great transgressor and guilty bearer of all our sins The sins of the world got Him down for a moment They came around Him like water Of Christ the Old Testament Prophet complained Thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off Psalm eighty eight sixteen By Christ s salvation we have been delivered from the terrors of God to a life of eternal felicity VERSE fourteen That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ Paul always keeps this text before him In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed The blessing promised unto Abraham could come upon the Gentiles only by Christ the seed of Abraham To become a blessing unto all nations Christ had to be made a curse to take away the curse from the nations of the earth The merit that we plead and the work that we proffer is Christ who was made a curse for us Let us become expert in the art of transferring our sins our death and every evil from ourselves to Christ and Christ s righteousness and blessing from Christ to ourselves VERSE fourteen That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith The promise of the Spirit is Hebrew for the promised Spirit The Spirit spells freedom from the Law sin death the curse hell and the judgment of God No merits are mentioned in connection with this promise of the Spirit and all the blessings that go with Him This Spirit of many blessings is received by faith alone Faith alone builds on the promises of God as Paul says in this verse Long ago the prophets visualized the happy changes Christ would effect in all things Despite the fact that the Jews had the Law of God they never ceased to look longingly for Christ After Moses no prophet or king added a single law to the Book Any changes or additions were deferred to the time of Christ s coming Moses told the people The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken Deut eighteen fifteen God s people of old felt that the Law of Moses could not be improved upon until the Messiah would bring better things than the Law i e grace and remission of sins VERSE fifteen Brethren I speak after the manner of men Though it be but a man s covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto After the preceding well taken argument Paul offers another based on the similarity between a man s testament and God s testament A man s testament seems too weak a premise for the Apostle to argue from in confirmation of so important a matter as justification We ought to prove earthly things by heavenly things and not heavenly things by earthly things But where the earthly thing is an ordinance of God we may use it to prove divine matters In Matthew seven eleven Christ Himself argued from earthly to heavenly things when He said If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him To come to Paul s argument Civil law which is God s ordinance prohibits tampering with any testament of man Any person s last will and testament must be respected Paul asks Why is it that man s last will is scrupulously respected and not God s testament You would not think of breaking faith with a man s testament Why do you not keep faith with God s testament The Apostle says that he is speaking after the manner of men He means to say I will give you an illustration from the customs of men If a man s last will is respected and it is how much more ought the testament of God be honored In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed When Christ died this testament was sealed by His blood After His death the testament was opened it was published to the nations No man ought to alter God s testament as the false apostles do who substitute the Law and traditions of men for the testament of God As the false prophets tampered with God s testament in the days of Paul so many do in our day They will observe human laws punctiliously but the laws of God they transgress without the flicker of an eyelid But the time will come when they will find out that it is no joke to pervert the testament of God VERSE sixteen Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made He saith not And to seeds as of many but as of one And to thy seed which is Christ The word testament is another name for the promise that God made unto Abraham concerning Christ A testament is not a law but an inheritance Heirs do not look for laws and assessments when they open a last will they look for grants and favors The testament which God made out to Abraham did not contain laws It contained promises of great spiritual blessings The promises were made in view of Christ in one seed not in many seeds The Jews will not accept this interpretation They insist that the singular seed is put for the plural seeds We prefer the interpretation of Paul who makes a fine case for Christ and for us out of the singular seed and is after all inspired to do so by the Holy Ghost VERSE seventeen And this I say that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect The Jews assert that God was not satisfied with His promises but after four hundred and thirty years He gave the Law God they say must have mistrusted His own promises and considered them inadequate for salvation Therefore He added to His promises something better the Law The Law they say canceled the promises Paul answers The Law was given four hundred and thirty years after the promise was made to Abraham The Law could not cancel the promise because the promise was the testament of God confirmed by God in Christ many years before the Law What God has once promised He does not take back Every promise of God is a ratified promise Why was the Law added to the promise Not to serve as a medium by which the promise might be obtained The Law was added for these reasons That there might be in the world a special people rigidly controlled by the Law a people out of which Christ should be born in due time and that men burdened by many laws might sigh and long for Him their Redeemer the seed of Abraham Even the ceremonies prescribed by the Law foreshadowed Christ Therefore the Law was never meant to cancel the promise of God The Law was meant to confirm the promise until the time should come when God would open His testament in the Gospel of Jesus Christ God did well in giving the promise so many years before the Law that it may never be said that righteousness is granted through the Law and not through the promise If God had meant for us to be justified by the Law He would have given the Law four hundred and thirty years before the promise at least He would have given the Law at the same time He gave the promise But He never breathed a word about the Law until four hundred years after The promise is therefore better than the Law The Law does not cancel the promise but faith in the promised Christ cancels the Law The Apostle is careful to mention the exact number of four hundred and thirty years The wide divergence in the time between the promise and the Law helps to clinch Paul s argument that righteousness is not obtained by the Law Let me illustrate A man of great wealth adopts a strange lad for his son Remember he does not owe the lad anything In due time he appoints the lad heir to his entire fortune Several years later the old man asks the lad to do something for him And the young lad does it Can the lad then go around and say that he deserved the inheritance by his obedience to the old man s request How can anybody say that righteousness is obtained by obedience to the Law when the Law was given four hundred and thirty years after God s promise of the blessing One thing is certain Abraham was never justified by the Law for the simple reason that the Law was not in his day If the Law was non existent how could Abraham obtain righteousness by the Law Abraham had nothing else to go by but the promise This promise he believed and that was counted unto him for righteousness If the father obtained righteousness through faith the children get it the same way We use the argument of time also We say our sins were taken away by the death of Christ fifteen hundred years ago long before there were any religious orders canons or rules of penance merits et cetera What did people do about their sins before these new inventions were hatched up Paul finds his arguments for the righteousness of faith everywhere Even the element of time serves to build his case against the false apostles Let us fortify our conscience with similar arguments They help us in the trials of our faith They turn our attention from the Law to the promises from sin to righteousness from death to life It is not for nothing that Paul bears down on this argument He foresaw this confusion of the promise and the Law creeping into the Church Accustom yourself to separate Law and Gospel even in regard to time When the Law comes to pay your conscience a visit say Mister Law you come too soon The four hundred and thirty years aren t up yet When they are up you come again Won t you VERSE eighteen For if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise In Romans four fourteen the Apostle writes For if they which are made of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect It cannot be otherwise That the Law is something entirely different from the promise is plain The Law thunders Thou shalt thou shalt not The promise of the seed pleads Take this gift of God If the inheritance of the gifts of God were obtained by the Law God would be a liar We would have the right to ask Him Why did you make this promise in the first place In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed Why did you not say In thy works thou shalt be blessed VERSE eighteen But God gave it to Abraham by promise So much is certain before the Law ever existed God gave Abraham the inheritance or blessing by the promise In other words God granted unto Abraham remission of sins righteousness salvation and everlasting life And not only to Abraham but to all believers because God said In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed The blessing was given unconditionally The Law had no chance to butt in because Moses was not yet born How then can you say that righteousness is obtained by the Law The Apostle now goes to work to explain the province and purpose of the Law VERSE nineteen Wherefore then serveth the law The question naturally arises If the Law was not given for righteousness or salvation why was it given Why did God give the Law in the first place if it cannot justify a person The Jews believed if they kept the Law they would be saved When they heard that the Gospel proclaimed a Christ who had come into the world to save sinners and not the righteous when they heard that sinners were to enter the kingdom of heaven before the righteous the Jews were very much put out They murmured These last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day Matthew twenty twelve They complained that the heathen who at one time had been worshipers of idols obtained grace without the drudgery of the Law that was theirs Today we hear the same complaints What was the use of our having lived in a cloister twenty thirty forty years what was the sense of having vowed chastity poverty obedience what good are all the masses and canonical hours that we read what profit is there in fasting praying et cetera if any man or woman any beggar or scour woman is to be made equal to us or even be considered more acceptable unto God than we Reason takes offense at the statement of Paul The law was added because of transgressions People say that Paul abrogated the Law that he is a radical that he blasphemed God when he said that People say We might as well live like wild people if the Law does not count Let us abound in sin that grace may abound Let us do evil that good may come of it What are we to do Such scoffing distresses us but we cannot stop it Christ Himself was accused of being a blasphemer and rebel Paul and all the other apostles were told the same things Let the scoffers slander us let them spare us not But we must not on their account keep silent We must speak frankly in order that afflicted consciences may find surcease Neither are we to pay any attention to the foolish and ungodly people for abusing our doctrine They are the kind that would scoff Law or no Law Our first consideration must be the comfort of troubled consciences that they may not perish with the multitudes When he saw that some were offended at his doctrine while others found in it encouragement to live after the flesh Paul comforted himself with the thought that it was his duty to preach the Gospel to the elect of God and that for their sake he must endure all things Like Paul we also do all these things for the sake of God s elect As for the scoffers and skeptics I am so disgusted with them that in all my life I would not open my mouth for them once I wish that they were back there where they belong under the iron heel of the Pope People foolish but wise in their conceits jump to the conclusion If the Law does not justify it is good for nothing How about that Because money does not justify would you say that money is good for nothing Because the eyes do not justify would you have them taken out Because the Law does not justify it does not follow that the Law is without value We must find and define the proper purpose of the Law We do not offhand condemn the Law because we say it does not justify We say with Paul that the Law is good if it is used properly Within its proper sphere the Law is an excellent thing But if we ascribe to the Law functions for which it was never intended we pervert not only the Law but also the Gospel It is the universal impression that righteousness is obtained through the deeds of the Law This impression is instinctive and therefore doubly dangerous Gross sins and vices may be recognized or else repressed by the threat of punishment But this sin this opinion of man s own righteousness refuses to be classified as sin It wants to be esteemed as high class religion Hence it constitutes the mighty influence of the devil over the entire world In order to point out the true office of the Law and thus to stamp out that false impression of the righteousness of the Law Paul answers the question Wherefore then serveth the Law with the words VERSE nineteen It was added because of transgressions All things differ Let everything serve its unique purpose Let the sun shine by day the moon and the stars by night Let the sea furnish fish the earth grain the woods trees et cetera Let the Law also serve its unique purpose It must not step out of character and take the place of anything else What is the function of the Law Transgression answers the Apostle The Twofold Purpose of the Law The Law has a twofold purpose One purpose is civil God has ordained civil laws to punish crime Every law is given to restrain sin Does it not then make men righteous No In refraining from murder adultery theft or other sins I do so under compulsion because I fear the jail the noose the electric chair These restrain me as iron bars restrain a lion and a bear Otherwise they would tear everything to pieces Such forceful restraint cannot be regarded as righteousness rather as an indication of unrighteousness As a wild beast is tied to keep it from running amuck so the Law bridles mad and furious man to keep him from running wild The need for restraint shows plainly enough that those who need the Law are not righteous but wicked men who are fit to be tied No the Law does not justify The first purpose of the Law accordingly is to restrain the wicked The devil gets people into all kinds of scrapes Therefore God instituted governments parents laws restrictions and civil ordinances At least they help to tie the devil s hands so that he does not rage up and down the earth This civil restraint by the Law is intended by God for the preservation of all things particularly for the good of the Gospel that it should not be hindered too much by the tumult of the wicked But Paul is not now treating of this civil use and function of the Law The second purpose of the Law is spiritual and divine Paul describes this spiritual purpose of the Law in the words Because of transgressions i e to reveal to a person his sin blindness misery his ignorance hatred and contempt of God his death hell and condemnation This is the principal purpose of the Law and its most valuable contribution As long as a person is not a murderer adulterer thief he would swear that he is righteous How is God going to humble such a person except by the Law The Law is the hammer of death the thunder of hell and the lightning of God s wrath to bring down the proud and shameless hypocrites When the Law was instituted on Mount Sinai it was accompanied by lightning by storms by the sound of trumpets to tear to pieces that monster called self righteousness As long as a person thinks he is right he is going to be incomprehensibly proud and presumptuous He is going to hate God despise His grace and mercy and ignore the promises in Christ The Gospel of the free forgiveness of sins through Christ will never appeal to the self righteous This monster of self righteousness this stiff necked beast needs a big axe And that is what the Law is a big axe Accordingly the proper use and function of the Law is to threaten until the conscience is scared stiff The awful spectacle at Mount Sinai portrayed the proper use of the Law When the children of Israel came out of Egypt a feeling of singular holiness possessed them They boasted We are the people of God All that the Lord hath spoken we will do Ex nineteen eight This feeling of holiness was heightened when Moses ordered them to wash their clothes to refrain from their wives and to prepare themselves all around The third day came and Moses led the people out of their tents to the foot of the mountain into the presence of the Lord What happened When the children of Israel saw the whole mountain burning and smoking the black clouds rent by fierce lightning flashing up and down in the inky darkness when they heard the sound of the trumpet blowing louder and longer shattered by the roll of thunder they were so frightened that they begged Moses Speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die Ex twenty nineteen I ask you what good did their scrubbing their snow white clothes and their continence do them No good at all Not a single one could stand in the presence of the glorious Lord Stricken by the terror of God they fled back into their tents as if the devil were after them The Law is meant to produce the same effect today which it produced at Mount Sinai long ago I want to encourage all who fear God especially those who intend to become ministers of the Gospel to learn from the Apostle the proper use of the Law I fear that after our time the right handling of the Law will become a lost art Even now although we continually explain the separate functions of the Law and the Gospel we have those among us who do not understand how the Law should be used What will it be like when we are dead and gone We want it understood that we do not reject the Law as our opponents claim On the contrary we uphold the Law We say the Law is good if it is used for the purposes for which it was designed to check civil transgression and to magnify spiritual transgressions The Law is also a light like the Gospel But instead of revealing the grace of God righteousness and life the Law brings sin death and the wrath of God to light This is the business of the Law and here the business of the Law ends and should go no further The business of the Gospel on the other hand is to quicken to comfort to raise the fallen The Gospel carries the news that God for Christ s sake is merciful to the most unworthy sinners if they will only believe that Christ by His death has delivered them from sin and everlasting death unto grace forgiveness and everlasting life By keeping in mind the difference between the Law and the Gospel we let each perform its special task Of this difference between the Law and the Gospel nothing can be discovered in the writings of the monks or scholastics nor for that matter in the writings of the ancient fathers Augustine understood the difference somewhat Jerome and others knew nothing of it The silence in the Church concerning the difference between the Law and the Gospel has resulted in untold harm Unless a sharp distinction is maintained between the purpose and function of the Law and the Gospel the Christian doctrine cannot be kept free from error VERSE nineteen It was added because of transgressions In other words that transgressions might be recognized as such and thus increased When sin death and the wrath of God are revealed to a person by the Law he grows impatient complains against God and rebels Before that he was a very holy man he worshipped and praised God he bowed his knees before God and gave thanks like the Pharisee But now that sin and death are revealed to him by the Law he wishes there were no God The Law inspires hatred of God Thus sin is not only revealed by the Law sin is actually increased and magnified by the Law The Law is a mirror to show a person what he is like a sinner who is guilty of death and worthy of everlasting punishment What is this bruising and beating by the hand of the Law to accomplish This that we may find the way to grace The Law is an usher to lead the way to grace God is the God of the humble the miserable the afflicted It is His nature to exalt the humble to comfort the sorrowing to heal the broken hearted to justify the sinners and to save the condemned The fatuous idea that a person can be holy by himself denies God the pleasure of saving sinners God must therefore first take the sledge hammer of the Law in His fists and smash the beast of self righteousness and its brood of self confidence self wisdom self righteousness and self help When the conscience has been thoroughly frightened by the Law it welcomes the Gospel of grace with its message of a Savior who came into the world not to break the bruised reed nor to quench the smoking flax but to preach glad tidings to the poor to heal the broken hearted and to grant forgiveness of sins to all the captives Man s folly however is so prodigious that instead of embracing the message of grace with its guarantee of the forgiveness of sin for Christ s sake man finds himself more laws to satisfy his conscience If I live says he I will mend my life I will do this I will do that Man if you don t do the very opposite if you don t send Moses with the Law back to Mount Sinai and take the hand of Christ pierced for your sins you will never be saved When the Law drives you to the point of despair let it drive you a little farther let it drive you straight into the arms of Jesus who says Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest VERSE nineteen Till the seed should come to whom the promise was made The Law is not to have its say indefinitely We must know how long the Law is to put in its licks If it hammers away too long no person would and could be saved The Law has a boundary beyond which it must not go How long ought the Law to hold sway Till the seed should come to whom the promise was made That may be taken literally to mean until the time of the Gospel From the days of John the Baptist says Jesus until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John Matthew eleven twelve thirteen When Christ came the Law and the ceremonies of Moses ceased Spiritually it means that the Law is not to operate on a person after he has been humbled and frightened by the exposure of his sins and the wrath of God We must then say to the Law Mister Law lay off him He has had enough You scared him good and proper Now it is the Gospel s turn Now let Christ with His gracious lips talk to him of better things grace peace forgiveness of sins and eternal life VERSE nineteen And it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator The Apostle digresses a little from his immediate theme Something occurred to him and he throws it in by the way It occurred to him that the Law differs from the Gospel in another respect in respect to authorship The Law was delivered by the angels but the Gospel by the Lord Himself Hence the Gospel is superior to the Law as the word of a lord is superior to the word of his servant The Law was handed down by a being even inferior to the angels by a middleman named Moses Paul wants us to understand that Christ is the mediator of a better testament than mediator Moses of the Law Moses led the people out of their tents to meet God But they ran away That is how good a mediator Moses was Paul says How can the Law justify when that whole sanctified people of Israel and even mediator Moses trembled at the voice of God What kind of righteousness do you call that when people run away from it and hate it the worst way If the Law could justify people would love the Law But look at the children of Israel running away from it The flight of the children of Israel from Mount Sinai indicates how people feel about the Law They don t like it If this were the only argument to prove that salvation is not by the Law this one Bible history would do the work What kind of righteousness is this law righteousness when at the commencement exercises of the Law Moses and the scrubbed people run away from it so fast that an iron mountain the Red Sea even could not have stopped them until they were back in Egypt once again If they could not hear the Law how could they ever hope to perform the Law If all the world had stood at the mountain all the world would have hated the Law and fled from it as the children of Israel did The whole world is an enemy of the Law How then can anyone be justified by the Law when everybody hates the Law and its divine author All this goes to show how little the scholastics know about the Law They do not consider its spiritual effect and purpose which is not to justify or to pacify afflicted consciences but to increase sin to terrify the conscience and to produce wrath In their ignorance the papists spout about man s good will and right judgment and man s capacity to perform the Law of God Ask the people of Israel who were present at the presentation of the Law on Mount Sinai whether what the scholastics say is true Ask David who often complains in the Psalms that he was cast away from God and in hell that he was frantic about his sin and sick at the thought of the wrath and judgment of God No the Law does not justify VERSE twenty Now a mediator is not a mediator of one Here the Apostle briefly compares the two mediators Moses and Christ A mediator says Paul is not a mediator of one He is necessarily a mediator of two The offender and the offended Moses was such a mediator between the Law and the people who were offended at the Law They were offended at the Law because they did not understand its purpose That was the veil which Moses put over his face The people were also offended at the Law because they could not look at the bare face of Moses It shone with the glory of God When Moses addressed the people he had to cover his face with that veil of his They could not listen to their mediator Moses without another mediator the veil The Law had to change its face and voice In other words the Law had to be made tolerable to the people Thus covered the Law no longer spoke to the people in its undisguised majesty It became more tolerable to the conscience This explains why men fail to understand the Law properly with the result that they become secure and presumptuous hypocrites One of two things has to be done Either the Law must be covered with a veil and then it loses its full effectiveness or it must be unveiled and then the full blast of its force kills Man cannot stand the Law without a veil over it Hence we are forced either to look beyond the Law to Christ or we go through life as shameless hypocrites and secure sinners Paul says A mediator is not a mediator of one Moses could not be a mediator of God only for God needs no mediator Again Moses could not be a mediator of the people only He was a mediator between God and the people It is the office of a mediator to conciliate the party that is offended and to placate the party that is the offender However Moses mediation consisted only in changing the tone of the Law to make it more tolerable to the people Moses was merely a mediator of the veil He could not supply the ability to perform the Law What do you suppose would have happened if the Law had been given without a mediator and the people had been denied the services of a go between The people would have perished or in case they had escaped they would have required the services of another mediator to preserve them alive and to keep the Law in force Moses came along and he was made the mediator He covered his face with a veil But that is as much as he could do He could not deliver men s consciences from the terror of the Law The sinner needs a better mediator That better mediator is Jesus Christ He does not change the voice of the Law nor does He hide the Law with a veil He takes the full blast of the wrath of the Law and fulfills its demands most meticulously Of this better Mediator Paul says A mediator is not a mediator of one We are the offending party God is the party offended The offense is of such a nature that God cannot pardon it Neither can we render adequate satisfaction for our offenses There is discord between God and us Could not God revoke His Law No How about running away from God It cannot be done It took Christ to come between us and God and to reconcile God to us How did Christ do it Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross colonel two fourteen This one word mediator is proof enough that the Law cannot justify Otherwise we should not need a mediator In Christian theology the Law does not justify In fact it has the contrary effect The Law alarms us it magnifies our sins until we begin to hate the Law and its divine Author Would you call this being justified by the Law Can you imagine a more arrant outrage than to hate God and to abhor His Law What an excellent Law it is Listen I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods showing mercy unto thousands honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land Ex twenty two three six twelve Are these not excellent laws perfect wisdom Let not God speak with us lest we die cried the children of Israel Is it not amazing that a person should refuse to hear things that are good for him Any person would be glad to hear I should think that he has a gracious God who shows mercy unto thousands Is it not amazing that people hate the Law that promotes their safety and welfare e g Thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal The Law can do nothing for us except to arouse the conscience Before the Law comes to me I feel no sin But when the Law comes sin death and hell are revealed to me You would not call this being made righteous You would call it being condemned to death and hell fire VERSE twenty But God is one God does not offend anybody therefore He needs no mediator But we offend God therefore we need a mediator And we need a better mediator than Moses We need Christ VERSE twenty one Is the law then against the promises of God Before he digressed Paul stated that the Law does not justify Shall we then discard the Law No no It supplies a certain need It supplies men with a needed realization of their sinfulness Now arises another question If the Law does no more than to reveal sin does it not oppose the promises of God The Jews believed that by the restraint and discipline of the Law the promises of God would be hastened in fact earned by them Paul answers Not so On the contrary if we pay too much attention to the Law the promises of God will be slowed up How can God fulfill His promises to a people that hates the Law VERSE twenty one God forbid God never said to Abraham In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast kept the Law When Abraham was still uncircumcised and without the Law or any law indeed when he was still an idol worshiper God said to him Get thee out of thy country et cetera I am thy shield et cetera In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed These are unconditional promises which God freely made to Abraham without respect to works This is aimed especially at the Jews who think that the promises of God are impeded by their sins Paul says The Lord is not slack concerning His promises because of our sins or hastens His promises because of any merit on our part God s promises are not influenced by our attitudes They rest in His goodness and mercy Just because the Law increases sin it does not therefore obstruct the promises of God The Law confirms the promises in that it prepares a person to look for the fulfillment of the promises of God in Christ The proverb has it that Hunger is the best cook The Law makes afflicted consciences hungry for Christ Christ tastes good to them Hungry hearts appreciate Christ Thirsty souls are what Christ wants He invites them Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest Christ s benefits are so precious that He will dispense them only to those who need them and really desire them VERSE twenty one For if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law The Law cannot give life It kills The Law does not justify a person before God it increases sin The Law does not secure righteousness it hinders righteousness The Apostle declares emphatically that the Law of itself cannot save Despite the intelligibility of Paul s statement our enemies fail to grasp it Otherwise they would not emphasize free will natural strength the works of supererogation et cetera To escape the charge of forgery they always have their convenient annotation handy that Paul is referring only to the ceremonial and not to the moral law But Paul includes all laws He expressly says If there had been a law given There is no law by which righteousness may be obtained not a single one Why not VERSE twenty two But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin Where First in the promises concerning Christ in Genesis three fifteen and in Genesis twenty two eighteen which speak of the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham The fact that these promises were made unto the fathers concerning Christ implies that the fathers were subject to the curse of sin and eternal death Otherwise why the need of promises Next Holy Writ concludes all under sin in this passage from Paul For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse Again in the passage which the Apostle quotes from Deuteronomy twenty seven twenty six Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them This passage clearly submits all men to the curse not only those who sin openly against the Law but also those who sincerely endeavor to perform the Law inclusive of monks friars hermits et cetera The conclusion is inevitable Faith alone justified without works If the Law itself cannot justify much less can imperfect performance of the Law or the works of the Law justify VERSE twenty two That the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe The Apostle stated before that the Scripture hath concluded all under sin Forever No only until the promise should be fulfilled The promise you will recall is the inheritance itself or the blessing promised to Abraham deliverance from the Law sin death and the devil and the free gift of grace righteousness salvation and eternal life This promise says Paul is not obtained by any merit by any law or by any work This promise is given To whom To those who believe In whom In Jesus Christ VERSE twenty three But before faith came The Apostle proceeds to explain the service which the Law is to render Previously Paul had said that the Law was given to reveal the wrath and death of God upon all sinners Although the Law kills God brings good out of evil He uses the Law to bring life God saw that the universal illusion of self righteousness could not be put down in any other way but by the Law The Law dispels all self illusions It puts the fear of God in a man Without this fear there can be no thirst for God s mercy God accordingly uses the Law for a hammer to break up the illusion of self righteousness that we should despair of our own strength and efforts at self justification VERSE twenty three But before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed The Law is a prison to those who have not as yet obtained grace No prisoner enjoys the confinement He hates it If he could he would smash the prison and find his freedom at all cost As long as he stays in prison he refrains from evil deeds Not because he wants to but because he has to The bars and the chains restrain him He does not regret the crime that put him in jail On the contrary he is mighty sore that he cannot rob and kill as before If he could escape he would go right back to robbing and killing The Law enforces good behavior at least outwardly We obey the Law because if we don t we will be punished Our obedience is inspired by fear We obey under duress and we do it resentfully Now what kind of righteousness is this when we refrain from evil out of fear of punishment Hence the righteousness of the Law is at bottom nothing but love of sin and hatred of righteousness All the same the Law accomplishes this much that it will outwardly at least and to a certain extent repress vice and crime But the Law is also a spiritual prison a veritable hell When the Law begins to threaten a person with death and the eternal wrath of God a man just cannot find any comfort at all He cannot shake off at will the nightmare of terror which the Law stirs up in his conscience Of this terror of the Law the Psalms furnish many glimpses The Law is a civil and a spiritual prison And such it should be For that the Law is intended Only the confinement in the prison of the Law must not be unduly prolonged It must come to an end The freedom of faith must succeed the imprisonment of the Law Happy the person who knows how to utilize the Law so that it serves the purposes of grace and of faith Unbelievers are ignorant of this happy knowledge When Cain was first shut up in the prison of the Law he felt no pang at the fratricide he had committed He thought he could pass it off as an incident with a shrug of the shoulder Am I my brother s keeper he answered God flippantly But when he heard the ominous words What hast thou done the voice of thy brother s blood crieth unto me from the ground Cain began to feel his imprisonment Did he know how to get out of prison No He failed to call the Gospel to his aid He said My punishment is greater than I can bear He could only think of the prison He forgot that he was brought face to face with his crime so that he should hurry to God for mercy and for pardon Cain remained in the prison of the Law and despaired As a stone prison proves a physical handicap so the spiritual prison of the Law proves a chamber of torture But this it should only be until faith be revealed The silly conscience must be educated to this Talk to your conscience Say Sister you are now in jail all right But you don t have to stay there forever It is written that we are shut up unto faith which should afterwards be revealed Christ will lead you to freedom Do not despair like Cain Saul or Judas They might have gone free if they had called Christ to their aid Just take it easy Sister Conscience It s good for you to be locked up for a while It will teach you to appreciate Christ How anybody can say that he by nature loves the Law is beyond me The Law is a prison to be feared and hated Any unconverted person who says he loves the Law is a liar He does not know what he is talking about We love the Law about as well as a murderer loves his gloomy cell his straight jacket and the iron bars in front of him How then can the Law justify us VERSE twenty three Shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed We know that Paul has reference to the time of Christ s coming It was then that faith and the object of faith were fully revealed But we may apply the historical fact to our inner life When Christ came He abolished the Law and brought liberty and life to light This He continues to do in the hearts of the believers The Christian has a body in whose members as Paul says sin dwells and wars I take sin to mean not only the deed but root tree fruit and all A Christian may perhaps not fall into the gross sins of murder adultery theft but he is not free from impatience complaints hatreds and blasphemy of God As carnal lust is strong in a young man in a man of full age the desire for glory and in an old man covetousness so impatience doubt and hatred of God often prevail in the hearts of sincere Christians Examples of these sins may be garnered from the Psalms Job Jeremiah and all the Sacred Scriptures Accordingly each Christian continues to experience in his heart times of the Law and times of the Gospel The times of the Law are discernible by heaviness of heart by a lively sense of sin and a feeling of despair brought on by the Law These periods of the Law will come again and again as long as we live To mention my own case There are many times when I find fault with God and am impatient with Him The wrath and the judgment of God displease me my wrath and impatience displease Him Then is the season of the Law when the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh The time of grace returns when the heart is enlivened by the promise of God s mercy It soliloquizes Why art thou cast down O my soul and why art thou disquieted within me Can you see nothing but law sin death and hell Is there no grace no forgiveness no joy peace life heaven no Christ and God Trouble me no more my soul Hope in God who has not spared His own dear Son but has given Him into death for thy sins When the Law carries things too far say Mister Law you are not the whole show There are other and better things than you They tell me to trust in the Lord There is a time for the Law and a time for grace Let us study to be good timekeepers It is not easy Law and grace may be miles apart in essence but in the heart they are pretty close together In the heart fear and trust sin and grace Law and Gospel cross paths continually Whether reason hears that justification before God is obtained by grace alone it draws the inference that the Law is without value The doctrine of the Law must therefore be studied carefully lest we either reject the Law altogether or are tempted to attribute to the Law a capacity to save There are three ways in which the Law may be abused First by the self righteous hypocrites who fancy that they can be justified by the Law Secondly by those who claim that Christian liberty exempts a Christian from the observance of the Law These says Peter use their liberty for a cloak of maliciousness and bring the name and the Gospel of Christ into ill repute Thirdly the Law is abused by those who do not understand that the Law is meant to drive us to Christ When the Law is properly used its value cannot be too highly appraised It will take me to Christ every time VERSE twenty four Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ This simile of the schoolmaster is striking Schoolmasters are indispensable But show me a pupil who loves his schoolmaster How little love is lost upon them the Jews showed by their attitude toward Moses They would have been glad to stone Moses to death Ex seventeen four You cannot expect anything else How can a pupil love a teacher who frustrates his desires And if the pupil disobeys the schoolmaster whips him and the pupil has to like it and even kiss the rod with which he was beaten Do you think the schoolboy feels good about it As soon as the teacher turns his back the pupil breaks the rod and throws it into the fire And if he were stronger than the teacher he would not take the beatings but beat up the teacher All the same teachers are indispensable otherwise the children would grow up without discipline instruction and training But how long are the scolding and the whippings of the schoolmaster to continue Only for a time until the boy has been trained to be a worthy heir of his father No father wants his son to be whipped all the time The discipline is to last until the boy has been trained to be his father s worthy successor The Law is such a schoolmaster Not for always but until we have been brought to Christ The Law is not just another schoolmaster The Law is a specialist to bring us to Christ What would you think of a schoolmaster who could only torment and beat a child Yet of such schoolmasters there were plenty in former times regular bruisers The Law is not that kind of a schoolmaster It is not to torment us always With its lashings it is only too anxious to drive us to Christ The Law is like the good schoolmaster who trains his children to find pleasure in doing things they formerly detested VERSE twenty four That we might be justified by faith The Law is not to teach us another Law When a person feels the full force of the Law he is likely to think I have transgressed all the commandments of God I am guilty of eternal death If God will spare me I will change and live right from now on This natural but entirely wrong reaction to the Law has bred the many ceremonies and works devised to earn grace and remission of sins The Law means to enlarge my sins to make me small so that I may be justified by faith in Christ Faith is neither law nor word but confidence in Christ who is the end of the law How so is Christ the end of the Law Not in this way that He replaced the old Law with new laws Nor is Christ the end of the Law in a way that makes Him a hard judge who has to be bribed by works as the papists teach Christ is the end or finish of the Law to all who believe in Him The Law can no longer accuse or condemn them But what does the Law accomplish for those who have been justified by Christ Paul answers this question next VERSE twenty five But after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster The Apostle declares that we are free from the Law Christ fulfilled the Law for us We may live in joy and safety under Christ The trouble is our flesh will not let us believe in Christ with all our heart The fault lies not with Christ but with us Sin clings to us as long as we live and spoils our happiness in Christ Hence we are only partly free from the Law With the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin Romans seven twenty five As far as the conscience is concerned it may cheerfully ignore the Law But because sin continues to dwell in the flesh the Law waits around to molest our conscience More and more however Christ increases our faith and in the measure in which our faith is increased sin Law and flesh subside If anybody objects to the Gospel and the sacraments on the ground that Christ has taken away our sins once and for always you will know what to answer You will answer Indeed Christ has taken away my sins But my flesh the world and the devil interfere with my faith The little light of faith in my heart does not shine all over me at once It is a gradual diffusion In the meanwhile I console myself with the thought that eventually my flesh will be made perfect in the resurrection VERSE twenty six For we are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus Paul as a true apostle of faith always has the word faith on the tip of his tongue By faith says he we are the children of God The Law cannot beget children of God It cannot regenerate us It can only remind us of the old birth by which we were born into the kingdom of the devil The best the Law can do for us is to prepare us for a new birth through faith in Christ Jesus Faith in Christ regenerates us into the children of God saint John bears witness to this in his Gospel As many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name John one twelve What tongue of man or angel can adequately extol the mercy of God toward us miserable sinners in that He adopted us for His own children and fellow heirs with His Son by the simple means of faith in Christ Jesus VERSE twenty seven For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ To put on Christ may be understood in two ways according to the Law and according to the Gospel According to the Law as in Romans thirteen fourteen Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ which means to follow the example of Christ To put on Christ according to the Gospel means to clothe oneself with the righteousness wisdom power life and Spirit of Christ By nature we are clad in the garb of Adam This garb Paul likes to call the old man Before we can become the children of God this old man must be put off as Paul says Ephesians four twenty nine The garment of Adam must come off like soiled clothes Of course it is not as simple as changing one s clothes But God makes it simple He clothes us with the righteousness of Christ by means of Baptism as the Apostle says in this verse As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ With this change of garments a new birth a new life stirs in us New affections toward God spring up in the heart New determinations affect our will All this is to put on Christ according to the Gospel Needless to say when we have put on the robe of the righteousness of Christ we must not forget to put on also the mantle of the imitation of Christ VERSE twenty eight There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus The list might be extended indefinitely There is neither preacher nor hearer neither teacher nor scholar neither master nor servant et cetera In the matter of salvation rank learning righteousness influence count for nothing With this statement Paul deals a death blow to the Law When a person has put on Christ nothing else matters Whether a person is a Jew a punctilious and circumcised observer of the Law of Moses or whether a person is a noble and wise Greek does not matter Circumstances personal worth character achievements have no bearing upon justification Before God they count for nothing What counts is that we put on Christ Whether a servant performs his duties well whether those who are in authority govern wisely whether a man marries provides for his family and is an honest citizen whether a woman is chaste obedient to her husband and a good mother all these advantages do not qualify a person for salvation These virtues are commendable of course but they do not count points for justification All the best laws ceremonies religions and deeds of the world cannot take away sin guilt cannot dispatch death cannot purchase life There is much disparity among men in the world but there is no such disparity before God For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Romans three twenty three Let the Jews let the Greeks let the whole world keep silent in the presence of God Those who are justified are justified by Christ Without faith in Christ the Jew with his laws the monk with his holy orders the Greek with his wisdom the servant with his obedience shall perish forever VERSE twenty eight For ye are all one in Christ Jesus There is much imparity among men in the world And it is a good thing If the woman would change places with the man if the son would change places with the father the servant with the master nothing but confusion would result In Christ however all are equal We all have one and the same Gospel one faith one baptism one God and Father of all one Christ and Savior of all The Christ of Peter Paul and all the saints is our Christ Paul can always be depended on to add the conditional clause In Christ Jesus If we lose sight of Christ we lose out VERSE twenty nine And if ye be Christ s then are ye Abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise If ye be Christ s means if you believe in Christ If you believe in Christ then are you the children of Abraham indeed Through our faith in Christ Abraham gains paternity over us and over the nations of the earth according to the promise In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed Through faith we belong to Christ and Christ to us CHAPTER four VERSE one Now I say That the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all VERSE two But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed 
4443-3992-0000	train-other-500	of the father THE Apostle had apparently finished his discourse on justification when this illustration of the youthful heir occurred to him He throws it in for good measure He knows that plain people are sooner impressed
4443-3992-0001	train-other-500	by an apt illustration than by learned discussion I want to give you another illustration from everyday life he writes to the Galatians As long as an heir is under age he is treated very much like a servant
4443-3992-0002	train-other-500	He is not permitted to order his own affairs He is kept under constant surveillance Such discipline is good for him otherwise he would waste his inheritance in no time This discipline however is not to last forever
4443-3992-0003	train-other-500	It is to last only until the time appointed of the father VERSE three Even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world As children of the Law
4443-3992-0004	train-other-500	we were treated like servants and prisoners We were oppressed and condemned by the Law But the tyranny of the Law is not to last forever It is to last only until the time appointed of the father until Christ came and redeemed us
4443-3992-0005	train-other-500	VERSE three Under the elements of the world By the elements of the world the Apostle does not understand the physical elements as some have thought In calling the Law the elements of the world
4443-3992-0006	train-other-500	Paul means to say that the Law is something material mundane earthly It may restrain evil but it does not deliver from sin The Law does not justify it does not bring a person to heaven
4443-3992-0007	train-other-500	I do not obtain eternal life because I do not kill commit adultery steal et cetera Such mere outward decency does not constitute Christianity
4443-3992-0008	train-other-500	The heathen observe the same restraints to avoid punishment or to secure the advantages of a good reputation In the last analysis such restraint is simple hypocrisy When the Law exercises its higher function
4443-3992-0009	train-other-500	it accuses and condemns the conscience All these effects of the Law cannot be called divine or heavenly These effects are elements of the world In calling the Law the elements of the world Paul refers to the whole Law
4443-3992-0010	train-other-500	principally to the ceremonial law which dealt with external matters as meat drink dress places times feasts cleansings sacrifices et cetera
4443-3992-0011	train-other-500	These are mundane matters which cannot save the sinner Ceremonial laws are like the statutes of governments dealing with purely civil matters as commerce inheritance et cetera As for the pope s church laws forbidding marriage and meats
none	none	 Paul calls them elsewhere the doctrines of devils 
4443-3992-0012	train-other-500	You would not call such laws elements of heaven
none	none	 The Law of Moses deals with mundane matters 
4443-3992-0013	train-other-500	It holds the mirror to the evil which is in the world By revealing the evil that is in us it creates a longing in the heart for the better things of God The Law forces us into the arms of Christ
4443-3992-0014	train-other-500	who is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth Romans one four Christ relieves the conscience of the Law In so far as the Law impels us to Christ it renders excellent service
none	none	 I do not mean to give the impression that the Law should be despised Neither does Paul intend to leave that impression The Law ought to be honored But when it is a matter of justification before God Paul had to speak disparagingly of the Law 
4443-3992-0015	train-other-500	because the Law has nothing to do with justification If it thrusts its nose into the business of justification we must talk harshly to the Law to keep it in its place The conscience ought not to be on speaking terms with the Law
4443-3992-0016	train-other-500	The conscience ought to know only Christ To say this is easy but in times of trial
none	none	 when the conscience writhes in the presence of God it is not so easy to do 
4443-3992-0017	train-other-500	As such times we are to believe in Christ as if there were no Law or sin anywhere but only Christ We ought to say to the Law Mister Law I do not get you You stutter so much
4443-3992-0018	train-other-500	I don t think that you have anything to say to me When it is not a question of salvation or justification with us we are to think highly of the Law and call it holy just and good Romans seven twelve
none	none	 The Law is of no comfort to a stricken conscience Therefore it should not be allowed to rule in our conscience particularly in view of the fact that Christ paid so great a price to deliver the conscience from the tyranny of the Law 
4443-3992-0019	train-other-500	Let us understand that the Law and Christ are impossible bedfellows The Law must leave the bed of the conscience which is so narrow that it cannot hold two as Isaiah says chapter twenty eight verse twenty Only Paul among the apostles
4443-3992-0020	train-other-500	calls the Law the elements of the world weak and beggarly elements the strength of sin the letter that killeth et cetera The other apostles do not speak so slightingly of the Law Those who want to be first class scholars in the school of Christ
4443-3992-0021	train-other-500	want to pick up the language of Paul Christ called him a chosen vessel and equipped with a facility of expression far above that of the other apostles that he as the chosen vessel should establish the doctrine of justification in clear cut words

4443-3992-0022	train-other-500	But when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law
4443-3992-0023	train-other-500	The fullness of the time means when the time of the Law was fulfilled and Christ was revealed Note how Paul explains Christ Christ says he is the Son of God and the son of a woman
4443-3992-0024	train-other-500	He submitted Himself under the Law to redeem us who were under the Law In these words the Apostle explains the person and office of Christ His person is divine and human God sent forth His Son made of a woman
4443-3992-0025	train-other-500	Christ therefore is true God and true man Christ s office the Apostle describes in the words Made under the law to redeem them that were under the law Paul calls the Virgin Mary a woman
4443-3992-0026	train-other-500	This has been frequently deplored even by some of the ancient fathers who felt that Paul should have written virgin instead of woman But Paul is now treating of faith and Christian righteousness of the person and office of Christ
4443-3992-0027	train-other-500	not of the virginity of Mary The inestimable mercy of God is sufficiently set forth by the fact that His Son was born of a woman The more general term woman indicates that Christ was born a true man
4443-3992-0028	train-other-500	Paul does not say that Christ was born of man and woman but only of woman That he has a virgin in mind is obvious This passage furthermore declares that Christ s purpose in coming was the abolition of the Law
4443-3992-0029	train-other-500	not with the intention of laying down new laws but to redeem them that were under the law Christ himself declared I judge no man John eight fifteen Again I came not to judge the world
4443-3992-0030	train-other-500	but to save the world John twelve forty seven In other words I came not to bring more laws or to judge men according to the existing Law I have a higher and better office I came to judge and to condemn the Law
4443-3992-0031	train-other-500	so that it may no more judge and condemn the world How did Christ manage to redeem us He was made under the law When Christ came He found us all in prison What did He do about it Although He was the Lord of the Law
4443-3992-0032	train-other-500	He voluntarily placed Himself under the Law and permitted it to exercise dominion over Him indeed to accuse and to condemn Him When the Law takes us into judgment it has a perfect right to do so For we are by nature the children of wrath

none	none	 I Pet two 
4443-3992-0034	train-other-500	twenty two Hence the Law had no jurisdiction over Him Yet the Law treated this innocent just and blessed Lamb of God as cruelly as it treated us It accused Him of blasphemy and treason
4443-3992-0035	train-other-500	It made Him guilty of the sins of the whole world It overwhelmed him with such anguish of soul that His sweat was as blood The Law condemned Him to the shameful death on the Cross
4443-3992-0036	train-other-500	It is truly amazing that the Law had the effrontery to turn upon its divine Author and that without a show of right For its insolence the Law in turn was arraigned before the judgment seat of God and condemned
4443-3992-0037	train-other-500	Christ might have overcome the Law by an exercise of His omnipotent authority over the Law Instead He humbled Himself under the Law for and together with them that were under the Law He gave the Law license to accuse and condemn Him
4443-3992-0038	train-other-500	His present mastery over the Law was obtained by virtue of His Sonship and His substitutionary victory Thus Christ banished the Law from the conscience It dare no longer banish us from God For that matter
4443-3992-0039	train-other-500	the Law continues to reveal sin It still raises its voice in condemnation But the conscience finds quick relief in the words of the Apostle Christ has redeemed us from the law The conscience

4443-3992-0041	train-other-500	Christ was made under the law are worth all the attention we can bestow on them They declare that the Son of God did not only fulfill one or two easy requirements of the Law but that He endured all the tortures of the Law
4443-3992-0042	train-other-500	The Law brought all its fright to bear upon Christ until He experienced anguish and terror such as nobody else ever experienced His bloody sweat His need of angelic comfort His tremulous prayer in the garden

none	none	 The Roman conception of Christ as a mere lawgiver more stringent than Moses is quite contrary to Paul s teaching Christ according to Paul was not an agent of the Law but a patient of the Law He was not a law giver 
4443-3992-0044	train-other-500	but a law taker True enough Christ also taught and expounded the Law But it was incidental It was a sideline with Him He did not come into the world for the purpose of teaching the Law
4443-3992-0045	train-other-500	as little as it was the purpose of His coming to perform miracles Teaching the Law and performing miracles did not constitute His unique mission to the world The prophets also taught the Law and performed miracles In fact
4443-3992-0046	train-other-500	according to the promise of Christ the apostles performed greater miracles than Christ Himself John fourteen twelve The true purpose of Christ s coming was the abolition of the Law of sin and of death
4443-3992-0047	train-other-500	If we think of Christ as Paul here depicts Him we shall never go wrong We shall never be in danger of misconstruing the meaning of the Law We shall understand that the Law does not justify We shall understand why a Christian observes laws

4443-3992-0055	train-other-500	the Holy Ghost is sent forth into the hearts of the believers as here stated God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts This sending is accomplished by the preaching of the Gospel through which the Holy Spirit inspires us with fervor and light
4443-3992-0056	train-other-500	with new judgment new desires and new motives This happy innovation is not a derivative of reason or personal development but solely the gift and operation of the Holy Ghost This renewal by the Holy Spirit may not be conspicuous to the world

4443-3992-0059	train-other-500	Outwardly there is no great difference between a Christian and any honest man The activities of a Christian are not sensational He performs his duty according to his vocation He takes good care of his family and is kind and helpful to others

none	none	 thank God for the Holy Spirit who infuses this love into the hearts of men We never come by this love naturally neither can it be enforced by laws It is the gift of the Holy Spirit The Roman theologians teach that no man can know for a certainty whether he stands in the favor of God or not This teaching forms one of the chief articles of their faith With this teaching they tormented men s consciences 
4443-3992-0062	train-other-500	excommunicated Christ from the Church and limited the operations of the Holy Ghost saint Augustine observed that every man is certain of his faith if he has faith This the Romanists deny God forbid they exclaim piously
4443-3992-0063	train-other-500	that I should ever be so arrogant as to think that I stand in grace that I am holy or that I have the Holy Ghost We ought to feel sure that we stand in the grace of God not in view of our own worthiness
4443-3992-0064	train-other-500	but through the good services of Christ As certain as we are that Christ pleases God so sure ought we to be that we also please God because Christ is in us And although we daily offend God by our sins
4443-3992-0065	train-other-500	yet as often as we sin God s mercy bends over us Therefore sin cannot get us to doubt the grace of God Our certainty is of Christ that mighty Hero who overcame the Law sin death and all evils
4443-3992-0066	train-other-500	So long as He sits at the right hand of God to intercede for us we have nothing to fear from the anger of God This inner assurance of the grace of God is accompanied by outward indications such as gladly to hear

none	none	 I would like nothing better than that Christ s Gospel be known throughout the world and that many many be brought to faith in Him VERSE six Crying Abba Father Paul might have written God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts calling Abba Father Instead he wrote Crying Abba Father In the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans the Apostle describes this crying of the Spirit as groanings which cannot be uttered He writes in the twenty sixth verse Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered The fact that the Spirit of Christ in our hearts cries unto God and makes intercession for us with groanings should reassure us greatly However there are many factors that prevent such full reassurance on our part We are born in sin To doubt the good will of God is an inborn suspicion of God with all of us Besides the devil our adversary goeth about seeking to devour us by roaring God is angry at you and is going to destroy you forever In all these difficulties we have only one support the Gospel of Christ To hold on to it that is the trick Christ cannot be perceived with the senses We cannot see Him The heart does not feel His helpful presence Especially in times of trials a Christian feels the power of sin the infirmity of his flesh the goading darts of the devil the agues of death the scowl and judgment of God All these things cry out against us The Law scolds us sin screams at us death thunders at us the devil roars at us In the midst of the clamor the Spirit of Christ cries in our hearts Abba Father And this little cry of the Spirit transcends the hullabaloo of the Law sin death and the devil and finds a hearing with God The Spirit cries in us because of our weakness Because of our infirmity the Holy Ghost is sent forth into our hearts to pray for us according to the will of God and to assure us of the grace of God Let the Law sin and the devil cry out against us until their outcry fills heaven and earth The Spirit of God outcries them all Our feeble groans Abba Father will be heard of God sooner than the combined racket of hell sin and the Law We do not think of our groanings as a crying It is so faint we do not know we are groaning But he says Paul that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit Romans eight twenty seven To this Searcher of hearts our feeble groaning as it seems to us is a loud shout for help in comparison with which the howls of hell the din of the devil the yells of the Law the shouts of sin are like so many whispers In the fourteenth chapter of Exodus the Lord addresses Moses at the Red Sea Wherefore criest thou unto me Moses had not cried unto the Lord He trembled so he could hardly talk His faith was at low ebb He saw the people of Israel wedged between the Sea and the approaching armies of Pharaoh How were they to escape Moses did not know what to say How then could God say that Moses was crying to Him God heard the groaning heart of Moses and the groans to Him sounded like loud shouts for help God is quick to catch the sigh of the heart Some have claimed that the saints are without infirmities But Paul says The Spirit helpeth our infirmities and maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered We need the help of the Holy Spirit because we are weak and infirm And the Holy Spirit never disappoints us Confronted by the armies of Pharaoh retreat cut off by the waters of the Red Sea Moses was in a bad spot He felt himself to blame The devil accused him These people will all perish for they cannot escape And you are to blame because you led the people out of Egypt You started all this And then the people started in on Moses Because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness Ex fourteen eleven twelve But the Holy Ghost was in Moses and made intercession for him with unutterable groanings sighings unto the Lord O Lord at Thy commandment have I led forth this people So help me now The Spirit intercedes for us not in many words or long prayers but with groanings with little sounds like Abba Small as this word is it says ever so much It says My Father I am in great trouble and you seem so far away But I know I am your child because you are my Father for Christ s sake I am loved by you because of the Beloved This one little word Abba surpasses the eloquence of a Demosthenes and a Cicero I have spent much time on this verse in order to combat the cruel teaching of the Roman church that a person ought to be kept in a state of uncertainty concerning his status with God The monasteries recruit the youth on the plea that their holy orders will assuredly recruit them for heaven But once inside the monastery the recruits are told to doubt the promises of God In support of their error the papists quote the saying of Solomon The righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them Eccles nine one They take this hatred to mean the wrath of God to come Others take it to mean God s present anger None of them seem to understand this passage from Solomon On every page the Scriptures urge us to believe that God is merciful loving and patient that He is faithful and true and that He keeps His promises All the promises of God were fulfilled in the gift of His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life The Gospel is reassurance for sinners Yet this one saying from Solomon misinterpreted at that is made to count for more than all the many promises of all the Scriptures If our opponents are so uncertain about their status with God and even go so far as to say that the conscience ought to be kept in a state of doubt why is it that they persecute us as vile heretics When it comes to persecuting us they do not seem to be in doubt and uncertainty one minute Let us not fail to thank God for delivering us from the doctrine of doubt The Gospel commands us to look away from our own good works to the promises of God in Christ the Mediator The pope commands us to look away from the promises of God in Christ to our own merit No wonder they are the eternal prey of doubt and despair We depend upon God for salvation No wonder that our doctrine is certified because it does not rest in our own strength our own conscience our own feelings our own person our own works It is built on a better foundation It is built on the promises and truth of God Besides the passage from Solomon does not treat of the hatred and love of God towards men It merely rebukes the ingratitude of men The more deserving a person is the less he is appreciated Often those who should be his best friends are his worst enemies Those who least deserve the praise of the world get most David was a holy man and a good king Nevertheless he was chased from his own country The prophets Christ the apostles were slain Solomon in this passage does not speak of the love and hatred of God but of love and hatred among men As though Solomon wanted to say There are many good and wise men whom God uses for the advancement of mankind Seldom if ever are their efforts crowned with gratitude They are usually repaid with hatred and ingratitude We are being treated that way We thought we would find favor with men for bringing them the Gospel of peace life and eternal salvation Instead of favor we found fury At first yes many were delighted with our doctrine and received it gladly We counted them as our friends and brethren and were happy to think that they would help us in sowing the seed of the Gospel But they revealed themselves as false brethren and deadly enemies of the Gospel If you experience the ingratitude of men don t let it get you down Say with Christ They hated me without cause And For my love they are my adversaries but I give myself unto prayer Ps one hundred nine four Let us never doubt the mercy of God in Christ Jesus but make up our minds that God is pleased with us that He looks after us and that we have the Holy Spirit who prays for us VERSE seven Wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son This sentence clinches Paul s argument He says With the Holy Spirit in our hearts crying Abba Father there can be no doubt that God has adopted us for His children and that our subjection to the Law has come to an end We are now the free children of God We may now say to the Law Mister Law you have lost your throne to Christ I am free now and a son of God You cannot curse me any more Do not permit the Law to lie in your conscience Your conscience belongs to Christ Let Christ be in it and not the Law As the children of God we are the heirs of His eternal heaven What a wonderful gift heaven is man s heart cannot conceive much less describe Until we enter upon our heavenly inheritance we are only to have our little faith to go by To man s reason our faith looks rather forlorn But because our faith rests on the promises of the infinite God His promises are also infinite so much so that nothing can accuse or condemn us VERSE seven And if a son then an heir of God through Christ A son is an heir not by virtue of high accomplishments but by virtue of his birth He is a mere recipient His birth makes him an heir not his labors In exactly the same way we obtain the eternal gifts of righteousness resurrection and everlasting life We obtain them not as agents but as beneficiaries We are the children and heirs of God through faith in Christ We have Christ to thank for everything We are not the heirs of some rich and mighty man but heirs of God the almighty Creator of all things If a person could fully appreciate what it means to be a son and heir of God he would rate the might and wealth of nations small change in comparison with his heavenly inheritance What is the world to him who has heaven No wonder Paul greatly desired to depart and to be with Christ Nothing would be more welcome to us than early death knowing that it would spell the end of all our miseries and the beginning of all our happiness Yes if a person could perfectly believe this he would not long remain alive The anticipation of his joy would kill him But the law of the members strives against the law of the mind and makes perfect joy and faith impossible We need the continued help and comfort of the Holy Spirit We need His prayers Paul himself cried out O wretched man that I am Who shall deliver me from the body of this death The body of this death spoiled the joy of his spirit He did not always entertain the sweet and glad expectation of his heavenly inheritance He often felt miserable This goes to show how hard it is to believe Faith is feeble because the flesh wars against the spirit If we could have perfect faith our loathing for this life in the world would be complete We would not be so careful about this life We would not be so attached to the world and the things of the world We would not feel so good when we have them we would not feel so bad when we lose them We would be far more humble and patient and kind But our faith is weak because our spirit is weak In this life we can have only the first fruits of the Spirit as Paul says VERSE seven Through Christ The Apostle always has Christ on the tip of his tongue He foresaw that nothing would be less known in the world some day than the Gospel of Christ Therefore he talks of Christ continually As often as he speaks of righteousness grace the promise the adoption and the inheritance of heaven he adds the words In Christ or Through Christ to show that these blessings are not to be had by the Law or the deeds of the Law much less by our own exertions or by the observance of human traditions but only by and through and in Christ VERSES eight and nine Howbeit then when ye knew not God ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods But now after that ye have known God or rather are known of God how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage This concludes Paul s discourse on justification From now to the end of the Epistle the Apostle writes mostly of Christian conduct But before he follows up his doctrinal discourse with practical precepts he once more reproves the Galatians He is deeply displeased with them for relinquishing their divine doctrine He tells them You have taken on teachers who intend to recommit you to the Law By my doctrine I called you out of the darkness of ignorance into the wonderful light of the knowledge of God I led you out of bondage into the freedom of the sons of God not by the prescription of laws but by the gift of heavenly and eternal blessings through Christ Jesus How could you so soon forsake the light and return to darkness How could you so quickly stray from grace into the Law from freedom into bondage The example of the Galatians of Anabaptists and other sectarians in our day bears testimony to the ease with which faith may be lost We take great pains in setting forth the doctrine of faith by preaching and by writing We are careful to apply the Gospel and the Law in their proper turn Yet we make little headway because the devil seduces people into misbelief by taking Christ out of their sight and focusing their eyes upon the Law But why does Paul accuse the Galatians of reverting to the weak and beggarly elements of the Law when they never had the Law Why does he not say to them At one time you Galatians did not know God You then served idols that were no gods But now that you have come to know the true God why do you go back to the worship of idols Paul seems to identify their defection from the Gospel to the Law with their former idolatry Indeed he does Whoever gives up the article of justification does not know the true God It is one and the same thing whether a person reverts to the Law or to the worship of idols When the article of justification is lost nothing remains except error hypocrisy godlessness and idolatry God will and can be known in no other way than in and through Christ according to the statement of John one eighteen The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him Christ is the only means whereby we can know God and His will In Christ we perceive that God is not a cruel judge but a most loving and merciful Father who to bless and to save us spared not his own Son but gave him up for us all This is truly to know God Those who do not know God in Christ arrive at this erroneous conclusion I will serve God in such and such a way I will join this or that order I will be active in this or that charitable endeavor God will sanction my good intentions and reward me with everlasting life For is He not a merciful and generous Father who gives good things even to the unworthy and ungrateful How much more will He grant unto me everlasting life as a due payment in return for my many good deeds and merits This is the religion of reason This is the natural religion of the world The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God I Cor two fourteen There is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after God Romans three eleven Hence there is really no difference between a Jew a Mohammedan and any other old or new heretic There may be a difference of persons places rites religions ceremonies but as far as their fundamental beliefs are concerned they are all alike Is it therefore not extreme folly for Rome and the Mohammedans to fight each other about religion How about the monks Why should one monk want to be accounted more holy than another monk because of some silly ceremony when all the time their basic beliefs are asnmuch alike as one egg is like the other They all imagine if we do this or that work God will have mercy on us if not God will be angry God never promised to save anybody for his religious observance of ceremonies and ordinances Those who rely upon such things do serve a god but it is their own invention of a god and not the true God The true God has this to say No religion pleases Me whereby the Father is not glorified through His Son Jesus All who give their faith to this Son of Mine to them I am God and Father I accept justify and save them All others abide under My curse because they worship creatures instead of Me Without the doctrine of justification there can be only ignorance of God Those who refuse to be justified by Christ are idolaters They remain under the Law sin death and the power of the devil Everything they do is wrong Nowadays there are many such idolaters who want to be counted among the true confessors of the Gospel They may even teach that men are delivered from their sins by the death of Christ But because they attach more importance to charity than to faith in Christ they dishonor Him and pervert His Word They do not serve the true God but an idol of their own invention The true God has never yet smiled upon a person for his charity or virtues but only for the sake of Christ s merits The objection is frequently raised that the Bible commands that we should love God with all our heart True enough But because God commands it it does not follow that we do it If we could love God with all our heart we should undoubtedly be justified by our obedience for it is written Which if a man do he shall live in them Lev eighteen five But now comes the Gospel and says Because you do not do these things you cannot live in them The words Thou shalt love the Lord thy God require perfect obedience perfect fear perfect trust and perfect love But where are the people who can render perfection Hence this commandment instead of justifying men only accuses and condemns them Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth Romans ten one How may these two contradictory statements of the Apostle Ye knew not God and Ye worshipped God be reconciled I answer By nature all men know that there is a God because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God hath showed it unto them For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen Romans one nineteen twenty Furthermore the different religions to be found among all nations at all times bear witness to the fact that all men have a certain intuitive knowledge of God If all men know God how can Paul say that the Galatians did not know God prior to the hearing of the Gospel I answer There is a twofold knowledge of God general and particular All men have the general and instinctive recognition that there is a God who created heaven and earth who is just and holy and who punishes the wicked How God feels about us what His intentions are what He will do for us or how He will save us that men cannot know instinctively It must be revealed to them I may know a person by sight and still not know him because I do not know how he feels about me Men know instinctively that there is a God But what His will is toward them they do not know It is written There is none that understandeth God Romans three eleven Again No man hath seen God John one eighteen Now what good does it do you if you know that there is a God if you do not know how He feels about you or what He wants of you People have done a good deal of guessing The Jew imagines he is doing the will of God if he concentrates on the Law of Moses The Mohammedan thinks his Koran is the will of God The monk fancies he is doing the will of God if he performs his vows But they deceive themselves and become vain in their imaginations as Paul says Romans one twenty one Instead of worshipping the true God they worship the vain imaginations of their foolish hearts What Paul means by saying to the Galatians When ye knew not God is simply this There was a time when you did not know the will of God in Christ but you worshipped gods of your own invention thinking that you had to perform this or that labor Whether you understand the elements of the world to mean the Law of Moses or the religions of the heathen nations it makes no difference Those who lapse from the Gospel to the Law are no better off than those who lapse from grace into idolatry Without Christ all religion is idolatry Without Christ men will entertain false ideas about God call their ideas what you like the laws of Moses the ordinances of the Pope the Koran of the Mohammedans or what have you VERSE nine But now after that ye have known God Is it not amazing cries Paul that you Galatians who knew God intimately by the hearing of the Gospel should all of a sudden revert from the true knowledge of His will in which I thought you were confirmed to the weak and beggarly elements of the Law which can only enslave you again VERSE nine Or rather are known of God The Apostle turns the foregoing sentence around He fears the Galatians have lost God altogether Alas he cries have you come to this that you no longer know God What else am I to think Nevertheless God knows you Our knowledge of God is rather passive than active God knows us better than we know God Ye are known of God means that God brings His Gospel to our attention and endows us with faith and the Holy Spirit Even in these words the Apostle denies the possibility of our knowing God by the performance of the Law No man knoweth who the Father is but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal him Luke ten twenty two By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities Isaiah fifty three eleven The Apostle frankly expresses his surprise to the Galatians that they who had known God intimately through the Gospel should so easily be persuaded by the false apostles to return to the weak and beggarly elements of the Law I would not be surprised to see my church perverted by some fanatic through one or two sermons We are no better than the apostles who had to witness the subversion of the churches which they had planted with their own hands Nevertheless Christ will reign to the end of the world and that miraculously as He did during the Dark Ages Paul seems to think rather ill of the Law He calls it the elements of the world the weak and beggarly elements of the world Was it not irreverent for him to speak that way about the holy Law of God The Law ought to prepare the way of Christ into the hearts of men That is the true purpose and function of the Law But if the Law presumes to usurp the place and function of the Gospel it is no longer the holy Law of God but a pseudo Gospel If you care to amplify this matter you may add the observation that the Law is a weak and beggarly element because it makes people weak and beggarly The Law has no power and affluence to make men strong and rich before God To seek to be justified by the Law amounts to the same thing as if a person who is already weak and feeble should try to find strength in weakness or as if a person with the dropsy should seek a cure by exposing himself to the pestilence or as if a leper should go to a leper and a beggar to a beggar to find health and wealth Those who seek to be justified by the Law grow weaker and more destitute right along They are weak and bankrupt to begin with They are by nature the children of wrath Yet for salvation they grasp at the straw of the Law The Law can only aggravate their weakness and poverty The Law makes them ten times weaker and poorer than they were before I and many others have experienced the truth of this I have known monks who zealously labored to please God for salvation but the more they labored the more impatient miserable uncertain and fearful they became What else can you expect You cannot grow strong through weakness and rich through poverty People who prefer the Law to the Gospel are like Aesop s dog who let go of the meat to snatch at the shadow of the water There is no satisfaction in the Law What satisfaction can there be in collecting laws with which to torment oneself and others One law breeds ten more until their number is legion Who would have thought it possible that the Galatians taught as they were by that efficient apostle and teacher Paul could so quickly be led astray by the false apostles To fall away from the Gospel is an easy matter because few people appreciate what an excellent treasure the knowledge of Christ really is People are not sufficiently exercised in their faith by afflictions They do not wrestle against sin They live in security without conflict Because they have never been tried in the furnace of affliction they are not properly equipped with the armor of God and know not how to use the sword of the Spirit As long as they are being shepherded by faithful pastors all is well But when their faithful shepherds are gone and wolves disguised as sheep break into the fold back they go to the weak and beggarly elements of the Law Whoever goes back to the Law loses the knowledge of the truth fails in the recognition of his sinfulness does not know God nor the devil nor himself and does not understand the meaning and purpose of the Law Without the knowledge of Christ a man will always argue that the Law is necessary for salvation that it will strengthen the weak and enrich the poor Wherever this opinion holds sway the promises of God are denied Christ is demoted hypocrisy and idolatry are established VERSE nine Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage The Apostle pointedly asks the Galatians whether they desire to be in bondage again to the Law The Law is weak and poor the sinner is weak and poor two feeble beggars trying to help each other They cannot do it They only wear each other out But through Christ a weak and poor sinner is revived and enriched unto eternal life VERSE ten Ye observe days and months and times and years The Apostle Paul knew what the false apostles were teaching the Galatians The observance of days and months and times and years The Jews had been obliged to keep holy the Sabbath Day the new moons the feast of the passover the feast of tabernacles and other feasts The false apostles constrained the Galatians to observe these Jewish feasts under threat of damnation Paul hastens to tell the Galatians that they were exchanging their Christian liberty for the weak and beggarly elements of the world VERSE eleven I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain It grieves the Apostle to think that he might have preached the Gospel to the Galatians in vain But this statement expresses more than grief Behind his apparent disappointment at their failure lurks the sharp reprimand that they had forsaken Christ and that they were proving themselves to be obstinate unbelievers But he does not openly condemn them for fear that oversharp criticism might alienate them altogether He therefore changes the tone of his voice and speaks kindly to them VERSE twelve Be as I am for I am as ye are Up to this point Paul has been occupied with the doctrinal aspect of the apostasy of the Galatians He did not conceal his disappointment at their lack of stability He had rebuked them He had called them fools crucifiers of Christ et cetera Now that the more important part of his Epistle has been finished he realizes that he has handled the Galatians too roughly Anxious lest he should do more harm than good he is careful to let them see that his criticism proceeds from affection and a true apostolic concern for their welfare He is eager to mitigate his sharp words with gentle sentiments in order to win them again Like Paul all pastors and ministers ought to have much sympathy for their poor straying sheep and instruct them in the spirit of meekness They cannot be straightened out in any other way Oversharp criticism provokes anger and despair but no repentance And here let us note by the way that true doctrine always produces concord When men embrace errors the tie of Christian love is broken At the beginning of the Reformation we were honored as the true ministers of Christ Suddenly certain false brethren began to hate us We had given them no offense no occasion to hate us They knew then as they know now that ours is the singular desire to publish the Gospel of Christ everywhere What changed their attitude toward us False doctrine Seduced into error by the false apostles the Galatians refused to acknowledge saint Paul as their pastor The name and doctrine of Paul became obnoxious to them I fear this Epistle recalled very few from their error Paul knew that the false apostles would misconstrue his censure of the Galatians to their own advantage and say So this is your Paul whom you praise so much What sweet names he is calling you in his letter When he was with you he acted like a father but now he acts like a dictator Paul knew what to expect of the false apostles and therefore he is worried He does not know what to say It is hard for a man to defend his cause at a distance especially when he has reason to think that he personally has fallen into disfavor VERSE twelve Be as I am for I am as ye are In beseeching the Galatians to be as he is Paul expresses the hope that they might hold the same affection for him that he holds for them Perhaps I have been a little hard with you Forgive it Do not judge my heart according to my words We request the same consideration for ourselves Our way of writing is incisive and straightforward But there is no bitterness in our heart We seek the honor of Christ and the welfare of men We do not hate the Pope as to wish him ill We do not desire the death of our false brethren We desire that they may turn from their evil ways to Christ and be saved with us A teacher chastises the pupil to reform him The rod hurts but correction is necessary A father punishes his son because he loves his son If he did not love the lad he would not punish him but let him have his own way in everything until he comes to harm Paul beseeches the Galatians to look upon his correction as a sign that he really cared for them Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby Heb twelve eleven Although Paul seeks to soften the effect of his reproachful words he does not take them back When a physician administers a bitter potion to a patient he does it to cure the patient The fact that the medicine is bitter is no fault of the physician The malady calls for a bitter medicine Paul wants the Galatians to judge his words according to the situation that made them necessary VERSE twelve Brethren I beseech you Ye have not injured me at all Would you call it beseeching the Galatians to call them bewitched disobedient crucifiers of Christ The Apostle calls it an earnest beseeching And so it is When a father corrects his son it means as if he were saying My son I beseech you be a good boy VERSE twelve Ye have not injured me at all I am not angry with you says Paul Why should I be angry with you since you have done me no injury at all To this the Galatians reply Why then do you say that we are perverted that we have forsaken the true doctrine that we are foolish bewitched et cetera if you are not angry We must have offended you somehow Paul answers You Galatians have not injured me You have injured yourselves I chide you not because I wish you ill I have no reason to wish you ill God is my witness you have done me no wrong On the contrary you have been very good to me The reason I write to you is because I love you The bitter potion must be sweetened with honey and sugar to make it palatable When parents have punished their children they give them apples pears and other good things to show them that they mean well VERSES thirteen fourteen Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus You Galatians were very good to me When I began to preach the Gospel to you in the infirmity of my flesh and in great temptation you were not at all offended On the contrary you were so loving so kind so friendly towards me you received me like an angel like Jesus Himself Indeed the Galatians are to be commended for receiving the Gospel from a man as unimposing and afflicted all around as Paul was Wherever he preached the Gospel Jews and Gentiles raved against him All the influential and religious people of his day denounced him But the Galatians did not mind it That was greatly to their honor And Paul does not neglect to praise them for it This praise Paul bestows on none of the other churches to which he wrote saint Jerome and others of the ancient fathers allege this infirmity of Paul s to have been some physical defect or concupiscence Jerome and the other diagnosticians lived at a time when the Church enjoyed peace and prosperity when the bishops increased in wealth and standing when pastors and bishops no longer sat over the Word of God No wonder they failed to understand Paul When Paul speaks of the infirmity of his flesh he does not mean some physical defect or carnal lust but the sufferings and afflictions which he endured in his body What these infirmities were he himself explains in II Corinthians twelve nine ten Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ s sake for when I am weak then am I strong And in the eleventh chapter of the same Epistle the Apostle writes In labors more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one Thrice was I beaten with rods once was I stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck et cetera II Cor eleven twenty three twenty five By the infirmity of his flesh Paul meant these afflictions and not some chronic disease He reminds the Galatians how he was always in peril at the hands of the Jews Gentiles and false brethren how he suffered hunger and want Now the afflictions of the believers always offend people Paul knew it and therefore has high praise for the Galatians because they overlooked his afflictions and received him like an angel Christ forewarned the faithful against the offense of the Cross saying Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me Matt eleven six Surely it is no easy thing to confess Him Lord of all and Savior of the world who was a reproach of men and despised of the people and the laughing stock of the world Ps twenty two seven I say to value this poor Christ so spitefully scorned spit upon scourged and crucified more than the riches of the richest the strength of the strongest the wisdom of the wisest is something It is worth being called blessed Paul not only had outward afflictions but also inner spiritual afflictions He refers to these in II Corinthians seven six Without were fightings within were fears In his letter to the Philippians Paul makes mention of the restoration of Epaphroditus as a special act of mercy on the part of God lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow Considering the many afflictions of Paul we are not surprised to hear him loudly praising the Galatians for not being offended at him as others were The world thinks us mad because we go about to comfort to help to save others while we ourselves are in distress People tell us Physician heal thyself Luke four twenty three The Apostle tells the Galatians that he will keep their kindness in perpetual remembrance Indirectly he also reminds them how much they had loved him before the invasion of the false apostles and gives them a hint that they should return to their first love for him VERSE fifteen Where is then the blessedness ye spake of How much happier you used to be And how you Galatians used to tell me that you were blessed And how much did I not praise and commend you formerly Paul reminds them of former and better times in an effort to mitigate his sharp reproaches lest the false apostles should slander him and misconstrue his letter to his disadvantage and to their own advantage Such snakes in the grass are equal to anything They will pervert words spoken from a sincere heart and twist them to mean just the opposite of what they were intended to convey They are like spiders that suck venom out of sweet and fragrant flowers The poison is not in the flowers but it is the nature of the spider to turn what is good and wholesome into poison VERSE fifteen For I bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me The Apostle continues his praise of the Galatians You did not only treat me very courteously If it had been necessary you would have plucked out your eyes and sacrificed your lives for me And in very fact the Galatians sacrificed their lives for Paul By receiving and maintaining Paul they called upon their own heads the hatred and malice of all the Jews and Gentiles Nowadays the name of Luther carries the same stigma Whoever praises Luther is a worse sinner than an idolater perjurer or thief VERSE sixteen Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth Paul s reason for praising the Galatians is to avoid giving them the impression as if he were their enemy because he had reprimanded them A true friend will admonish his erring brother and if the erring brother has any sense at all he will thank his friend In the world truth produces hatred Whoever speaks the truth is counted an enemy But among friends it is not so much less among Christians The Apostle wants his Galatians to know that just because he had told them the truth they are not to think that he dislikes them I told you the truth because I love you VERSE seventeen They zealously affect you but not well Paul takes the false apostles to task for their flattery Satan s satellites softsoap the people Paul calls it by good words and fair speeches to deceive the hearts of the simple Romans sixteen eighteen They tell me that by my stubbornness in this doctrine of the Sacrament I am destroying the harmony of the church They say it would be better if we would make some slight concession rather than cause such commotion and controversy in the Church regarding an article which is not even one of the fundamental doctrines My reply is cursed be any love or harmony which demands for its preservation that we place the Word of God in jeopardy VERSE seventeen Yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them Do you Galatians know why the false apostles are so zealous about you They expect you to reciprocate And that would leave me out If their zeal were right they would not mind your loving me But they hate my doctrine and want to stamp it out In order to bring this to pass they go about to alienate your hearts from me and to make me obnoxious to you In this way Paul brings the false apostles into suspicion He questions their motives He maintains that their zeal is mere pretense to deceive the Galatians Our Savior Christ also warned us saying Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep s clothing Matt seven fifteen Paul was considerably disturbed by the commissions and changes that followed in the wake of his preaching He was accused of being a pestilent fellow a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world Acts twenty four five In Philippi the townspeople cried that he troubled their city and taught customs which were not lawful for them to receive Acts sixteen twenty twenty one All troubles calamities famines wars were laid to the charge of the Gospel of the apostles However the apostles were not deterred by such calumnies from preaching the Gospel They knew that they ought to obey God rather than men and that it was better for the world to be upset than to be ignorant of Christ Do you think for a moment that these reactions did not worry the apostles They were not made of iron They foresaw the revolutionary character of the Gospel They also foresaw the dissensions that would creep into the Church It was bad news for Paul when he heard that the Corinthians were denying the resurrection of the dead that the churches he had planted were experiencing all kinds of difficulties and that the Gospel was being supplanted by false doctrines But Paul also knew that the Gospel was not to blame He did not resign his office because he knew that the Gospel he preached was the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes The same criticism which was leveled at the apostles is leveled at us The doctrine of the Gospel we are told is the cause of all the present unrest in the world There is no wrong that is not laid to our charge But why We do not spread wicked lies We preach the glad tidings of Christ Our opponents will bear us out when we say that we never fail to urge respect for the constituted authorities because that is the will of God All of these vilifications cannot discourage us We know that there is nothing the devil hates worse than the Gospel It is one of his little tricks to blame the Gospel for every evil in the world Formerly when the traditions of the fathers were taught in the Church the devil was not excited as he is now It goes to show that our doctrine is of God else behemoth would lie under shady trees in the covert of the reed and fens The fact that he is again walking about as a roaring lion to stir up riots and disorders is a sure sign that he has begun to feel the effect of our preaching VERSE eighteen But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when I am present with you When I was present with you you loved me although I preached the Gospel to you in the infirmity of my flesh The fact that I am now absent from you ought not to change your attitude towards me Although I am absent in the flesh I am with you in spirit and in my doctrine which you ought to retain by all means because through it you received the Holy Spirit VERSE nineteen My little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you With every single word the Apostle seeks to regain the confidence of the Galatians He now calls them lovingly his little children He adds the simile Of whom I travail in birth again As parents reproduce their physical characteristics in their children so the apostles reproduced their faith in the hearts of the hearers until Christ was formed in them A person has the form of Christ when he believes in Christ to the exclusion of everything else This faith in Christ is engendered by the Gospel as the Apostle declares in I Corinthians four fifteen In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel and in II Corinthians three three Ye are the epistle of Christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God The Word of God falling from the lips of the apostle or minister enters into the heart of the hearer The Holy Ghost impregnates the Word so that it brings forth the fruit of faith In this manner every Christian pastor is a spiritual father who forms Christ in the hearts of his hearers At the same time Paul indicts the false apostles He says I have begotten you Galatians through the Gospel giving you the form of Christ But these false apostles are giving you a new form the form of Moses Note the Apostle does not say Of whom I travail in birth again until I be formed in you but until Christ be formed in you The false apostles had torn the form of Christ out of the hearts of the Galatians and substituted their own form Paul endeavors to reform them or rather reform Christ in them VERSE twenty I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice A common saying has it that a letter is a dead messenger Something is lacking in all writing You can never be sure how the written page will affect the reader because his mood his circumstances his affections are so changeable It is different with the spoken word If it is harsh and ill timed it can always be remodeled No wonder the Apostle expresses the wish that he could speak to the Galatians in person He could change his voice according to their attitude If he saw that they were repentant he could soften the tone of his voice If he saw that they were stubborn he could speak to them more earnestly This way he did not know how to deal with them by letter If his Epistle is too severe it will do more damage than good If it is too gentle it will not correct conditions But if he could be with them in person he could change his voice as the occasion demanded VERSE twenty For I stand in doubt of you I do not know how to take you I do not know how to approach you by letter In order to make sure that he leaves no stone unturned in his effort to recall them to the Gospel of Christ he chides entreats praises and blames the Galatians trying every way to hit the right note and tone of voice VERSE twenty one Tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law Here Paul would have closed his Epistle because he did not know what else to say He wishes he could see the Galatians in person and straighten out their difficulties But he is not sure whether the Galatians have fully understood the difference between the Gospel and the Law To make sure he introduces another illustration He knows people like illustrations and stories He knows that Christ Himself made ample use of parables Paul is an expert at allegories They are dangerous things Unless a person has a thorough knowledge of Christian doctrine he had better leave allegories alone The allegory which Paul is about to bring is taken from the Book of Genesis which he calls the Law True that book contains no mention of the Law Paul simply follows the custom of the Jews who included the first book of Moses in the collective term Law Jesus even included the Psalms VERSES twenty two twenty three For it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise This is Paul s allegory Abraham had two sons Ishmael by Hagar and Isaac by Sarah They were both the true sons of Abraham with this difference that Ishmael was born after the flesh i e without the commandment and promise of God while Isaac was born according to the promise With the permission of Sarah Abraham took Hagar Sarah s bondwoman to wife Sarah knew that God had promised to make her husband Abraham the father of a nation and she hoped that she would be the mother of this promised nation But with the passage of the years her hope died out In order that the promise of God should not be annulled by her barrenness this holy woman resigned her right and honor to her maid This was no easy thing for her to do She abased herself She thought God is no liar What He has promised He will perform But perhaps God does not want me to be the mother of Abraham s posterity Perhaps He prefers Hagar for the honor Ishmael was thus born without a special word or promise of God at the mere request of Sarah God did not command Abraham to take Hagar nor did God promise to bless the coalition It is evident that Ishmael was the son of Abraham after the flesh and not after the promise In the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans saint Paul advances the same argument which he amplifies into an allegory in writing to the Galatians There he argues that all the children of Abraham are not the children of God For Abraham had two kinds of children children born of the promise like Isaac and other children born without the promise as Ishmael With this argument Paul squelched the proud Jews who gloried that they were the children of God because they were the seed and the children of Abraham Paul makes it clear enough that it takes more than an Abrahamic pedigree to be a child of God To be a child of God requires faith in Christ VERSE twenty four Which things are an allegory Allegories are not very convincing but like pictures they visualize a matter If Paul had not brought in advance indisputable arguments for the righteousness of faith over against the righteousness of works this allegory would do little good Having first fortified his case with invincible arguments he can afford to inject this allegory to add impressiveness and beauty to his presentation VERSES twenty four twenty five For these are the two covenants the one from the mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage which is Agar For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia In this allegory Abraham represents God Abraham had two sons born respectively of Hagar and Sarah The two women represent the two Testaments The Old Testament is Mount Sinai the bondwoman Hagar The Arabians call Mount Sinai Agar It may be that the similarity of these two names gave Paul his idea for this allegory As Hagar bore Abraham a son who was not an heir but a servant so Sinai the Law the allegorical Hagar bore God a carnal and servile people of the Law without promise The Law has a promise but it is a conditional promise depending upon whether people fulfill the Law The Jews regarded the conditional promises of the Law as if they were unconditional When the prophets foretold the destruction of Jerusalem the Jews stoned them as blasphemers of God They never gave it any thought that there was a condition attached to the Law which reads If you keep the commandments it shall be well with thee VERSE twenty five And answereth to Jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children A little while ago Paul called Mount Sinai Hagar He would now gladly make Jerusalem the Sarah of the New Testament but he cannot The earthly Jerusalem is not Sarah but a part of Hagar Hagar lives there in the home of the Law the Temple the priesthood the ceremonies and whatever else was ordained in the Law at Mount Sinai I would have been tempted to call Jerusalem Sarah or the New Testament I would have been pleased with this turn of the allegory It goes to show that not everybody has the gift of allegory Would you not think it perfectly proper to call Sinai Hagar and Jerusalem Sarah True Paul does call Sarah Jerusalem But he has the spiritual and heavenly Jerusalem in mind not the earthly Jerusalem Sarah represents that spiritual Jerusalem where there is no Law but only the promise and where the inhabitants are free To show that the Law has been quite abolished the earthly Jerusalem was completely destroyed with all her ornaments temples and ceremonies VERSE twenty six But Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all The earthly Jerusalem with its ordinances and laws represents Hagar and her offspring They are slaves to the Law sin and death But the heavenly Jerusalem is Sarah the free woman This heavenly Jerusalem is the Church that is to say the number of all believers throughout the world having one and the same Gospel one and the same faith in Christ one and the same Holy Ghost and the same sacraments Do not mistake this one word above to refer to the triumphant Church in heaven but to the militant Church on earth In Philippians three twenty the Apostle uses the phrase Our conversation is in heaven not locally in heaven but in spirit When a believer accepts the heavenly gifts of the Gospel he is in heaven So also in Ephesians one three Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jerusalem here means the universal Christian Church on earth Sarah the Church as the bride of Christ bears free children who are not subject to the Law VERSE twenty seven For it is written Rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband Paul quotes the allegorical prophecy of Isaiah to the effect that the mother of many children must die desolately while the barren woman shall have an abundance of children Isaiah fifty four one He applies this prophecy to Hagar and Sarah to the Law and the Gospel The Law as the husband of the fruitful woman procreates many children For men of all ages have had the idea that they are right when they follow after the Law and outwardly perform its requirements Although the Law has many children they are not free They are slaves As servants they cannot have a share in the inheritance but are driven from the house as Ishmael was cast out of the house of Abraham In fact the servants of the Law are even now barred from the kingdom of light and liberty for he that believeth not is condemned already John three eighteen As the servants of the Law they remain under the curse of the Law under sin and death under the power of the devil and under the wrath and judgment of God On the other hand Sarah the free Church seems barren The Gospel of the Cross which the Church proclaims does not have the appeal that the Law has for men and therefore it does not find many adherents The Church does not look prosperous Unbelievers have always predicted the death of the Church The Jews were quite certain that the Church would not long endure They said to Paul As concerning this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against Acts twenty eight twenty two No matter how barren and forsaken how weak and desolate the Church may seem she alone is really fruitful before God By the Gospel she procreates an infinite number of children that are free heirs of everlasting life The Law the old husband is really dead But not all people know it or want to know it They labor and bear the burden and the heat of the day and bring forth many children children that are bastards like themselves children born to be put out of the house like Ishmael to perish forever Accursed be that doctrine life and religion which endeavors to obtain righteousness before God by the Law and its creeds The scholastics think that the judicial and ceremonial laws of Moses were abolished by the coming of Christ but not the moral law They are blind When Paul declares that we are delivered from the curse of the Law he means the whole Law particularly the moral law which more than the other laws accuses curses and condemns the conscience The Ten Commandments have no right to condemn that conscience in which Jesus dwells for Jesus has taken from the Ten Commandments the right and power to curse us Not as if the conscience is now insensitive to the terrors of the Law but the Law cannot drive the conscience to despair There is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Romans eight one If the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed John eight thirty six You will complain But I am not doing anything That is right You cannot do a thing to be delivered from the tyranny of the Law But listen to the glad tidings which the Holy Ghost brings to you in the words of the prophet Rejoice thou barren As Christ is greater than the Law so much more excellent is the righteousness of Christ than the righteousness of the Law In one more respect the Law has been abolished The civil laws of Moses do not concern us and should not be put back in force That does not mean that we are exempt from obedience to the civil laws under which we live On the contrary the Gospel commands Christians to obey government not only for wrath but also for conscience sake Romans thirteen five Neither do the ordinances of Moses or those of the Pope concern us But because life cannot go on without some ordinances the Gospel permits regulations to be made in the Church in regard to special days times places et cetera in order that the people may know upon what day at what hour and in what place to assemble for the Word of God Such directions are desirable that all things be done decently and in order I Cor fourteen forty These directions may be changed or omitted altogether as long as no offense is given to the weak Paul however refers particularly to the abolition of the moral law If faith alone in Christ justifies then the whole Law is abolished without exception And this the Apostle proves by the testimony of Isaiah who bids the barren to rejoice because she will have many children whereas she that has a husband and many children will be forsaken Isaiah calls the Church barren because her children are born without effort by the Word of faith through the Spirit of God It is a matter of birth not of exertion The believer too works but not in an effort to become a son and an heir of God He is that before he goes to work He is born a son and an heir He works for the glory of God and the welfare of his fellowmen VERSE twenty eight Now we brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise The Jews claimed to be the children of God because they were the children of Abraham Jesus answered them John eight thirty nine forty If ye were Abraham s children ye would do the works of Abraham But now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth And in verse forty two If God were your Father ye would love me In other words You are not the children of God If you were you would know and love me Brothers born and living together in the same house recognize each other You do not recognize me You are of your father the devil We are not like these Jews the children of the bondwoman the Law who were cast out of the house by Jesus We are children of the promise like Isaac born of grace and faith unto an everlasting inheritance VERSE twenty nine But as that he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit even so it is now This is a cheering thought We who are born of the Gospel and live in Christ and rejoice in our inheritance have Ishmael for our enemy The children of the Law will always persecute the children of the Gospel This is our daily experience Our opponents tell us that everything was at peace before the Gospel was revived by us Since then the whole world has been upset People blame us and the Gospel for everything for the disobedience of subjects to their rulers for wars plagues and famines for revolutions and every other evil that can be imagined No wonder our opponents think they are doing God a favor by hating and persecuting us Ishmael will persecute Isaac We invite our opponents to tell us what good things attended the preaching of the Gospel by the apostles Did not the destruction of Jerusalem follow on the heels of the Gospel And how about the overthrow of the Roman Empire Did not the whole world seethe with unrest as the Gospel was preached in the whole world We do not say that the Gospel instigated these upheavals The iniquity of man did it Our opponents blame our doctrine for the present turmoil But ours is a doctrine of grace and peace It does not stir up trouble Trouble starts when the people the nations and their rulers of the earth rage and take counsel together against the Lord and against His anointed Psalm two But all their counsels shall be brought to naught He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the Lord shall have them in derision Psalm two four Let them cry out against us as much as they like We know that they are the cause of all their own troubles As long as we preach Christ and confess Him to be our Savior we must be content to be called vicious trouble makers These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar so said the Jews of Paul and Silas Acts seventeen six seven Of Paul they said We have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes The Gentiles uttered similar complaints These men do exceedingly trouble our city This man Luther is also accused of being a pestilent fellow who troubles the papacy and the Roman empire If I would keep silent all would be well and the Pope would no more persecute me The moment I open my mouth the Pope begins to fume and to rage It seems we must choose between Christ and the Pope Let the Pope perish Christ foresaw the reaction of the world to the Gospel He said I am come to send fire on the earth and what will I if it be already kindled Luke twelve forty nine Do not take the statement of our opponents seriously that no good can come of the preaching of the Gospel What do they know They would not recognize the fruits of the Gospel if they saw them At any rate our opponents cannot accuse us of adultery murder theft and such crimes The worst they can say about us is that we have the Gospel What is wrong with the Gospel We teach that Christ the Son of God has redeemed us from sin and everlasting death This is not our doctrine It belongs to Christ If there is anything wrong with it it is not our fault If they want to condemn Christ for being our Savior and Redeemer that is their lookout We are mere onlookers watching to see who will win the victory Christ or His opponents On one occasion Jesus remarked If ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you John fifteen nineteen In other words I am the cause of all your troubles I am the one for whose sake you are killed If you did not confess my name the world would not hate you The servant is not greater than his lord If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you Christ takes all the blame He says You have not incurred the hatred and persecutions of the world I have But be of good cheer I have overcome the world VERSE thirty Nevertheless what saith the Scripture Cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman Sarah s demand that the bondwoman and her son be cast out of the house was undoubtedly a blow to Abraham He felt sorry for his son Ishmael The Scripture explicitly states Abraham s grief in the words And the thing was very grievous in Abraham s sight because of his son general twenty one eleven But God approved Sarah s action and said to Abraham Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called general twenty one twelve The Holy Ghost contemptuously calls the admirers of the Law the children of the bondwoman If you do not know your mother I will tell you what kind of a woman she is She is a slave And you are slaves You are slaves of the Law and therefore slaves of sin death and everlasting damnation You are not fit to be heirs You are put out of the house This is the sentence which God pronounces upon the Ishmaelites the papists and all others who trust in their own merits and persecute the Church of Christ Because they are slaves and persecutors of the children of the free woman they shall be cast out of the house of God forever They shall have no inheritance with the children of the promise This sentence stands forever This sentence affects not only those popes cardinals bishops and monks who were notoriously wicked and made their bellies their Gods It strikes also those who lived in all sincerity to please God and to merit the forgiveness of their sins through a life of self denial Even these will be cast out because they are children of the bondwoman Our opponents do not defend their own moral delinquency The better ones deplore and abhor it But they defend and uphold their doctrine of works which is of the devil Our quarrel is not with those who live in manifest sins Our quarrel is with those among them who think they live like angels claiming that they do not only perform the Ten Commandments of God but also the sayings of Christ and many good works that God does not expect of them We quarrel with them because they refuse to have Jesus merit count alone for righteousness saint Bernard was one of the best of the medieval saints He lived a chaste and holy life But when it came to dying he did not trust in his chaste life for salvation He prayed I have lived a wicked life But Thou Lord Jesus hast a heaven to give unto me First because Thou art the Son of God Secondly because Thou hast purchased heaven for me by Thy suffering and death Thou givest heaven to me not because I earned it but because Thou hast earned it for me If any of the Romanists are saved it is because they forget their good deeds and merits and feel like Paul Not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ Phil three nine VERSE thirty one So then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free With this sentence the Apostle Paul concludes his allegory of the barren Church This sentence forms a clear rejection of the righteousness of the Law and a confirmation of the doctrine of justification In the next chapter Paul lays special stress upon the freedom which the children of the free woman enjoy He treats of Christian liberty the knowledge of which is very necessary The liberty which Christ purchased for us is a bulwark to us in our battle against spiritual tyranny Therefore we must carefully study this doctrine of Christian liberty not only for the confirmation of the doctrine of justification but also for the comfort and encouragement of those who are weak in faith CHAPTER five IN this chapter the Apostle Paul presents the doctrine of Christian liberty in a final effort to persuade the Galatians to give up the nefarious doctrine of the false apostles To accomplish his purpose he adduces threats and promises trying in every way possible to keep them in the liberty which Christ purchased for them VERSE one Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free Be steadfast not careless Lie not down and sleep but stand up Be watchful Hold fast the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free Those who loll cannot keep this liberty Satan hates the light of the Gospel When it begins to shine a little he fights against it with might and main What liberty does Paul mean Not civil liberty for which we have the government to thank but the liberty which Christ has procured for us At one time the emperor was compelled to grant to the bishop of Rome certain immunities and privileges This is civil liberty That liberty exempts the clergy from certain public charges Then there is also another kind of liberty when people obey neither the laws of God nor the laws of men but do as they please This carnal liberty the people want in our day We are not now speaking of this liberty Neither are we speaking of civil liberty Paul is speaking of a far better liberty the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free not from material bonds not from the Babylonian captivity not from the tyranny of the Turks but from the eternal wrath of God Where is this liberty In the conscience Our conscience is free and quiet because it no longer has to fear the wrath of God This is real liberty compared with which every other kind of liberty is not worth mentioning Who can adequately express the boon that comes to a person when he has the heart assurance that God will nevermore be angry with him but will forever be merciful to him for Christ s sake This is indeed a marvelous liberty to have the sovereign God for our Friend and Father who will defend maintain and save us in this life and in the life to come As an outgrowth of this liberty we are at the same time free from the Law sin death the power of the devil hell et cetera Since the wrath of God has been assuaged by Christ no Law sin or death may now accuse and condemn us These foes of ours will continue to frighten us but not too much The worth of our Christian liberty cannot be exaggerated Our conscience must be trained to fall back on the freedom purchased for us by Christ Though the fears of the Law the terrors of sin the horror of death assail us occasionally we know that these feelings shall not endure because the prophet quotes God as saying In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee Isa fifty four eight We shall appreciate this liberty all the more when we bear in mind that it was Jesus Christ the Son of God who purchased it with His own blood Hence Christ s liberty is given us not by the Law or for our own righteousness but freely for Christ s sake In the eighth chapter of the Gospel of saint John Jesus declares If the Son shall make you free ye shall be free indeed He only stands between us and the evils which trouble and afflict us and which He has overcome for us Reason cannot properly evaluate this gift Who can fully appreciate the blessing of the forgiveness of sins and of everlasting life Our opponents claim that they also possess this liberty But they do not When they are put to the test all their self confidence slips from them What else can they expect when they trust in works and not in the Word of God Our liberty is founded on Christ Himself who sits at the right hand of God and intercedes for us Therefore our liberty is sure and valid as long as we believe in Christ As long as we cling to Him with a steadfast faith we possess His priceless gifts But if we are careless and indifferent we shall lose them It is not without good reason that Paul urges us to watch and to stand fast He knew that the devil delights in taking this liberty away from us VERSE one And be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage Because reason prefers the righteousness of the Law to the righteousness of faith Paul calls the Law a yoke a yoke of bondage Peter also calls it a yoke Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear Acts fifteen ten In this passage Paul again disparages the pernicious notion that the Law is able to make men righteous before God a notion deeply rooted in man s reason All mankind is so wrapped up in this idea that it is hard to drag it out of people Paul compares those who seek to be justified by the Law to oxen that are hitched to the yoke Like oxen that toil in the yoke all day and in the evening are turned out to graze along the dusty road and at last are marked for slaughter when they no longer can draw the burden so those who seek to be justified by the Law are entangled with the yoke of bondage and when they have grown old and broken down in the service of the Law they have earned for their perpetual reward God s wrath and everlasting torment We are not now treating of an unimportant matter It is a matter that involves everlasting liberty or everlasting slavery For as a liberation from God s wrath through the kind office of Christ is not a passing boon but a permanent blessing so also the yoke of the Law is not a temporary but an everlasting affliction Rightly are the doers of the Law called devil s martyrs They take more pains to earn hell than the martyrs of Christ to obtain heaven Theirs is a double misfortune First they torture themselves on earth with self inflicted penances and finally when they die they gain the reward of eternal damnation VERSE two Behold I Paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing Paul is incensed at the thought of the tyranny of the Law His antagonism to the Law is a personal matter with him Behold I Paul he says I who have received the Gospel not from men but by the revelation of Jesus Christ I who have been commissioned from above to preach the Gospel to you I Paul say to you If you submit to circumcision Christ will profit you nothing Paul emphatically declares that for the Galatians to be circumcised would mean for them to lose the benefits of Christ s suffering and death This passage may well serve as a criterion for all the religions To teach that besides faith in Christ other devices like works or the observance of rules traditions or ceremonies are necessary for the attainment of righteousness and everlasting life is to make Christ and His salvation of no benefit to anybody This passage is an indictment of the whole papacy All priests monks and nuns and I am now speaking of the best of them who repose their hope for salvation in their own works and not in Christ whom they imagine to be an angry judge hear this sentence pronounced against them that Christ shall profit them nothing If one can earn the forgiveness of sins and everlasting life through one s own efforts to what purpose was Christ born What was the purpose of His suffering and death His resurrection His victory over sin death and the devil if men may overcome these evils by their own endeavor Tongue cannot express nor heart conceive what a terrible thing it is to make Christ worthless The person who is not moved by these considerations to leave the Law and the confidence in his own righteousness for the liberty in Christ has a heart that is harder than stone and iron Paul does not condemn circumcision in itself Circumcision is not injurious to the person who does not ascribe any particular importance to it Neither are works injurious provided a person does not attach any saving value to them The Apostle does not say that works are objectionable but to build one s hopes for righteousness on works is disastrous for that makes Christ good for nothing Let us bear this in mind when the devil accuses our conscience When that dragon accuses us of having done no good at all but only evil say to him You trouble me with the remembrance of my past sins you remind me that I have done no good But this does not bother me because if I were to trust in my own good deeds or despair because I have done no good deeds Christ would profit me neither way I am not going to make him unprofitable to me This I would do if I should presume to purchase for myself the favor of God and everlasting life by my good deeds or if I should despair of my salvation because of my sins VERSE three For I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law The first fault with circumcision is that it makes Christ unprofitable The second fault is that it obligates those who are circumcised to observe the whole Law Paul is so very much in earnest about this matter that he confirms it with an oath I testify he says I swear by the living God Paul s statement may be explained negatively to mean I testify to every man who is being circumcised that he cannot perform the Law in any point In the very act of circumcision he is not being circumcised and in the very act of fulfilling the Law he fulfills it not This seems to be the simple meaning of Paul s statement Later on in the sixth chapter he explicitly states They themselves which are circumcised keep not the law The fact that you are circumcised does not mean you are righteous and free from the Law The truth is that by circumcision you have become debtors and servants of the Law The more you endeavor to perform the Law the more you will become tangled up in the yoke of the Law The truth of this I have experienced in myself and in others I have seen many work themselves down to the bones in their hungry effort to obtain peace of conscience But the harder they tried the more they worried Especially in the presence of death they were so uneasy that I have seen murderers die with better grace and courage This holds true also in regard to the church regulations When I was a monk I tried ever so hard to live up to the strict rules of my order I used to make a list of my sins and I was always on the way to confession and whatever penances were enjoined upon me I performed religiously In spite of it all my conscience was always in a fever of doubt The more I sought to help my poor stricken conscience the worse it got The more I paid attention to the regulations the more I transgressed them Hence those that seek to be justified by the Law are much further away from the righteousness of life than the publicans sinners and harlots They know better than to trust in their own works They know that they cannot ever hope to obtain forgiveness by their sins Paul s statement in this verse may be taken to mean that those who submit to circumcision are thereby submitting to the whole Law To obey Moses in one point requires obedience to him in all points It does no good to say that only circumcision is necessary and not the rest of Moses laws The same reasons that obligate a person to accept circumcision also obligate a person to accept the whole Law Thus to acknowledge the Law is tantamount to declaring that Christ is not yet come And if Christ is not yet come then all the Jewish ceremonies and laws concerning meats places and times are still in force and Christ must be awaited as one who is still to come The whole Scripture however testifies that Christ has come that by His death He has abolished the Law and that He has fulfilled all things which the prophets have foretold about Him Some would like to subjugate us to certain parts of the Mosaic Law But this is not to be permitted under any circumstances If we permit Moses to rule over us in one thing we must obey him in all things VERSE four Christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace Paul in this verse discloses that he is not speaking so much of circumcision as the trust which men repose in the outward act We can hear him say I do not condemn the Law in itself what I condemn is that men seek to be justified by the Law as if Christ were still to come or as if He alone were unable to justify sinners It is this that I condemn because it makes Christ of no effect It makes you void of Christ so that Christ is not in you nor can you be partakers of the knowledge the spirit the fellowship the liberty the life or the achievements of Christ You are completely separated from Him so much so that He has nothing to do with you any more or for that matter you with Him Can anything worse be said against the Law If you think Christ and the Law can dwell together in your heart you may be sure that Christ dwells not in your heart For if Christ is in your heart He neither condemns you nor does He ever bid you to trust in your own good works If you know Christ at all you know that good works do not serve unto righteousness nor evil works unto condemnation I do not want to withhold from good works their due praise nor do I wish to encourage evil works But when it comes to justification I say we must concentrate upon Christ alone or else we make Him non effective You must choose between Christ and the righteousness of the Law If you choose Christ you are righteous before God If you stick to the Law Christ is of no use to you VERSE four Ye are fallen from grace That means you are no longer in the kingdom or condition of grace When a person on board ship falls into the sea and is drowned it makes no difference from which end or side of the ship he falls into the water Those who fall from grace perish no matter how they go about it Those who seek to be justified by the Law are fallen from grace and are in grave danger of eternal death If this holds true in the case of those who seek to be justified by the moral Law what will become of those I should like to know who endeavor to be justified by their own regulations and vows They will fall to the very bottom of hell Oh no they say we will fly straight into heaven If you live according to the rules of Saint Francis Saint Dominick Saint Benedict you will obtain the peace and mercy of God If you perform the vows of chastity obedience et cetera you will be rewarded with everlasting life Let these playthings of the devil go to the place where they came from and listen to what Paul has to say in this verse in accordance with Christ s own teaching He that believeth in the Son of God hath everlasting life but he that believeth not in the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth in him The words Ye are fallen from grace must not be taken lightly They are important To fall from grace means to lose the atonement the forgiveness of sins the righteousness liberty and life which Jesus has merited for us by His death and resurrection To lose the grace of God means to gain the wrath and judgment of God death the bondage of the devil and everlasting condemnation VERSE six For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith Paul concludes the whole matter with the above statement You want to be justified by the Law by circumcision and by works We cannot see it To be justified by such means would make Christ of no value to us We would be obliged to perform the whole law We rather through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness The Apostle is not satisfied to say justified by faith He adds hope to faith Holy Writ speaks of hope in two ways as the object of the emotion and hope as the emotion itself In the first chapter of the Epistle to the Colossians we have an instance of its first use For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven i e the thing hoped for In the sense of emotion we quote the passage from the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans For we are saved by hope As Paul uses the term hope here in writing to the Galatians we may take it in either of its two meanings We may understand Paul to say We wait in spirit through faith for the righteousness that we hope for which in due time will be revealed to us Or we may understand Paul to say We wait in Spirit by faith for righteousness with great hope and desire True we are righteous but our righteousness is not yet revealed as long as we live here sin stays with us not to forget the law in our members striving against the law of our mind When sin rages in our body and we through the Spirit wrestle against it then we have cause for hope We are not yet perfectly righteous Perfect righteousness is still to be attained Hence we hope for it This is sweet comfort for us And we are to make use of it in comforting the afflicted We are to say to them Brother you would like to feel God s favor as you feel your sin But you are asking too much Your righteousness rests on something much better than feelings Wait and hope until it will be revealed to you in the Lord s own time Don t go by your feelings but go by the doctrine of faith which pledges Christ to you The question occurs to us What difference is there between faith and hope We find it difficult to see any difference Faith and hope are so closely linked that they cannot be separated Still there is a difference between them First hope and faith differ in regard to their sources Faith originates in the understanding while hope rises in the will Secondly they differ in regard to their functions Faith says what is to be done Faith teaches describes directs Hope exhorts the mind to be strong and courageous Thirdly they differ in regard to their objectives Faith concentrates on the truth Hope looks to the goodness of God Fourthly they differ in sequence Faith is the beginning of life before tribulation Hebrews eleven Hope comes later and is born of tribulation Romans five Fifthly they differ in regard to their effects Faith is a judge It judges errors Hope is a soldier It fights against tribulations the Cross despondency despair and waits for better things to come in the midst of evil Without hope faith cannot endure On the other hand hope without faith is blind rashness and arrogance because it lacks knowledge Before anything else a Christian must have the insight of faith so that the intellect may know its directions in the day of trouble and the heart may hope for better things By faith we begin by hope we continue This passage contains excellent doctrine and much comfort It declares that we are justified not by works sacrifices or ceremonies but by Christ alone The world may judge certain things to be ever so good without Christ they are all wrong Circumcision and the law and good works are carnal We says Paul are above such things We possess Christ by faith and in the midst of our afflictions we hopefully wait for the consummation of our righteousness You may say The trouble is I don t feel as if I am righteous You must not feel but believe Unless you believe that you are righteous you do Christ a great wrong for He has cleansed you by the washing of regeneration He died for you so that through Him you may obtain righteousness and everlasting life VERSE six For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love Faith must of course be sincere It must be a faith that performs good works through love If faith lacks love it is not true faith Thus the Apostle bars the way of hypocrites to the kingdom of Christ on all sides He declares on the one hand In Christ Jesus circumcision availeth nothing i e works avail nothing but faith alone and that without any merit whatever avails before God On the other hand the Apostle declares that without fruits faith serves no purpose To think If faith justifies without works let us work nothing is to despise the grace of God Idle faith is not justifying faith In this terse manner Paul presents the whole life of a Christian Inwardly it consists in faith towards God outwardly in love towards our fellow men VERSE seven Ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth This is plain speaking Paul asserts that he teaches the same truth now which he has always taught and that the Galatians ran well as long as they obeyed the truth But now misled by the false apostles they no longer run He compares the Christian life to a race When everything runs along smoothly the Hebrews spoke of it as a race Ye did run well means that everything went along smoothly and happily with the Galatians They lived a Christian life and were on the right way to everlasting life The words Ye did run well are encouraging indeed Often our lives seem to creep rather than to run But if we abide in the true doctrine and walk in the spirit we have nothing to worry about God judges our lives differently What may seem to us a life slow in Christian development may seem to God a life of rapid progression in grace VERSE seven Who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth The Galatians were hindered in the Christian life when they turned from faith and grace to the Law Covertly the Apostle blames the false apostles for impeding the Christian progress of the Galatians The false apostles persuaded the Galatians to believe that they were in error and that they had made little or no progress under the influence of Paul Under the baneful influence of the false apostles the Galatians thought they were well off and advancing rapidly in Christian knowledge and living VERSE eight This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you Paul explains how those who had been deceived by false teachers may be restored to spiritual health The false apostles were amiable fellows Apparently they surpassed Paul in learning and godliness The Galatians were easily deceived by outward appearances They supposed they were being taught by Christ Himself Paul proved to them that their new doctrine was not of Christ but of the devil In this way he succeeded in regaining many We also are able to win back many from the errors into which they were seduced by showing that their beliefs are imaginary wicked and contrary to the Word of God The devil is a cunning persuader He knows how to enlarge the smallest sin into a mountain until we think we have committed the worst crime ever committed on earth Such stricken consciences must be comforted and set straight as Paul corrected the Galatians by showing them that their opinion is not of Christ because it runs counter to the Gospel which describes Christ as a meek and merciful Savior Satan will circumvent the Gospel and explain Christ in this his own diabolical way Indeed Christ is meek gentle and merciful but only to those who are holy and righteous If you are a sinner you stand no chance Did not Christ say that unbelievers are already damned And did not Christ perform many good deeds and suffer many evils patiently bidding us to follow His example You do not mean to say that your life is in accord with Christ s precepts or example You are a sinner You are no good at all Satan is to be answered in this way The Scriptures present Christ in a twofold aspect First as a gift He of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption I Cor one thirty Hence my many and grievous sins are nullified if I believe in Him Secondly the Scriptures present Christ for our example As an exemplar He is to be placed before me only at certain times In times of joy and gladness that I may have Him as a mirror to reflect upon my shortcomings But in the day of trouble I will have Christ only as a gift I will not listen to anything else except that Christ died for my sins To those that are cast down on account of their sins Christ must be introduced as a Savior and Gift and not as an example But to sinners who live in a false assurance Christ must be introduced as an example The hard sayings of Scripture and the awful judgments of God upon sin must be impressed upon them Defy Satan in times of despair Say O cursed Satan you choose a nice time to talk to me about doing and working when you know very well that I am in trouble over my sins I will not listen to you I will listen to Christ who says that He came into the world to save sinners This is the true Christ and there is none other I can find plenty of examples for a holy life in Abraham Isaiah John the Baptist Paul and other saints But they cannot forgive my sins They cannot save me They cannot procure for me everlasting life Therefore I will not have you for my teacher O Satan VERSE nine A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Paul s concern for them meant nothing to some of the Galatians Many had disowned him as their teacher and gone over to the false apostles No doubt the false apostles took every occasion to defame Paul as a stubborn and contemptuous fellow who thought nothing of disrupting the unity of the churches for no other reason than his selfish pride and jealousy Others of the Galatians perhaps saw no harm in deviating a trifle from the doctrine of justification and faith When they noticed that Paul made so much ado about a matter that seemed of no particular importance to them they raised their eyebrows and thought within themselves What if we did deviate a little from the doctrine of Paul What if we are a little to blame He ought to overlook the whole matter and not make such an issue out of it lest the unity of the churches be disturbed To this Paul replies A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Our opponents record the same complaints about us They put us down as contentious ill tempered faultfinders But these are the crafty passes of the devil with which he seeks to overthrow our faith We answer with Paul A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Small faults grow into big faults To tolerate a trifling error inevitably leads to crass heresy The doctrine of the Bible is not ours to take or to allow liberties with We have no right to change even a tittle of it When it comes to life we are ready to do to suffer to forgive anything our opponents demand as long as faith and doctrine remain pure and uncorrupt The Apostle James says For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all This passage supports us over against our critics who claim that we disregard all charity to the great injury of the churches We protest we desire nothing more than peace with all men If they would only permit us to keep our doctrine of faith The pure doctrine takes precedence before charity apostles or an angel from heaven Let others praise charity and concord to the skies we magnify the authority of the Word and faith Charity may be neglected at times without peril but not the Word and faith Charity suffers all things it gives in Faith suffers nothing it never yields Charity is often deceived but is never put out because it has nothing to lose it continues to do well even to the ungrateful When it comes to faith and salvation in the midst of lies and errors that parade as truth and deceive many charity has no voice or vote Let us not be influenced by the popular cry for charity and unity If we do not love God and His Word what difference does it make if we love anything at all Paul therefore admonishes both teachers and hearers not to esteem lightly the doctrine of faith as if it were a toy with which to amuse oneself in idle hours VERSE ten l have confidence in you through the Lord I have taught admonished and reproved you enough I hope the best for you The question occurs to us whether Paul did well to trust the Galatians Does not Holy Writ forbid us to trust in men Faith trusts in God and is never wrong Charity trusts in men and is often wrong This charitable trust in man is necessary to life Without it life would be impossible in the world What kind of life would ours be if nobody could trust anybody else True Christians are more ready to believe in men than the children of this world Such charitable confidence is the fruit of the Spirit Paul had such trust in the Galatians although they had forsaken his doctrine He trusts them through the Lord insofar as they were in Christ and Christ in them Once they had forsaken Christ altogether the Apostle will trust the Galatians no longer VERSE ten That ye will be none otherwise minded Not minded otherwise than I have taught you In other words I have confidence that you will accept no doctrine that is contrary to the one you have learned from me VERSE ten But he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be Paul assumes the role of a judge and condemns the false apostles as troublers of the Galatians He wants to frighten the Galatians with his severe judgments of the false apostles into avoiding false doctrine like a contagious disease We can hear him say to the Galatians Why do you give these pestilent fellows a hearing in the first place They only trouble you The doctrine they bring causes your conscience only trouble The clause whosoever he be seems to indicate that the false apostles in outward appearance at least were very good and devout men It may be that among them was some outstanding disciple of the apostles a man of fame and authority The Apostle must have been faced by this very situation otherwise his vehemence would have been uncalled for No doubt many of the Galatians were taken back with the vehemency of the Apostle They perhaps thought why should he be so stubborn in such small matters Why is he so quick to pronounce damnation upon his brethren in the ministry I cannot say it often enough that we must carefully differentiate between doctrine and life Doctrine is a piece of heaven life is a piece of earth Life is sin error uncleanness misery and charity must forbear believe hope and suffer all things Forgiveness of sins must be continuous so that sin and error may not be defended and sustained But with doctrine there must be no error no need of pardon There can be no comparison between doctrine and life The least little point of doctrine is of greater importance than heaven and earth Therefore we cannot allow the least jot of doctrine to be corrupted We may overlook the offenses and errors of life for we daily sin much Even the saints sin as they themselves confess in the Lord s Prayer and in the Creed But our doctrine God be praised is pure because all the articles of our faith are grounded on the Holy Scriptures VERSE eleven And I brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do I yet suffer persecution then is the offense of the cross ceased In his great desire to recall the Galatians Paul draws himself into the argument He says Because I refuse to recognize circumcision as a factor in our salvation I have brought upon myself the hatred and persecution of my whole nation If I were to acknowledge circumcision the Jews would cease to persecute me in fact they would love and praise me But because I preach the Gospel of Christ and the righteousness of faith I must suffer persecution The false apostles know how to avoid the Cross and the deadly hatred of the Jewish nation They preach circumcision and thus retain the favor of the Jews If they had their way they would ignore all differences in doctrine and preserve unity at all cost But their unionistic dreams cannot be realized without loss to the pure doctrine of the Cross It would be too bad if the offense of the Cross were to cease To the Corinthians he expressed the same conviction Christ sent me to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect I Cor one seventeen Here someone may be tempted to call the Christians crazy Deliberately to court danger by preaching and confessing the truth and thus to bring upon ourselves the hatred and enmity of the whole world is this not madness But Paul does not mind the enmity of the world It made him all the bolder to confess Christ The enmity of the world in his estimation augurs well for the success and growth of the Church which fares best in times of persecution When the offense of the Cross ceases when the rage of the enemies of the Cross abates when everything is quiet it is a sign that the devil is the door keeper of the Church and that the pure doctrine of God s Word has been lost Saint Bernard observed that the Church is in best shape when Satan assaults it on every side by trickery and violence and in worst shape when it is at peace In support of his statement he quotes the passage from the song of Hezekiah Behold for peace I had great bitterness Paul looks with suspicion upon any doctrine that does not provoke antagonism Persecution always follows on the heels of the Word of God as the Psalmist experienced I believe therefore have I spoken I was greatly afflicted Ps one hundred sixteen ten The Christians are accused and slandered without mercy Murderers and thieves receive better treatment than Christians The world regards true Christians as the worst offenders for whom no punishment can be too severe The world hates the Christians with amazing brutality and without compunction commits them to the most shameful death congratulating itself that it has rendered God and the cause of peace a distinct service by ridding the world of the undesired presence of these Christians We are not to let such treatment cause us to falter in our adherence to Christ As long as we experience such persecutions we know all is well with the Gospel Jesus held out the same comfort to His disciples in the fifth chapter of saint Matthew Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven The Church must not come short of this joy I would not want to be at peace with the pope the bishops the princes and the sectarians unless they consent to our doctrine Unity with them would be an unmistakable sign that we have lost the true doctrine Briefly as long as the Church proclaims the doctrine she must suffer persecution because the Gospel declares the mercy and glory of God This in turn stirs up the devil because the Gospel shows him up for what he is the devil and not God Therefore as long as the Gospel holds sway persecution plays the accompaniment or else there is something the matter with the devil When he is hit you will know it by the havoc he raises everywhere So do not be surprised or offended when hell breaks loose Look upon it as a happy indication that all is well with the Gospel of the Cross God forbid that the offense of the Cross should ever be removed This would be the case if we were to preach what the prince of this world and his followers would be only too glad to hear the righteousness of works You would never know the devil could be so gentle the world so sweet the Pope so gracious and the princes so charming But because we seek the advantage and honor of Christ they persecute us all around VERSE twelve I would they were even cut off which trouble you It hardly seems befitting an apostle not only to denounce the false apostles as troublers of the Church and to consign them to the devil but also to wish that they were utterly cut off what else would you call it but plain cursing Paul I suppose is alluding to the rite of circumcision As if he were saying to the Galatians The false apostles compel you to cut off the foreskin of your flesh Well I wish they themselves were utterly cut off by the roots We had better answer at once the question whether it is right for Christians to curse Certainly not always nor for every little cause But when things have come to such a pass that God and His Word are openly blasphemed then we must say Blessed be God and His Word and cursed be everything that is contrary to God and His Word even though it should be an apostle or an angel from heaven This goes to show again how much importance Paul attached to the least points of Christian doctrine that he dared to curse the false apostles evidently men of great popularity and influence What right then have we to make little of doctrine No matter how nonessential a point of doctrine may seem if slighted it may prove the gradual disintegration of the truths of our salvation Let us do everything to advance the glory and authority of God s Word Every tittle of it is greater than heaven and earth Christian charity and unity have nothing to do with the Word of God We are bold to curse and condemn all men who in the least point corrupt the Word of God for a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump Paul does right to curse these troublers of the Galatians wishing that they were cut off and rooted out of the Church of God and that their doctrine might perish forever Such cursing is the gift of the Holy Ghost Thus Peter cursed Simon the sorcerer Thy money perish with thee Many instances of this holy cursing are recorded in the sacred Scriptures especially in the Psalms e g Let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell Ps fifty five fifteen THE DOCTRINE OF GOOD WORKS Now come all kinds of admonitions and precepts It was the custom of the apostles that after they had taught faith and instructed the conscience they followed it up with admonitions unto good works that the believers might manifest the duties of love toward each other In order to avoid the appearance as if Christianity militated against good works or opposed civil government the Apostle also urges us to give ourselves unto good works to lead an honest life and to keep faith and love with one another This will give the lie to the accusations of the world that we Christians are the enemies of decency and of public peace The fact is we Christians know better what constitutes a truly good work than all the philosophers and legislators of the world because we link believing with doing VERSE thirteen For brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another In other words You have gained liberty through Christ i e You are above all laws as far as conscience is concerned You are saved Christ is your liberty and life Therefore law sin and death may not hurt you or drive you to despair This is the constitution of your priceless liberty Now take care that you do not use your wonderful liberty for an occasion of the flesh Satan likes to turn this liberty which Christ has gotten for us into licentiousness Already the Apostle Jude complained in his day There are certain men crept in unawares turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness Jude four The flesh reasons If we are without the law we may as well indulge ourselves Why do good why give alms why suffer evil when there is no law to force us to do so This attitude is common enough People talk about Christian liberty and then go and cater to the desires of covetousness pleasure pride envy and other vices Nobody wants to fulfill his duties Nobody wants to help out a brother in distress This sort of thing makes me so impatient at times that I wish the swine who trampled precious pearls under foot were back once again under the tyranny of the Pope You cannot wake up the people of Gomorrah with the gospel of peace Even we creatures of the world do not perform our duties as zealously in the light of the Gospel as we did before in the darkness of ignorance because the surer we are of the liberty purchased for us by Christ the more we neglect the Word prayer well doing and suffering If Satan were not continually molesting us with trials with the persecution of our enemies and the ingratitude of our brethren we would become so careless and indifferent to all good works that in time we would lose our faith in Christ resign the ministry of the Word and look for an easier life Many of our ministers are beginning to do that very thing They complain about the ministry they maintain they cannot live on their salaries they whimper about the miserable treatment they receive at the hand of those whom they delivered from the servitude of the law by the preaching of the Gospel These ministers desert our poor and maligned Christ involve themselves in the affairs of the world seek advantages for themselves and not for Christ With what results they shall presently find out Since the devil lies in ambush for those in particular who hate the world and seeks to deprive us of our liberty of the spirit or to brutalize it into the liberty of the flesh we plead with our brethren after the manner of Paul that they may never use this liberty of the spirit purchased for us by Christ as an excuse for carnal living or as Peter expresses it I Peter two sixteen for a cloak of maliciousness In order that Christians may not abuse their liberty the Apostle encumbers them with the rule of mutual love that they should serve each other in love Let everybody perform the duties of his station and vocation diligently and help his neighbor to the limit of his capacity Christians are glad to hear and obey this teaching of love When others hear about this Christian liberty of ours they at once infer If I am free I may do what I like If salvation is not a matter of doing why should we do anything for the poor In this crude manner they turn the liberty of the spirit into wantonness and licentiousness We want them to know however that if they use their lives and possessions after their own pleasure if they do not help the poor if they cheat their fellow men in business and snatch and scrape by hook and by crook everything they can lay their hands on we want to tell them that they are not free no matter how much they think they are but they are the dirty slaves of the devil and are seven times worse than they ever were as the slaves of the Pope As for us we are obliged to preach the Gospel which offers to all men liberty from the Law sin death and God s wrath We have no right to conceal or revoke this liberty proclaimed by the Gospel And so we cannot do anything with the swine who dive headlong into the filth of licentiousness We do what we can we diligently admonish them to love and to help their fellow men If our admonitions bear no fruit we leave them to God who will in His own good time take care of these disrespecters of His goodness In the meanwhile we comfort ourselves with the thought that our labors are not lost upon the true believers They appreciate this spiritual liberty and stand ready to serve others in love and though their number is small the satisfaction they give us far outweighs the discouragement which we receive at the hands of the large number of those who misuse this liberty Paul cannot possibly be misunderstood for he says Brethren ye have been called unto liberty In order that nobody might mistake the liberty of which he speaks for the liberty of the flesh the Apostle adds the explanatory note only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another Paul now explains at the hand of the Ten Commandments what it means to serve one another in love VERSE fourteen For all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself It is customary with Paul to lay the doctrinal foundation first and then to build on it the gold silver and gems of good deeds Now there is no other foundation than Jesus Christ Upon this foundation the Apostle erects the structure of good works which he defines in this one sentence Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself In adding such precepts of love the Apostle embarrasses the false apostles very much as if he were saying to the Galatians I have described to you what spiritual life is Now I will also teach you what truly good works are I am doing this in order that you may understand that the silly ceremonies of which the false apostles make so much are far inferior to the works of Christian love This is the hall mark of all false teachers that they not only pervert the pure doctrine but also fail in doing good Their foundation vitiated they can only build wood hay and stubble Oddly enough the false apostles who were such earnest champions of good works never required the work of charity such as Christian love and the practical charity of a helpful tongue hand and heart Their only requirement was that circumcision days months years and times should be observed They could not think of any other good works The Apostle exhorts all Christians to practice good works after they have embraced the pure doctrine of faith because even though they have been justified they still have the old flesh to refrain them from doing good Therefore it becomes necessary that sincere preachers cultivate the doctrine of good works as diligently as the doctrine of faith for Satan is a deadly enemy of both Nevertheless faith must come first because without faith it is impossible to know what a God pleasing deed is Let nobody think that he knows all about this commandment Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself It sounds short and easy but show me the man who can teach learn and do this commandment perfectly None of us heed or urge or practice this commandment properly Though the conscience hurts when we fail to fulfill this commandment in every respect we are not overwhelmed by our failure to bear our neighbor sincere and brotherly love The words for all the law is fulfilled in one word entail a criticism of the Galatians You are so taken up by your superstitions and ceremonies that serve no good purpose that you neglect the most important thing love saint Jerome says We wear our bodies out with watching fasting and labor and neglect charity the queen of all good works Look at the monks who meticulously fast watch et cetera To skip the least requirement of their order would be a crime of the first magnitude At the same time they blithely ignored the duties of charity and hated each other to death That is no sin they think The Old Testament is replete with examples that indicate how much God prizes charity When David and his companions had no food with which to still their hunger they ate the showbread which lay people were forbidden to eat Christ s disciples broke the Sabbath law when they plucked the ears of corn Christ himself broke the Sabbath as the Jews claimed by healing the sick on the Sabbath These incidents indicate that love ought to be given consideration above all laws and ceremonies VERSE fourteen For all the Law is fulfilled in one word We can imagine the Apostle saying to the Galatians Why do you get so worked up over ceremonies meats days places and such things Leave off this foolishness and listen to me The whole Law is comprehended in this one sentence Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself God is not particularly interested in ceremonies nor has He any use for them The one thing He requires of you is that you believe in Christ whom He hath sent If in addition to faith which comes first as the most acceptable service unto God you want to add laws then you want to know that all laws are comprehended in this short commandment Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself Paul knows how to explain the law of God He condenses all the laws of Moses into one brief sentence Reason takes offense at the brevity with which Paul treats the Law Therefore reason looks down upon the doctrine of faith and its truly good works To serve one another in love i e to instruct the erring to comfort the afflicted to raise the fallen to help one s neighbor in every possible way to bear with his infirmities to endure hardships toil ingratitude in the Church and in the world and on the other hand to obey government to honor one s parents to be patient at home with a nagging wife and an unruly family these things are not at all regarded as good works The fact is they are such excellent works that the world cannot possibly estimate them at their true value It is tersely spoken Love thy neighbour as thyself But what more needs to be said You cannot find a better or nearer example than your own If you want to know how you ought to love your neighbor ask yourself how much you love yourself If you were to get into trouble or danger you would be glad to have the love and help of all men You do not need any book of instructions to teach you how to love your neighbor All you have to do is to look into your own heart and it will tell you how you ought to love your neighbor as yourself My neighbor is every person especially those who need my help as Christ explained in the tenth chapter of Luke Even if a person has done me some wrong or has hurt me in any way he is still a human being with flesh and blood As long as a person remains a human being so long is he to be an object of our love Paul therefore urges his Galatians and incidentally all believers to serve each other in love You Galatians do not have to accept circumcision If you are so anxious to do good works I will tell you in one word how you can fulfill all laws By love serve one another You will never lack people to whom you may do good The world is full of people who need your help VERSE fifteen But if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another When faith in Christ is overthrown peace and unity come to an end in the church Diverse opinions and dissensions about doctrine and life spring up and one member bites and devours the other i e they condemn each other until they are consumed To this the Scriptures and the experience of all times bear witness The many sects at present have come into being because one sect condemns the other When the unity of the spirit has been lost there can be no agreement in doctrine or life New errors must appear without measure and without end For the avoidance of discord Paul lays down the principle Let every person do his duty in the station of life into which God has called him No person is to vaunt himself above others or find fault with the efforts of others while lauding his own Let everybody serve in love It is not an easy matter to teach faith without works and still to require works Unless the ministers of Christ are wise in handling the mysteries of God and rightly divide the word faith and good works may easily be confused Both the doctrine of faith and the doctrine of good works must be diligently taught and yet in such a way that both the doctrines stay within their God given sphere If we only teach works as our opponents do we shall lose the faith If we only teach faith people will come to think that good works are superfluous VERSE sixteen This I say then Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh I have not forgotten what I told you about faith in the first part of my letter Because I exhort you to mutual love you are not to think that I have gone back on my teaching of justification by faith alone I am still of the same opinion To remove every possibility for misunderstanding I have added this explanatory note Walk in the Spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh With this verse Paul explains how he wants this sentence to be understood By love serve one another When I bid you to love one another this is what I mean and require Walk in the Spirit I know very well you will not fulfill the Law because you are sinners as long as you live Nevertheless you should endeavor to walk in the spirit i e fight against the flesh and follow the lead of the Holy Ghost It is quite apparent that Paul had not forgotten the doctrine of justification for in bidding the Galatians to walk in the Spirit he at the same time denies that good works can justify When I speak of the fulfilling of the Law I do not mean to say that you are justified by the Law All I mean to say is that you should take the Spirit for your guide and resist the flesh That is the most you shall ever be able to do Obey the Spirit and fight against the flesh VERSE sixteen And ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh The lust of the flesh is not altogether extinct in us It rises up again and again and wrestles with the Spirit No flesh not even that of the true believer is so completely under the influence of the Spirit that it will not bite or devour or at least neglect the commandment of love At the slightest provocation it flares up demands to be revenged and hates a neighbor like an enemy or at least does not love him as much as he ought to be loved Therefore the Apostle establishes this rule of love for the believers Serve one another in love Bear the infirmities of your brother Forgive one another Without such bearing and forbearing giving and forgiving there can be no unity because to give and to take offense are unavoidably human Whenever you are angry with your brother for any cause repress your violent emotions through the Spirit Bear with his weakness and love him He does not cease to be your neighbor or brother because he offended you On the contrary he now more than ever before requires your loving attention The scholastics take the lust of the flesh to mean carnal lust True believers too are tempted with carnal lust Even the married are not immune to carnal lusts Men set little value upon that which they have and covet what they have not as the poet says The things most forbidden we always desire And things most denied we seek to acquire I do not deny that the lust of the flesh includes carnal lust But it takes in more It takes in all the corrupt desires with which the believers are more or less infected as pride hatred covetousness impatience Later on Paul enumerates among the works of the flesh even idolatry and heresy The apostle s meaning is clear I want you to love one another But you do not do it In fact you cannot do it because of your flesh Hence we cannot be justified by deeds of love Do not for a moment think that I am reversing myself on my stand concerning faith Faith and hope must continue By faith we are justified by hope we endure to the end In addition we serve each other in love because true faith is not idle Our love however is faulty In bidding you to walk in the Spirit I indicate to you that our love is not sufficient to justify us Neither do I demand that you should get rid of the flesh but that you should control and subdue it VERSE seventeen For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh When Paul declares that the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh he means to say that we are not to think speak or do the things to which the flesh incites us I know he says that the flesh courts sin The thing for you to do is to resist the flesh by the Spirit But if you abandon the leadership of the Spirit for that of the flesh you are going to fulfill the lust of the flesh and die in your sins VERSE seventeen And these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would These two leaders the flesh and the Spirit are bitter opponents Of this opposition the Apostle writes in the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into the captivity to the law of sin which is in my members O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death The scholastics are at a loss to understand this confession of Paul and feel obliged to save his honor That the chosen vessel of Christ should have had the law of sin in his members seems to them incredible and absurd They circumvent the plain spoken statement of the Apostle by saying that he was speaking for the wicked But the wicked never complain of inner conflicts or of the captivity of sin Sin has its unrestricted way with them This is Paul s very own complaint and the identical complaint of all believers Paul never denied that he felt the lust of the flesh It is likely that at times he felt even the stirrings of carnal lust but there is no doubt that he quickly suppressed them And if at any time he felt angry or impatient he resisted these feelings by the Spirit We are not going to stand by idly and see such a comforting statement as this explained away The scholastics monks and others of their ilk fought only against carnal lust and were proud of a victory which they never obtained In the meanwhile they harbored within their breasts pride hatred disdain self trust contempt of the Word of God disloyalty blasphemy and other lusts of the flesh Against these sins they never fought because they never took them for sins Christ alone can supply us with perfect righteousness Therefore we must always believe and always hope in Christ Whosoever believeth shall not be ashamed Rom nine thirty three Do not despair if you feel the flesh battling against the Spirit or if you cannot make it behave For you to follow the guidance of the Spirit in all things without interference on the part of the flesh is impossible You are doing all you can if you resist the flesh and do not fulfill its demands When I was a monk I thought I was lost forever whenever I felt an evil emotion carnal lust wrath hatred or envy I tried to quiet my conscience in many ways but it did not work because lust would always come back and give me no rest I told myself You have permitted this and that sin envy impatience and the like Your joining this holy order has been in vain and all your good works are good for nothing If at that time I had understood this passage The flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh I could have spared myself many a day of self torment I would have said to myself Martin you will never be without sin for you have flesh Despair not but resist the flesh I remember how Doctor Staupitz used to say to me I have promised God a thousand times that I would become a better man but I never kept my promise From now on I am not going to make any more vows Experience has taught me that I cannot keep them Unless God is merciful to me for Christ s sake and grants unto me a blessed departure I shall not be able to stand before Him His was a God pleasing despair No true believer trusts in his own righteousness but says with David Enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified Ps one hundred forty three two Again If thou Lord shouldest mark iniquities O Lord who shall stand Ps one hundred thirty three No man is to despair of salvation just because he is aware of the lust of the flesh Let him be aware of it so long as he does not yield to it The passion of lust wrath and other vices may shake him but they are not to get him down Sin may assail him but he is not to welcome it Yes the better Christian a man is the more he will experience the heat of the conflict This explains the many expressions of regret in the Psalms and in the entire Bible Everybody is to determine his peculiar weakness and guard against it Watch and wrestle in spirit against your weakness Even if you cannot completely overcome it at least you ought to fight against it According to this description a saint is not one who is made of wood and never feels any lusts or desires of the flesh A true saint confesses his righteousness and prays that his sins may be forgiven The whole Church prays for the forgiveness of sins and confesses that it believes in the forgiveness of sins If our antagonists would read the Scriptures they would soon discover that they cannot judge rightly of anything either of sin or of holiness VERSE eighteen But if ye be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law Here someone may object How come we are not under the law You yourself say Paul that we have the flesh which wars against the Spirit and brings us into subjection But Paul says not to let it trouble us As long as we are led by the Spirit and are willing to obey the Spirit who resists the flesh we are not under the Law True believers are not under the Law The Law cannot condemn them although they feel sin and confess it Great then is the power of the Spirit Led by the Spirit the Law cannot condemn the believer though he commits real sin For Christ in whom we believe is our righteousness He is without sin and the Law cannot accuse Him As long as we cling to Him we are led by the Spirit and are free from the Law Even as he teaches good works the Apostle does not lose sight of the doctrine of justification but shows at every turn that it is impossible for us to be justified by works The words If ye be led of the Spirit ye are not under the law are replete with comfort It happens at times that anger hatred impatience carnal desire fear sorrow or some other lust of the flesh so overwhelms a man that he cannot shake them off though he try ever so hard What should he do Should he despair God forbid Let him say to himself My flesh seems to be on a warpath against the Spirit again Go to it flesh and rage all you want to But you are not going to have your way I follow the leading of the Spirit When the flesh begins to cut up the only remedy is to take the sword of the Spirit the word of salvation and fight against the flesh If you set the Word out of sight you are helpless against the flesh I know this to be a fact I have been assailed by many violent passions but as soon as I took hold of some Scripture passage my temptations left me Without the Word I could not have helped myself against the flesh VERSE nineteen Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these Paul is saying That none of you may hide behind the plea of ignorance I will enumerate first the works of the flesh and then also the works of the Spirit There were many hypocrites among the Galatians as there are also among us who pretend to be Christians and talk much about the Spirit but they walk not according to the Spirit rather according to the flesh Paul is out to show them that they are not as holy as they like to have others think they are Every period of life has its own peculiar temptations Not one true believer whom the flesh does not again and again incite to impatience anger pride But it is one thing to be tempted by the flesh and another thing to yield to the flesh to do its bidding without fear or remorse and to continue in sin Christians also fall and perform the lusts of the flesh David fell horribly into adultery Peter also fell grievously when he denied Christ However great these sins were they were not committed to spite God but from weakness When their sins were brought to their attention these men did not obstinately continue in their sin but repented Those who sin through weakness are not denied pardon as long as they rise again and cease to sin There is nothing worse than to continue in sin If they do not repent but obstinately continue to fulfill the desires of the flesh it is a sure sign that they are not sincere No person is free from temptations Some are tempted in one way others in another way One person is more easily tempted to bitterness and sorrow of spirit blasphemy distrust and despair Another is more easily tempted to carnal lust anger envy covetousness But no matter to which sins we are disposed we are to walk in the Spirit and resist the flesh Those who are Christ s own crucify their flesh Some of the old saints labored so hard to attain perfection that they lost the capacity to feel anything When I was a monk I often wished I could see a saint I pictured him as living in the wilderness abstaining from meat and drink and living on roots and herbs and cold water This weird conception of those awesome saints I had gained out of the books of the scholastics and church fathers But we know now from the Scriptures who the true saints are Not those who live a single life or make a fetish of days meats clothes and such things The true saints are those who believe that they are justified by the death of Christ Whenever Paul writes to the Christians here and there he calls them the holy children and heirs of God All who believe in Christ whether male or female bond or free are saints not in view of their own works but in view of the merits of God which they appropriate by faith Their holiness is a gift and not their own personal achievement Ministers of the Gospel public officials parents children masters servants et cetera are true saints when they take Christ for their wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption and when they fulfill the duties of their several vocations according to the standard of God s Word and repress the lust and desires of the flesh by the Spirit Not everybody can resist temptations with equal facility Imperfections are bound to show up But this does not prevent them from being holy Their unintentional lapses are forgiven if they pull themselves together by faith in Christ God forbid that we should sit in hasty judgment on those who are weak in faith and life as long as they love the Word of God and make use of the supper of the Lord I thank God that He has permitted me to see what as a monk I so earnestly desired to see not one but many saints whole multitudes of true saints Not the kind of saints the papists admire but the kind of saints Christ wants I am sure I am one of Christ s true saints I am baptized I believe that Christ my Lord has redeemed me from all my sins and invested me with His own eternal righteousness and holiness To hide in caves and dens to have a bony body to wear the hair long in the mistaken idea that such departures from normalcy will obtain some special regard in heaven is not the holy life A holy life is to be baptized and to believe in Christ and to subdue the flesh with the Spirit To feel the lusts of the flesh is not without profit to us It prevents us from being vain and from being puffed up with the wicked opinion of our own work righteousness The monks were so inflated with the opinion of their own righteousness they thought they had so much holiness that they could afford to sell some of it to others although their own hearts convinced them of unholiness The Christian feels the unholy condition of his heart and it makes him feel so low that he cannot trust in his good works He therefore goes to Christ to find perfect righteousness This keeps a Christian humble VERSES nineteen twenty Now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft Paul does not enumerate all the works of the flesh but only certain ones First he mentions various kinds of carnal lusts as adultery fornication wantonness et cetera But carnal lust is not the only work of the flesh and so he counts among the works of the flesh also idolatry witchcraft hatred and the like These terms are so familiar that they do not require lengthy explanations IDOLATRY The best religion the most fervent devotion without Christ is plain idolatry It has been considered a holy act when the monks in their cells meditate upon God and His works and in a religious frenzy kneel down to pray and to weep for joy Yet Paul calls it simply idolatry Every religion which worships God in ignorance or neglect of His Word and will is idolatry They may think about God Christ and heavenly things but they do it after their own fashion and not after the Word of God They have an idea that their clothing their mode of living and their conduct are holy and pleasing to Christ They not only expect to pacify Christ by the strictness of their life but also expect to be rewarded by Him for their good deeds Hence their best spiritual thoughts are wicked thoughts Any worship of God any religion without Christ is idolatry In Christ alone is God well pleased I have said before that the works of the flesh are manifest But idolatry puts on such a good front and acts so spiritual that the sham of it is recognized only by true believers WITCHCRAFT This sin was very common before the light of the Gospel appeared When I was a child there were many witches and sorcerers around who bewitched cattle and people particularly children and did much harm But now that the Gospel is here you do not hear so much about it because the Gospel drives the devil away Now he bewitches people in a worse way with spiritual sorcery Witchcraft is a brand of idolatry As witches used to bewitch cattle and men so idolaters i e all the self righteous go around to bewitch God and to make Him out as one who justifies men not by grace through faith in Christ but by the works of men s own choosing They bewitch and deceive themselves If they continue in their wicked thoughts of God they will die in their idolatry SECTS Under sects Paul here understands heresies Heresies have always been found in the church What unity of faith can exist among all the different monks and the different orders None whatever There is no unity of spirit no agreement of minds but great dissension in the papacy There is no conformity in doctrine faith and life On the other hand among evangelical Christians the Word faith religion sacraments service Christ God heart and mind are common to all This unity is not disturbed by outward differences of station or of occupation DRUNKENNESS GLUTTONY Paul does not say that eating and drinking are works of the flesh but intemperance in eating and drinking which is a common vice nowadays is a work of the flesh Those who are given to excess are to know that they are not spiritual but carnal Sentence is pronounced upon them that they shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven Paul desires that Christians avoid drunkenness and gluttony that they live temperate and sober lives in order that the body may not grow soft and sensual VERSE twenty one Of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in the past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God This is a hard saying but very necessary for those false Christians and hypocrites who speak much about the Gospel about faith and the Spirit yet live after the flesh But this hard sentence is directed chiefly at the heretics who are large with their own self importance that they may be frightened into taking up the fight of the Spirit against the flesh VERSES twenty two twenty three But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance The Apostle does not speak of the works of the Spirit as he spoke of the works of the flesh but he attaches to these Christian virtues a better name He calls them the fruits of the Spirit LOVE It would have been enough to mention only the single fruit of love for love embraces all the fruits of the Spirit In I Corinthians thirteen Paul attributes to love all the fruits of the Spirit Charity suffereth long and is kind et cetera Here he lets love stand by itself among other fruits of the Spirit to remind the Christians to love one another in honor preferring one another to esteem others more than themselves because they have Christ and the Holy Ghost within them JOY Joy means sweet thoughts of Christ melodious hymns and psalms praises and thanksgiving with which Christians instruct inspire and refresh themselves God does not like doubt and dejection He hates dreary doctrine gloomy and melancholy thought God likes cheerful hearts He did not send His Son to fill us with sadness but to gladden our hearts For this reason the prophets apostles and Christ Himself urge yes command us to rejoice and be glad Rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion shout O daughter of Jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee Zech nine nine In the Psalms we are repeatedly told to be joyful in the Lord Paul says Rejoice in the Lord always Christ says Rejoice for your names are written in heaven PEACE Peace towards God and men Christians are to be peaceful and quiet Not argumentative not hateful but thoughtful and patient There can be no peace without longsuffering and therefore Paul lists this virtue next LONGSUFFERING Longsuffering is that quality which enables a person to bear adversity injury reproach and makes them patient to wait for the improvement of those who have done him wrong When the devil finds that he cannot overcome certain persons by force he tries to overcome them in the long run He knows that we are weak and cannot stand anything long Therefore he repeats his temptation time and again until he succeeds To withstand his continued assaults we must be longsuffering and patiently wait for the devil to get tired of his game GENTLENESS Gentleness in conduct and life True followers of the Gospel must not be sharp and bitter but gentle mild courteous and soft spoken which should encourage others to seek their company Gentleness can overlook other people s faults and cover them up Gentleness is always glad to give in to others Gentleness can get along with forward and difficult persons according to the old pagan saying You must know the manners of your friends but you must not hate them Such a gentle person was our Savior Jesus Christ as the Gospel portrays Him Of Peter it is recorded that he wept whenever he remembered the sweet gentleness of Christ in His daily contact with people Gentleness is an excellent virtue and very useful in every walk of life GOODNESS A person is good when he is willing to help others in their need FAITH In listing faith among the fruits of the Spirit Paul obviously does not mean faith in Christ but faith in men Such faith is not suspicious of people but believes the best Naturally the possessor of such faith will be deceived but he lets it pass He is ready to believe all men but he will not trust all men Where this virtue is lacking men are suspicious forward and wayward and will believe nothing nor yield to anybody No matter how well a person says or does anything they will find fault with it and if you do not humor them you can never please them It is quite impossible to get along with them Such faith in people therefore is quite necessary What kind of life would this be if one person could not believe another person MEEKNESS A person is meek when he is not quick to get angry Many things occur in daily life to provoke a person s anger but the Christian gets over his anger by meekness TEMPERANCE Christians are to lead sober and chaste lives They should not be adulterers fornicators or sensualists They should not be quarrelers or drunkards In the first and second chapters of the Epistle to Titus the Apostle admonishes bishops young women and married folks to be chaste and pure VERSE twenty three Against such there is no law There is a law of course but it does not apply to those who bear these fruits of the Spirit The Law is not given for the righteous man A true Christian conducts himself in such a way that he does not need any law to warn or to restrain him He obeys the Law without compulsion The Law does not concern him As far as he is concerned there would not have to be any Law VERSE twenty four And they that are Christ s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts True believers are no hypocrites They crucify the flesh with its evil desires and lusts Inasmuch as they have not altogether put off the sinful flesh they are inclined to sin They do not fear or love God as they should They are likely to be provoked to anger to envy to impatience to carnal lust and other emotions But they will not do the things to which the flesh incites them They crucify the flesh with its evil desires and lusts by fasting and exercise and above all by a walk in the Spirit To resist the flesh in this manner is to nail it to the Cross Although the flesh is still alive it cannot very well act upon its desires because it is bound and nailed to the Cross VERSE twenty five If we live in the Spirit let us also walk in the Spirit A little while ago the Apostle had condemned those who are envious and start heresies and schisms As if he had forgotten that he had already berated them the Apostle once more reproves those who provoke and envy others Was not one reference to them sufficient He repeats his admonition in order to emphasize the viciousness of pride that had caused all the trouble in the churches of Galatia and has always caused the Church of Christ no end of difficulties In his Epistle to Titus the Apostle states that a vainglorious man should not be ordained as a minister for pride as saint Augustine points out is the mother of all heresies Now vainglory has always been a common poison in the world There is no village too small to contain someone who wants to be considered wiser or better than the rest Those who have been bitten by pride usually stand upon the reputation for learning and wisdom Vainglory is not nearly so bad in a private person or even in an official as it is in a minister When the poison of vainglory gets into the Church you have no idea what havoc it can cause You may argue about knowledge art money countries and the like without doing particular harm But you cannot quarrel about salvation or damnation about eternal life and eternal death without grave damage to the Church No wonder Paul exhorts all ministers of the Word to guard against this poison He writes If we live in the Spirit Where the Spirit is men gain new attitudes Where formerly they were vainglorious spiteful and envious they now become humble gentle and patient Such men seek not their own glory but the glory of God They do not provoke each other to wrath or envy but prefer others to themselves As dangerous to the Church as this abominable pride is yet there is nothing more common The trouble with the ministers of Satan is that they look upon the ministry as a stepping stone to fame and glory and right there you have the seed for all sorts of dissensions Because Paul knew that the vainglory of the false Apostles had caused the churches of Galatia endless trouble he makes it his business to suppress this abominable vice In his absence the false apostles went to work in Galatia They pretended that they had been on intimate terms with the apostles while Paul had never seen Christ in person or had much contact with the rest of the apostles Because of this they delivered him rejected his doctrine and boosted their own In this way they troubled the Galatians and caused quarrels among them until they provoked and envied each other which goes to show that neither the false apostles nor the Galatians walked after the Spirit but after the flesh The Gospel is not there for us to aggrandize ourselves The Gospel is to aggrandize Christ and the mercy of God It holds out to men eternal gifts that are not gifts of our own manufacture What right have we to receive praise and glory for gifts that are not of our own making No wonder that God in His special grace subjects the ministers of the Gospel to all kinds of afflictions otherwise they could not cope with this ugly beast called vainglory If no persecution no cross or reproach trailed the doctrine of the Gospel but only praise and reputation the ministers of the Gospel would choke with pride Paul had the Spirit of Christ Nevertheless there was given unto him the messenger of Satan to buffet him in order that he should not come to exalt himself because of the grandeur of his revelations saint Augustine s opinion is well taken If a minister of the Gospel is praised he is in danger if he is despised he is also in danger The ministers of the Gospel should be men who are not too easily affected by praise or criticism but simply speak out the benefit and the glory of Christ and seek the salvation of souls Whenever you are being praised remember it is not you who is being praised but Christ to whom all praise belongs When you preach the Word of God in its purity and also live accordingly it is not your own doing but God s doing And when people praise you they really mean to praise God in you When you understand this and you should because what hast thou that thou didst not receive you will not flatter yourself on the one hand and on the other hand you will not carry yourself with the thought of resigning from the ministry when you are insulted reproached or persecuted It is really kind of God to send so much infamy reproach hatred and cursing our way to keep us from getting proud of the gifts of God in us We need a millstone around our neck to keep us humble There are a few on our side who love and revere us for the ministry of the Word but for every one of these there are a hundred on the other side who hate and persecute us The Lord is our glory Such gifts as we possess we acknowledge to be the gifts of God given to us for the good of the Church of Christ Therefore we are not proud because of them We know that more is required of them to whom much is given than of such to whom little is given We also know that God is no respecter of persons A plain factory hand who does his work faithfully pleases God just as much as a minister of the Word VERSE twenty six Let us not be desirous of vain glory To desire vainglory is to desire lies because when one person praises another he tells lies What is there in anybody to praise But it is different when the ministry is praised We should not only desire people to praise the ministry of the Gospel but also do our utmost to make the ministry worthy of praise because this will make the ministry more effective Paul warns the Romans not to bring Christianity into disrepute Let not then your good be evil spoken of Rom fourteen sixteen He also begged the Corinthians to give no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed I Cor six three When people praise our ministry they are not praising our persons but God VERSE twenty six Provoking one another envying one another Such is the ill effect of vainglory Those who teach errors provoke others When others disapprove and reject the doctrine the teachers of errors get angry in turn and then you have strife and trouble The sectarians hate us furiously because we will not approve their errors We did not attack them directly We merely called attention to certain abuses in the Church They did not like it and became sore at us because it hurt their pride They wish to be the lone rulers of the church CHAPTER six VERSE one Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness IF we carefully weigh the words of the Apostle we perceive that he does not speak of doctrinal faults and errors but of much lesser faults by which a person is overtaken through the weakness of his flesh This explains why the Apostle chooses the softer term fault To minimize the offense still more as if he meant to excuse it altogether and to take the whole blame away from the person who has committed the fault he speaks of him as having been overtaken seduced by the devil and of the flesh As if he meant to say What is more human than for a human being to fall to be deceived and to err This comforting sentence at one time saved my life Because Satan always assails both the purity of doctrine which he endeavors to take away by schisms and the purity of life which he spoils with his continual temptations to sin Paul explains how the fallen should be treated Those who are strong are to raise up the fallen in the spirit of meekness This ought to be borne in mind particularly by the ministers of the Word in order that they may not forget the parental attitude which Paul here requires of those who have the keeping of souls Pastors and ministers must of course rebuke the fallen but when they see that the fallen are sorry they are to comfort them by excusing the fault as well as they can As unyielding as the Holy Spirit is in the matter of maintaining and defending the doctrine of faith so mild and merciful is He toward men for their sins as long as sinners repent The Pope s synagogue teaches the exact opposite of what the Apostle commands The clerics are tyrants and butchers of men s conscience Every small offense is closely scrutinized To justify the cruel inquisitiveness they quote the statement of Pope Gregory It is the property of good lives to be afraid of a fault where there is no fault Our censors must be feared even if they are unjust and wrong On these pronouncements the papists base their doctrine of excommunication Rather than terrify and condemn men s consciences they ought to raise them up and comfort them with the truth Let the ministers of the Gospel learn from Paul how to deal with those who have sinned Brethren he says if any man be overtaken with a fault do not aggravate his grief do not scold him do not condemn him but lift him up and gently restore his faith If you see a brother despondent over a sin he has committed run up to him reach out your hand to him comfort him with the Gospel and embrace him like a mother When you meet a willful sinner who does not care go after him and rebuke him sharply But this is not the treatment for one who has been overtaken by a sin and is sorry He must be dealt with in the spirit of meekness and not in the spirit of severity A repentant sinner is not to be given gall and vinegar to drink VERSE one Considering thyself lest thou also be tempted This consideration is very much needed to put a stop to the severity of some pastors who show the fallen no mercy saint Augustine says There is no sin which one person has committed that another person may not commit it also We stand in slippery places If we become overbearing and neglect our duty it is easy enough to fall into sin In the book entitled The Lives of Our Fathers one of the Fathers is reported to have said when informed that a brother had fallen into adultery He fell yesterday I may fall today Paul therefore warns the pastors not to be too rigorous and unmerciful towards offenders but to show them every affection always remembering This man fell into sin I may fall into worse sin If those who are always so eager to condemn others would investigate themselves they would find that the sins of others are motes in comparison to their own Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall I Cor ten twelve If David who was a hero of faith and did so many great things for the Lord could fall so badly that in spite of his advanced age he was overcome by youthful lust after he had withstood so many different temptations with which the Lord had tested his faith who are we to think that we are more stable These object lessons of God should convince us that of all things God hates pride VERSE two Bear ye one another s burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ The Law of Christ is the Law of love Christ gave us no other law than this law of mutual love A new commandment I give unto you That ye love one another To love means to bear another s burdens Christians must have strong shoulders to bear the burdens of their fellow Christians Faithful pastors recognize many errors and offenses in the church which they oversee In civil affairs an official has to overlook much if he is fit to rule If we can overlook our own shortcomings and wrong doings we ought to overlook the shortcomings of others in accordance with the words Bear ye one another s burdens Those who fail to do so expose their lack of understanding of the law of Christ Love according to Paul believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things This commandment is not meant for those who deny Christ neither is it meant for those who continue to live in sin Only those who are willing to hear the Word of God and then inadvertently fall into sin to their own great sorrow and regret carry the burdens which the Apostle encourages us to bear Let us not be hard on them If Christ did not punish them what right have we to do it VERSE three For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself Again the Apostle takes the authors of sects to task for being hard hearted tyrants They despise the weak and demand that everything be just so Nothing suits them except what they do Unless you eulogize whatever they say or do unless you adapt yourself to their slightest whim they become angry with you They are that way because as saint Paul says they think themselves to be something they think they know all about the Scriptures Paul has their number when he calls them zeros They deceive themselves with their self suggested wisdom and holiness They have no understanding of Christ or the law of Christ By insisting that everything be perfect they not only fail to bear the burdens of the weak they actually offend the weak by their severity People begin to hate and shun them and refuse to accept counsel or comfort from them Paul describes these stiff and ungracious saints accurately when he says of them They think themselves to be something Bloated by their own silly ideas and schemes they entertain a pretty fair opinion of themselves when in reality they amount to nothing VERSE four But let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another In this verse the Apostle continues his attack upon the vainglorious sectarians Although this passage may be applied to any work the Apostle has in mind particularly the work of the ministry The trouble with these seekers after glory is that they never stop to consider whether their ministry is straightforward and faithful All they think about is whether people will like and praise them Theirs is a threefold sin First they are greedy of praise Secondly they are very sly and wily in suggesting that the ministry of other pastors is not what it should be By way of contrast they hope to rise in the estimation of the people Thirdly once they have established a reputation for themselves they become so chesty that they stop short of nothing When they have won the praise of men pride leads them on to belittle the work of other men and to applaud their own In this artful manner they hoodwink the people who rather enjoy to see their former pastors taken down a few notches by such upstarts Let a minister be faithful in his office is the apostolic injunction Let him not seek his own glory or look for praise Let him desire to do good work and to preach the Gospel in all its purity Whether an ungrateful world appreciates his efforts is to give him no concern because after all he is in the ministry not for his own glory but for the glory of Christ A faithful minister cares little what people think of him as long as his conscience approves of him The approval of his own good conscience is the best praise a minister can have To know that we have taught the Word of God and administered the sacraments rightly is to have a glory that cannot be taken away The glory which the sectarians seek is quite unstable because it rests in the whim of people If Paul had had to depend on this kind of glory for his ministry he would have despaired when he saw the many offenses and evils following in the wake of his preaching If we had to feel that the success of our ministry depended upon our popularity with men we would die because we are not popular On the contrary we are hated by the whole world with rare bitterness Nobody praises us Everybody finds fault with us But we can glory in the Lord and attend to our work cheerfully Who cares whether our efforts please or displease the devil Who cares whether the world praises or hates us We go ahead by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report II Cor six eight The Gospel entails persecution The Gospel is that kind of a doctrine Furthermore the disciples of the Gospel are not all dependable Many embrace the Gospel today and tomorrow discard it To preach the Gospel for praise is bad business especially when people stop praising you Find your praise in the testimony of a good conscience This passage may also be applied to other work besides the ministry When an official a servant a teacher minds his business and performs his duty faithfully without concerning himself about matters that are not in his line he may rejoice in himself The best commendation of any work is to know that one has done the work that God has given him well and that God is pleased with his effort VERSE five Every man shall bear his own burden That means For anybody to covet praise is foolish because the praise of men will be of no help to you in the hour of death Before the judgment throne of Christ everybody will have to bear his own burden As it is the praise of men stops when we die Before the eternal Judge it is not praise that counts but your own conscience True the consciousness of work well done cannot quiet the conscience But it is well to have the testimony of a good conscience in the last judgment that we have performed our duty faithfully in accordance with God s will For the suppression of pride we need the strength of prayer What man even if he is a Christian is not delighted with his own praise Only the Holy Spirit can preserve us from the misfortune of pride VERSE six Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things Now the Apostle also addresses the hearers of the Word requesting them to bestow all good things upon those who have taught them the Gospel I have often wondered why all the apostles reiterated this request with such embarrassing frequency In the papacy I saw the people give generously for the erection and maintenance of luxurious church buildings and for the sustenance of men appointed to the idolatrous service of Rome I saw bishops and priests grow rich until they possessed the choicest real estate I thought then that Paul s admonitions were overdone I thought he should have requested the people to curtail their contributions I saw how the generosity of the people of the Church was encouraging covetousness on the part of the clergy I know better now As often as I read the admonitions of the Apostle to the effect that the churches should support their pastors and raise funds for the relief of impoverished Christians I am half ashamed to think that the great Apostle Paul had to touch upon this subject so frequently In writing to the Corinthians he needed two chapters to impress this matter upon them I would not want to discredit Wittenberg as Paul discredited the Corinthians by urging them at such length to contribute to the relief of the poor It seems to be a by product of the Gospel that nobody wants to contribute to the maintenance of the Gospel ministry When the doctrine of the devil is preached people are prodigal in their willing support of those who deceive them We have come to understand why it is so necessary to repeat the admonition of this verse When Satan cannot suppress the preaching of the Gospel by force he tries to accomplish his purpose by striking the ministers of the Gospel with poverty He curtails their income to such an extent that they are forced out of the ministry because they cannot live by the Gospel Without ministers to proclaim the Word of God the people go wild like savage beasts Paul s admonition that the hearers of the Gospel share all good things with their pastors and teachers is certainly in order To the Corinthians he wrote If we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things I Cor nine eleven In the old days when the Pope reigned supreme everybody paid plenty for masses The begging friars brought in their share Commercial priests counted the daily offerings From these extortions our countrymen are now delivered by the Gospel You would think they would be grateful for their emancipation and give generously for the support of the ministry of the Gospel and the relief of impoverished Christians Instead they rob Christ When the members of a Christian congregation permit their pastor to struggle along in penury they are worse than heathen Before very long they are going to suffer for their ingratitude They will lose their temporal and spiritual possessions This sin merits the severest punishment The reason why the churches of Galatia Corinth and other places were troubled by false apostles was this that they had so little regard for their faithful ministers You cannot refuse to give a penny who gives you all good things even life eternal and turn around and give the devil the giver of all evil and death eternal pieces of gold and not be punished for it The words in all good things are not to be understood to mean that people are to give all they have to their ministers but that they should support them liberally and give them enough to live well VERSE seven Be not deceived God is not mocked The Apostle is so worked up over this matter that he is not content with a mere admonition He utters the threatening words God is not mocked Our countrymen think it good sport to despise the ministry They like to treat the ministers like servants and slaves Be not deceived warns the Apostle God is not mocked God will not be mocked in His ministers Christ said He that despiseth you despiseth me Luke ten sixteen To Samuel God said They have not rejected thee but they have rejected me I Sam eight seven Be careful you scoffers God may postpone His punishment for a time but He will find you out in time and punish you for despising His servants You cannot laugh at God Maybe the people are little impressed by the threats of God but in the hour of their death they shall know whom they have mocked God is not ever going to let His ministers starve When the rich suffer the pangs of hunger God will feed His own servants In the days of famine they shall be satisfied Ps thirty seven nineteen VERSE seven For whatever a man soweth that shall he also reap These passages are all meant to benefit us ministers I must say I do not find much pleasure in explaining these verses I am made to appear as if I am speaking for my own benefit If a minister preaches on money he is likely to be accused of covetousness Still people must be told these things that they may know their duty over against their pastors Our Savior says Eating and drinking such things as they give for the laborer is worthy of his hire Luke ten seven And Paul says elsewhere Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel I Cor nine thirteen fourteen VERSE eight For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap everlasting life This simile of sowing and reaping also refers to the proper support of ministers He that soweth to the Spirit i e he that honors the ministers of God is doing a spiritual thing and will reap everlasting life He that soweth to the flesh i e he that has nothing left for the ministers of God but only thinks of himself that person will reap of the flesh corruption not only in this life but also in the life to come The Apostle wants to stir up his readers to be generous to their pastors That the ministers of the Church need support any man with common sense can see Though this support is something physical the Apostle does not hesitate to call it sowing to the Spirit When people scrape up everything they can lay their hands on and keep everything for themselves the Apostle calls it a sowing to the flesh He pronounces those who sow to the Spirit blessed for this life and the life to come while those who sow to the flesh are accursed now and forever VERSE nine And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not The Apostle intends soon to close his Epistle and therefore repeats once more the general exhortation unto good deeds He means to say Let us do good not only to the ministers of the Gospel but to everybody and let us do it without weariness It is easy enough to do good once or twice but to keep on doing good without getting disgusted with the ingratitude of those whom we have benefited that is not so easy Therefore the Apostle does not only admonish us to do good but to do good untiringly For our encouragement he adds the promise For in due season we shall reap if we faint not Wait for the harvest and then you will reap the reward of your sowing to the Spirit Think of that when you do good and the ingratitude of men will not stop you from doing good VERSE ten As we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith In this verse the Apostle summarizes his instructions on the proper support of the ministers and of the poor He paraphrases the words of Christ I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work John nine four Our good deeds are to be directed primarily at those who share the Christian faith with us the household of faith as Paul calls them among whom the ministers rank first as objects of our well doing VERSE eleven Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand With these words the Apostle intends to draw the Galatians on I never he says wrote such a long letter with my own hand to any of the other churches His other epistles he dictated and only subscribed his greetings and his signature with his own hand VERSE twelve As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ Paul once more scores the false apostles in an effort to draw the Galatians away from their false doctrine The teachers you have now do not seek the glory of Christ and the salvation of your souls but only their own glory They avoid the Cross They do not understand what they teach These three counts against the false apostles are of so serious a nature that no Christian could have fellowship with them But not all the Galatians obeyed the warning of Paul The Apostle s attack upon the false apostles was not unjustified Neither are our attacks upon the papacy When we call the Pope the Antichrist and his minions an evil brood we do not slander them We merely judge them by the touchstone of God s Word recorded in the first chapter of this Epistle Though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed VERSE thirteen For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh In other words I shall tell you what kind of teachers you have now They avoid the Cross they teach no certain truths They think they are performing the Law but they are not They have not the Holy Spirit and without Him nobody can keep the Law Where the Holy Ghost does not dwell in men there dwells an unclean spirit a spirit that despises God and turns every effort at keeping the Law into a double sin Mark what the Apostle is saying Those who are circumcised do not fulfill the Law No self righteous person ever does To work pray or suffer apart from Christ is to work pray and to suffer in vain for whatsoever is not of faith is sin It does a person no good to be circumcised to fast to pray or to do anything if in his heart he despises Christ Why do the false apostles insist that you should be circumcised Not for the sake of your righteousness although they give that impression but that they may glory in your flesh Now what sort of an ambition is that Worst of all they force circumcision upon you for no other reason than the satisfaction they get out of your submission VERSE fourteen But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ God forbid says the Apostle that I should glory in anything as dangerous as the false apostles glory in because what they glory in is a poison that destroys many souls and I wish it were buried in hell Let them glory in the flesh if they wish and let them perish in their glory As for me I glory in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ He expresses the same sentiment in the fifth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans where he says We glory in tribulations and in the twelfth chapter of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians Most gladly therefore will l rather glory in my infirmities According to these expressions the glory of a Christian consists in tribulations reproaches and infirmities And this is our glory today with the Pope and the whole world persecuting us and trying to kill us We know that we suffer these things not because we are thieves and murderers but for Christ s sake whose Gospel we proclaim We have no reason to complain The world of course looks upon us as unhappy and accursed creatures but Christ for whose sake we suffer pronounces us blessed and bids us to rejoice Blessed are ye says He when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake Rejoice and be exceeding glad Matt five eleven twelve By the Cross of Christ is not to be understood here the two pieces of wood to which He was nailed but all the afflictions of the believers whose sufferings are Christ s sufferings Elsewhere Paul writes Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body s sake which is the church colonel one twenty four It is good for us to know this lest we sink into despair when our opponents persecute us Let us bear the cross for Christ s sake It will ease our sufferings and make them light as Christ says Matthew eleven thirty My yoke is easy and my burden is light VERSE fourteen By whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world The world is crucified unto me means that I condemn the world I am crucified unto the world means that the world in turn condemns me I detest the doctrine the self righteousness and the works of the world The world in turn detests my doctrine and condemns me as a revolutionary heretic Thus the world is crucified unto us and we unto the world The monks imagined the world was crucified unto them when they entered the monastery Not the world but Christ is crucified in the monasteries In this verse Paul expresses his hatred of the world The hatred was mutual As Paul so we are to despise the world and the devil With Christ on our side we can defy him and say Satan the more you hurt me the more I oppose you VERSE fifteen For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature Since circumcision and uncircumcision are contrary matters we would expect the Apostle to say that one or the other might accomplish some good But he denies that either of them do any good Both are of no value because in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avail anything Reason fails to understand this for the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God I Cor two fourteen It therefore seeks righteousness in externals However we learn from the Word of God that there is nothing under the sun that can make us righteous before God and a new creature except Christ Jesus A new creature is one in whom the image of God has been renewed Such a creature cannot be brought into life by good works but by Christ alone Good works may improve the outward appearance but they cannot produce a new creature A new creature is the work of the Holy Ghost who imbues our hearts with faith love and other Christian virtues grants us the strength to subdue the flesh and to reject the righteousness of the world VERSE sixteen And as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy This is the rule by which we ought to live that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness Eph four twenty four Those who walk after this rule enjoy the favor of God the forgiveness of their sins and peace of conscience Should they ever be overtaken by any sin the mercy of God supports them VERSE seventeen From henceforth let no man trouble me The Apostle speaks these words with a certain amount of indignation I have preached the Gospel to you in conformity with the revelation which I received from Jesus Christ If you do not care for it very well Trouble me no more Trouble me no more VERSE seventeen For I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus The marks on my body indicate whose servant I am If I was anxious to please men if I approved of circumcision and good works as factors in our salvation if I would take delight in your flesh as the false apostles do I would not have these marks on my body But because I am the servant of Jesus Christ and publicly declare that no person can obtain the salvation of his soul outside of Christ I must bear the badge of my Lord These marks were given to me against my will as decorations from the devil and for no other merit but that I made known Jesus Of the marks of suffering which he bore in his body the Apostle makes frequent mention in his epistles I think he says that God hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men I Cor four nine Again Unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place And labour working with our hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day I Cor four eleven thirteen VERSE eighteen Brethren the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit Amen This is the Apostle s farewell He ends his Epistle as he began it by wishing the Galatians the grace of God We can hear him say I have presented Christ to you I have pleaded with you I have reproved you I have overlooked nothing that I thought might be of benefit to you All I can do now is to pray that our Lord Jesus Christ would bless my Epistle and grant you the guidance of the Holy Ghost The Lord Jesus Christ our Savior who gave me the strength and the grace to explain this Epistle and granted you the grace to hear it preserve and strengthen us in faith unto the day of our redemption To Him the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit be glory world without end Amen This text was
