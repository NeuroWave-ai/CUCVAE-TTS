Father of our country But he did not get this name until he was nearly sixty years old and all kinds of interesting things like taming wild colts fighting Indians hunting game fording rivers and commanding an army had happened to him before that He really had a wonderful life George Washington was born in Virginia almost two hundred years ago Virginia was not a state then Indeed there were no states Every colony from Maine to Georgia was owned by King George who sent men from England to govern them At the time of George Washington s birth Virginia was the richest of the thirteen colonies George s father Augustine Washington had a fine old southern farmhouse set in the midst of a large tobacco plantation This farm of a thousand acres was on the Potomac River The Washington boys George had two older brothers and several younger ones had plenty of room to play in and George had a pony Hero of his own George was eleven years old when his father died and his mother managed the plantation and brought up the children George never gave her any trouble He had good lessons at school and was willing to help her at home He was a fine wrestler and could row and swim Indeed he liked the water so well that he fancied he might lead the life of a sailor carrying tobacco from the Potomac River to England He heard stories of vessels meeting pirates and thought it would be very exciting But his English uncle warned missus Washington that it would be a hard life for her son and she coaxed him to give up the idea George had shown that he could do the work of a man on the farm when he was only sixteen He was tall and strong and had a firm will He had great skill in breaking colts and understood planting and harvesting as well as tobacco raising Being good at figures he learned surveying Surveying is the science of measuring land so that an owner will know just how much he has how it lies and what it adjoins so that he can cut it into lots and set the measurements all down on paper George was a fine land surveyor and when he went to visit a half brother Lawrence Washington who had a beautiful new home on the Potomac which he called Mount Vernon an English nobleman Lord Fairfax who owned the next estate hired George to go all over his land in Virginia and put on paper for him the names of the people who lived in the Shenandoah valley the way the roads ran and the size of his different plantations He really did not know how much land he owned for King Charles the Second had given an immense amount of land to his grandfather But he thought it was quite time to find out and he was sure George Washington was an honest lad who would do the work well Lord Fairfax spoke so highly of George that he was made surveyor of the colony The outdoor life and the long tramps in the sunshine made George s tall frame fill out and he became one of the stoutest and handsomest young men in the colony Lawrence Washington was ill and had to go to a warmer climate so he took George with him for help and company Lawrence did not live and left the eight thousand acre estate Mount Vernon to George This made George Washington a rich man at twenty The French and English began to discover that there was fine rich land on either side of the Ohio River and each laid claim to it Now the Indians had been wandering through the forests of that region camping and fishing where they chose and they felt the land belonged to them They grew ugly and sulky toward the English with whom up to this time they had been very friendly It looked as if there would be war Some one must go and talk to these Frenchmen said Dinwiddie the English governor at Virginia whom shall we send Lord Fairfax the old neighbor of George answered I know just the man you want Your messenger must be young strong and brave He must know the country and be able to influence both the French and the Indians Send George Washington Washington served through these troubled times one year with Dinwiddie and three years with General Braddock an English general Always he proved himself brave He had plenty of dangers He was nearly drowned four bullets went crashing through his clothes in two different battles the horse on which he was riding was killed but he kept calm and kept on fighting He was soon made commander in chief of all the armies in Virginia After five hard years of fighting Washington went back to Mount Vernon where he lived quietly and happily with a beautiful widow to whom he was married a few weeks after meeting her When he and his bride rode home to Mount Vernon she was dressed in white satin and wore pearl jewels Her coach was drawn by six white horses Washington was dressed in a suit of blue lined with red satin and trimmed with silver lace He rode beside the coach on a chestnut horse with soldiers attending him missus Washington had two children Jack Custis aged six and Martha who was nicknamed Patty aged four George Washington was very fond of these children and one of the first things he did after they came to Mount Vernon was to send to England for ten shillings worth of toys six little books and a fashionable doll Patty broke this doll but Washington only laughed and ordered another that was better and larger George Washington was having a fine time farming raising horses and sheep having the negro women weave and spin cloth and yarn carrying on a fishery and riding over his vast estate when there was trouble between the colonists and England Again a man was needed that was brave wise and honest And when the colonists decided to fight unless the king would either stop taxing them or let them vote in Parliament they said George Washington must be our commander in chief So he left his wife children and home and led the American troops for seven years The colonists won their freedom from the English yoke but they knew if they were to govern themselves they needed a very wise man at their head They made George Washington the first President of the United States of America Of course it pleased him that such honor should be shown him but he would have preferred to be just a Virginian farmer at Mount Vernon However he went to New York and took the oath of office that is he promised as all presidents have to to work for the good of the United States He was dressed in a suit of dark brown cloth which was made in America with knee breeches and white silk stockings and shoes with large silver buckles He wore a sword at his side and as the sun shone on his powdered hair he looked very noble and handsome He kissed the Bible as he took the oath the chancellor lifted his hand and shouted Long live George Washington President of the United States The people did some wild cheering cannons boomed bells rang hats were tossed in the air and there was happiness everywhere America had her first President Washington ruled the people for eight years wisely and well He was greatly beloved at home and he was praised in other countries A German ruler said Washington was the greatest general in the world A prime minister of England said Washington was the purest man in history But we like to say Washington was the Father of our country and we like to remember that he said Do justice to all but never forget that we are Americans WILLIAM PENN When Charles the Second was King of England there lived in London a wealthy admiral of the British navy Sir William Penn He had been such a brave sailor that he was a favorite at court He had a son who was a handsome merry lad whom he meant to educate very highly for he knew the king would find some great place for him in his kingdom So young William was sent early to school and college where he learned Greek and Latin French German and Dutch He was quick motioned and strong At Oxford College there was hardly a student who could equal him in swimming rowing and outdoor sports His father grew prouder and prouder of his son each day William he said to himself will do honor to me to his king and to his country And he kept urging money and luxuries upon his son whom he dressed like a prince Imagine the Admiral s despair when he learned one morning that his son was hobnobbing with the Quakers Just then a new sect of religious people who called themselves Quakers or Friends had sprung up in England They were much despised A Quaker believed that all men are equal so he never took his hat off to any one not even the king The Quakers would not take an oath in court would not go to war or pay money in support of war always said thee and thou in addressing each other and wore plain clothes and sober colors They thought they ought always to act as their consciences told them to In England and Massachusetts Quakers were treated like criminals Some of them were put to death But the more they were abused the more their faith became known and the more followers they had A traveling Quaker preacher went to Oxford and when young William Penn heard him he decided that he had found a religion that suited him He stopped going to college services declared he would not wear the college gown and even tore the gowns from other students He was expelled from Oxford The Admiral was very angry He told his son he had disgraced him But he knew William had a strong will and instead of having many harsh words with him sent his son off to Paris I flatter myself laughed the Admiral that in gay fashionable Paris William will soon forget his foolish ideas about the Quakers The young people of Paris made friends with William at once for he was handsome and jolly He was eighteen years old He had large eyes and long dark hair which fell in curls about his shoulders For a time he entered into all the gay doings of Paris and spent a long time in Italy So when he returned to England two years later his father nodded approval at the change in his looks and ways He seemed to have forgotten the new religion entirely But presently an awful plague swept over London and William grew serious again The Admiral now packed the boy off to Ireland He was bound to stop this Quaker business There was some kind of a riot or war in Ireland and William fought in the thickest of it for he liked to be in the midst of whatever was going on One evening he heard that the old Quaker preacher he had liked at Oxford was preaching near by He with some other soldiers went to hear him and all his love for the Quaker faith came back to him and he joined the society He was imprisoned with other Quakers and then his father said he would never speak to him again But he really loved his son and was so pleased when he got out of prison that he agreed to forgive him if he would only promise to take off his hat when he met his father the king or the Duke of York But after young William had thought about it he told his father that he could not make such a promise William was sometimes in prison sometimes driven from home by his father then forgiven for the sake of his mother often he was tired out with writing and preaching but he kept true to his belief When William s father died he left his son great wealth which he used for the good of others especially the Quakers William knew the Crown owed the Admiral nearly a hundred thousand dollars As the king was something of a spendthrift it was not likely that the debt would be paid very soon so William asked the king to pay him in land This the monarch was glad to do so he granted an immense tract of land on the Delaware River in America to the Admiral s son William planned to call this tract Sylvania or Woodland but when King Charles heard this he said One thing I insist on Your grant must be called after your father for I had great love for the brave Admiral Thus the name decided on was Pennsylvania Penn s Woods William Penn lost no time in sending word to all the Quakers in England that in America they could find a home and on his land be free from persecution As many as three thousand of them sailed at once for America and the next year William visited his new possessions He did not know just how the tract might please him so he left his wife and child behind in England He laid out a city himself on the Delaware River and called it the City of Brotherly Love because he hoped there would be much love and harmony in the colony of Quakers The other name for city of brotherly love is Philadelphia If you visit this city to day you will find many of its streets bearing the names William Penn gave them more than two hundred years ago Some of these are Pine Mulberry Cedar Walnut and Chestnut streets Of course Indians were to be found along all the rivers in the American colonies Penn really owned the land along the Delaware but he thought it better to pay them for it as they had held it so many years so he called a council under a big tree where he shook hands with the red men and said he was of the same blood and flesh as they and he gave them knives beads kettles axes and various things for their land The Indians were pleased and vowed they would live in love with William Penn as long as the moon and sun should shine This treaty was never broken And one of the finest things to remember about William Penn is his honesty with the much persecuted Indians Penn left the Quaker colony after a while and went back to England But he returned many years later with his wife and daughter He had two fine homes one in the city of Philadelphia the other in the country At the country home there was a large dining hall and in it Penn entertained strangers and people of every color and race At one of his generous feasts his guests ate one hundred roast turkeys Penn who was so gentle and loving to all the world had many troubles of his own One son was wild and gave him much anxiety He himself was suspected of being too friendly with the papist King James and of refusing to pay his bills For one thing and another he was cast into prison until he lost his health from the cold dark cells It seems strange that the rich honest William Penn should from boyhood be doomed to imprisonment because of his religion his loyalty and from trying to obey the voice of his conscience While he was not born in this country the piety and honesty of William Penn will always be remembered in America JOHN PAUL JONES Along the banks of the River Dee in Scotland the Earls of Selkirk owned two castles John Paul was landscape gardener at Saint Mary s Isle and his brother George made the grounds beautiful at the Arbigland estate Little John Paul stayed often with his uncle At either place he could see the blue water and he loved everything about it At Arbigland he watched the ships sail by and could see the English mountains in the distance From the sailors he heard all kinds of sea stories and tales of wild border warfare When a tiny child he used to wander down to the mouth of the river Nith and coax the crews of the sailing vessels to tell him stories They liked him and taught him to manage small sailboats He quickly learned sea phrases and used to climb on some high rock and give off orders to his small play fellows or perhaps launch his boat alone upon the waters and just make believe that he had a crew of men on board with whom he was very stern For a few years this son of the Scotch gardener went to parish school but his mind was filled with the wild stories of adventure and he longed to see the world John had a feeling that his life was going to be exciting and he could not keep his mind on his books some days He was not sorry when his mother told him that as times were hard he must leave school and go to work John s older brother William had gone to America and his uncle George had ceased working for the Earls of Selkirk because he had saved enough money to go to America He was a merchant with a store of his own in South Carolina John heard such glowing accounts of men getting rich and famous in that land across the sea that he felt it must be almost like fairy land Think how pleased he must have been when at the age of twelve he shipped aboard the ship Friendship bound for Virginia And best of all this ship anchored a few miles from Fredericksburg where his brother lived When in port John stayed with William He loved America from the first moment he saw a bit of her coast and he never left off loving our country as long as he lived John went back and forth from America to Scotland on the Friendship a great many times He had made up his mind that he would always go to sea and he meant to understand everything about ships countries to which they might sail and all laws about trading in different ports So he studied all the books he could get hold of that would teach him these things Sometimes he changed vessels shipping with a different captain Sometimes he went to strange countries But he was one who kept his eyes open and he learned to be more and more skilful in all sea matters About two years before the Revolutionary War he was feeling discouraged He knew his employers were pirates in a way He had met with some trouble on his last voyage so that he knew it was best not to go to his brother s when he reached North Carolina from the West Indies and that he had best avoid using his own name As he sat alone on a bench in front of a tavern one afternoon his head in his hands a jovial handsome man came along The man was well dressed a kind hearted rich Southerner He hated to see people unhappy After he had passed John Paul he turned back and going close to him asked What s your name my friend I have none was the answer Where s your home I have none The stranger was struck with the face and figure of John Paul and noticed that his handsome black eyes had a commanding expression He said to himself Here is a lad that will be of importance some day or my name is not Willie Jones Then Willie Jones took John by the arm and said Come home with me My home is big enough for us both This was quite true for Willie Jones had a beautiful estate called The Grove The house was like a palace with its immense drawing rooms wide fireplaces carved halls and spacious dining room which overlooked the owner s race track For Willie Jones owned blooded horses went to country hunts played cards and had overseers to manage his fifteen hundred slaves who worked in Jones s tobacco fields and salt mines His clothes were of the first quality and his linen fine On a neighboring estate across the river lived Willie s brother Allen Jones He was married to a dark eyed beauty who gave parties in her large ballroom and who led the minuets and gavottes better than any of her guests Just as John Paul had been at home on the estates of the Earl of Selkirk in Scotland he was now at home on both these southern plantations By both families he was petted and soon beloved He seemed like one of their own blood The people of North Carolina talked constantly of Liberty They declared themselves anxious to be independent of England Soon after the famous Boston Tea party the women of North Carolina pledged their word to drink no more tea that was taxed John Paul took the same stand as his good friends And he more than ever felt he was born to do great deeds And he hoped to prove his gratitude to the Joneses by winning fame From this time he took the name of John Paul Jones All his navy papers are signed that way And he became an American citizen Paul Jones s rise was rapid In seventeen seventy six he became a lieutenant in the Continental navy The colonists had but five armed vessels the Alfred on which Paul Jones served was one of them These five ships were the beginning of the American navy The captain of the Alfred was slow in reaching his vessel and so Paul Jones had to get the ship ready for sea He was so quick and sure in all his acts that the sailors all liked him The ship was visited by the commodore of the squadron of five ships He found everything in such fine condition that he said My confidence in you is so great that if the captain does not reach here by the time we should get away I shall hoist my flag on your ship and give you command of her Thank you Commodore and Paul bowed when your flag is hoisted on the Alfred I hope a flag of the United Colonies will fly at the peak I want to be the man to raise that flag on the ocean The commodore laughed and replied As Congress is slow I am afraid there will not be time to make a flag after it actually decides what that shall be I think there will Sir answered Paul Jones It seems he knew almost for a certainty that the Continental Congress had planned their first flag of the Revolution It was to be of yellow silk showing a pine tree with a rattlesnake under it and bearing the daring motto Don t tread on me Paul Jones had bought the material to make one out of his own pocket and Bill Green a quarter master sat up all night to cut and sew the cloth into a flag Captain Saltonstall arrived in time to take command but Paul Jones kept his disappointment to himself and faithfully did the lieutenant s duties He had been drilling the men and when the commodore came again to inspect the ship some four hundred with one hundred marines were drawn up on deck Bill Green and Paul Jones were very busy for a minute and just as the commodore came over the ladder at the ship s side the flag with the pennant flew up the staff under Paul Jones s hand Every man s hat came off the drummer boys beat a double ruffle on the drums and such cheers burst from every throat The commodore said to Paul Jones I congratulate you you have been enterprising Congress adopted that flag but yesterday and this one is the first to fly Bill Green was thanked too and the squadron sailed for the open sea the Alfred leading the way Paul Jones was very daring but his judgment and knowledge were so perfect that in the twenty three great battles which he fought upon the seas though many times wounded he was never defeated He made the American flag which he was the first to raise honored and he kept it flying in the Texel with a dozen double decked Dutch frigates threatening him in the harbor while another dozen English ships were waiting just beyond to capture him He was offered safety if he would hoist the French colors and accept a commission in the French navy but he never wavered It was his pride to be able to say to the American Congress I have never borne arms under any but the American flag nor have I ever borne or acted under any commission except that of the Congress of America Paul Jones served without pay and used nearly all of his private fortune for the cause of independence Congress made him the ranking officer of the American navy and gave him a gold medal France conferred the cross of a military order upon him and a gold sword It was a beautiful day when this cross was given him The French minister gave a grand fete in Philadelphia All Congress was there army and navy officers citizens and sailors who had served under Jones Against the green of the trees the uniforms of the officers and the white gowns of the ladies showed gleamingly Paul Jones wore the full uniform of an American captain and his gold sword He carried his blue and gold cap in his hand A military band played inspiring airs as the French minister and Paul Jones walked toward the center of the lawn Paul Jones was pale but happy He was receiving an honor never before given a man who was not a citizen of France but as his eyes lighted on the stars and stripes floating above him they filled with tears for his greatest joy of all was that he had left the sands of Dee to become a citizen and defender of his beloved America JOHN SINGLETON COPLEY When the city of Boston Massachusetts was just a small town in which there were no schools where boys and girls could learn to draw and paint one little fellow by the name of John Singleton Copley was quite sure to be waiting at the door when his stepfather Peter Pelham came home to dinner or supper to ask why the pictures he had been drawing of various people did not look like them Peter Pelham could nearly always tell John what the matter was because he knew a good deal about drawing He made maps and engravings himself John remembered what his stepfather told him and practised until he made really fine drawings Then he began to color them He did love gay tints and as both men and women wore many buckles and jewels and brocades and velvets of every hue in those days he could make these portraits as dazzling as he chose There is no doubt John loved to make pictures He had drawn many a one on the walls of his nursery when he was scarcely more than a baby He later covered the blank pages and margins of his school books with faces and animals And instead of playing games with the other boys in holidays he was apt to spend such hours with chalks and paints When John was fourteen or fifteen his portraits were thought so lifelike that Boston people paid him good prices for them He was glad to earn money for his kind stepfather died leaving his wife to the care of John and his stepbrother Henry He had been working and saving for years when he married the daughter of a rich Boston merchant This wife Suzanne was a beautiful girl proud of her husband s talent and anxious for him to get on in the world The artist soon bought a house on Beacon Hill which had a fine view from its windows He called this estate which covered eleven acres his little farm You can guess how large it looked when I tell you that the farm is to day practically the western side of Beacon Hill The young couple were happy and must have prospered for a man who saw the house on the hill wrote to his friends I called on John Singleton Copley and found him living in a beautiful home on a fine open common dressed in red velvet laced with gold and having everything about him in handsome style It is evident John still liked bright colors John had never seen any really good paintings he had never had any teacher and he longed to see the works of the old masters in other countries But at first he did not want to leave his old mother then it was the young wife who kept him here and by and by he felt he could not be away from his own dear little children so it was not until he was nearly forty that he went abroad In one of the first letters that Suzanne got from her husband he told of the fine shops in Genoa She laughed when she read that in a few hours after he landed he bought a suit of black velvet lined with crimson satin lace ruffles for his neck and sleeves and silk stockings I d know she said to herself the suit would have a touch of crimson John does love rich colors All his letters told how wonderful he found the old paintings and often described his attempts to copy them After he had visited the galleries and museums of Italy he went to England He was delighted to find that his wife and family had already fled there because of the Revolution in America He had heard of the trouble between the Colonists in America and England and had worried night and day for fear harm would come to Suzanne and the children Of course he worried about the little farm too but it was no time to go back to Boston and he could only hope his agent would protect it The Copleys liked London but some days they felt homesick for Beacon Hill Still he must keep earning money and there were plenty of English people who wanted to sit for their portraits while of course with the fierce Revolution raging and with soldiers camping everywhere Boston people did not care much about having their pictures painted In London John began to paint pictures that showed events in history Sometimes he would take for a subject a famous battle sometimes a scene from the English Parliament or perhaps a king or lord doing some act which we have read about in their lives These pictures were immense in size and took a long time to do because Copley was particular to have everything exactly true George the Third was so much pleased with his work that when he was going to paint the large work The Siege of Gibraltar his Majesty sent him with his wife and eldest daughter to Hanover to take the portraits of four great generals of that country who had proved their bravery and skill on the rock of Gibraltar All the uniforms swords banners and scenery were as perfect as if Copley had been at the siege himself and the officers faces were just like photographs The king was very kind and generous He told Copley not to hurry back to England but to enjoy Hanover thoroughly and to give his wife and daughter a holiday they would never forget To enable Copley to go into private homes and look at art treasures which the public never saw the king gave him a letter asking this courtesy written with his own hand This large canvas The Siege of Gibraltar is owned by the city of London There is another huge painting The Death of Lord Chatham at Kensington Museum which Americans like to see It shows old Lord Chatham falling in a faint at the House of Lords The poor man was too sick to be there but he was a strong friend to the American Colonies and had declared over and over again that the king ought not to tax them When he heard there was to be voting on the question he rose from his bed and drove in a carriage to the House to say once more how wicked it was The members of the House of Lords look very imposing with their grave faces and robes of scarlet trimmed with ermine but they sometimes act in a childish manner and show temper One man who almost hated Chatham for so defending the Colonies sat as still as if he were carved out of stone when the poor old lord dropped to the floor This picture shows him sitting as cold and stiff as a ramrod while all the other members have sprung to their feet or have rushed to help the fainting man The Boston Public Library holds one of Copley s historical pictures It shows a scene from the life of Charles the First of England He is standing in the speaker s chair in the House of Commons demanding something which the speaker kneeling before him is unwilling to tell There is plenty of chance for John Copley to show his love for brilliant coloring for the suits of the king his nephew Prince Rupert and his followers are of velvets and satins the slashed sleeves showing facings of yellow cherry and green The knee breeches are fastened with buckles over gaudy silk stockings and high heeled slippers The men wear deep collars of lace curled wigs and velvet hats with sweeping plumes But in a picture at Buckingham Palace called The Three Princesses there is a riot of color The scene is a garden beyond which the towers of Windsor Castle show with the flag of England floating above it there are fruit trees and flowers parrots of gay plumage and pet dogs The little girls gowns are rainbow like and one of them is dancing to the music of a tambourine It is a darling picture and the royal couple prized it greatly When John Copley was only a young man he sent a picture from Boston to England asking that it might be placed on exhibition at the Royal Academy It was called The Boy and the Flying Squirrel The boy was a portrait of his half brother Henry Pelham Copley sent no name or letter and it was against the rules of the Academy to hang any picture by an unknown artist but the coloring was so beautiful that the rule was broken and crowds stopped before the Boston lad s canvas to admire it When it was discovered that John Copley painted it and it was known he had received no lessons at that time he was urged to go abroad at once At the time he could not But the praise encouraged him to keep on and before he had a chance to visit Italy he had painted nearly three hundred pictures Nearly all of these were painted at the little farm on Beacon Hill when he or Suzanne would hardly have dreamed the day would come when he should be the favorite of kings and courts BENJAMIN FRANKLIN One of the greatest Americans that ever lived was Benjamin Franklin The story of his life sounds like a fairy tale Though he stood before queens and kings dressed in velvet and laces before he died he was the son of a poor couple who had to work very hard to find food and clothes for their large family for there were more than a dozen little Franklins Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston one bright Sunday morning more than two hundred years ago That same afternoon his father took the baby boy across the street to the Old South Church to be baptized He was named for his uncle Benjamin who lived in England As Benjamin grew up he made friends easily People liked his eager face and merry ways He was never quiet but darted about like a kitten The questions he asked and the mischief he got into But the neighbors loved him The women made little cakes for him and the men were apt to toss him pennies One day when Benjamin was about seven some one gave him all the pennies he could squeeze into one hand Off he ran to the toy shop but on his way he overtook a boy blowing a whistle Ben thought that whistle was the nicest thing he had ever seen and offered his handful of pennies for it The boy took them and Ben rushed home with his prize Well he tooted that whistle all over the house until the family wished there had never been a whistle in the world Then an older brother told him he had paid the other boy altogether too much for it and when Ben found that if he had waited and bought it at a store he would have had some of the pennies left for something else he burst out crying He did not forget about this either When he was a grown man and was going to buy something he would wait a little and say to himself Careful now don t pay too much for your whistle An Italian sculptor who had heard this story made a lovely statue called Franklin and his Whistle If you happen to be in the beautiful Public Library in Newark New Jersey you must ask to see it Ben always loved the water and was a wonderful swimmer as a little fellow He could manage a boat too and spent half his play hours down at the wharves One day he had been flying kites as he often did and thought he would see what would happen if he went in swimming with a kite tied to his waist He tried it and the kite pulled him along finely If he wanted to go slowly he let out a little bit of string If he wanted to move through the water fast he sent the kite up higher in the air But it was in school that Ben did his best He studied so well that his father wanted to make a great scholar of him but there was not money enough to do this so when he was ten he had to go into his father s soap and candle shop to work The more he worked over the candles the worse he hated to and by and by he said to his father Oh let me go to sea No said mister Franklin your brother ran away to sea I can t lose another boy that way We will look up something else So the father and son went round the city day after day visiting all kinds of work shops to see what Benjamin fancied best But when it proved that the trade of making knives and tools which was what pleased Benjamin most could not be learned until mister Franklin had paid one hundred dollars that had to be given up like the school There was never any spare cash in the Franklin purse As James Franklin an older brother had learned the printing business in England and had set up an office in Boston Ben was put with him to learn the printer s trade Poor Ben found him a hard man to work for If it had not been for the books he found there to read and the friends who loaned him still more books he could not have stayed six months But Ben knew that since he had to leave school when he was only ten the thing for him to do was to study by himself every minute he could get He sat up half the nights studying When he needed time to finish some book he would eat fruit and drink a glass of water at noon just to save a few extra minutes for studying James never gave him a chance for anything but work it seemed as if he could not pile enough on him When he found Ben could write poetry pretty well he made him write ballads and sell them on the streets putting the money they brought into his own pocket He was very mean to the younger brother and when he began to strike Ben whenever he got into a rage the boy left him Benjamin went to New York but found no work there He worked his way to Philadelphia By this time his clothes were ragged He had no suitcase or traveling bag and carried his extra stockings and shirts in his pockets You can imagine how bulgy and slack he looked walking through the streets He was hungry and stepped into a baker s for bread He had only one silver dollar in the world But he must eat whether he found work or not When he asked for ten cents worth of bread the baker gave him three large loaves He began munching one of these as he went back into the street As his pockets were filled with stockings and shirts he had to carry the other two loaves under his arms No wonder a girl standing in a doorway giggled as he passed by Years afterwards when Franklin was rich and famous and had married this very girl the two used to laugh well over the way he looked the first time she saw him Illustration He began munching one of these as he went back into the street Page forty one After one or two useless trips to England Franklin settled down to the printing business in Philadelphia He was the busiest man in town Deborah his wife helped him and he started a newspaper a magazine a bookstore he made ink he made paper even made soap work that he hated so when a boy Then he published every year an almanac Into this odd book which people hurried to buy he put some wise sayings which I am sure you must have heard many times Such as Haste makes waste Well done is better than well said and Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise Franklin and his wife did so many things and did them well that they grew rich So when he was only forty two Franklin shut up all his shops and took his time for studying out inventions When you hear about the different things he invented you will not wonder that the colleges in the country thought he ought to be honored with a degree and made him Doctor Franklin Here are some of his inventions lightning rods stoves fans to cool hot rooms a cure for smoking chimneys better printing presses sidewalks street cleaning He opened salt mines and drained swamps so that they were made into good land Then he founded the first public library the first police service and the first fire company Doesn t it seem as if he thought of everything But better than all Franklin always worked for the glory of America When King George was angry and bitter against our colonies Franklin went to England and stood his ground against the king and all his council He said the king had no right to make the colonies pay a lot of money for everything that was brought over from England unless they had some say as to how much money it should be If they paid taxes they wanted to vote They were not willing to be just slaves under a hard master Very well then said the council then you colonists can t have any more clothes from England mister Franklin answered back Very well then we will wear old clothes till we can make our own new ones In a week or so word was sent from England that clothing would not be taxed and the colonists had great rejoicings They built bonfires rang bells and had processions and Benjamin Franklin s name was loudly cheered But England still needed money and decided to make the colonists pay a tax on tea and a few other things Then the American colonists were as angry as they could be They tipped the whole cargo of tea into Boston Harbor and in spite of Franklin s trying to make the king and the colonists understand each other there was a long war it is called the Revolutionary War and it ended in the colonists declaring themselves independent of Great Britain A paper telling the king and the world that the colonists should not obey the English rule any longer but would make laws of their own was signed by men from all thirteen colonies Benjamin Franklin was one of the men from Pennsylvania who signed it As this paper The Declaration of Independence was first proclaimed July four seventeen seventy six the people always celebrate the fourth day of July throughout the United States Franklin was postmaster general of the colonies he was our first minister to the Court of France the governor or president as the office was then called of Pennsylvania and helped more than almost any other man to make America the great country she is Franklin was admired in France and England for his good judgment and clever ideas Pictures of him were shown in public places prints of his face were for sale in three countries medallions of his head were set in rings and snuff boxes he traveled in royal coaches and was treated like a prince But although it was the Great Doctor Franklin here and the Noble Patriot there he did not grow vain Benjamin Franklin was just a modest good American LOUIS AGASSIZ Louis Agassiz was a Swiss boy who knew how to keep his eyes open Some people walk right by things without seeing them but Louis kept a sharp lookout and nothing escaped him Louis was born in a small Swiss village near a lake His father was a minister and school teacher His mother was a fine scholar and was very sure that she wanted her children to love books but two brothers of Louis s had died and she meant to have Louis and another son Auguste get plenty of play and romping in the fields so that they would grow up healthy and strong first of all there would be time for study afterwards The Agassiz boys had a few short lessons in the morning with their father or mother and then they roamed through the woods and fields the rest of the day Of course they found plenty to interest them and never came home from these jaunts with empty hands They had pet mice birds rabbits and fish There was a stone basin in his father s yard with spring water flowing through it In this Louis put his fish and then watched their habits As I told you nothing escaped his eyes He proved this more than once It was the custom in Swiss cantons for different kinds of workmen to travel from house to house making such things at the door as each family might need Louis watched the cobbler and after he had gone away surprised his sister with a pair of boots he himself had made for her doll And after the cooper had made his father some casks and barrels Louis made a tiny water tight barrel as perfect as could be He kept his sharpest gaze on the tailor and Papa Agassiz said to his wife Let us see now if Louis can make a suit They did not in the end ask him to try but no doubt he knew pretty well how it was done At the age of ten Louis was sent to a college twenty miles from Motier where his parents lived He was keen at his lessons and asked questions until he mastered whatever he studied The second year he went to this college he was joined by his brother Auguste The two boys liked the same things and never wanted to be away from each other Whenever a vacation came the boys walked home all that twenty miles and did not make any fuss about it By and by the boys wanted to own books which would tell them about birds fishes and rocks These were the things Louis was thinking of all the time The boys saved every cent of their spending money for these books They were always talking about animals One day as they were walking from Zurich to Motier they were overtaken by a gentleman in a carriage He asked them to ride with him and to share his lunch They did so and talked to him about their studies He was greatly taken with Louis who was a handsome graceful lad as he told the stranger his fondness for books The gentleman hardly took his eyes from the boy and a few days later Reverend mister Agassiz had a letter from him saying that he was very rich and that he wanted to adopt Louis He said he was sure that the boy was a genius Louis was not willing though to be any one s boy but his own parents and so the matter was dropped The boys did not have much spending money and it took oh such a long time to save enough to buy even one book So they often went to a library or borrowed a book from a teacher then copied every word of it with pen and ink so as to own it You can see from this that they were very much in earnest When not studying or copying the brothers were busy outdoors watching animals In this way they learned just what kinds of fishes could be found in certain lakes and almost the exact day when different birds would come or go from the woods In their rooms the cupboards and shelves were crammed with shells stuffed fishes plants and odd specimens On the ledges of the windows hovered often as many as fifty kinds of birds who had become tamed and who made their home there At seventeen Louis was bending over his desk a good many hours of the day He learned French German Latin Greek Italian and English But he was wise enough to keep himself well and strong by walking swimming and fencing Because Louis s parents and his uncle wanted him to be a doctor he studied medicine He carried home his diploma when he was twenty three and earned a degree in philosophy too But in his own heart he knew he would not be happy unless he could hunt the world over for strange creatures and try to find out the secrets of the old old mountains Louis traveled all he could and became so excited over the different things he discovered that he sometimes stopped in cities and towns and talked to the people in their public halls about them He had a happy way of telling his news and crowds went to listen to the young Swiss The King of Prussia thought that any one who used his eyes in such good fashion ought to visit many places He said to Louis Here is money for you to travel with so that you may find out more of these strange things You are a clever young man and can do much for the world In the course of his travels Louis Agassiz came to America At that time he could not speak English very well but all his stories were so charming that the halls were never large enough to hold the men and women who wanted to hear him Louis Agassiz loved America so well that he made up his mind to spend the rest of his life here As time passed he decided also to give this country the benefit of all that he discovered He was so bright that the whole world was beginning to wonder at him France got jealous of America s keeping such a great man So Napoleon offered him a high office and great honors but Louis said No adding courageously I d rather have the gratitude of a free people than the patronage of Emperors The city of Zurich begged him to return No he wrote I cannot I love America too well Then the city of Paris urged him to be at the head of their Natural History Museum but this was no use either Nothing could win Louis Agassiz away from America At Harvard College Agassiz was made professor of natural history and there is to day at Cambridge a museum of zoology the largest of its kind in the world which Agassiz founded and built At his home in Cambridge the professor still kept strange pets quite as he used to do when a boy Visitors to his garden never knew when they might step on a live turtle or when they might come suddenly upon an alligator an eagle or a timid rabbit The precious dream of going to Brazil came true when Louis Agassiz was fifty years old With a party of seventeen and his wife he went on an exploring expedition to South America It was a great adventure Agassiz had been to many cold countries and had slept on glaciers night after night with only a single blanket under him but never in his life had he been in the tropics When Agassiz arrived in South America Don Pedro the Emperor of Brazil was glad to see the man who was known as a famous scientist and heaped all kinds of honors upon him Better than all he helped Agassiz get into many out of the way places If you want to know about a fish that has four eyes about dragon flies that are flaming crimson and green and floating islands that are as large as a school playground yet go sailing along like a ship bearing birds deer and wild looking jaguars read A Journey to Brazil by Professor and missus Agassiz When you have heard the story of all these strange things you will agree that Louis Agassiz did certainly know how to keep his eyes open DOROTHEA LYNDE DIX Doctor Elisha Dix of Orange Court Boston was never happier than when his pet grandchild little Dorothea Dix came to visit his wife and himself Every morning he had to drive about the city in his old fashioned chaise to see how the sick people were getting along and he did love to have Dorothea sitting beside him her tongue going as he used to declare like a trip hammer She was a wide awake quick motioned creature and said such droll things that the doctor used to shout with laughter until the dappled gray horse which he drove sometimes stopped short and looked round at the two in the chaise as if to say Whatever in the world does all this mean But when the time drew near for Dorothea to go back home she always looked sober enough One day she burst out Oh Grandpa I almost hate tracts Doctor Dix glanced down at her in his kind way and answered I don t know as I blame you Child You see Joseph Dix Dorothea s father was a strange man He had fine chances to make money because the doctor had bought one big lot of land after another and had to hire agents to look after these farms and forests Naturally he sent his own son to the pleasantest places but the only thing Joseph Dix who was very religious in the gloomiest sort of a way really wanted to do was to repeat hymns and write tracts To publish these dismal booklets he used nearly all the money he earned so that the family had small rations of food cheap clothing and no holidays Besides having to live in such sorry fashion the whole household were forced to stitch and paste these tracts together Year after year missus Dix Dorothea and her two brothers sat in the house doing this tiresome work No matter whether as agent mister Dix was sent to Maine New Hampshire Vermont or Massachusetts no matter whether their playmates in the neighborhood were berrying skating or picnicking no matter how the birds sang the brooks sparkled the nuts and fruit ripened the wife and children of Joseph Dix had no outdoor pleasures no they just bent over those old tracts pasting and sewing till they fairly ached When Dorothea was twelve she decided to stand such a life no longer Fortunately the family was then living in Worcester near Boston and it did not cost much to get there Doctor Dix was dead but Dorothea ran away to her grandmother who still lived at Orange Court now it is called Dix Place and although Madam Dix was very strict life was better there than with the tract maker At Orange Court Dorothea was allowed no time to play She was taught to sew and cook and knit and was sometimes punished if the tasks were not well done Poor thing she said in after life I never had any childhood But she went to school and was so quick at her lessons that in two years she went back to Worcester and opened a school for little children She was only fourteen and rather small for her age so she put on long dresses and piled her hair on top of her head with a high comb I think people never guessed how young she was Anyway she proved a good teacher and the children loved her and never disobeyed her After keeping this school for a year she studied again in Boston until she was nineteen Then she not only taught a day and boarding school in that city but looked after her brothers and opened another school for poor children whose parents could not afford to pay for their lessons She took care of her grandmother s house too While every one was wondering how one young girl could do so much she made them open their eyes still wider by writing three or four books By and by her health broke down and she began to think that she could never work any more but after a long rest in England she came back to America and did something far greater than teaching or writing she went through the whole country making prisons jails and asylums more comfortable Up to the time of Dorothea Dix s interest no one had seemed to bother his head about prisoners and insane people Any kind of a place that had a lock and key was good enough for such to sleep in And what did it matter if a wicked man or a crazy man was cold or hungry But it mattered very much to Dorothea Dix that human beings were being ill treated and she meant to start a reform She talked with senators governors and presidents She visited the places in each State where prisoners the poor and the crazy were shut up She talked kindly to these shut ins and she talked wrathfully to the men who ill treated them She made speeches before legislatures she wrote articles for the papers and begged money from millionaires to build healthy almshouses and asylums This was seventy years ago when traveling was slow and dangerous in the west and south She had so many delays on account of stage coaches breaking down on rough or muddy roads that finally she made a practice of carrying with her an outfit of hammer wrench nails screws a coil of stout rope and straps of strong leather Some of the western rivers had to be forded and many times she nearly lost her life Once when riding in a stage coach in Michigan a robber sprang out of a dark place in the forest through which they were passing and demanded her purse She did not scream or faint She asked him if he was not ashamed to molest a woman who was going through the country to help prisoners She told him if he was really poor she would give him some money And what do you think Before she finished speaking the robber recognized her voice He had heard her talk to the prisoners when he was a convict in a Philadelphia prison He begged her to go on her way in peace For twelve years Miss Dix went through the United States in the interests of the deaf and dumb the blind and the insane Then she went to Europe to rest But she found the same suffering there as here In no time she was busy again She tried to get audience with the Pope in Rome to beg him to stop some prison cruelties but was always put off Any one else would have given up but Dorothea Dix always carried her point One day she met the Pope s carriage in the street She stopped it and as she knew no Italian began talking fast to him in Latin She was so earnest and sensible that he gave her everything she asked for It was not long after her return to America before the Civil War broke out She went straight to Washington and offered to nurse the soldiers without pay As she was appointed superintendent she had all the nurses under her rule She hired houses to keep supplies in she bought an ambulance she gave her time strength and fortune to her country In the whole four years of the Civil War Dorothea Dix never took a holiday She was so interested in her work that often she forgot to eat her meals until reminded of them After this war was over the Secretary of War Honorable Edwin M Stanton asked her how the nation could show its gratitude to her for the grand work she had done She told him she would like a flag Two very beautiful ones were given her made with special printed tributes on them In her will Miss Dix left these flags to Harvard College They hang over the doors of Memorial Hall Nobody ever felt sorry that Dorothea ran away from those tiresome tracts For probably all the tracts ever written by Joseph Dix never did as much good as a single day s work of his daughter among the wounded soldiers And as for her reforms they will go on forever She has been called the most useful woman of America That is a great name to earn ULYSSES SIMPSON GRANT Once upon a time at Point Pleasant a small town on the Ohio River there lived a young couple who could not decide how to name their first baby He was a darling child and as the weeks went by and he grew prettier every minute it was harder and harder to think of a name good enough for him Finally Jesse Grant the father told his wife Hannah he thought it would be a good plan to ask the grandparents advice So off they rode from their little cottage carrying the baby with them But at grandpa s it was even worse In that house there were four people besides themselves to suit At last the father mother grandfather grandmother and the two aunts each wrote a favorite name on a bit of paper These slips of paper were all put into grandpa s tall silk hat which was placed on the spindle legged table Now said the father to one of the aunts draw from the hat a slip of paper and whatever name is written on that slip shall be the name of my son The slip she drew had the name Ulysses on it Well murmured the grandfather our dear child is named for a great soldier of the olden days But I wanted him to be called Hiram who was a good king in Bible times Then Hannah Grant who could not bear to have him disappointed answered Let him have both names So the baby was christened Hiram Ulysses Grant While Ulysses was still a baby his parents moved to Georgetown Ohio There his father built a nice new brick house and managed a big farm besides his regular work of tanning leather As Ulysses got old enough to help at any kind of work it was plain he would never be a tanner He hated the smell of leather But he was perfectly happy on the farm He liked best of all to be around the horses and before he was six years old he rode horseback as well as any man in Georgetown When he was seven it was part of his work to drive the span of horses in a heavy team that carried the cord wood from the wood lot to the house and shop He must have been a strong boy for at the age of eleven he used to hold the plow when his father wanted to break up new land and it makes the arms and back ache to hold a heavy plow He was patient with all animals and knew just how to manage them His father and all the neighbors had Ulysses break their colts In the winters Ulysses went to school but he did not care for it as much as he did for outdoor life and work with his hands Still he usually had his lessons and was decidedly bright in arithmetic Because he was not a shirk and always told the truth his father was in the habit of saying after the farm chores were done Now Ulysses you can take the horse and carriage and go where you like I know I can trust you When he was only twelve his father began sending him seventy or eighty miles away from home on business errands These trips would take him two days Sometimes he went alone and sometimes he took one of his chums with him Talking so much with grown men gave him an old manner and as his judgment was pretty good he was called by merchants a sharp one He would have been contented to jaunt about the country trading and colt breaking all his life but his father decided he ought to have military training and obtained for him an appointment at West Point the United States school for training soldiers that was started by George Washington without Ulysses knowing a thing about it Now Ulysses did not have the least desire to be a soldier and did not want to go to this school one bit but he had always obeyed his father and started on a fifteen days journey from Ohio without any more talk than the simple statement I don t want to go but if you say so I suppose I must He found when he reached the school that his name had been changed Up to this time his initials had spelled HUG but the senator who sent young Grant s appointment papers to Washington had forgotten Ulysses middle name He wrote his full name as Ulysses Simpson Grant and as it would make much trouble to have it changed at Congress Ulysses let it stand that way So instead of being called H U G Grant as he had been by his mates at home the West Point boys to tease him caught up the new initials and shouted Uncle Sam Grant or United States Grant and sometimes Useless Grant But the Ohio boy was good natured and only laughed at them He was a cool slow moving chap well behaved and was never known to say a profane word in his life At this school there was plenty of chance to prove his skill with horses Ulysses was never happier than when he started off for the riding hall with his spurs clanking on the ground and his great cavalry sword dangling by his side Once mounted on a big sorrel horse and before a visiting Board of Directors he made the highest jump that had ever been known at West Point He was as modest as could be about this jump but the other cadets as the pupils were called bragged about it till they were hoarse After his graduation Grant with his regiment was sent to the Mexican border In the battle of Palo Alto he had his first taste of war Being truthful he confessed afterwards that when he heard the booming of the big guns he was frightened almost to pieces But he had never been known to shirk and he not only rode into the powder and smoke that day but for two years proved so brave and calm in danger that he was promoted several times But he did not like fighting He was sure of that At the end of the Mexican War Ulysses married a girl from saint Louis named Julia Dent and she went to live as soldiers wives do in whatever military post to which he happened to be sent First the regiment was stationed at Lake Ontario then at Detroit and then dear me it was ordered to California There were no railroads in those days People had to go three thousand miles on horseback or in slow lumbering wagons This took months and was both tiresome and dangerous Every little while there would be a deep river to ford or some wicked Indians skulking round or a wild beast threatening The officers decided to take their regiments to California by water This would be a hard trip but a safer one It was lucky that missus Grant and the babies stayed behind with the grandparents for besides the weariness of the long journey there was scarcity of food a terrible cholera plague broke out and Ulysses Grant worked night and day He had to keep his soldiers fed watch out for the Indians and nurse the sick people Well after eleven years of army life Grant decided to resign from the service He thought war was cruel he wanted to be with his wife and children and a soldier got such small pay that he wondered how he was ever going to be able to educate the children Farming would be better than fighting he said He was welcomed home with great joy His wife owned a bit of land and Grant built a log cabin on it He planted crops cut wood kept horses and cows and worked from sunrise till dark But the land was so poor that he named the place Hardscrabble Even with no money and hard work the Grants were happy until the climate gave Ulysses a fever then they left Missouri country life and moved into the city of saint Louis In this city Grant tried his hand at selling houses laying out streets and working in the custom house but something went wrong in every place he got He had to move into poorer houses he had to borrow money and finally he walked the streets trying to find some new kind of work Nobody would hire him The men said he was a failure Friends of the Dent family shook their heads as they whispered Poor Julia she didn t get much of a husband did she Then he went back to Galena Illinois and was a clerk in his brother s store earning about what any fifteen year old boy gets to day He worked quietly in the store all day stayed at home evenings and was called a very commonplace man He was bitterly discouraged I tell you that he could not get ahead in the world And his father s pride was hurt to think that his son who had appeared so smart at twelve could not as a grown man take care of his own family But Julia Dent Grant was sweet and kind She kept telling him that he would have better luck pretty soon In eighteen sixty one the Americans began to quarrel among themselves Several of the States grew very bitter against each other and were so stubborn that the President of the United States Abraham Lincoln said he must have seventy five thousand men to help him stop such rebellion Ulysses Grant came forward and said he would be one of these seventy five thousand and enlisted again in the United States Army He was asked to be the colonel of an Illinois regiment by the governor of that State Then you may be sure what he had learned at West Point came into good play He soon showed that he knew just how to train men into fine soldiers He did so well that he was made Brigadier general He stormed right through the enemies lines and took fort after fort Oh his work was splendid this man who had been called a failure A general who was fighting against him began to get frightened and by and by he sent Grant a note saying What terms will you make with us if we will give in just a little and do partly as you want us to Grant laughed when he read the letter and wrote back No terms at all but unconditional surrender Finally the other general did surrender and when the story of the two letters and the victory for Grant was told the initials of his name were twisted into another phrase he was called Unconditional Surrender Grant This saying was quoted for months every time his name was mentioned At the end of that time he had said something else that pleased the people and the President You see the war kept raging harder and harder It seemed as if it would never end Grant was always at the front of his troops watching everything the enemy did and planned but he grew sadder and sadder He felt sure there would be fighting until dear brave Robert E Lee the southern general laid down his sword The whole country was sad and anxious They said It is time there was a change what in the world is Grant going to do And he answered I am going to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer No one doubted he would keep his word It did take all summer and all winter too Then when poor General Lee saw that his men were completely trapped and that they would starve if he did not give in he yielded Grant showed how much of a gentleman he was by his treatment of the general and soldiers he had conquered There was no lack of courtesy toward them I can tell you When the cruel war was ended Grant was the nation s hero Later Grant was made President of the United States he had saved When he had finished his term of four years he was chosen for President again After that he traveled round the world I cannot begin to tell you the number of presents he received or describe one half the honors which were paid him paid to this man who at one time could not get a day s work in saint Louis This farmer from Hardscrabble dined with kings and queens talked with the Pope of Rome called on the Czar of Russia visited the Mikado of Japan in his royal palace and was given four beautiful homes of his own by rich Americans One house was in Galena one in Philadelphia one in Washington and another in New York New York was his favorite city and in a square named for him you can see a statue showing General Grant on his pet horse in army uniform On Claremont Heights where it can be seen from the city the harbor and the Hudson River stands a magnificent tomb the resting place of the great hero who was born in the tiny house at Point Pleasant There was always a good deal of fighting blood in the Grants The sixth or seventh great grandfather of Ulysses Matthew Grant came to Massachusetts in sixteen thirty almost three hundred years ago over in Scotland where he was born he belonged to the clan whose motto was Stand Fast I think that old Scotchman and all the other ancestors would agree with us that the boy from Ohio stood fast And how well the name suited him which his aunt drew from the old silk hat Ulysses a brave soldier of the olden time CLARA BARTON It was on the brightest sunniest kind of a Christmas morning nearly one hundred years ago that Clara Barton was born in the State of Massachusetts Besides the parents there were two grown up sisters and two big brothers to pet the new baby There was plenty of love and plenty of money in the Barton household so the child knew nothing but happiness Clara was a bright little thing As she grew old enough to walk and talk she followed the family about repeating all their words and phrases like a parrot She was not sure as to the meaning of all these words but she liked the sound of them Her father who had fought in the French and Indian wars had a fondness for the rules and forms that are used among soldiers He taught her the names and rank of army officers Also the name of the United States president the vice president and members of the president s cabinet Clara s eyes looked so big and her voice was so solemn when she babbled these names that her mother asked her one day what she thought these men looked like Oh gasped Clara Papa always says the great president so I guess he s almost a giant I guess the president is as big as the meeting house and prob ly the vice president is the size of the school house The school teacher sisters were busy with Clara so that she was reading and spelling almost as soon as she could talk One of these gave her a geography and Clara was so excited over it that she used to wake this poor sister up long before daylight and make her hold a candle close to the maps so that she could find rivers mountains and cities Stephen Barton the older brother was a wonder in arithmetic It was he who taught Clara how to add subtract multiply and divide She made such good figures and so often had the examples right that she enjoyed her little slate next best to riding horseback with her brother David David did not care much for study but did like farm work and horses He taught Clara to ride and the two used to gallop across the country at a mad pace She felt as safe on the back of a horse as in a rocking chair She did not look much larger than a doll when the neighbors first noticed her dashing by on the back of a colt which wore neither saddle nor bridle clinging to the animal s mane keeping close to David s horse and laughing with joy Sometimes Button the white dog tore along after them trying his best to keep up with them Button belonged to Clara He had taken care of her when she was a baby and very gravely picked her up each time she fell in the days when she was learning to walk Stephen and David went to a school that was several miles away They wanted to take Clara with them It was one of the old fashioned ungraded schools and the pupils were all ages The snowdrifts were high and Stephen carried Clara on his shoulder Clara sat very quiet with her slate until the primer class was called Then she stepped before the teacher with the other little ones The serious man pointed to the letters of different words for each child then he asked them to spell short words like dog and cat When Clara was asked to do the same she smiled at the teacher and said But I do not spell there Where do you spell he inquired I spell in artichoke she answered looking very dignified In that case he laughed I think you belong with the scholars who spell in three and four syllables So after that she spelled in the class of her big brothers When Clara was twelve she was very shy of strangers and her parents thought it might help her to get over it if she went away from home to school in New York She was a bright pupil and decided she would like to be a teacher like her two sisters Clara made an excellent teacher but was not very well and went to Washington D C to work While there the Civil War broke out and she offered her services as a nurse Nobody doubted she would be good at nursing for when she was only ten years old she took all the care of her dear brother David who was sick for nearly two years She really knew just exactly what sick people needed Clara worked in hospitals camps and battlefields all the time the four years war lasted Sometimes she had to jump on to a horse whose rider had been shot and dash away for bandages or a surgeon and she was glad enough that David had taught her to be such a fine horsewoman Clara helped every sick and wounded man she came across and some people thought she should only help the northerners But she did not mind what anybody said or thought She made all the soldiers as comfortable as she could And she was delighted when four years later while she was in beautiful Switzerland for a rest she heard of the Red Cross Society This society helped every wounded person no matter what color he was no matter what cause or country he fought for Clara Barton worked with this Swiss society all through the war between France and Prussia The foreigners called her the Angel When Clara Barton came back to America she tried a long time to have a branch of the Swiss society started in this country but it was eight years before the Red Cross Society was actually formed in America Then because there was often sickness and suffering from fires and floods as well as from wars Miss Barton persuaded Congress to say that the society might help wherever there had been any great disaster Miss Barton s name is known in Europe as well as in America She did Red Cross work until she was eighty years old Almost every country on the globe gave her a present or medal When we think what a heroine Clara Barton proved herself it would seem as if the little girl born on the sunny December morning was a Christmas present to the whole world ABRAHAM LINCOLN The more you find out about Abraham Lincoln the more you will love him Abraham was born in Kentucky and lived in that State with his parents and his one sister until he was eight years old The Lincolns were very very poor They lived in a small log cabin on the banks of a winding creek They need not have been quite so poor but the truth of the matter is that mister Thomas Lincoln Abraham s father was lazy To be sure he fastened a few logs together for shelter cut a little wood and dug up some ground for a garden But after the corn and potatoes were planted they never received any care and there is no doubt the family would have gone hungry many a day if Abraham had not hurried home with fish which he caught in a near by stream or if missus Lincoln had not taken her rifle into the woods and shot a deer or a bear The meat from these would last for weeks and the skins of animals missus Lincoln always saved to make into clothes for the children Thomas Lincoln could not read or spell and as near as I can find out was not a bit ashamed of it either But his wife Nancy Hanks Lincoln was a fair scholar and taught Abraham and his sister Sarah to read and spell There was no floor to the Lincoln s log cabin and no furnishings but a few three legged stools and a bed made of wooden slats fastened together with pegs Abraham and Sarah slept on piles of leaves or brush Slates and pencils were scarce and Abraham used to lie before the fire when he was seven or eight years old with a flat slab of wood and a stick which he burned at one end till it was charred then he formed letters with it on the wood In that way he taught himself to write His mother had three books a Bible a catechism and a spelling book He had never had any boy playmate and was greatly excited when an aunt and uncle of his mother s mister and missus Sparrow with a nephew named Dennis Hanks arrived at the creek and lived in a half faced camp near by Dennis and Abraham became fast friends A fever swept the country and Abraham s mother died Three years later his father married a new wife The second missus Lincoln had been married before and had three children a boy and two girls So there were five children to play together mister Lincoln had built a better cabin and she brought such furniture as the Lincoln children had never seen Their eyes opened wide at the sight of real chairs and tables She made Abraham and Sarah pretty new clothes They had neat comfortable beds and the two sets of children were very happy missus Lincoln loved Abraham and saw that there was the making of a smart man in him She helped him study and when there was school for a short time in a distant log hut she sent Abraham every day When the school ended there were four years when there was no school anywhere near their settlement so she read with Abraham and kept him at his lessons in reading and arithmetic all that time Hunters and traders rode that way sometimes and if a traveler had a book about him Abraham was sure to get a look at it A new settler had a Life of Washington Abraham looked at the book hungrily for weeks and finally worked up courage to ask the loan of it He promised to take good care of it He was then earning money to give his parents by chopping down trees in the forests and he had no time to read but in the evenings One night the rain soaked through the cracks of the cabin and the precious book that he had promised to take good care of was stained on every page What was he to do He had no money to pay for the book but he hurried to the settler s cabin and told him what had happened He offered to work in the cornfield for three days to pay mister Crawford for the loss of the book It was heavy work but he did it and in the end owned the stained Life of Washington himself Abraham had a fine memory He could repeat almost the whole of a sermon a speech or a story that he had happened to hear He had a funny way of telling stories too so when the farmers or woodchoppers were taking their noon rest they always asked him to amuse them When Abraham was sixteen years old he was six feet tall and so strong that all the neighbors hired him whenever he was not working for his father He joked and laughed at his work and every one liked him He did any kind of work to earn an honest penny Once he had a fine time working for a man that ran a ferry boat because this man owned a history of the United States and took a newspaper and Abraham had more to read than ever before in his life But he had to take the time he should have slept to read because when the boat wasn t running there was farm work housework for he helped this man s wife even to tending the baby and rail splitting Then he kept store for a man It was here that he won a nickname that he kept all his life Honest Abe A woman s bill came to two dollars and six cents Later in the day Abraham found he had charged her six cents too much After he closed the store that night he walked three miles to pay her back those six cents Another time when he weighed tea for a woman there was a weight on the scales so that she did not get as much tea as she paid for That meant another long tramp But he was liked for his honesty and good nature When there was trouble with the Indians Abraham proved that he could fight and also manage troops so he was a captain for three months Abraham was so well informed that the people sent him to legislature They made him postmaster They hired him to lay out roads and towns It became the fashion if there was need of some honest skilful work for people to say Why not get Abraham Lincoln to do it Then you ll know it s done right He studied law went to legislature again and became a circuit judge This meant that he had to ride all round the country to attend different courts He would start off on horseback to be away three months with saddle bags holding clean linen an old green umbrella and a few books to read as he rode along When he came to woodchoppers as he rode through forests he liked to dismount ask for an axe and chop a log so quickly that the men would stare Abraham Lincoln settled with his wife and children in Springfield Illinois He was a lawyer but would not take a case if he thought his client was guilty He was still Honest Abe He loved children and usually when he went to his office in the morning the baby was perched on his shoulder while the others held on to his coat tails and followed behind All the children in Springfield felt he was their friend No wonder for he was never too busy to help them One morning as he was hurrying to his law office he saw a little girl very much dressed up crying as if her heart would break Her sobs almost shook her off the doorstep where she sat mister Lincoln unlatched the gate and went up the walk singing out Well well now what does all this mean Oh mister Lincoln I was going to Chicago to visit my aunt I have my ticket in my purse and here the sobs came faster than ever the expressman can t get here in time for my trunk How big is your trunk This size stretching her hands apart Pooh I ll carry that trunk to the station for you myself Where is it The little girl pointed to the hall and in a minute mister Lincoln with his tall silk hat on his head his long coat tails flying out behind the trunk on his shoulder was striding to the railroad station as the now happy little girl skipped beside him He was not going to have the child disappointed Illustration How big is your trunk Page eighty eight mister Lincoln had a big heart It never bothered him to stop long enough to do a kindness One bitterly cold day he saw an old man chopping wood He was feeble and was shaking with the cold mister Lincoln watched him for a few minutes and then asked him how much he was to be paid for the whole lot One dollar he answered and I need it to buy shoes I should think you did said the lawyer noticing that the poor old man s toes showed through the holes of those he was wearing Then he gently took the axe from the man s hands and said You go in by the fire and keep warm and I ll do the wood mister Lincoln made the chips fly He chopped so fast that the passers by never stopped talking about it Abraham Lincoln was known to be honest unselfish and clear headed He had grown very wise by much reading and study Finally the people of the United States paid him the greatest honor that can come to an American They made him President Yes this man who had taught himself to write in the Kentucky log cabin was President of the United States As President mister Lincoln lived in style at the White House But he was just the same quiet modest man that he had always been He was busier that was all When President Lincoln spoke to the people or sent letters messages they are called to Congress every one said What a brain that man has But he used very short simple words Once he gave a reason for this He said it used to make him angry when he was a child to hear the neighbors talk to his father in a way that he could not understand He would lie awake sometimes half the night trying to think what they meant When he thought he had at last got the idea he would put it into the simplest words he knew so that any boy would know what was meant This got to be a habit and even in his great talk at Gettysburg the beautiful words are short and plain One day when Lincoln was running the ferry boat for the man I have spoken of before he saw at one of the river landings some negro slaves getting a terrible beating by their master He was only a boy but he never forgot the sight and one of the things he brought about when he became President of the United States was the freedom of the black people There are a great many lives and stories about Lincoln which you will read and enjoy and it is certain that the more you know of this great man Dear Honest Abe the better you will love him ROBERT EDWARD LEE Small Robert Lee of Virginia aged five was playing one day with another boy of his own age whose mother was visiting missus Lee The Lees had lived for two centuries in the beautiful brick mansion Stratford on the Potomac River While the boys played on the veranda there was the sound of busy feet inside the house and an air of bustle and hurrying to and fro Robert knew the cause of this and was feeling very happy His father Colonel Robert E Lee was coming home from Mexico where he had done brave things in the Mexican War The story of this had been in the papers and though Robert had not seen his father for two years and sometimes could not remember just how he looked he knew from the way people mentioned Colonel Lee s name that he was a man to be proud of When Eliza Robert s black mammy called him in to be dressed there was trouble He would not wear what she had ready for him He was the Colonel s namesake and if his father was coming home nothing was nice enough but his best frock of blue and white Small Robert had his way about the frock His hair was freshly curled and he rushed down to the broad hall where the family were waiting for Colonel Lee The lady visitor had pinned a rose in her hair and the other little boy had been dressed in his prettiest clothes Pretty soon there were shouts of Here he comes here he comes and they could see Colonel Lee in a handsome uniform riding his chestnut horse Grace Darling He sprang from the horse and up the steps and when he had greeted the older ones he sang out Where s my little boy where s Robbie He seized the child nearest him and kissed him half a dozen times But it wasn t Robert that he kissed It was the other boy For a minute Robert cried but his father had plenty of kisses for him when he found what a mistake he had made and he whispered something to Robert that made everything all right There was a mustang pony on the way from Mexico for his little son This pony was pure white A faithful Irish servant taught Robert to ride in a short time and he was the proudest boy in the world when he rode out on Santa Anna beside his father on Grace Darling Robert bragged a good deal to his playmates about Grace Darling because she had carried his father all through the Mexican War and had the scars of seven bullets on her sides Colonel Lee loved animals and taught all his children to be kind to their pets When the family lived in Arlington Spec a lively black and tan terrier went everywhere with them even to church Colonel Lee thought he made the children restless so one Sunday when they started for church he shut Spec in a chamber in the second story Spec looked out of the window for awhile It was open and he soon made up his mind that he would rather be with his friends So he jumped to the ground ran as fast as he could and walked into the pew just behind the family After that he was allowed to go to church every Sunday Colonel Robert E Lee was a very handsome man When he and missus Lee were going out in the evening the children always begged to sit up and see them start They never saw any man or any picture of a man they thought so beautiful as their own father General Lee was not just a good leader of soldiers he knew how to make everyone mind and although he was the best playmate his children had he was very firm with them No slipshod ways were allowed in his house No indeed If his boys and girls were not tidy about their clothes faithful in their lessons polite and truthful they found their father stern enough When their father was so quick at sports and games and could plan such perfectly splendid holidays it did seem pretty hard to the Lee children that he was so often sent away on war duties But wherever he was he found time from his military affairs to write long letters to his children and these were so playful and told of so many strange things that it partly made up for his absence The neighboring playmates used to watch for those letters almost as eagerly as the family and probably they envied the Lee children sometimes when their father came for a visit wearing some new honor or title For as he was wise and good and brave he did not fail to rise higher and higher in rank His father had been a general under George Washington and had taught his son that there is no grander honor for a man than to defend his country And in order that Robert should make a fine soldier he had been trained at West Point When he had proved how keen and skilful he was Abraham Lincoln then president of the United States asked Robert E Lee who had become a general to take command of all the armies of the Union But general Lee was much troubled in his mind Just then there was danger of the northern and southern States fighting against each other If the people of the different States should really grow so angry that they came to blows Lee felt he must stand by Virginia because that was his father s State Indeed the Lees had lived there since sixteen forty two and Robert Lee loved every inch of its soil He felt sad enough when he found there must be fighting but he could not accept Lincoln s offer so he gave up his high place in the United States Army and took the post of Major general among the Virginian soldiers Then the Lee family had to do without their father and chum for four long years They had grown up by this time and all their childhood pets were dead Grace Darling s place was taken by Traveller an iron gray horse with black points He was so large and strong it did not seem possible to tire him out He carried General Lee all through the Civil War He often went cold and hungry but he loved his master and would come when he heard the general s whistle or call no matter how far away he might be The soldiers loved Lee too and they obeyed his slightest wish The Civil War was long and cruel as all war is and at the end Lee had to yield because his men were starving But he is counted as one of the greatest generals known in history and his fame will never die The little Robert E Lee who rode the mustang pony is now a gray haired man He has written the life of his father and has told how General Lee became a college president after the War The students loved their president as well as the soldiers loved their general and they always felt proud of him as he went galloping past them on dear old Traveller after the duties were over for the day Good old Traveller deserved a medal if ever a horse did for sharing the dangers of her gallant master General Robert E Lee JOHN JAMES AUDUBON Have you ever happened to see a book that cost a thousand dollars A man who loved birds and knew a great deal about them drew pictures of all the kinds to be found in our country calling these drawings when they were colored and bound together The Birds of North America It took four volumes to hold all these pictures and each one of these books costs a thousand dollars There were only seventy five or eighty of these sets of bird books made but you can see them in the Boston Public Library the Lenox and Astor libraries in New York city and at several colleges and private homes Each one of these books is more than three feet long and a little over two feet wide and is so heavy that it takes two strong men to lift it on to a rack when some one wants to look at the pictures If you should look through all four books you would see more than a thousand kinds of birds all drawn as big as life and each one colored like the bird itself You may be sure it took the maker of these books many many years to travel all over the United States to find such a number of birds The man s name was John James Audubon He slept in woods waded through marshes and swamps tramped hundreds of miles and suffered many hardships before he could learn the colors and habits of so many birds He always said his love for birds began when his pet parrot was killed It happened this way One morning when John James was about four years old and his nurse was giving him his breakfast the little parrot Mignonne who said a lot of words as plainly as a child asked for some bread and milk A tame monkey who was in the room happened to be angry and sulking over something He sprang at Mignonne who screamed for help Little John James shouted too and begged his nurse to save the bird but before any one could stop the ugly monkey s blows the parrot was dead The monkey was always kept chained after that and John James buried his parrot in the garden and trimmed the grave with shrubs and flowering plants But he missed his pet and so roamed through the woods adjoining his father s estate watching the birds that flew through them By and by he did not care for anything so much as trying to make pictures of these birds listening to their songs finding what kind of nests they built and at what time of year they flew north or south John James lived in Nantes France when he was a small boy although he was born in Louisiana His father was a wealthy French gentleman an officer in the French navy and was much in America so that John James was first in France and then in America until he was about twenty five at which time he settled in his native country for good Few men have loved these United States better than he John James did not care much for school Figures tired his head He loved music drawing and dancing His father was away from home most of the time and his pretty young stepmother let the boy do quite as he pleased She loved him dearly and as he liked to roam through the country with boys of his age she would pack luncheon baskets day after day for him and when he came back at dusk with the same baskets filled with birds eggs strange flowers and all sorts of curiosities she would sit down beside him and look them over as interested as could be Some years later when John James s father put him in charge of a large farm near Philadelphia the young man bought some fine horses some well trained dogs and spent long summer days in hunting and fishing He also got many breeds of fowl It is a wonder that with all the leisure hours he had and the large amount of spending money his father allowed him he did not get into bad habits but young Audubon ate mostly fruit and vegetables never touched liquor and chose good companions He did like fine clothes and about this time dressed rather like a fop I expect the handsome fellow made a pretty picture as he dashed by on his spirited black horse in his satin breeches silk stockings and pumps and the fine ruffled shirts which he had sent over from France Anyway a sweet young girl Lucy Bakewell lost her heart to him Only as she was very young her parents said she must not yet be married And while he was waiting for her he fixed over his house and with a friend mister Rozier and a good natured housekeeper lived a simple country life You would have enjoyed a visit to him about this time He turned the lower floor into a sort of museum The walls were festooned with birds eggs which had been blown out and strung on thread There were stuffed squirrels opossums and racoons and paintings of gorgeous colored birds hung everywhere Audubon had great skill in training animals and one dog Zephyr did wonderful tricks When Audubon and Lucy married they went to Kentucky where he and his friend Rozier opened a store But Rozier did most of the store work as Audubon was apt to wander off to the woods for he had already decided to make this book about birds His mind was not on his business as you can see when I tell you that one day he mailed a letter with eight thousand dollars in it and never sealed it The only part of the business he enjoyed were the trips to New York and Philadelphia to buy goods These goods were carried on the backs of pack horses and a good part of the journeys led through forests He lost the horses for a whole day once because he heard a song bird that was new to him and as he followed the sound of the bird so as to get a sight of it he forgot all about the pack horses and the goods By and by his best friends said he acted like a crazy man Only his wife and family stood by him Finally when his money was gone and there were two children growing up things looked rather desperate But Lucy his wife said You are a genius and you know more about birds than any one living I am sure all you need is time to show the world how clever you are I will earn money while you study and paint So Audubon traveled to seek out the haunts of still more birds while Lucy went as governess in rich families or opened private schools where she could teach her own two boys as well as others She earned a great deal of money and when he had made all his pictures and was ready to publish the books she had nearly enough to pay the expense and gave it to him No he said I am going to earn part of this myself I will open a dancing class He had danced beautifully ever since he was a child and could not understand how people could be so awkward and stupid as his class of sixty Kentuckians proved to be In their first lesson he broke his bow and almost ruined his beautiful violin in his excitement and temper Why watch me he cried and he danced to his own music so charmingly that the class clapped their hands and said they would do their best to copy him By and by they did better and before he left them they quite satisfied him And what was fortunate for him they had paid him two thousand dollars With this and Lucy s earnings he went to England and had the famous drawings published When they were done he exhibited them at the Royal Institute charging admission and earned many pounds more Audubon was a lovable courteous man never too poor to help others very modest and gracious He adored his wife and as his books he wrote many volumes of his travels which I hope you will read some day brought in quite a fortune the two with their sons and their grandchildren spent their last days in great comfort on a fine estate on the Hudson River ROBERT FULTON When Robert Fulton was a little boy in Pennsylvania he never minded being called to his lessons with his mother for she was a famous Irish beauty and Robert loved to look at her She was good natured too and told him far more interesting stories than he found in the lesson books It was quite a different matter when Robert was sent at the age of eight to a school kept by Caleb Johnson a Quaker gentleman With mister Johnson Robert found lessons rather stupid affairs He missed the stories his mother always wove in with the books they read together Besides Robert had taken some toys and old clocks to pieces and he was busy planning how he could make some himself if he but had the tools Sometimes Caleb Johnson spoke to him two or three times before Robert heard him The old Quaker thought the boy was wasting precious time so he feruled him every day This was way back just before the Revolutionary War and in those days every school teacher kept a stout stick on his desk called a ferule with which to slap the naughty pupils hands The ferule always made the hand burn and sting and if the teacher were harsh he sometimes blistered a boy s hand One time after the Quaker had used the ferule on Robert until his own arm ached he cried There that will make you do something I guess But answered Robert I came here Sir to have something beaten into my head not into my knuckles Robert was keener on making things than on learning lessons One morning he did not get to the schoolhouse until nearly noon and mister Johnson exclaimed Now mister Tardy Boy where have you been At mister Miller s shop pounding out a lead for my pencil I want you to look at it It is the best one I ever had And the teacher had to admit that he never saw a better one Another time Robert told the Quaker teacher that he was so busy thinking up new ideas that he did not have any room in his mind for storing away what was in dusty books Robert loved pictures There was a large portrait of his beautiful mother painted by Benjamin West which hung in the parlor and he had often wished to try and make one like it He had not been long at school before a seat mate brought to school some paints and brushes belonging to an older brother As the war was waging the people had hard work to get luxuries or money to buy them with so Robert quite envied the boy such a prize He begged to try them and he made such wonderful pictures pictures so much better than any one else in school could make that the owner gave the whole outfit to him About this time Robert was always buying little packages of quicksilver He was trying experiments with it but he wouldn t tell the other boys what they were So they nicknamed him Quicksilver Bob Of course the men in shops where firearms were made and repaired were very busy Quicksilver Bob went to these shops every day The men liked him and as he talked with them he often made suggestions that they were glad to follow That boy will do something big some of these days they would say to each other When Robert was fourteen he met a boy who worked in a machine shop by the name of Christopher Grumpf This boy was eighteen and his father was a fine fisherman who knew where the largest number of fish could be caught and he took the two boys up and down the river in a flat bottomed boat that was pushed along by the means of two long poles The boat was clumsy and this poling made the boys arms ache Robert kept thinking there must be a better way of getting that boat through the water He went away to visit his aunt but worked all the time on a set of paddles and the model of a boat on which they could be built He tried a set of these paddles on mister Grumpf s boat when he got home and they worked so well that mister Grumpf never used the poles again on his fishing trips He found the paddles saved him from having lame muscles Robert and his playmates had fine times watching the two thousand troops stationed in Lancaster These were British prisoners Some of them were kept in the barracks the officers lodged in private houses and the Hessian troops some of whom had their wives with them lived in square huts of mud and sod This colony of Hessians greatly interested the boys of the village and Robert drew capital pictures of them for he had been practising sketching and painting all his spare time In fact he decided at the age of seventeen to go to the city of Philadelphia and make a business of painting portraits and miniatures For four years he lived there earning a good deal of money and sending the greater part of it home to his mother Among the many pleasant friends he made in Philadelphia was Benjamin Franklin mister Franklin and most of his wealthy patrons advised Robert to go to Europe and take painting lessons of Benjamin West Before he went Robert bought a farm for his mother and sisters He never forgot to see that his mother was comfortable Robert had been thinking for years how fine it would be if boats did not have to depend on sails but could be sent through the water by steam Over in Europe he met a lord who was making plans for canals and while talking with him he grew more interested than ever in ways of traveling by water So although he painted enough portraits to lay away money for a rainy day he studied all the rules for building canals and about the machinery that goes in boats Certainly he was busier than when as a boy he told Caleb Johnson there was no time for dusty books when his mind was holding so many new ideas for he learned three or four languages invented the first panorama ever shown in France a machine for cutting marble another for twisting rope and a torpedo boat to be used in warfare Only you must not think that because he had so many clever notions about the implements of war he believed in nations killing each other off no indeed He stood for peace more than a hundred and fifty years ago before there was so much said and done to encourage it He said The art of Peace should be the study of every young American He stayed seven years in France and was pointed out wherever he went as that talented young foreigner He lived most of the time with an American gentleman mister Joel Barlow and his wife They were very fond of Fulton and believed that the experiments he was trying to make vessels go by steam would prove a success They nicknamed him Toot because every evening in his room he was running a tiny model of a steam engine across his work table which gave shrill whistles now and then For as much as thirty years men in Europe and America had been trying to make vessels run by steam when Fulton finally succeeded in doing it He built a boat which was fitted with a steam engine and gave it a trial on the river Seine Something broke which let the vessel down on to the river s bottom but Fulton soon had another puffing its way up and down a section of the Seine while the people on the banks cheered and wondered Fulton returned to America and built a steamer which he intended to run on the Hudson River He named it the Clermont but it was generally spoken of as Fulton s Folly by the crowds who watched its building The loungers who stood about jeering at the inventor were so disrespectful as they watched the last few days work that Fulton feared they would smash it in pieces and hired a guard to protect it It was four years after Fulton had shown the model boat on the Seine in France that he started the Clermont up the Hudson River in his own country There were not thirty people in New York city who believed the steamer would go a mile in an hour A few friends went aboard with the inventor to make the trial trip but they looked frightened and worried The Clermont was a clumsy affair its machinery creaked and groaned no whistle seemed to work so a horn was blown whenever the boat approached a landing The crew carried on enough wood at each landing to last till they reached another This wood was pine and whenever the engineer stirred the coals a lot of sparks flew into the air and black smoke poured from the funnel The crews on the ordinary sailing vessels were afraid of this strange craft that went chugging by them and some of the sailors were in such a panic that they left their vessels and ran into the woods declaring there was a horrible monster afloat on the water Well the Clermont proved a great convenience on the Hudson River It ran as a packet boat for years and Fulton built other steamers He realized that it would mean a great deal to America if some quick cheap method of carrying people and freight along the great Missouri and Mississippi rivers could be used His invention of the steamboat has given him the name of the Father of Steam Navigation and it has been a blessing to the whole world Besides being a wonderful inventor Robert Fulton was a polished gentleman He was tall and handsome like his mother as gentle as a child and he had a charming way of talking so whether he spoke of America France steamboats or pictures there was always silence in the room Think of the old Quaker teacher Caleb Johnson trying to ferule a few ideas into Robert Fulton s head No doubt mister Johnson was worried but Robert s head proved to be an uncommonly wise one GEORGE PEABODY It was quite a while before you and I were born that a boy by the name of George Peabody lived in Danvers Massachusetts He had such good lessons in school that his teachers rather thought he would go to college but one day he took his books out of his desk and said he must leave school and go to work because his mother was very poor The teacher said We shall miss you George and hope you will have much good luck George was only eleven when this happened He was a round faced plucky little fellow with the good manners that generally go with a kind heart and there wasn t a lazy bone in his body mister Proctor the grocer thought he was just the kind of a boy he needed in his store So he hired him Right away the housekeepers in Danvers agreed that George Peabody was the nicest grocer boy they ever saw They said to each other it was worth the walk to the store to have him hand out their packages with his sunny smile his pleasant words and polite bow When he carried the heavier things like a bag of meal or a gallon of molasses home for them they would coax him to rest awhile and eat some fruit or cake They all liked to talk with him George stayed with mister Proctor four years Then he went to Vermont to help his grandfather mister Proctor almost cried when he saw the big stage coach rattle away in a cloud of dust while the boy who had been so faithful to his duties waved good by with his handkerchief as long as he could see When George was sixteen he joined his brother David who had a store in Newburyport The young people in this old sea port town made friends with him at once They asked him to every fishing party and picnic they had but he was usually too busy to go for besides selling goods all day he often wrote cards in a clear neat hand in his room evenings He spent almost nothing on himself but was as happy as could be when his letters to his mother held more money than usual His being poor did not matter The rich boys in Newburyport were glad to pay his share in games and excursions any time he could take a holiday just for the sake of having his lively company A fire destroyed David s store and George had to make a fresh start in Georgetown It was the same story there It was no time at all before the mayor of Georgetown said to the doctor and the minister I tell you George Peabody is a comfortable person to have round At twenty George did not have a dollar of his own but after the fire plenty of men offered to lend him money and he kept on working in his happy way until he was thirty five when he found himself rich enough to go to London and not only have stores but to open a bank too Then Englishmen began to find out what a comfortable man George Peabody was to have round He had no wife and lived rather simply himself but was glad to spend a great deal on other folks He found the working men lived in filthy unhealthy places so he built a great square almost a little village of neat pretty working men s homes In his will he left the poor of London half a million dollars Then when it was feared that Sir John Franklin the great arctic explorer was lost and there was need to send men to search for him George Peabody said Let me help I ll fit out a ship and he paid for everything that went aboard the Advance You understand now why you find on the geography maps a point way up north called Peabody s Land The Englishmen took a strong liking to this sociable American who had settled among them and it was thought a great treat to go round to his rooms in the evening and have a game of backgammon or whist after a jolly dinner at which mister Peabody always told funny stories He had a fine memory and a real gift for story telling He loved music and was delighted when people would sing Scotch songs for him Living in England many years did not make mister Peabody love America any the less When the great Crystal Palace was built in which to hold a sort of World s Fair there were to be shown samples of things made by different countries The papers were full of talk about this grand affair One morning mister Peabody opened his paper at the breakfast table and read an article which ridiculed the looks of the rooms or stalls set apart for American products I tell you it did not take him long to eat his breakfast He said I guess I ll see about this I guess my own country is not going to be made fun of He did not abuse the man who wrote the article but he went right to the Crystal Palace to find out how our things did look He knew the minute he got there that our agents did not have money enough to work with So he just opened his purse and wrote letters and offered advice until in the end the American stalls were decorated in exquisite taste and when there were such things shown as Powers s Greek Slave a wonderful statue the very useful reaping machine of McCormack s Colt s revolvers and the printing press of Hoe with many other interesting things the visitors to the fair agreed that few countries had more to their credit than America Then the English papers behaved very handsomely and spoke so well of our exhibit that I expect if George Peabody read the last article at his breakfast table he may have chuckled to himself and said I ll risk America every time He noticed while at the fair how well the Crystal Palace was suited for large gatherings it is mostly of iron and glass with two immense glittering towers and decided he would give a big dinner on the Fourth of July to all the Americans in London This dinner proved a grand affair The Duke of Wellington and many famous English people were present It was such a success that ever after as long as he lived George Peabody gave a Fourth of July dinner in Crystal Palace Queen Victoria so deeply esteemed mister Peabody that she sent a message to him that she wished to make him a baronet and confer the Order of the Bath upon him And what word do you suppose he sent back Why he said I am going over to America pretty soon to visit the town where I was born and as I do not care one bit about titles and such things but do value your interest and friendship I wish you would just write me a letter which I may read to my friends in America who love you as I do The queen wrote a long affectionate letter to him saying what a blessing he had been to England and asked him to accept her portrait So when Danvers a part of which had been set off into a new town by itself and named Peabody for the faithful grocer boy who had become the rich banker was to have its hundredth birthday George Peabody crossed the ocean to be there He gave to his native town a free library and lecture hall and the portrait of Queen Victoria This miniature was so set with gold and jewels as to cost fifty thousand dollars The queen s letter is kept there to this day mister Peabody gave money for museums at Yale and Harvard an Academy of Science at Salem a memorial church at Georgetown the birthplace of his mother and large sums of money for schools in the South because he realized that after the Civil War there would be much disorder and poverty Some men could not have kept perfectly friendly with two countries but mister Peabody loved both England and America and in all he did and said tried to bind the two nations together The very last time he spoke in public was at the National Peace Jubilee in Boston When George Peabody died the queen wanted him buried in Westminster Abbey and when she found he had left a request to be taken to America she sent a ship the Monarch across the Atlantic Ocean with his body A good many lives and stories have been written about George Peabody and he has earned several names like The Great Philanthropist The Merchant Prince the Ambassador of Peace the Friend of the Poor and so forth but none fit him any better than the saying He was a comfortable man to have round DANIEL WEBSTER Before New England became such a busy hurried sort of a place say a hundred years ago its men and women had time to listen to sermons that were more than an hour long or to lecturers who talked three or four hours When a public speaker used very fine words and could keep the people who listened to him wide awake and eager to hear more he was called a great orator An orator who dazzled our grandfathers and grandmothers was named Daniel Webster He has been dead a long time but the public speeches he made will never be forgotten Down in the business part of Boston can be seen on a large building a tablet which reads The Home of Daniel Webster On the terraced lawn of Massachusetts State house stands a bronze statue of Daniel Webster And in old Faneuil Hall Boston which is called the Cradle of Liberty there is a huge painting as long as well as long as a street car which is called Webster s Reply to Hayne In this picture there are the portraits of one hundred and thirty senators and other men but all of them are watching Daniel Webster This is a picture well worth seeing and Webster was well worth hearing Daniel Webster was born in New Hampshire When he was a year old his parents moved onto a farm which they called The Elms on account of the fine old trees which grew there The older Webster boys did all kinds of heavy work but as Daniel was not very strong he was petted and as he grew up was asked to do only very light work He rode the plow horse in the fields drove the cows to pasture and tended logs in his father s sawmill When he was sent to do this last he always took a book along because it took twenty minutes for the saw to work its teeth through one of the tree trunks and he could not bear to waste all that time He learned to read from his mother and sister almost as soon as he could talk and he pored over the Bible for hours at a time Daniel s father kept a tavern besides carrying on his farm The teamsters who got their dinners there used to ask Daniel to read to them His voice was deep and musical and he gave such meaning to the words of the Bible that they thought him a wonder His eyes were like black velvet and his hair was as black and shiny as the feathers of a crow Every one called him little black Dan Daniel read everything he could find and could recite whole poems and chapters of books when he was quite small At a country store just across the road from his father s tavern he bought a cotton pocket handkerchief on which the Constitution of the United States was printed After looking at the eagles and flags which were printed as a border he sat down under one of the giant elm trees and learned by heart every word printed there Daniel liked to wander along the banks of the Merrimac River and as he played in the fields and woods he learned a great deal about animals and plants Robert Wise taught him to fish for the salmon and shad that were plenty about there Robert Wise was an old English sailor who lived with his wife in a cottage on the Webster farm He told Daniel famous stories of the strange countries he had sailed to This man could not read so he felt well repaid for carrying little black Dan on his shoulder or paddling him up and down streams half a day at a time if the boy would go after supper to his cottage and read aloud to him from books or newspapers Daniel loved all outdoor beauty the sun moon and stars the ocean and the wind In almost every one of the great speeches that he made as a middle aged or old man he mentioned them In the state of New Hampshire when Daniel was a boy teachers and schools were scarce A man or a woman would teach a few weeks in one town and then move on to another They were called traveling teachers This was done because there were not anywhere near enough teachers to go round and it was thought only fair that each little village or town should get its few weeks Daniel followed these traveling teachers a long time every year sometimes walking two or three miles a day at other times boarding away from home Nothing was taught in these schools but reading and writing Daniel was an almost perfect reader but a poor writer One of Daniel s teachers wanted his pupils to know good poems and chapters of books by heart He offered a prize a jack knife to the one who should learn the most verses from the Bible One after another was called upon to recite They had found it rather hard and many of them had learned but eight or ten verses at the most When it was Daniel s turn he recited chapter after chapter He kept on and on until it was time for the teacher to dismiss school mister Tappan said Well there is no doubt you deserve the prize How many more chapters did you learn Oh a lot more answered Dan laughing After Daniel was twelve he began to grow stronger and did his share of work on the farm One day when he was helping his father in the hayfield mister Webster said Daniel it is the men who have fine educations that succeed in this world I do not intend that you shall be a drudge all your days I am going to send you through college Illustration He rode there on horseback Page one hundred twenty nine Daniel was so pleased at this that he sat right down on the hay and cried When Daniel was fitting for college at Exeter he was about the brightest pupil there but it did seem funny that the boy who was to one day be a great orator could not then declaim or recite before the school He would learn the nicest pieces and practise them in his own room but when he stood up before all the scholars and teachers his courage left him Sometimes when his name was called he could not rise from his seat He was very much ashamed of himself and shed a good many tears over his shyness But he persevered and finally did better than any of the boys There is nothing like trying things enough times When Daniel went to Dartmouth College he rode there on horseback carrying his feather bed blankets clothes and books on his horse He was still such a dark looking person that the students thought he was an Indian Daniel studied law and made very fine pleas in the courtrooms He was a senator in Congress a secretary of state and a public speaker who was admired in England as well as in America mister Webster had a wife and children He bought a large estate at Marshfield in Massachusetts where the family spent many summers He loved children and animals was kind to the poor and bought the freedom of several slaves He was very neat in dress His favorite costume for court and senate was a blue coat with brass buttons a buff waistcoat and black trousers Daniel Webster always liked to look up old friends and was never cold or haughty to any one Once when he was going through the West making famous speeches in the different cities a man crowded forward to speak to him saying Why is this little black Dan that used to water my horses The dignified orator did not mind a bit Yes he laughed I m little black Dan grown up Daniel was a good son to the father who had tried hard to make him a fine scholar Only once did he disappoint him That was when he refused to be clerk of court When his father begged him to take that place he said No father I am going to use my tongue in courts not my pen I mean to be an orator He proved to be one of America s great ones AUGUSTUS saint GAUDENS Augustus saint Gaudens was a sculptor He made wonderful figures of our American heroes No matter how often we are told of the brave deeds of Lincoln Sherman Shaw and Farragut we shall remember these men longer because of saint Gaudens s statues of them Although Augustus was the son of a French shoemaker named Bernard Paul saint Gaudens and a young Irish girl of Dublin who lost her heart to Bernard as she sat binding slippers in the same shop where he made shoes we call him an American for a great famine swept Ireland when little Augustus was only six months old and the young parents sailed to America with all haste They landed in Boston where the mother and baby waited for the father to find work in New York He soon sent for them and as Augustus and his two brothers grew up in that city and always lived in this country he seems to belong to us Shoemakers as a rule are not rich men and mister saint Gaudens did not pay very strict attention to his work for he joined so many societies and clubs that these took his time His patrons would never have had their shoes made or mended if he had not hired help Then also his sons learned to cobble shoes very young Before Augustus went into his father s shop to work and when he had a good many hours out of school he found the busy streets of New York exciting enough He was laughing and merry so that he made friends from the Bowery to Central Park He had only to sniff hungrily at the bakery to have the good natured German cook toss him out brown sugar cakes and if he fell off the wharves or ran too near big fire engines some kind policeman rescued him He was not a bad boy Probably the worst thing he did was to join some other boys in the string joke They used to tie strings from the seats of the bakery wagons to the posts of high stoops and watch these strings knock off hats as men hurried by Sundays were gala days If the sun shone all the boys in the neighborhood went over to New Jersey on the ferry boat Augustus s father always gave him and his brothers five cents each Two cents took a boy over to New Jersey two cents brought him back and there was the other cent for candy or gum It was good sport to chase each other through the green fields hunt birds nests and climb trees but the best fun came on the way back when the boys sat in a long row at the front of the boat letting their legs dangle over the edge watching the life on the river When Augustus went to school at the age of ten he did more drawing on his slate than arithmetic How the pupils craned their necks to see his pictures He did not draw just one man a bird or a single house but whole armies shooting guns and cannon These soldiers looked alive On his way home Augustus was apt to draw charcoal sketches on every white house he passed The sketches were fine but the housekeepers scolded Few people noticed the real talent of the boy but one old doctor became much excited and urged Augustus s father to let him study art His father had seen very lifelike pictures of his own workshop and cobblers which Augustus had drawn and agreed that he would do what he could to help him Only Augustus must for a few more years earn money for the family So while he went to a night school for drawing lessons he cut cameos through the day My but the man who taught him cameo cutting was cross Augustus was scolded and driven to work faster all day long In spite of the terrible rages into which this stonecutter would go he was very artistic and Augustus learned how to cut wonderful heads of dogs horses and lions for scarf pins He made hundreds of lions heads and twenty years later when he was helping his brother model the lion figures for the Boston Public Library his hands fairly flew he knew all the lines so well When Augustus went in the evenings to the drawing classes at Cooper Union he began drawing human figures and was so eager about his art that he would have forgotten to eat or sleep if his mother had not watched him As he grew older he loved art more and more The only thing else that attracted his eye was the city full of soldiers at the beginning of the Civil War He read the bulletin boards heard groups of men telling about battles and his heart ached with love for America He wanted to go to war to show that love But his father was now sure that Augustus was a genius and insisted upon his going to Europe to study The father could not give him much money hardly more than enough to get him across the ocean but he could cut cameos to pay for his lessons Augustus stayed in Paris a year He made friends among the artists just as he had made them when a child in New York Then he worked four years in Rome He had a hard time there and grew thin for want of food and sleep but he was as eager as ever and worked faster and harder than before People began to visit his studio and always went away full of praise for the talented young man Rich Americans visiting in Rome urged him to return to this country They gave him orders and he finally came back to America where he was kept busy on busts and medallions until he began to have orders for monuments of great Americans This was work he liked He loved America and he was proud of her heroes Perhaps he loved Abraham Lincoln best of all He had seen Lincoln a good many times and he had read and studied about his beautiful life until every line of that man s face and figure was clear in his mind Still when he was asked to make a statue of Lincoln for the city of Chicago he worked on it many years On his statue of General Sherman which stands in Central Park New York he labored eleven years On the beautiful Robert Gould Shaw monument which stands in front of the State House in Boston he spent twelve years This does not mean that he stood with clay in his hands all this time but that from the time he began to plan what he would draw into the statue what size it ought to be and whether the man should be standing or sitting until it stood all finished he thought and worked a long long time His work is almost perfect and fine work always takes time and patience When busy on the Gould Shaw monument saint Gaudens often stood on a scaffolding ten hours at a time in the hottest summer days not eating anything but an apple He was so eager over his work that he did not want to lose a minute But he had some fun as well The horse he used as a model used to get terribly tired of standing so long and would snort and prance and paw the ground until it took several men to hold him And some of the negroes who posed nearly fainted when they saw saint Gaudens make faces that looked exactly like them with just a few pinches of his fingers on the soft clay They thought he was in league with Satan they said When you see this monument you will notice how brave Colonel Shaw looks riding on his large horse and how eagerly the colored troops march behind him saint Gaudens was very fond of Phillips Brooks the good Bishop and because of their friendship his statue of Brooks at Trinity Church Boston is so like the man that you almost expect to hear him speak as you stand before it saint Gaudens had been to concerts with Bishop Brooks had heard him preach had seen him merry and sad knew how unselfish he was and how much he liked to cheer people up and somehow managed to make his statue tell us all these traits There is no doubt saint Gaudens was one of the world s great sculptors but he would never have been great if he had not loved his art so well that he could go hungry cold and tired year after year for the sake of learning it And he was great because he was so determined to do his work over and over again until he felt it was just right He always urged students to do the same You can do anything you please he often said it s the way it s done that makes the difference Besides becoming famous the shoemaker s son was happy and rich in the end He had a wife and a son who among other books has written a life of his father From this book and by the stories saint Gaudens s friends tell of him we know that the sculptor was a gentle loving man who tried to help the world to be better and wiser It will not matter whether it is the statue of Sherman Logan Lincoln or Shaw by saint Gaudens that you are fortunate enough to see it will be the way any piece of his is done which makes it so beautiful and which makes Americans glad that almost every bit of his work has stayed in this country HENRY DAVID THOREAU Concord Massachusetts is one of the New England towns that everybody likes to visit When tourists reach Boston they usually make a point of going to Concord either by electric or steam train because they have read about its famous battle ground where the first British soldiers fell in the great Revolutionary War and because they want to see the very house in which Louisa May Alcott wrote Little Women and the homes of Hawthorne Emerson and Thoreau Henry Thoreau who was born in Concord loved the town so well that he spent most of his life tramping through its fields and forests You might say the business of his life was walking for he never had any real profession and he walked from four to eight hours a day across lots too He used to say roads were made for horses and business men Why what would become of us he would ask if we walked only in a garden or a mall What should we see When mister Thoreau started out for a long saunter in the woods he wore a wide brimmed straw hat stout shoes and strong gray trousers that would not show spots too easily and would stand tree climbing Under his arm he usually carried an old music book in which to press plants and in his pocket he kept a pencil his diary a microscope a jack knife and a ball of twine He and a friend William Ellery Channing agreed that a week s camping was more fun than all the books in the world Once they tried tramping and camping in Canada They wore overalls most of the time and wishing not to be bothered with trunks or suitcases they tied a few changes of clothing in bundles and each man took an umbrella They called themselves Knights of the Umbrella and Bundle The Thoreaus were rather a prominent family in Concord There were six of them all told The father mister John Thoreau was a pencil maker A hundred years ago this was a trade that brought good money mister Thoreau could turn out a great many pencils because all the children helped him make them He was a small man quite deaf and very shy He did not talk much But his wife missus Cynthia Thoreau who was half a head taller than he could and did talk enough for both She was handsome wide awake and had a strong sweet singing voice She took part in all the merry makings and also in all the church affairs in Concord She was bitter against slavery She used to call meetings at her house to talk over ways of putting an end to it and when slaves ran away from the South she often hid them in her home and helped them get further away She knew a great deal about nature bought a good many books for her children and was determined that they should have good educations Henry his brother John and the two sisters Helen and Sophia all taught school And Helen helped Henry earn money to go to Harvard College The whole Thoreau family were proud of Henry and his mother never tired of telling what fine letters and essays he could write She and Sophia went one day to call on an aunt of Ralph Waldo Emerson s Miss Mary Emerson who was eighty four missus Thoreau began to talk about Henry right away Miss Emerson nodded her head and said Very true now and then but kept her eyes shut every minute her callers stayed When they rose to go Miss Emerson said Perhaps you noticed missus Thoreau that I kept my eyes closed during your call I did so because I did not wish to look on the ribbons you are wearing so unsuitable for a child of God and a woman of your years Poor missus Thoreau was seventy and her bonnet was as bright and gay as it had been possible to buy for she loved rich colors and silks and velvets She did not mind Miss Emerson s rebuke a bit but Sophia stuffed her handkerchief in her mouth to keep from laughing aloud When Henry was a boy he used to delight in his Uncle Charles Dunbar who paid the family a visit every year mister Dunbar was not a worker like his sister Cynthia Thoreau He did not have any business but drifted about the country living by his wits One of his favorite tricks was to pretend to swallow all the knives and forks and a plate or two at a tavern and offer to give them back if the landlord would not charge for his dinner He was a great wrestler and could do sleight of hand tricks Henry used to watch him and ask question after question and he learned how to do a few tricks himself Just as his mother hoped when Henry grew up he decided to be a writer To be sure he taught school a while and gave lectures which people did not understand very well for he had strange ideas for those times but he wrote page after page sitting in the woods and liked that better than all else He first wrote an account of a week s trip on the Concord and Merrimac rivers This book did not sell very well and one time he carried home from the publishers seven hundred copies that no one would buy saying Well I have quite a respectably sized library now all my own writing too But four or five years later Thoreau built a hut on the shore of Walden Pond and lived there all alone like a hermit for two years He did this for two reasons because he wanted to prove that people spend too much time and money on food and clothes and because he wanted a perfectly quiet chance with no neighbors running in to write more books He said he spent but one hundred dollars a year while he lived in this hut He raised beans on his land ate wild berries caught fish and went visiting now and then I should not wonder if he often took a second helping of food when visiting To buy his woodsman s clothes and a few necessities he planted gardens painted houses and cut wood for his friends He wrote a book called Walden which tells all about these seven or eight hundred days he went a hermiting and after that several other books These sold very well In all of them he was rather fond of boasting that he had found the only sensible way to live I am for simple living he would say and always was declaring I love to be ALONE But sometimes people passing by the pond used to hear him whistling old ballads or playing very softly and beautifully on a flute and they thought he sounded lonely Although he makes you feel when you read his books that it is fine to roam the fields sniffing the wild grape and the yellow violets and that no one can find pleasure like the man who rows and skates and swims and tills the soil yet the question is bound to come Is a man all alone in a hut any better off than a jolly father in a big house playing games with his children Let me tell you too that after all Thoreau s talk about wanting to be alone the last year he lived in the hut he used to steal off just at twilight to a neighbor s house where there were little children While they curled up on a rug in front of the open fire he would draw near in a big rocking chair and sit for an hour or more telling them stories of his childhood He would pop corn make whistles for them with his jack knife or best of all do some of the juggling tricks which he had learned as a boy from his uncle Charles And one day he appeared at the door with a hay rack to give them a ride He had covered the bottom of the rack with deep hay then spread a buffalo robe over the hay to make it comfortable He sat on a board placed across the front and drove the span of horses and as he drove he told funny stories and sang songs till the children thought a hermit was a pretty good sort of a chum The hut went to pieces years ago and only a pile of stones marks the place where it stood but if you go to Concord you will find a pleasant street named for Thoreau and the house in which he lived the last twelve years of his life half hidden by tall trees And also you can read his books and learn how he enjoyed the woods and what beautiful things he found in them LOUISA MAY ALCOTT As much as seventy years ago in the city of Boston there lived a small girl who had the naughty habit of running away On a certain April morning almost as soon as her mother finished buttoning her dress Louisa May Alcott slipped out of the house and up the street as fast as her feet could carry her Louisa crept through a narrow alley and crossed several streets It was a beautiful day and she did not care so very much just where she went so long as she was having an adventure all by herself Suddenly she came upon some children who said they were going to a nice tall ash heap to play They asked her to join them Louisa thought they were fine playmates for when she grew hungry they shared some cold potatoes and bread crusts with her She would not have thought this much of a lunch in her mother s dining room but for an outdoor picnic it did very well When she tired of the ash heap she bade the children good by thanked them for their kindness and hop skipped to the Common where she must have wandered about for hours because all of a sudden it began to grow dark Then she wanted to get home She wanted her doll her kitty and her mother It frightened her when she could not find any street that looked natural She was hungry and tired too She threw herself down on some door steps to rest and to watch the lamplighter for you must remember this was long before there was any gas or electricity in Boston At this moment a big dog came along He kissed her face and hands and then sat down beside her with a sober look in his eyes as if he were thinking I guess Little Girl you need some one to take care of you Poor tired Louisa leaned against his neck and was fast asleep in no time The dog kept very still He did not want to wake her Pretty soon the town crier went by He was ringing a bell and reading in a loud voice from a paper in his hand the description of a lost child You see Louisa s father and mother had missed her early in the forenoon and had looked for her in every place they could think of Each hour they grew more worried and at dusk they decided to hire this man to search the city When the runaway woke up and heard what the man was shouting Lost Lost A little girl six years old in a pink frock white hat and new green shoes she called out in the darkness Why dat s ME The town crier took Louisa by the hand and led her home where you may be sure she was welcomed with joy mister and missus Alcott from first to last had had a good many frights about this flyaway Louisa Once when she was only two years old they were traveling with her on a steamboat and she darted away in some moment when no one was noticing her and crawled into the engine room to watch the machinery Of course her clothes were all grease and dirt and she might have been caught in the machinery and hurt You won t be surprised to know that the next day after this last affair Louisa s parents made sure that she did not leave the house Indeed to be entirely certain of her where abouts they tied her to the leg of a big sofa for a whole day Except for this one fault Louisa was a good child so she felt much ashamed that she had caused her mother whom she loved dearly so much worry As she sat there tied to the sofa she made up her mind that she would never frighten her so again No she would cure herself of the running away habit After that day whenever she felt the least desire to slip out of the house without asking permission she would hurry to her own little room and shut the door tight To keep her mind from bad plans she would shut her eyes and make up stories think them all out herself you know Then when some of them seemed pretty good she would write them down so that she would not forget them By and by she found she liked making stories better than anything she had ever done in her life Her mother sometimes wondered why Louisa grew so fond of staying in her little chamber at the head of the stairs all of a sudden but was pleased that the runaway child had changed into such a quiet like to stay at home girl It was a long time before Louisa dared to mention the stories and rhymes she had hidden in her desk but finally she told her mother about them and when missus Alcott had read them she advised her to keep on writing Louisa did so and became one of the best American story tellers She wrote a number of books and if you begin with Lulu s Library you will want to read Little Men and Little Women and all the books that dear Louisa Alcott ever wrote At first Louisa was paid but small sums for her writings and as the Alcott family were poor she taught school did sewing took care of children or worked at anything always with a merry smile so long as it provided comforts for those she loved When the Civil War broke out she was anxious to do something to help so she went into one of the Union hospitals as a nurse She worked so hard that she grew very ill and her father had to go after her and bring her home One of her books tells about her life in the hospital It was soon after her return home that her books began to sell so well that she found herself for the first time in her life with a great deal of money There was enough to buy luxuries for the Alcott family there was enough for her to travel No doubt she got more happiness in traveling than some people for she found boys and girls in England France and Germany reading the very books she herself Louisa May Alcott had written Then too at the age of fifty she enjoyed venturing into new places just as well as she did the morning she sallied forth to Boston Common in her new green shoes SAMUEL FINLEY BREESE MORSE Some of these days when you are learning about countries mountains and rivers you may like to know that a minister by the name of Morse was called the Father of American Geography He wrote all the first geographies used Some were hard others much easier But whatever he wrote he had to have the house very quiet Between the sermons he had to get ready for Sundays and the books he had to make for schools he was nearly always writing in his study so his little boy Sammy had been taught to tiptoe through the rooms and to be quiet with his toys He could not remember the time when his mother was not whispering with a warning finger held up Sh Sh Papa s writing Sammy liked to draw especially faces One day an old school teacher had come to see his father about a geography This man had a large queer shaped nose Sammy wondered if he could draw a picture of it He did not dare disturb any one by asking for paper and pencil so he took a large pin and scratched a picture on his mother s best mahogany bureau The scratches looked so like the man that Sammy clapped his hands and shouted with laughter His mother came running to see what had happened and when she looked ready to cry and said Oh Samuel Finley Breese Morse what have you done he knew right away that something was wrong She usually called him just Sammy It was only when she was displeased that she used the whole long name After this he was watched pretty closely until he went to school Then he grew so fond of reading that there did not seem to be time for anything else In school it was noticed that Samuel Morse had better lessons than most of the boys and that when it came to questions in history or questions about pictures and artists it was Samuel who was able to answer them When he was fourteen he wrote a life of a noted Greek scholar It was not published but it was very good He also painted pictures in water colors of his home and portraits of all the family These were so perfect that every one said he should go to Europe and study with the famous Benjamin West Finally his parents agreed that this was the right thing for him to do but they said he would have to live very simply because the Morses were not rich Samuel did not mind working hard eating little or dressing shabbily if he could just study with a fine teacher West noticed how willing Samuel was to do his pictures over and over again so he took much pains with him Samuel won several prizes and medals and his pictures were talked of everywhere Morse came back to Boston when he was twenty four poor and threadbare but famous People flocked to see his pictures but did not buy them So he went to New York to try his luck in that city From a little boy he had liked to try experiments with magnets and electricity so he often went to lectures on electricity and thought about different things that might be done with such a force if only people could learn how to use it These lecturers that he heard often made the remark If only electricity could be made to write This sentence kept going through Samuel s head as he sat at his easel painting It stayed in his mind when he went to Europe for the second time It followed him aboard ship when he was returning from that second trip sad and discouraged because a big picture on which he had spent much time and money had not sold Poor Samuel Morse felt like crying but he said to himself Well I won t sit by myself and sulk just because I have had more hard luck I will be sociable and talk with the other passengers It was fortunate he did for a group of men were telling about some experiments they had seen in Paris with a magnet and electricity Samuel asked some questions and then began to pace the deck and think Pretty soon he took out a notebook from his pocket and began to make marks in it He got more and more excited as the hours went by for he knew he had thought of something wonderful He had invented an alphabet for sending dispatches from one part of the world to another When it was daylight he had written out an alphabet of dots and dashes that stood for every letter and number in the English language Morse expected others to be as pleased as he with his invention but they did not even believe in it The idea said they that a man in New York can talk with another in San Francisco Of course if people did not believe Morse s idea was right they naturally would not give any money to try it out so for years this man almost starved while he lived in one small room that had to serve for work shop bedroom kitchen and artist s studio while he took pupils did small pictures anything in fact to get money for his machine and to pay for his room and food You see he needed one beautifully made machine and he must have a long line of poles and wires built before he could prove that with his dots and dashes people could talk to each other although they were miles apart And this would cost a lot of money He sent many letters to Washington asking Congress to help him The men in Congress were not interested His letters were not answered Poor old chap they laughed he s gone crazy over his scheme Finally as no attention was paid to his letters mister Morse saved up a little money and went to Washington himself One senator agreed to ask Congress to advance him some money But the time kept slipping by and nothing was done One night when it was late and all the senators were eager to get through with bills and business the senator who liked mister Morse saw him sitting away up in the gallery all alone He went up to him and said I know your bill or request will not pass Oh do give it up and go home When mister Morse went out of the building he had given up all hopes of getting help He went to his boarding house and when he had paid for the room and his breakfast the next morning he never ran in debt for he had a horror of it he had just thirty seven cents left in the world After he had crept up the many flights of stairs he shut the door of his small room and knelt down beside his bed He told God that he was going to give up his invention that perhaps it was not right for him to succeed He had tried to do something which he thought would be a help in the world and if he could not he would try to be brave and sensible about it Then being very tired he fell asleep like a tired child But the next morning what do you think a young lady the daughter of the friendly senator came rushing into the room where mister Morse was eating his breakfast and holding out both hands said joyfully I ve come to congratulate you Your bill has passed It cannot be he answered Oh it is true My father let me be the bearer of the good news Well said mister Morse trembling with delight you my dear message bearer shall send the first message that ever goes across the wires It did not take long to convince the world that Professor Morse as he was now called had invented a fine thing In less than a year a line was completed from Washington to Baltimore and Miss Ellsworth the kind senator s daughter sent the first message ever heard over a recording telegraph People found it a great blessing to be able to send quick news and Samuel Morse was soon called the greatest benefactor of the age The man who had lived in one room and who had gone for two days at a time without food received so many invitations to banquets that he could not go to half of them The ten powers of Europe held a special congress and sent the inventor eighty thousand dollars for a gift The Sultan of Turkey the King of Prussia the Queen of Spain the Emperor of the French the King of Denmark all sent decorations and presents The name of Samuel F B Morse was on every lip But all this success did not spoil him one bit He was the same modest lovable man he had always been Very few Americans have had so much honor paid to them as he When he was an old man the telegraph people all over the world wanted to show their esteem for him and so erected a statue to his memory in Central Park New York An evening reception was held in a large hall and when Samuel Morse came upon the stage how the audience rose and cheered He was led to a table on which had been placed the first telegraph register ever used In some clever way this had been joined to every telegraph wire in America and to those in foreign lands mister Morse put his fingers on the keys and after thanking his friends for their gift spelled out with his own dots and dashes his farewell greeting it was this Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men When Jedediah Morse wrote his geographies of the United States he little thought the small boy Samuel who tried so hard not to disturb him would one day bind all the countries on the globe together WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT George Washington was a daring soldier himself and of course noticed how other men behaved on a battlefield He liked a man who had plenty of courage a real hero There was a certain Colonel Prescott who fought at the battle of Bunker Hill whom Washington admired He always spoke of him as Prescott the brave Colonel Prescott had a grandson William Hickling Prescott who was never in a battle in his life and did not know the least thing about soldiering but he deserved the same title his grandfather won Prescott the brave as you will see William was born in Salem in seventeen ninety six His father a lawyer who afterwards became a famous judge was a rich man so William and his younger brothers and sisters had a beautiful home and as his mother was a laughing joyous woman the little Prescotts had a happy childhood William was much petted by his parents His mother taught him to read and write but when he was very small he went to school to a lady who loved her pupils so well that she never allowed people to call her a school teacher she said she was a school mother Between his pleasant study hours with Miss Higginson this school mother and his merry play hours at home the days were never quite long enough for William When he was seven he was placed in a private school taught by Master Knapp And there he was asked to study rather more than he liked He had loved story books almost from his cradle and what he read was very real to him Sometimes when he was only a tiny boy he felt so sure the goblins fairies and giants of which he had been reading might suddenly appear unless his mother were at hand to banish them that he would follow her from room to room holding on to her gown Still these books were much nicer he thought than the ones Master Knapp told him to study He was full of fun and frolic and took all Master Knapp s rebukes so cheerfully that the teacher could not get angry with him His schoolmates adored him Even if he did play a good many jokes on them they were not mean vicious jokes He had altogether too kind a heart to hurt a person or to say unkind things He did manage to get his history lessons and he liked to read lives of great men But he did not study any great amount until after his father moved to Boston and William began to fit himself for Harvard College He was proud of his father and fancied that he would like to be a lawyer like him Illustration The poor fellow fell to the floor as if he were dead Page one hundred sixty six Young Prescott had been in college but a short time when one night at dinner a rough rude student hurled a hard crust of bread across the table not aiming at any one in particular But it hit Prescott in his left eye and destroyed the sight in it The poor fellow fell to the floor as if he were dead and was very ill for weeks Then it was that he began to earn his title of Prescott the brave He did not complain he did not say Well of course I shall never try to do anything now that I have only one eye to use Instead he kept up his spirits and finished his course at Harvard gayly Everybody talked of his pluck He was asked to be orator of his class and he wrote for graduation day a Latin poem on Hope which he recited with such a happy face and manner that the people clapped their hands and cheered His parents were so pleased that William could finish his college work in spite of his accident and that he could keep right on being a rollicking laughing boy that they spread a great tent on the college grounds and feasted five hundred friends who had come to see William graduate Then William went on a wonderful visit to the Azores His mother s brother Thomas Hickling was United States Consul at saint Michael This uncle had married a Portuguese lady and there was a large family of cousins to entertain the New England boy mister Hickling had a big country house and a lot of spirited horses As William drove over the lovely island he used to laugh at the funny little burros the working people rode and the strange costumes they wore Of course he found saint Michael a different looking place from Boston with its brick or sober colored houses At the Azores you know everything is bright and gay A salmon pink castle stands next a square box like house painted yellow a blue villa and a buff villa probably adjoin dainty green and lavender cottages and occasionally a fancy little dwelling all towers and balconies will be painted cherry red Then the mountain peaks behind all these houses are vivid green So William felt almost as if he were in fairyland When he had been looking at these beautiful things about six weeks he found suddenly one morning that they had turned black He could not see a bit with his well eye A doctor was sent for and he said A perfectly dark room for you William Prescott for three months and only enough food to keep you alive In all the ninety five days the doctor kept him shut in William was never heard to utter one word of complaint His cousins sat with him a good deal thankful that he could not see them cry and he told them funny stories sang songs and paced back and forth for exercise with his elbows held way out at his sides to avoid running into the furniture He finally saw again but had to be very careful of that one useful eye all the rest of his life The minute he used it too much the blindness would come on again As studying law was out of the question for him he thought he would write histories He had already learned a good deal about the different countries but knew most about Spain So he set about learning all he could of that country as far back as the days of Christopher Columbus Of course this brought in King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella you remember she offered to sell her jewels to help Columbus and stories of Peru and Mexico so that William Prescott spent most of his life gathering facts together about the Spanish people And the histories of them he wrote eight large books sound almost like story books when you read them you seem to see the banquet halls the queens followed by their pages and ladies in waiting the priests chanting hymns in their monasteries and the Mexican generals in their showy uniforms Think how hard it was for William Prescott to make these histories He dared use his eye but a few hours a week So he hired people to read to him to go to libraries to look at old papers and letters and to copy the notes he made on a queer machine You can see this instrument that he contrived at the Massachusetts Historical Society Some pieces of wood held sheets of paper in place other strips of wood kept the pencil going in fairly straight lines But sometimes when he used this at night or when his eye was bandaged he would forget to put in a fresh sheet of paper and would scribble ahead for a long time writing the same lines over and across until his secretaries would have a hard time to find out what he meant He did not want to waste time by asking to have the same thing read twice to him so he trained his memory until he could carry the exact words on a page in his mind and after a while he could repeat whole chapters without a mistake But it was slow work making books this way He was ten years getting his first one the history of Ferdinand and Isabella ready for the publisher Prescott did not talk about this work No one but his parents and the secretaries knew that he was busy at all because in his resting hours he was often seen at balls and parties laughing and chatting in his own lively way And one day one of his relatives drew him aside this was when he had been grinding away in his library for eight years and said William it seems to me you are wasting your time sadly Why don t you stop being so idle and try some kind of work This same relation and all Prescott s friends were astonished and proud enough when two years later three big volumes of Spanish history were for sale in the book stores with William Hickling Prescott s name given as the author That season every one who could afford it gave their friends a Christmas present of the Prescott books He had compliments enough to turn his head but he was too sensible to be vain He wrote several other books and soon became famous When he was in London he had many honors shown him Prescott was fond of children and always kept a stock of candy and sweets on hand for small people His servants adored him and so did his secretaries They used to tell how he would frolic even at his work Sometimes when he had got to a place in one of the books where he must describe a battle scene he would dash about the room singing at the top of his lungs some stirring ballad like Oh give me but my Arab steed And then when he felt he really had his steam up he would begin to write He was kind and generous and showed so much courtesy to rich and poor alike that he has been called the finest gentleman of his time No doubt he was but it is true too that he was Prescott the Brave PHILLIPS BROOKS One of the greatest preachers in America was a Boston boy His name was Phillips Brooks and there is a fine statue of him near Trinity Church where he was rector for twenty two years When Phillips was a little boy he and his five brothers made quite a long row or circle when they sat at the big library table learning their lessons for the next day s school while their happy faced mother sat near with her sewing and their father read The Brooks boys had all the newest story books games music and parties so they were a very jolly lot but it is Phillips I want to tell you the most about Phillips liked books better than play and was such a bright pupil that his teachers were always praising him In fact he was a favorite everywhere It did not make much difference whether he was spending his vacation in Andover with his Grandma Phillips walking across Boston Common with his mother or hurrying in the morning sunshine to the Boston Latin School people who looked at his handsome face and his big brown eyes said to themselves There goes a boy to be proud of It was just the same when he went to Harvard College He was such a likeable chap that he was asked to join all the clubs and invited to the merry makings of the students But he was rather shy Perhaps he had grown too fast for he was only fifteen years old and six feet three inches tall think of it He stayed in his own room a good deal writing and trying for prizes He won several He did not like arithmetic or figures of any kind but anything about the different countries or the lives of men and women would keep him bending over a book half the night Things had gone pretty easily for Phillips up to the time he graduated from Harvard He had always found faces and voices pleasant So you can see how hurt he must have been when the very first time he tried to teach school the pupils were ugly and rude to him It almost broke his heart that they did not want to mind him The smaller boys loved him and took pride in learning their lessons but the older ones hardly opened their books Instead of that they spent their time making the young teacher s life miserable He was only nineteen Poor fellow he must have wished many a day that he was at the North Pole or the South Seas instead of in Boston These rowdies threw heads of matches on the floor and grinned when they exploded they piled wood in the stoves until every one gasped for breath they fired wads of paper at each other and once they threw shot in Phillips s face The principal of the school beat his boys when they did not behave and he had no patience with Phillips for not doing the same But Phillips could not do that He finally said he would resign Some principals would have said to the young teacher Now don t mind it if you have not done very well at teaching there are no doubt other things that you will find you can do better than this Good luck to you my lad Remember you have always a friend in me But Phillips s principal glared at him and declared Well if you have failed to make a good teacher you will fail in everything else Just then Phillips did not think of much else but his own disappointment His father and his five brothers were very successful at their work and it shamed him to think he was not Phillips s brown eyes were very serious in those days The same ones who had once sighed There s a boy to be proud of now showed no pity in their looks and often hurried down a side street to avoid bowing to him Dear me and it was the very same boy they had praised when he was taking prizes Phillips began to feel that he would like to help the people in the world who had the heartache There seemed to be plenty to help the happy rich folks but there were many others who he was sure needed a friendly word and hand clasp to give them new courage His pastor advised him to become a preacher This meant more study So he went to a seminary down in Virginia where men fit themselves for the ministry He got there after school had begun so he had to take a room in an attic There was no fire in it poor light and he with his six feet and three inches could not stand up straight in it without bumping his head against the rafters And his bed was not nearly long enough for him It is a nuisance sometimes to be as tall as Phillips was But he never minded all these things He only felt in a hurry to finish his studies so that he could preach and work among the poor After he had preached at two churches in Philadelphia he was asked to be the rector of Trinity Church in Boston He was rector there for twenty two years until he was made Bishop of Massachusetts He spoke so beautifully from the pulpit that strangers traveled from all parts of the country to hear him So many flocked to Trinity Church that the pews would not hold them Chairs were packed in the aisles and a few more people managed to hear him by squeezing on to the pulpit steps Phillips Brooks s sermons were wonderful but his work among the sick and the poor was more wonderful still He carried help and good cheer with him every day The more good he did the happier he grew himself His laugh rang out like a boy s By the time he was made Bishop he was so merry that he could hardly contain himself He helped poor men find work he held sick children while their mothers rested he coaxed young men away from bad habits and like his Master he went about doing good He did not look sober or bothered with all this either There was always a smile on his face Phillips Brooks had no wife or children but several nieces At his home on Clarendon Street he kept a doll a music box and many toys for them to play with Every little while when he was all tired out with his preaching and his cheering up work he would take a long trip to some distant country and from all these strange places he would write letters to these nieces which made them nearly explode with laughter when their mothers read them aloud All the funny sights in Venice were described and the stories about the children in India made the eyes of Susie and Gertrude Brooks open their widest At the end of almost every letter he would charge the little girls not to forget their Uncle Phillips As if any one who had ever known Bishop Brooks could forget him But Christmas time was the best of all for these little girls Their uncle Phillips took them right along with him to buy the presents for the whole family This would be weeks and weeks before it was time for Santa Claus so he would make them promise not to lisp a word of what was in the packages that arrived at the rectory They loved sharing secrets with him and would not have told one for any money That was a strange thing about Phillips Brooks he made people trust worthy He always believed the best of every one and no one wanted to disappoint him Sometimes when the girls and their uncle started on one of these entrancing shopping tours it did seem as if they would never reach the shops So many passers by wanted a word with the great preacher they had to halt every other minute I have no doubt his smile was as sunny for the Irish scrub woman who hurried after him to ask a favor as it had been for good Queen Victoria when she thanked him for preaching her a sermon in the Royal Chapel at Windsor Castle Because his heart was filled with love and sympathy Phillips Brooks left the world better and happier than he found it Now if every one who passes his statue at Trinity Church should say I really must do some kind generous thing myself each day in the week there would be sort of a Christmassy feeling all the year round and we should keep a little of the sunshine which the Bishop of Massachusetts shed still shining SAMUEL CLEMENS Better Known as MARK TWAIN John Clemens Samuel s father was a farmer merchant and postmaster in a Missouri town called Florida His wife Jane Clemens was a stirring busy woman who liked to get her work out of the way and then have a real frolic Her husband did not know what it meant to frolic He was not very well to begin with and when he had any spare time he sat by himself figuring away on an invention year after year He spent a good deal of time too thinking what fine things he would do for his family when he sold a great tract of land in Tennessee He had bought seventy five thousand acres of land when he was much younger for just a few cents an acre and when that land went up in price he expected to be pointed out as a millionaire at least John Clemens was a good man and something of a scholar but he was not the least bit merry His children never saw him laugh once in his whole life Think of it missus Clemens did not like to have any one around when she was bustling through the housework so the six children spent the days roaming through the country picking nuts and berries When it came night and they had had their supper they would crowd around the open fire and coax Jennie a slave girl or Uncle Ned a colored farm hand to tell them stories Uncle Ned was a famous story teller When he described witches and goblins the children would look over their shoulders as if they half expected to see the queer creatures in the room All these stories began Once pon a time but each one ended differently One of the children Sam Clemens admired Uncle Ned s stories so that he could hardly wait for evening to come Sam was a delicate child The neighbors used to shake their heads and declare he would never live to be a man and every one always spoke of him as little Sam When mister Clemens moved to another town some distance away the mother said instantly Well Hannibal may be all right for your business but Florida agrees so well with little Sam that I shall spend every summer here with the children on the Quarles farm The children were glad she held to this plan for mister Quarles laughed and joked with them built them high swings let them ride in ox teams and go on horseback and tumble in the hayfields all they wished They had so much fun and exercise that they were even willing to go to bed without any stories Sam grew plump A funny thing happened the first summer they went to nice mister Quarles s missus Clemens with the older children the new baby and Jennie went on ahead in a large wagon Sam was asleep mister Clemens was to wait until he woke up and then was to carry him on horseback to join the rest Well as mister Clemens was waiting for Sam to finish his nap he got to thinking of his invention or his Tennessee land and presently he saddled and bridled the horse and rode away without him He never thought of Sam again until his wife said as he reached the Quarles s dooryard Where is little Sam Why why he stammered I must have forgotten him Of course he was ashamed of himself and hurried a man off to Hannibal on a swift horse where Sam was found hungry and frightened wandering through the locked house Sam was sent to school when he was five He certainly did not like to study very well but did learn to be a fine reader and speller At the age of nine Sam was a good swimmer although he came very near being drowned three different times while he was learning and loved the river so that he was to be found on its shore almost any hour of the day He longed to travel by steamer Once he ran away and hid on board one until it was well down the river As soon as he showed himself to the captain he was put ashore his father was sent for and he received a whipping that he remembered a long time At nine he had a head rather too large for his body and it looked even bigger because he had such a lot of waving sandy hair He had fine gray eyes a slow drawling voice and said such droll things that the boys listened to everything he said His two best chums were Will Bowen and John Briggs These three friends could run like deer and what time they were not fishing or swimming they usually spent in a cave which they had found At twelve he was just a careless happy barefoot boy often in mischief and only excelling in two things at school He won the weekly medal for spelling and his compositions were so funny that the teachers and pupils used to laugh till the tears came when they were read aloud His teachers said he ought to train himself for a writer but it did not seem to him that there was anything so noble or desirable in this world as being a pilot And he loved the great Mississippi River better than any place he had known or could imagine Sam s father died whispering Don t sell the Tennessee land Hold on to it and you will all be rich After his death Sam learned the printer s trade He was very quick in setting type and accurate so that he soon helped his older brother start a newspaper He worked with his brother until he was eighteen and then he told his mother that he wanted to start out for himself in the world Jane Clemens loved him dearly and hated to part with him but when she saw his heart was set on going she took up a testament and said Well Sam you may try it but I want you to take hold of this book and make me a promise I want you to repeat after me these words I do solemnly swear that I will not throw a card or drink a drop of liquor while I am gone He repeated these words after her bade her good by and went to saint Louis He meant to travel and as he earned enough by newspaper work he visited New York Philadelphia and was on his way to South America when he got a chance to be a pilot on the Mississippi River While he was learning this trade he was happier than he had ever been in his life If you want to know what happened to him at this time you must read a book he wrote Life on the Mississippi River He wrote a great many books and signed whatever he wrote with a queer name MARK TWAIN This was an old term used by pilots to show how deep the water is where they throw the lead His writings like his boyish compositions made people laugh So that now although he has been dead several years whenever the name of Mark Twain is mentioned a smile goes around If you want to know more about the actual doings of Sam and his chums Will Bowen and John Briggs read Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn for in those books Sam has set down a pretty fair account of their escapades mister Clemens had a wife and children of whom he was very fond As he made much money from his books and lectures they were all able to travel in foreign countries and his best book of travel is Innocents Abroad It seems to me that even his father would have laughed over that book Speaking of his father again reminds me to tell you that the Tennessee land never brought any luxuries to the Clemens family It was sold for less than the taxes had amounted to JOE JEFFERSON Joseph or as he was always called Joe Jefferson was a great actor And there is never much talk of theaters actors and plays but some one is apt to say Ah but you should have seen Joe Jefferson in Rip Van Winkle All Americans are very proud of the fact that this man was born in the United States that he lived and died here There have been four actors in the Jefferson family by the name of Joseph but it was Joe Jefferson Number Three who played the part of the queer old Dutchman Rip Van Winkle for thirty years whose life is told of now Joe was born in Philadelphia but his parents went to Washington soon after They lived in a house whose back hall led right into the side entrance of a theater As soon as he could walk about by himself little Joe used to run through this hall and play all day long in the empty theater behind the scenes Out in that part of the old building there were all kinds of stage settings piled up behind the wings There were large pieces of canvas painted to look like an Italian lake or an English garden or a Roman palace There was a tiny cottage with a real door just big enough for Joe to squeeze through and slam behind him He used to pretend that he owned this cottage There were throne chairs for the make believe kings and queens to sit in a robber s cave and a lovely board and canvas bank covered with moss and flowers Two or three children often joined Joe here and they gave plays which they made up themselves Oh it was such an odd exciting place to play in In the dressing room of this old theater was a large mirror and Joe loved to stand before this and act little bits of certain plays which he had heard his parents recite His mother was a singer and his father both an actor and manager so Joe being just across the hall was often carried on to the stage when some play called for a baby or small child Then too some evenings he would escape from his nurse and in his night dress peep in through the door of the dressing room and watch the actors making up for their parts When Joe was four a friend of the family was making a great success of a negro part called Jim Crow A good deal of dancing and singing went with it and it was no time at all before little Joe could copy the man perfectly This made Rice the friend pleased enough and he insisted that Joe should go through the part in public Rice was more than six feet tall and Joe was a tiny four year old child You don t wonder I am sure when the two stood on the stage side by side dressed exactly alike that the audience shouted with laughter First the big Jim Crow would sing a verse and dance and then the tiny Jim would do the same The people in the audience kept clapping their hands for more and threw silver coins on to the stage for the child until stage hands after the curtain went down picked up twenty four dollars and gave them to Joe In spite of Joe s being most carefully trained by his parents to tell the truth and say his prayers he did when he was small let his fancy run away with him sometimes and to a dear old lady always dressed in stiffly starched frills black gown and mitts who kept a book and notion store he told stories of horrors that never really happened No doubt he liked to see her hold up her hands in dismay as he described some imaginary runaway accident and no doubt he liked to have her run to bring him a nice cool drink to steady his nerves after such a shocking sight Belonging to an actor s family means of course living in many different cities Joe had known Philadelphia Washington and New York well when the Jefferson family went to Illinois As Springfield was the capital of that State and the men attending the legislature would swell the audiences Joe s father decided to build a theater there Just as it was finished the ministers of the place began to preach against allowing a theater there at all They preached to such good effect that the city council put a tremendous tax on the building so big a tax that poor mister Jefferson could not begin to pay it for he had used every dollar he had in building the theater While he was wondering what he would do a young lawyer of Springfield came to him and said that as he thought the tax was out of all reason he would agree to bring the matter before the council free of charge Well this lawyer made such a strong plea and got the members of the council into such gales of laughter with his funny stories that the tax was removed and mister Jefferson opened his playhouse and made a good deal of money The young lawyer s name was Abraham Lincoln Tennessee proved an unlucky State for the Jeffersons At Memphis there had been a money panic and people had no heart for theaters Joe s father had always known how to paint scenery and now he advertised to paint signs but did not get many orders Joe heard that a law was passed that all carts drays and carriages in the city of Memphis must bear numbers He went to the mayor s house and rang the bell Please mister Mayor he said I m Joe Jefferson s son Oh yes my boy I ve seen both you and your father on the stage Well Sir my father can paint signs as well as act and now that the theaters are closed he is glad of outside work Couldn t you please give him the contract to paint the numbers on your city carriages The mayor s eyes twinkled He was pleased with the business like way of the boy and granted his request The money from this work was a help and right after that a rich man hired Joe s father to paint Scottish scenes on the walls of his reception hall so they were getting on quite comfortably when poor mister Jefferson was taken ill and died This meant that Joe and his sister must leave school and go to work missus Jefferson opened a boarding house and the two children joined a traveling theatrical company They did fancy dancing and sang comic duets and ever so many times when they pretended to laugh they were so tired and homesick that they wanted to cry Sometimes Joe would be given a few lines to speak in some play It seemed as if he would never get a chance to show what talent he really had But he studied all his spare time and watched great actors carefully because he intended to win a high place on the stage some day By and by Laura Keene an actress who had a theater of her own in New York let him try a leading character in a play that ran one hundred and fifty nights There was not one of these performances at which the audience did not applaud young Joe Jefferson and say they wanted to see him in something else And when they did see him in Dickens s Cricket on the Hearth as dear old Caleb Plummer and as Bob Acres in The Rivals they exclaimed This young man is a wonder Why he knows the whole art of acting But Joe Jefferson did not think he knew half enough He kept on studying for he meant to improve still more Finally after he had become quite famous in half a dozen different parts in this country in England and Australia he began giving the most wonderful play of all the one always called his masterpiece Rip Van Winkle In a few years he had all the fame wealth and praise that a man could ask for The little fellow who at four years of age was blacked up to dance Jim Crow and gathered twenty four dollars for his queer antics forty years later could easily count on a thousand dollars for one night s appearance in Rip Van Winkle But we must not forget how hard and patiently he had worked for this We must not forget what he had actually done He had educated himself so that he had friends among the most cultivated people in the world he was quoted as one of the most polished and finished actors in America and he had earned enough money to bring up his own children in luxury Joe Jefferson had a lovely old age He bought a large southern estate where he spent the winter months and he owned a summer home at Buzzard s Bay Massachusetts where he fished and painted pictures to his heart s content and where he entertained many distinguished people After he stopped playing except once in a while and intended to retire from the stage every now and then there would be such a call for him that he would consent to give Rip Van Winkle just once more He must have been about perfect in this play else how is it that old theater goers look so happy and satisfied when they say Ah you should have seen the great Joe Jefferson in Rip Van Winkle HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW When Henry Wadsworth Longfellow the poet was a boy he lived in Portland Maine In those days Portland did much trading with the West Indies and Henry and his boy friends liked to stay down at the wharves when the Portland vessels came in It was sport to watch the burly negroes unload the hogsheads of molasses the barrels of sugar and the spices The boys used to wish they were sailors or captains so that they could sail across the water and perhaps have great adventures Henry also thought it would suit him to be a soldier and when he was five years old and there was much talk about the great war which is called the War of eighteen twelve he sent a letter to his father who happened to be away at the time that he had a toy gun already and if his father would please buy him a drum he would start right off for the battle field Probably he was not as warlike as he fancied he was for one Fourth of July just after that he jumped every time a cannon went off and begged his mother to stuff his ears with cotton so that he would not hear the banging Henry liked music and books far better than fighting He read a great deal with his mother and they took long walks together for they both loved flowers and birds Twice every Sunday Henry went to church with his mother In the cold weather he carried her foot stove for her a funny little box which held coals and in the summer her nosegay because she never went to service after the flowers began to bloom without a bunch of sweet smelling blossoms This odd foot warmer can be seen any time in the old Wadsworth Longfellow house in Portland Visitors from all over the world even from India and Turkey have wandered through this home of the poet to look at the desk at which he wrote the rich mahogany chairs and the old fashioned mirrors Henry was willing to do errands or any tasks that his mother wished him to do He did not mind even driving the cow to pasture for as he walked along he was usually making up rhymes And although he had very good lessons in school he often scribbled little jingles in his copy book When he was thirteen he told his sister that he was going to send a poem to the Portland newspaper He did not tell any one but her and he only signed Henry at the end of the poem so although the editor printed it the other school children did not find out for a long time that it was his Henry and his sister read the printed verses until they wore the newspaper to shreds and felt they had a lovely secret After Henry graduated from college his father wanted him to be a lawyer like himself but Henry was sure he wanted to be an author He said Don t ask me to study law father I think I can write books Anyway if you will let me have my way I will promise to be famous at something So his parents let him travel through Europe and when he sent long happy letters home telling about the different things he saw they were so charming that all the neighbors wanted to borrow the letters and mister and missus Longfellow agreed that Henry would probably be famous with his pen When Henry came home again he was chosen for a college professor He was only twenty two and it began to look as if the Portland boy would be a success even if he did not study law The students at Harvard College loved young Professor Longfellow He was so handsome so lively so exquisitely neat in dress that they were very proud to introduce him to their parents and best of all he made their lessons so interesting that they were actually sorry when the class was dismissed He proved a fine teacher But besides teaching in the college Henry wrote poem after poem It was not long before his verses were liked in other countries as well as in America French people began to say Why we want our children to know Henry Wadsworth Longfellow s poems And Spanish ladies and Italian noblemen declared they were beautiful Finally so many countries were asking for these poems they were translated into fifteen languages Longfellow was soon called The Poet of Every Land You will think that was the right name for him when you hear what happened on a big ocean steamer Once a large party of travelers were sailing from Greece to France As they sat talking one evening somebody praised the great French poet Victor Hugo A lovely Russian lady spoke up Victor Hugo is fine but no poet is so well known as the American Longfellow I want to go to Boston to see the Bridge about which he wrote Then she repeated every word of I stood on the Bridge at Midnight Upon that an English captain just back from the Zulu war recited a Longfellow poem A gray haired Scotchman said another an American remembered one a Greek sang some verses of Longfellow s that had been set to music and when the French captain of the steamer declaimed Excelsior there was great handclapping and it showed that Henry Longfellow was indeed a favorite poet Henry Longfellow liked Cambridge He boarded in a fine old place Craigie House where General George Washington had once stayed And when he was married to a Boston girl her father gave them Craigie House for a wedding present Longfellow was so happy as the years went on that he wrote better than ever You will like his Hiawatha which tells about the Indians his Evangeline and the story of Myles Standish Do not forget to read The Children s Hour Longfellow was never too busy to play with his children and saw to it that they were kept happy Once when he took the three girls to England Charles Dickens the great English writer asked them to visit at his grand place Gads Hill He sent a wonderful coach all glittering with gold trimmings and driven by men in scarlet livery to the station for them and had a Swiss chalet in his garden for them to use as a playhouse Many great people gave them dinners and parties But what pleased them most of all was the respect shown their father One of the daughters still lives in Craigie House which is often visited by people who love Longfellow s poems and who wish to see the rooms in which he lived Longfellow could sell his verses as fast as he wrote them A New York editor once paid Longfellow three thousand dollars for one short poem And imagine how proud his wife and children must have been to overhear people saying I wonder if mister Longfellow has written anything lately If he has I must read it Imagine how happy it made his father that he had kept his word If you will let me have my way I will promise to be famous in something And surely all the Americans who were on that steamer and heard the Russian the Greek and other foreigners reciting Longfellow s poems must have been proud that a man from their own country had won the name of The Poet of Every Land JAMES McNEILL WHISTLER It was about seventy five years ago that the Emperor of Russia Nicolas I made up his mind that he wanted a railroad between Moscow and saint Petersburg

5778_54535_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 He is Major George Washington Whistler 
5778_54535_000004_000001	train-clean-100	He is one of the founders of the city in which he lives Lowell Massachusetts 
5778_54535_000004_000002	train-clean-100	He is a distinguished army officer and a fine engineer 
5778_54535_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 He is named for a great officer answered Nicolas remembering our General Washington and he dispatched a letter to the Lowell engineer 
5778_54535_000006_000000	train-clean-100	The major made haste to start for Russia because the honor was great and the payment would be generous 
5778_54535_000006_000001	train-clean-100	He left his boys and his wife behind because he did not know just how comfortable he could make them in the far off country but he told the boys to be good and to mind their mother 
5778_54535_000007_000000	train-clean-100	These boys were named James McNeill William and Charles 
5778_54535_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Their mother was a fine woman but sometimes they wished she would not be quite so strict 
5778_54535_000007_000002	train-clean-100	She used to say on Saturday afternoons Come boys empty your pockets and gather up your toys we will put the knives and marbles away and get ready for Sunday All day Sunday they were not allowed to read any book but the Bible 
none	none	But James liked the stories he found there and when he was only nine could say almost half the Bible by heart 
5778_54535_000008_000000	train-clean-100	James was the oldest in the family 
5778_54535_000008_000001	train-clean-100	He was born in Lowell and was such a cunning baby that everybody wanted his picture 
5778_54535_000008_000002	train-clean-100	One of his uncles who loved him dearly used to say It s enough to make Sir Joshua Reynolds this was a great English painter who had died years before come out of his grave to paint Jimmie asleep Jimmie had delicate features and long silky brown curls that hung about his face 
5778_54535_000008_000003	train-clean-100	In among these was one white lock that dropped straight down over his forehead 
5778_54535_000008_000004	train-clean-100	This looked like a tiny feather 
5778_54535_000008_000005	train-clean-100	More than all his playthings he liked a pencil and paper 
5778_54535_000008_000006	train-clean-100	From the time he could scribble at all he drew pictures of everybody and everything in sight 
5778_54535_000008_000007	train-clean-100	These pictures were very good and when he was large enough to go to school the other children were apt to ask him to make animals and birds for them on the blackboard 
5778_54535_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Major Whistler soon sent for his family to join him in Russia 
5778_54535_000009_000001	train-clean-100	It was a long hard voyage there and poor little Charlie died on the way 
none	none	The two other boys were better sailors and were as well as could be when they met their father They did enjoy the strange sights in saint Petersburg They were not long in getting acquainted with the little Russian children or in learning the language 
5778_54535_000009_000005	train-clean-100	They went skating dressed in handsome furs they learned the folk and fancy dances joined in the winter sports and voted Russia a fine country 
5778_54535_000009_000006	train-clean-100	Still their parents did not let them forget they were little Americans 
5778_54535_000010_000000	train-clean-100	The climate did not agree with James and every time he caught cold he had touches of rheumatism so that often he had to stay in the house and have his feet put in hot water 
5778_54535_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Instead of making a fuss about this he used to call for pencil and paper and practise drawing feet until he could make very perfect ones 
none	none	Major Whistler sent him to the Art Academy in saint Petersburg where he was praised by his teachers 
5778_54535_000010_000003	train-clean-100	That old tiresome rheumatism kept bothering him and by and by he had a long rheumatic fever 
5778_54535_000010_000004	train-clean-100	He was a dear patient boy however and afterwards declared he was almost glad he had it because some one who pitied the small invalid sent him a book of Hogarth s engravings 
5778_54535_000010_000005	train-clean-100	I want you to be sure and remember about this gentleness and patience because when he was older people often accused him of being cross and rude 
5778_54535_000010_000006	train-clean-100	But at this time I am sure no one could have been nicer 
5778_54535_000011_000000	train-clean-100	James was very careful of his mother too 
5778_54535_000011_000001	train-clean-100	One evening she had taken the boys in a carriage to see a big illumination 
5778_54535_000011_000002	train-clean-100	Bands were playing and rockets flying 
5778_54535_000011_000003	train-clean-100	The horses next their carriage were frightened and reared and plunged as if they would hit the Whistler party 
5778_54535_000011_000004	train-clean-100	James shoved his mother down on the seat behind him and standing in front of her beat the horses back from them 
5778_54535_000011_000005	train-clean-100	He always was as polite to her as if she were the emperor s wife 
5778_54535_000012_000000	train-clean-100	The major worked too hard on the great railway and died before James was fifteen 
5778_54535_000012_000001	train-clean-100	The emperor was fond of the two boys and wanted them to stay on in Russia and be trained in the school for pages of the Court 
5778_54535_000012_000002	train-clean-100	But their mother said they must grow up in America and hurried back to her own land 
5778_54535_000012_000003	train-clean-100	She did not have much money to spend but thought James should go to West Point to get the military training his father had had 
5778_54535_000012_000004	train-clean-100	At this academy he found he did not like to draw maps and forts nearly as well as he did human figures and faces 
5778_54535_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Once when he had been sent to Washington to draw maps for the Coast Survey he forgot what he was about and filled up the nice white margins with pert little dancing folks 
5778_54535_000012_000006	train-clean-100	He was well scolded for this I can tell you 
5778_54535_000013_000000	train-clean-100	James was a tall handsome young fellow at this time and liked to go about to dancing parties in the evening 
5778_54535_000013_000001	train-clean-100	He earned very little making maps and could not afford to buy the real narrow tailed coat which was proper 
none	none	So he used to take his frock coat that he wore all day and pin it back to look like a dress coat and start off for big balls where nobody was much shocked because he was always doing droll things and was so lively that he was welcome in any dress In Paris strangers used to ask who the young artist was who had the snow white lock among his black curls for the brown curls had grown as black as jet and the map drawing had grown so tiresome that James had given up West Point and settled down to painting and etching in Paris He had decided that there was nothing in the world which suited him but the life of an artist 
5778_54535_000014_000001	train-clean-100	He worked quite steadily and people began to say I think young Whistler is going to do great things some day But suddenly he packed up and went to London 
none	none	In this city he was praised even more but he did not sell enough pictures to pay his bills and once when he had kept men waiting a long time for money that he owed them officers came and took everything away but his pictures The room looked so bare and homely that Whistler painted a very good imitation of furniture round the walls of his room So good in fact that a rich man who came to look at the pictures sat down in one of the imitation chairs and found himself on the floor 
5778_54535_000016_000000	train-clean-100	It was fortunate that James could go a long time without food for it took nearly all he could earn from his pictures to buy paint and canvas for others 
5778_54535_000016_000001	train-clean-100	I dare say that quite often when it was said James McNeill Whistler is growing rude and cross the real truth of the matter was that James McNeill Whistler was hungry and worried 
5778_54535_000017_000000	train-clean-100	However he began to make money at last and just as life seemed bright an art critic mister John Ruskin declared that the Whistler pictures which were being bought at big prices were poor very poor 
5778_54535_000017_000001	train-clean-100	mister Ruskin spoke and what was worse printed his opinion 
5778_54535_000017_000002	train-clean-100	 I never expected he wrote to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public s face Well it did not look for a while as if there was any more good luck in the world for James Whistler 
none	none	He did not lose any time in getting a lawyer to sue mister Ruskin for spoiling the sale of his pictures 
5778_54535_000017_000004	train-clean-100	There was a trial in London and the court room was crowded 
5778_54535_000017_000005	train-clean-100	Some were there because they already owned Whistler pictures and wanted to find out if they had paid good money for bad pictures others because they were warm friends of the artist or the critic but even more men and women went to hear the sharp questions of the lawyers and the clever answers of Ruskin and Whistler 
5778_54535_000017_000006	train-clean-100	Whistler won the case 
5778_54535_000017_000007	train-clean-100	When the judge awarded one farthing for damages this is only a quarter of a cent in our money Whistler laughed and hung the English farthing on his watch chain for a charm 
5778_54535_000017_000008	train-clean-100	mister Ruskin had to pay the costs of the trial which had mounted up to nineteen hundred dollars 
5778_54535_000017_000009	train-clean-100	Some of his friends insisted on raising that sum for him 
5778_54535_000017_000010	train-clean-100	One of them said it was worth nineteen hundred dollars to have heard the talk that went on in the court room 
5778_54535_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Later mister Whistler received much more than two hundred guineas for a single picture 
5778_54535_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Two famous ones of which we often see prints are Portrait of my Mother and the Scotch writer Carlyle James Whistler s mother lived to be an old woman as one can guess from the picture and her son loved her just as dearly as he did when he beat the prancing horses away from her in Russia 
5778_54535_000018_000002	train-clean-100	The French nation bought this portrait and it hangs in the Luxembourg Museum Paris 
5778_54535_000018_000003	train-clean-100	The Scotch people wanted to own the portrait of Carlyle and the city of Glasgow was glad to pay five thousand dollars for it 
5778_54535_000019_000000	train-clean-100	mister Whistler married a woman who was herself an artist and she was very proud of him 
5778_54535_000019_000001	train-clean-100	 The Duet one of his pictures shows his wife and her sister at the piano 
5778_54535_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Two portraits by this American artist hang in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts but most of them are owned in England 
5778_54535_000020_000000	train-clean-100	James Whistler was always kind to young artists and liked to have them sit by him while he worked 
5778_54535_000020_000001	train-clean-100	They were very proud to be noticed by him for long before he died he had received all kinds of honors and medals from foreign academies and France Germany and Italy made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor a Commander and a Chevalier 
5778_54535_000020_000002	train-clean-100	He loved art so well that he made water colors pastels etchings and lithographs as well as oil paintings 
5778_54535_000020_000003	train-clean-100	He did not get his fame without much hard work 
5778_54535_000020_000004	train-clean-100	You remember how many times he copied his own foot when he was a child 
5778_54535_000020_000005	train-clean-100	Well he was just as patient and thorough when he was older 
5778_54535_000020_000006	train-clean-100	For a long time he made a practice of drawing a picture of himself every night before he went to bed 
5778_54535_000020_000007	train-clean-100	He traveled a great deal painting views in many countries and studying the pictures of other artists 
none	none	But Hogarth was his favorite and it is interesting to know that James McNeill Whistler lies buried very near Hogarth in London for he had thought him a model ever since his boyhood days in saint Petersburg RALPH WALDO EMERSON You can t think how hard fathers and mothers used to work and plan to get their children educated in the old days when there were no public schools The Emersons did some planning I can assure you All the pictures of Ralph Waldo Emerson that I have happened to see show him as a man of middle age with very smooth hair and plain but very nice looking clothes He looks in these pictures as nurse Richards used to say of my father as if he had just come out of the top bureau drawer Well Ralph Emerson did not always wear fine clothes but I would not be a bit surprised if he always looked middle aged Boys who had as little fun as the Emerson boys had when they were growing up would not be expected to look young In the end Ralph became a minister as well as a writer and a lecturer and a philosopher His father and his grandfather had been ministers too I fancy it was trying to send all these minister Emersons to school and college that kept each set of parents so poor Ralph s father William Emerson did not care to be a minister He wanted to live in a city and teach school play his bass viol and belong to musical or singing clubs But his mother looked ready to cry when he told her this and said Why William it has taken all the money I had to send you through Harvard College What good will it do you if you do not become a preacher So rather than grieve his mother he agreed to fit himself for preaching How he hoped he might be sent to some large town But instead of that he settled in a small place where neighbors lived two or three miles from each other He was as lonesome as he could be He was too poor to buy a horse and too busy to spend half his time walking so he could not get very well acquainted with the families that came to hear him preach Besides his pay was small and if the kind hearted farmers had not brought him a ham a leg of lamb or a load of wood now and then I don t see how he would have managed In spite of all these hindrances William saved a little money in five years He bought a small farm and got married As the years went by and there were children to feed his preaching did not bring half the money they needed so he taught school his wife took boarders and he even sold his beloved bass viol And I do not think they felt that anything was too hard if only these children could go to college missus Emerson was very proud of her husband when he stood in the pulpit on Sundays and used to shut her eyes and try to imagine how their boys would look in a pulpit Finally good luck came their way mister Emerson was asked to preach in Boston Then he had the city life he loved he heard good music and could call on his friends three times a day if he wished and the boys had fine schools None of the children were over ten when this good man Minister William died And then came the widow s struggle to educate them The church members were kind to her she took boarders again and sewed and mended with never a complaint so long as the boys could go to the Latin School They saw how tired she got and kept wishing they could grow up faster so they could earn money and let her rest They helped her wash dishes and they chopped wood and cleaned vegetables while the other school boys played ball or swam or skated There were no play hours for them They had but one overcoat between them So they took turns wearing it Some of the mean cruel boys at school used to taunt them about it singing out when they came in sight Well who is wearing the coat to day A spinster aunt Miss Mary Emerson came to see the family often She urged the boys to stand high in their classes and thought it would not hurt them to do without play She read all the fine books aloud to them that she could borrow Once a caller found her telling the boys stories of great heroes late at night so that they might forget that they had been without food for a day and a half They were as poor as that Ralph began to go to school when he was three and so was able to enter Harvard College when he was fourteen He did not have to pay for his room at the president s house because he did errands for him And to pay for his meals he waited on tables That was working to get an education wasn t it Ralph did not find fault because he had to work all the time that he was not studying he was thinking of his mother When he won a prize of thirty dollars for declaiming well he sent it to his mother as fast as the mails could take it and asked her to buy a shawl for herself But she had to take it to buy food for the smaller children Ralph used to tell his brothers that he could not think of anything in this world that would make him so happy as to be able some day to buy a house for his dear mother and to see her living easily The other boys Waldo Charles Buckley and Edward proved to be fine scholars like Ralph but they were never strong They were always having to hurry south or across the ocean to get over some illness The truth is they did not have enough to eat when they were little Old maid aunts can tell stories of heroes every night in the year but that will never take the place of bread and potatoes eggs and milk Ralph s mother was very happy that he became a minister and like his father preached in Boston After some years of preaching he traveled in Europe Then he lectured He had a beautiful clear voice and all the things he told were so interesting that his name became famous even before he wrote books He settled in Concord where Thoreau and Louisa May Alcott lived He knew so much that by and by people called him The Sage of Concord He said he could never think very well sitting down So when he wanted to write a poem or sermon or essay and you can hardly step into a New England home where there is not a book called Emerson s Essays he put on his hat and went out for a walk When he had walked three or four hours he had usually decided just what he wanted to write down On this account he generally went out alone It was after a stroll in the woods near Concord where the squirrels are thick that he wrote the fable about the mountain and the squirrel It begins this way The Mountain and the Squirrel Had a quarrel The Mountain called the Squirrel Little Prig Illustration He generally went out alone Page two hundred twenty one It is rather nice to remember that after William Emerson had sold his bass viol after all the pinching and saving of missus William and after going with half a coat Ralph Waldo Emerson proved in the end to be such an uncommon man and scholar that his name is known the world over Perhaps if all of us were as willing to study and work and to keep studying and working as the Sage of Concord was there would be ever so many more famous Americans than there are to day JANE ADDAMS When Jane Addams was a little girl about seven years old out in Cedarville Illinois her father used to wonder why she got up in the morning so much earlier than the other children She explained to him politely that it was because she had so much to do Her mother was dead but her father looked after the children very carefully and to make sure that Jane read something besides fairy stories gave her five cents every time she could tell him about a new hero from Plutarch s Lives and fifteen cents for every volume of Irving s Life of Washington She would have read what he asked her to without a cent of pay for she almost worshiped him He was tall and handsome and a man of great importance in the west Jane was very proud of him and as she was plain toed in when she walked and had rather a crooked back she imagined that he must really be ashamed of her only he was too kind to say so So she tried to keep out of his way The Honorable John Addams her father taught a Bible class in Sunday school and Jane was so afraid it would mortify him if she walked home with him that she always ran ahead with an uncle urging him to hurry My she used to say he would be too ashamed to hold his head up again if I should speak to him on the street No one knew she felt this way and she had been dodging him some years when one morning over in the neighboring town she saw him coming down the steps of a bank building across the street from her There was no place to hide so she stood there blushing and breathing pretty hard But he lifted his tall silk hat to her smiled and waved his hand He looked so pleased to see her that she never worried any more about meeting him on the street Across the road from Jane s house was a nice green common and beyond this a narrow path led to her father s mills He owned two a flour mill and a sawmill In the sawmill great trees from the Illinois forests were sawed into lumber Jane used to sit on a log that was every minute being drawn nearer the great teeth of the saw and jump off it when she was within a few inches of the saw Jane and the other children had great fun in the flour mill too They made believe the bins were houses and down in the basement played on the tall piles of bran and shorts as they would on sand piles Jane s home was pretty and all the stores where she bought candy and toys were fascinating places She fancied the whole world was pleasant and gay She supposed that everybody in Cedarville had as good a home as she until one day she went down in the part of the town where the mill hands lived There the houses were shabby and untidy the children ragged and dirty They looked hungry too Jane ran home and when her father came to dinner she asked him why any one had to live in such a pitiful way He could not explain it so that she felt any better about it When I grow up she declared I will build a lovely house right in the middle of those poor huts so that the children may have something beautiful to look at and I will see that they have clean clothes and good food Only a few Sundays later Jane dashed into her father s room ready for church See my new cloak she called isn t it handsome Her father admired it and then answered Yes it is so much nicer than any other girl has that it may make some of the poorer ones unhappy Perhaps you had better wear your old one Jane was a child that could not bear to hurt another s feelings so she hung the new coat away and wore the other But as she walked to church she asked her father why every child could not have the same kind of things He told her probably there would always be a difference in the clothing families wore but in religion and education there was no reason why all should not have equal chances And Jane dear he added I think it is a mistake ever to make other people unhappy by dressing too much Jane never dropped her plan to have a fine house in the midst of poor ones The back gave her a good deal of trouble as she grew older and sometimes she had to lie still in bed for a year at a time But she managed to fit for college and to graduate Then she traveled abroad But never for a day had she given up that house she had planned when she was a child of seven Jane started to study medicine but was not strong enough to become a doctor So she traveled some more but she could never find a city where poor people were not suffering It saddened her and she said I can t wait any longer I must have a few people made happy So with a girl friend she went to the big city of Chicago and hired a fine old house that had been built by a millionaire a mister Hull This house had a wide hall open fireplaces a lot of windows for the sun to stream through and was on Halstead Street This street is thirty two miles long and in it live people from about every country in the world Jane Addams made the house so cheerful and pretty that it was a joy to peep into it Miss Addams and her friend asked the people about there to come in and have coffee and cocoa read books aloud to them taught the poor children to sew and cook visited the sick and made them understand all these poor tired discouraged people that at Hull House there were friends who wanted to help them in every way By and by there were clubs for boys at Hull House kindergartens for children parties for old folks and Halstead Street began to look cleaner for Miss Addams went up and down those thirty two miles of street and made it understood that she was there to help people grow healthy and clean All the time she was helping to nurse the sick and urging the rich people at their end of the city to come down to Halstead Street to see how the poor lived At Hull House an idiot child or a drunken woman was helped as quickly and willingly as if they had been a clean member of the royal family The more Miss Addams found out about what goes on in big cities the harder she worked She remembered what her father said about every one in this world deserving an equal chance and she tried to help factory workers mill hands girls and boys who had done wrong ignorant mothers who did not know how to keep house and take care of their children men who were out of work and the blind and crippled Miss Addams s work set other people to thinking and to day there is hardly a large city but has built a handsome house down in the slums which offers help and comfort to the poor But Hull House is the leading settlement house in the United States Jane Addams still dresses simply She does not care to have the best clothes in the neighborhood or jewels or luxuries for herself She does not believe in talking a great deal about what she intends to do later on She has found that the world needs busy workers more than ready talkers She is a busy good woman who has done noble work in America She is still getting up very early in the morning and I fancy that when she is asked why she rests so little she gives the same polite answer that her father heard Because I have so much to do LUTHER BURBANK A few years ago every one who went to California tried to see Luther Burbank for the newspapers and magazines were filled with stories of the wonderful things he was doing Plenty of men make houses automobiles ships to go on the water and ships that sail through the air clothing and toys but this man makes new fruits and flowers It is not an easy thing to do and mister Burbank has found that he needs all his strength and time for his work So now at his small farm at Santa Rosa and at his big farm at Sebastopol strangers find a sign like this ALL VISITORS ARE LIMITED TO FIVE MINUTES EACH UNLESS BY SPECIAL APPOINTMENT And during the six busiest months of the year from April to October other signs tell that it will cost ten dollars to stay one hour These signs are not put up because mister Burbank is cross or rude but because these strange new plants have to be watched as carefully as tiny babies He can t leave them for visitors Luther Burbank was born in Lancaster Massachusetts When he was a baby in his cradle his mother and sisters found that nothing made him dimple and crow with delight like a flower They noticed too that he never crushed a flower and once when a petal fell off a flower he was holding he tried for hours with his tiny fingers to put it back in place And when he was big enough to run about the house and yard instead of carrying a toy or a dog or cat in his arms he was usually hugging a potted plant of some kind for as people saw his great love for such things they were on the lookout for cunning plants for the dear little Burbank boy One day Luther was trudging across the yard clasping a small lobster cactus in an earthen pot when he stumbled and fell breaking the pot and plant He cried for days over the accident At school Luther was a delight to his teachers There were few black marks against his name He liked all his lessons but the books that told him about birds trees and flowers pleased him most When Luther was old enough to go to Leicester Academy he had for his dearest chum a boy cousin who knew Agassiz and who through him became interested in science This boy wanted to study about rocks and caves rivers and fish while Luther watched the birds that perched on the rocks and the trees that grew near the rivers But the two spent many weeks tramping over the country together Luther worked several summers in a factory near his home He was quick to understand machinery and invented a machine that saved the manager of the factory a great deal of money for it would do the work of six men Luther s family and friends were sure he would be an inventor But he himself wanted to raise flowers Luther saved a little money and started a vegetable garden He tried experiments with the potato plants until he raised an entirely different kind than had ever grown before Of course this made him want to experiment with other plants and he stayed in the hot sun so much looking after them that he had a bad sunstroke This led to his going to a climate where he might live outdoors during more months of the year and where he would not be apt to have such attacks When Luther reached California he had only a few dollars rather poor health and was among strangers He tried to get work on farms or orchards because he wanted to experiment with vines and vegetables But if he got work it was usually for only a few days at a time Finally he was obliged to work on a chicken ranch where the only place for him to sleep was in one of the chicken coops The pay was small and he did not have as much or as good food as some pet dogs get But all the time he was saying to himself If I can have patience I shall yet get a farm of my own By and by he was hired to look after a small nursery this is what a big plantation of trees is called He would have been perfectly happy there if sleeping in a damp room had not given him a fever He was poor sick and almost alone but not quite for a very poor woman who had only the milk of one cow to sell found him one day lying on a bed of straw and ever after that insisted on his drinking a pint of her milk each day He declared that this milk saved his life For some years Luther took one odd job after another until he saved enough to buy a small piece of ground Then he was soon raising plants and making new varieties He read and studied and tried experiments Sometimes he failed and even when he succeeded there was a good deal of fun made of him Some people thought Luther Burbank was crazy It seemed such an odd thing for a man to think of doing making a fruit or a flower that had not been heard of or dreamed of before But he did not pay any heed to all this sneering He worked harder than ever And before long the first new plants were in great demand so that by selling them he got money to buy more land To day some of the largest orchards in California are growing from one of Luther Burbank s experiments And our country is millions of dollars richer from his new kinds of plums potatoes and prunes mister Burbank bought acres of land hired armies of workmen denied himself pleasures and visitors and did not mind how tired he was so long as old plants were being made better or new plants were being created Pretty soon letters began to come from Russia France Japan England South America and Africa asking for some Burbank plants and some Burbank advice as to their care mister Burbank has made more new forms of plant life than any other man He has worked on two thousand five hundred species of plants Besides making flowers more beautiful and of sweeter fragrance he has done wonders with the cactus plants that grow on prairies Once all these plants were covered with thorns and prickles so that the cattle who bit into them rushed away with bleeding mouths feeling much the same as we should if we put our teeth into a stalk of celery and bit on to fish hooks and needles Well mister Burbank has changed all that The fruit of some of his cactus plants is almost as sweet as oranges the thorns are all gone so that the stalks are fine food for cattle some of the leaves make good pickles or greens and the small plants are used for hedges So the plants that were in old times a pest and nuisance are to day thanks to mister Burbank a comfort to the world Luther Burbank is a handsome courteous gentleman fond of fun of young people and children but you can see how busy he has been in the odd science of making new plants and trees and as he has plans for a great many more you will also understand why he really has to have those signs put up around his farm at Santa Rosa EDWARD ALEXANDER MACDOWELL On a lovely Sunday morning some years ago when all the sweet June smells came in through the open church window an old man with silvery white hair played such a soft entrancing little air on the organ as the ushers took the weekly offering that the listeners held their breath What is it they whispered What is the dainty thing called They asked the organist at the close of the service and he answered That was MacDowell s To a Wild Rose and MacDowell is a composer of whom America may well be proud Edward MacDowell was born in New York He had his first piano lessons when he was eight years old But as soon as he had learned the notes his mother noticed that it was not exercises that he played but merry rollicking airs When she asked him where he found them he replied In my head and heart He was even then composing music of his own His mother did not run to the neighbors at once crying My son is a genius Instead of that she thought Dear me I am afraid Edward will be a Jack of all trades and good at none for he writes beautiful stories and poems and draws exact likenesses of people What in the world shall we do with him All his music teachers said it would be wicked not to keep him at the piano But that was easier said than done When at the age of fifteen he went with his mother to Paris he passed fine examinations for entrance to the French Conservatory and learned the French language in no time so as to understand the teachers and lecturers But he was still apt to forget that he went to his classes to listen and spent much time sketching the faces of teacher or pupils on the margin of his note book MacDowell was busy one day over a picture of a teacher who had a large queerly shaped nose when the teacher seeing that the boy was paying no attention to the lesson darted to his seat and seized the sketch MacDowell was frightened and imagined he would be punished But the teacher was not a bit angry when he saw how true the lines were He asked to keep the paper and a few days later called on missus MacDowell Madam he said I have shown the picture your son drew of me to an artist of the School of Fine Arts and this gentleman is so sure Edward is meant for a portrait painter that he offers to pay all his expenses for three years and to give him lessons free of charge This was a grand chance for a poor boy missus MacDowell did not want to make any mistake She looked at the teacher a minute and asked What would you do Why I am sure he will make a famous piano player There was the same old tiresome question if Edward could do three or four things well how was any one to know which he might do best Finally the matter was left to Edward After a good many days of thinking he decided his life should be given to music Art was given up and Edward promised to waste no more time on his drawing But he was a great reader and liked good books to the end of his days After study of the piano in Paris MacDowell went to Frankfort for two years He had many pupils there and to one of them he was married The young married couple crossed the ocean and stayed in Boston long enough for MacDowell to give some concerts His fingers were like velvet on the keys of the piano and every one declared he must take part in a grand American concert that was to be given during the Paris Exposition He did as he was asked and the French people waved their handkerchiefs and cried in their language Good for the little American The French people invited him everywhere and begged him to remain in Paris but from first to last Edward MacDowell was a loyal American and he returned to Boston where for eight years he played in concerts took pupils and best of all wrote much of the music which makes Americans so proud of him He became a professor of music in Columbia College and his piano pieces were played the world over Many men who write music try to give it a style like some old Italian or German composer but MacDowell s music does not remind one of any German Italian or French writers it is just itself it is MacDowell Some of his music is heavy and grand but more of it is delicate It was wonderful to hear MacDowell himself play To a Wild Rose A friend who knew how much the composer liked that said once Mac something dreadful happened a few weeks ago I heard your Wild Rose played at a high school graduation on a high school piano by a high school girl awful MacDowell laughed and answered I suppose she pulled it up by the roots didn t she MacDowell loved outdoor life and after he bought a farm at Peterboro New Hampshire he built a log cabin way off in the woods had a grand piano carried there and in the quiet of that forest wrote some of his sweetest musical sketches The names of MacDowell s compositions show he loved life under the sky There are The Woodland Sketches Sea Pieces From a Log Cabin and single titles like The Eagle A Water Lily and The Bars at Sunset MacDowell worked too steadily and died when he was quite young but he had written enough music to be remembered as a great American composer He said any man who wanted to write music that described his country must love that country so well that he would put into his notes what the nation had put into its life He felt that America was a happy brave hopeful nation and he tried to make his music show that MacDowell was shy and modest and was quite surprised when different colleges made him a Doctor of Music when great concert players meekly asked him if they played his sonatas as he wished them played and when medals and jewels were sent him as gifts A good many studios are now built near MacDowell s log cabin in Peterboro and musicians and authors stay in the forest through the summer months liking the quiet spot and hoping the sight of his log cabin may make them work as faithfully for the glory of America as Edward MacDowell did Even the French artist who wished to make a portrait painter of him must have been glad that MacDowell clung to music and missus MacDowell found that her Jack of all trades was really master of one THOMAS ALVA EDISON If ever there was a busy boy Thomas Edison who was born in Milan Ohio was one He wanted to do everything that he saw others doing and more than that he liked to contrive new ways of doing things The grown up people wished he would not ask so many questions or stay always at their elbows watching their work But it came out all right in the end these busy ways of his for to day he is one of the world s greatest inventors Thomas was a sunny laughing little boy and pretty too except when he was trying to think how something was made then he would scowl and pucker up his mouth until you would hardly know him He always wanted to know how machinery worked and asked his father or any one near by to explain it to him Sometimes his father would get all tired out answering questions and to get rid of the little chap would say I don t know Then Thomas would stare at his father and say You don t know Why don t you know Then if mister Edison did not answer Thomas would perhaps run down by the water along the tow path for the canal There were shipyards by the water and he would pick up the different tools and ask the workmen what the name of each was how it was used and why it was used and get in their way generally until they drove him home He built fine houses and tiny villages with plank sidewalks from the bits of wood these ship builders gave him The belts and wheels in the saw and grist mills pleased him He watched them often Once in one of the mills he fell into a pile of wheat in a grain elevator and had nearly smothered before he was found Several times he fell into the canal and came near drowning When Thomas was six years old he watched a goose sitting on her eggs and saw them hatch He wanted to understand this strange thing better so he gathered all the goose and hen s eggs he could and made a big nest in his father s barn Then all of a sudden he was missing The family rushed to the canal the village and the mills and finally found him sitting on the nest of eggs in the barn He wanted to see if he could hatch those eggs out The only person who did not get out of patience with Thomas was his mother He and she adored each other She had been a school teacher and was used to children She saw that Thomas had a keen mind and was always ready to explain things to him When he went to school the teacher did not know what to make of his strange remarks and almost broke Thomas s heart one day by telling the principal that she thought the little Edison boy was addled Thomas ran home crying He could not bear to go again to the school so his mother taught him at home He had a wonderful memory and must have paid close attention to what was said for he never had to be told a thing the second time Thomas quite often had his lessons with his mother on the piazza They seemed so happy that the children who went to school often wished they could study with missus Edison She was fond of children and was apt to run down to the gate with some cookies or apples for them Sunny days Thomas liked to go with his father and mother into a tower mister Edison had built near the house It was eighty feet high and from its top one could see the broad river and hills beyond At the age of nine Thomas was more fond of reading than of playing When he was twelve he got the notion in his head that it would be a fine thing to read every book that was in the Public Library in Detroit He kept at it for months But when he had read every book on the first fifteen feet of shelves he saw that some were very dry and stupid and gave up his plan After that he chose the books that told of interesting things When Thomas was eleven he felt he ought to be doing something besides reading He wanted to earn some money His mother did not agree with him but after he had teased for whole weeks she said Well you may try working part of each day He sold papers and candy on the trains running between Port Huron and Detroit At first missus Edison was very nervous She imagined that perhaps his train was getting wrecked that he had fallen under the wheels of the engine and all sorts of horrid things but as he kept coming back home every night safe and happy she stopped worrying He was bright and the men who talked and laughed with him paid him a good deal of money for the papers and the nuts and candies which he carried in a basket He was a proud boy to hand over to his mother the earnings of a week which sometimes counted up to twenty dollars Thomas was such a very busy person that the lessons he had with his mother early in the mornings and his paper work on the train were not enough to satisfy him so he bought some old type a printing press and some ink rollers and began making a little newspaper of his own This newspaper was only the size of a lady s pocket handkerchief but it was so clever that he soon had five hundred subscribers and he made ten more dollars a week on that The great English engineer Stephenson was traveling on Thomas s train one day and was so pleased with the paper that he bought a thousand copies He said there were many newspapers edited by grown up men that were not one half as good Remember about this paper and if ever you see Thomas Edison s beautiful home at Orange New Jersey ask to look at a copy of it mister Edison thinks as much of it as of anything in the fine library Well Thomas s business on the trains grew so that he had to hire four boys to help him Then he bought some chemicals and in one corner of the baggage car in spare moments he began trying experiments He was just getting hold of some pretty exciting ideas when one day the train ran over something rough and spilled a bottle that held phosphorus This set the woodwork on fire and while poor Thomas was trying to beat out the flames the conductor in a rage threw boy press bottles and all off the train And that was the end of the newspaper The next thing to interest Thomas was the system of telegraphing He had not lost the habit of asking questions and quizzed the operator at Mt Clemens mister McKenzie every chance he had As he stood on the station platform one day asking mister McKenzie something he noticed the operator s little child playing on the tracks right in front of a coming train And that train was an express Thomas rushed out and seized the child just as the train almost touched his coat mister McKenzie was so grateful that he said Look here I want to do something for you Let me teach you to be a telegraph operator Thomas was delighted and after that used to take four lessons a week At the end of three months he was an expert Thomas could not have learned so quickly if he had not worked very steadily He always put his heart and mind on whatever he was learning and he did not sleep more than four or five hours at night all the time he was studying the dots and dashes that are used in sending telegraph messages At the age of sixteen Thomas Edison took his first position as telegraph operator He did not earn very much at this work at first and usually tried to get places where he had night hours This was so that he would have part of the daytime to read in public libraries and to try experiments There were so many wonderful things to learn or to understand in this world that it was a pity he thought to waste much time in eating or sleeping When Thomas was twenty two he had made his ideas worth three hundred dollars a month Probably the school teacher who thought the little Edison boy was addled never earned that much at any age From that time until now Thomas Edison s experiments have meant a fortune to him and no end of pleasure and comfort to the world You cannot go into a city in the United States that is not fitted with electric lights Edison lights When you hear a phonograph remember it is an Edison invention when you go sight seeing in a new city the guide of the motor carriages will shout the names of places to you through a megaphone another Edison idea He has patents on fourteen hundred ideas No wonder he has had to keep busy There is no telling how many more patents his brain will win for he is only sixty seven and that is young in the Edison family Thomas s great grandfather lived to be a hundred and four and his grandfather lived to be a hundred and two And he himself is just as busy to day as he was when he drove every one but his mother nearly crazy with his questions Only to day he stays in his workshop getting answers to them He never loses his interest in telegraph matters many of his inventions have been along that line In fun he called his first girl and boy Dot and Dash And in that fine home in New Jersey hanging near the funny little newspaper is a picture of Thomas Edison when he sold newspapers on the train and sent telegraph news about the great Civil War to all the stations along the way The picture shows a bright merry face America s greatest inventor still laughs like a boy and takes a day off now and then for music fishing and reading But he is the busiest man living Transcriber s note The following changes have been made to the
