MDCCXLIX THE DEDICATION TO THE SULTANA SHERAA BY SADI The eighteenth of the Month Scheval in the Year of the Hegira eight hundred thirty seven Thou Joy of ev ry Eye Thou Torment of every Heart Thou Intellectual Light I do not kiss the Dust of thy Feet because thou seldom art seen out of the Seraglio and when thou art thou walkest only on the Carpets of Iran or on Beds of Roses I here present you with a Translation of the Work of an ancient Sage who having the Happiness of living free from all Avocations thought proper by Way of Amusement to write the History of Zadig a Performance that comprehends in it more Instruction than tis possible you may at first be aware of I beg you would indulge me so far as to read it over and then pass your impartial Judgment upon it For notwithstanding you are in the Bloom of your Life tho ev ry Pleasure courts you tho you are Nature s Darling and have internal Qualities in proportion to your Beauty tho the World resounds your Praises from Morning till Night and consequently you must have a just Title to a superior Degree of Understanding than the rest of your Sex Yet your Wit is no ways flashy Your Taste is refin d and I have had the Honour to hear you talk more learnedly than the wisest Dervise with his venerable Beard and pointed Bonnet You are discreet and yet not mistrustful you are easy but not weak you are beneficent with Discretion you love your Friends and create yourself no Enemies Your most sprightly Flights borrow no Graces from Detraction you never speak a misbecoming Word nor do an ill natur d Action tho tis always in your Power In a Word your Soul is as spotless as your Person You have moreover a little Fund of Philosophy which gives me just Grounds to hope that you ll relish this Historical Performance better than any other Lady of your Quality would do It was originally compos d in the Chaldean Language to which both you and my self are perfect Strangers It was translated however into Arabic for the Amusement of the celebrated Sultan OULOUG BEG It first appear d in Public when the Arabian and Persian Tales of One Thousand and One Nights and One Thousand and One Days were most in Vogue OULOUG chose rather to entertain himself with the Adventures of Zadig The Sultanas indeed were more fond of the former How can you said the judicious OULOUG be so partial as to prefer a Set of Tales that are no ways interesting or instructive to a Work that has a Variety of Beauties to recommend it Oh replied the Sultanas the less Sense there is in them the more they are in Taste and the less their Merit the greater their Commendation I flatter my self thou Patroness of Wisdom that thou wilt not copy after those thoughtless Sultanas but give into the Sentiments of OULOUG I am in hopes likewise when you are tir d with the Conversation of such as make those senseless Romances abovemention d their favourite Amusements you will vouchsafe to listen for one Minute or two to the Dictates of solid Sense Had you been Thalestris in the Days of Scander the Son of Philip had you been the Queen of Sheba in the Reign of Solomon those Kings would have been proud to have taken a Tour to visit you May the Celestial Virtues grant that your Pleasures may meet with no Interruption your Charms know no Decay and may your Felicity be everlasting SADI THE Approbation I Who have subscrib d my Name hereto ambitious of being thought a Man of Wit and Learning have perus d this MANUSCRIPT which I find to my great Mortification amusing moral philosophical and fit to be read even by those who have an utter Aversion to Romances for which Reason I have depretiated it as it deserves and have in direct Terms told the CADI LESQUIER that tis a most detestable Performance THE CONTENTS CHAP I The blind Eye CHAP

by Nature with an uncommon Genius but born of illustrious Parents who bestowed on him an Education no ways inferior to his Birth Tho rich and young he knew how to give a Check to his Passions he was no ways self conceited he didn t always act up to the strictest Rules of Reason himself and knew how to look on the Foibles of others with an Eye of Indulgence Every one was surpriz d to find that notwithstanding he had such a Fund of Wit he never insulted nay never so much as rallied any of his Companions for that Tittle Tattle which was so vague and empty so noisy and confus d for those rash Reflections those illiterate Conclusions and those insipid Jokes and in short for that Flow of unmeaning Words which was call d polite Conversation in Babylon He had learned from the first Book of Zoroaster that Self love is like a Bladder full blown which when once prick d discharges a kind of petty Tempest Zadig in particular never boasted of his Contempt of the Fair Sex or of his Facility to make Conquests amongst them He was of a generous Spirit insomuch that he was not afraid of obliging even an ungrateful Man strictly adhering to that wise Maxim of Zoroaster When you are eating throw an Offal to the Dogs that are under the Table lest they should be tempted to bite you He was as wise as he could well be wish d since he was fond of no Company but such as were distinguish d for Men of Sense As he was well grounded in all the Sciences of the antient Chaldeans he was no Stranger to those Principles of Natural Philosophy which were then known And understood as much of Metaphysics as any one in all Ages after him that is to say he knew little or nothing of the Matter He was firmly convinc d that the Year consisted of three hundred sixty five Days and an half tho directly repugnant to the new Philosophy of the Age he liv d in and that the Sun was situated in the Center of the Earth And when the Chief Magi told him with an imperious Air that he maintain d erroneous Principles and that it was an Indignity offered to the Government under which he liv d to imagine the Sun should roll round its own Axis and that the Year consisted of twelve Months he knew how to sit still and quiet without shewing the least Tokens of Resentment or Contempt As Zadig was immensely rich and had consequently Friends without Number and as he was a Gentleman of a robust Constitution and remarkably handsome as he was endowed with a plentiful Share of ready and inoffensive Wit And in a Word as his Heart was perfectly sincere and open he imagin d himself in some Measure qualified to be perfectly happy For which Purpose he determin d to marry a gay young Lady one Semira by name whose Beauty Birth and Fortune render d her the most desirable Person in all Babylon He had a sincere Affection for her grounded on Honour and Semira conceiv d as tender a Passion for him They were just upon the critical Minute of a mutual Conjunction in the Bands of Matrimony when as they were walking Hand in Hand together towards one of the Gates of Babylon under the Shade of a Row of Palm trees that grew on the Banks of the River Euphrates they were beset by a Band of Ruffians arm d with Sabres Bows and Arrows They were the Guards it seems of young Orcan Nephew of a certain Minister of State whom the Parasites kept by his Uncle had buoy d up with a Permission to do with Impunity whatever he thought proper This young Rival tho he had none of those internal Qualities to boast of that Zadig had yet he imagin d himself a Man of more Power and for that Reason was perfectly outrageous to see the other preferr d before him This Fit of Jealousy the Result of mere Vanity prompted him to think that he was deeply in Love with the fair Semira and fir d with that amorous Notion he was determin d to take her away from Zadig by Dint of Arms The Ravishers rush d rudely upon her and in the Transport of their Rage drew the Blood of a Beauty the Sight of whose Charms would have soften d the very Tigers of Mount Imaues The injur d Lady rent the very Heavens with her Exclamations Where s my dear Husband she cried They have torn me from the Arms of the only Man whom I adore She never reflected on the Danger to which she was expos d her sole Concern was for her beloved Zadig At the same Time he defended her like a Lover and a Man of Integrity and Courage With the Assistance only of two domestic Servants he put those Sons of Violence to Flight and conducted Semira bloody as she was and in fainting Fits to her own House No sooner was she come to her self but she fix d her lovely Eyes on her Dear Deliverer O Zadig said she I love thee as affectionately as if I were actually thy Bride I love thee as the Man to whom I owe my Life and what is dearer to me the Preservation of my Honour No Heart sure could be more deeply smitten than that of Semira Never did the Lips of the fairest Creature living utter softer Sounds never did the most enamoured Lady breathe such tender Sentiments of Love and Gratitude for his signal Service never in short did the most affectionate Bride express such Transports of Joy for the fondest Husband Her Wounds however were but very superficial and she was soon recover d Zadig receiv d a Wound that was much more dangerous An unlucky Arrow had graz d one of his Eyes and the Orifice was deep Semira was incessant in her Prayers to the Gods that they might restore her Zadig Her Eyes were Night and Day overwhelm d with Tears She waited with Impatience for the happy Moment when those of Zadig might dart their Fires upon her but alas the wounded Eye grew so inflam d and swell d that she was terrified to the last Degree She sent as far as Memphis for Hermes the celebrated Physician there who instantly attended his new Patient with a numerous Retinue Upon his first Visit he peremptorily declared that Zadig would lose his Eye and foretold not only the Day but the very Hour when that woful Disaster would befal him Had it been said that Great Man his right Eye I could have administred an infallible Specific but as it is his Misfortune is beyond the Art of Man to cure Tho all Babylon pitied the hard Case of Zadig they equally stood astonish d at the profound Penetration of Hermes Two Days after the Imposthume broke without any Application and Zadig soon after was perfectly recover d Hermes thereupon wrote a very long and elaborate Treatise to prove that his Wound ought not to have been heal d Zadig however never thought it worth his while to peruse his learned Lucubrations but as soon as ever he could get abroad determin d to pay the Lady a Visit who had testified such uncommon Concern for his Welfare and for whose Sake alone he wish d for the Restoration of his Sight Semira he found had been out of Town for three Days but was inform d by the bye that his intended Spouse having conceived an implacable Aversion to a one ey d Man was that very Night to be married to Orcan At this unexpected ill News poor Zadig was perfectly thunder struck He laid his Disappointment so far to Heart that in a short Time he was become a mere Skeleton and was sick almost to death for some Months afterwards At last however by Dint of Reflection he got the better of his Distemper and the Acuteness of the Pain he underwent in some Measure contributed towards his Consolation Since I have met with such an unexpected Repulse said he from a capricious Court Lady I am determin d to marry some substantial Citizen s Daughter He pitch d accordingly upon Azora a young Gentlewoman extremely well bred an excellent Oeconomist and one whose Parents were very rich Their Nuptials accordingly were soon after solemniz d and for a whole Month successively no two Turtles were ever more fond of each other In Process of Time however he perceiv d she was a little Coquettish and too much inclin d to think that the handsomest young Fellows were always the most virtuous and the greatest Wits CHAP II The NOSE One Day Azora as she was just return d home from taking a short Country airing threw herself into a violent Passion and swell d with Invectives What in God s Name my Dear said Zadig has thus ruffled your Temper What can be the Meaning of all these warm Exclamations Alas said she you would have been disgusted as much as I am had you been an Eye witness of that Scene of Female Falshood as I was Yesterday I went you must know to visit the disconsolate Widow Cosrou who has been these two Days erecting a Monument to the Memory of her young deceased Husband near the Brook that runs on one side of her Meadow She made the most solemn Vow in the Height of her Affliction never to stir from that Tomb as long as ever that Rivulet took its usual Course Well and wherein pray said Zadig is the good Woman so much to blame Is it not an incontestable Mark of her superior Merit and Conjugal Affection But Zadig said Azora was you to know how her Thoughts were employ d when I made my Visit you d never forget or forgive her Pray my dearest Azora what then was she about Why the Creature said Azora was studying to be sure to find out Ways and Means to turn the Current of the River Azora in short harangu d so long and was so big with her Invectives against the young Widow that her too affected vain Shew of Virtue gave Zadig a secret Disgust Zadig had an intimate Friend one Cador by Name whose Spouse was perfectly honest and had in reality a greater Regard for him than all Mankind besides This Friend Zadig made his Confident and bound him to keep a Project of his entirely a Secret by a Promise of some valuable Token of his Respect Azora had been visiting a Female Companion for two Days together in the Country and on the third was returning home No sooner however was she in Sight of the House but the Servants ran to meet her with Tears in their Eyes and told her that their Master dy d suddenly the Night before that they durstn t carry her the doleful Tidings but were going to bury Zadig in the Sepulchre of his Ancestors at the Bottom of the Garden She burst into a Flood of Tears tore her Hair and vow d to die by his Side As soon as it was dark young Cador came and begg d the Favour of being introduc d to the Widow He was so and they wept together very cordially Next Day the Storm was somewhat abated and they din d together Cador inform d her that his Friend had left him the much greater Part of his Effects and gave her to understand that he should think himself the happiest Creature in the World if she would condescend to be his Partner in that Demise The Widow wept sobb d and began to melt More Time was spent in Supper than at Dinner They discoursed together with a little more Freedom Azora was lavish of her Encomiums on Zadig but then twas true she said he had some secret Infirmities to which Cador was a Stranger In the Midst of their Midnight Entertainment Cador all on a sudden complain d that he was taken with a most violent pleuretic Fit and was ready to swoon away Our Lady being extremely concern d and over officious flew to her Closet of Cordials and brought down every Thing she could think of that might be of Service on this emergent Occasion She was extremely sorry that the famous Hermes was gone from Babylon and condescended to lay her warm Hand upon the Part affected in which he felt such an agonizing Pain Pray Sir said she in a soft languishing Tone are you subject to this tormenting Malady Sometimes Madam said Cador so strong that they bring me almost to Death s Door and there is but one Thing can infallibly cure me and that is the Application of a dead Man s Nose to the part affected An odd Remedy truly said Azora Not stranger Madam said he than the Great Arnon s infallible Apoplectic Necklaces There was at this Time in Babylon a famous Doctor nam d Arnon who both cur d Apoplectic Fits and prevented them from affecting his Patients as was frequently advertiz d in the Gazettes by a little never failing Purse that he hung round their Necks This Assurance of Success together with Cador s personal Merit determin d Azora in his Favour After all said she when my Husband shall be about to cross the Bridge Tchimavar from this World of Yesterday to the other of To morrow will the Angel Asrael think you make any Scruple about his Passage should his Nose prove something shorter in the next Life than twas in this She would venture however and taking up a sharp Razor repair d to her Husband s Tomb water d it first with her Tears and then intended to perform the innocent Operation as he lay extended breathless as she thought in his Coffin Zadig mounted in a Moment secur d his Nose with one Hand and the Incision Knife with the other Madam said he never more exclaim against the Widow Cosrou The Scheme for cutting my Nose off was much closer laid than hers of throwing the River into a new Channel CHAP III The DOG and the HORSE Zadig found by Experience that the first thirty Days of Matrimony as tis written in the Book of Zend is Honey Moon but the second is all Wormwood He was oblig d in short as Azora grew such a Termagant to sue out a Bill of Divorce and to seek his Consolation for the future in the Study of Nature Who is happier said he than the Philosopher who peruses with Understanding that spacious Book which the supreme Being has laid open before his Eyes The Truths he discovers there are of infinite Service to him He thereby cultivates and improves his Mind He lives in Peace and Tranquility all his Days he is afraid of Nobody and he has no tender indulgent Wife to shorten his Nose for him Wrapped up in these Contemplations he retir d to a little Country House on the Banks of the Euphrates there he never spent his Time in calculating how many Inches of Water run thro the Arch of a Bridge in a second of Time or in enquiring if a Cube Line of Rain falls more in the Mouse Month than in that of the Ram He form d no Projects for making Silk Gloves and Stockings out of Spiders Webbs nor of China Ware out of broken Glass Bottles but he pry d into the Nature and Properties of Animals and Plants and soon by his strict and repeated Enquiries he was capable of discerning a Thousand Variations in visible Objects that others less curious imagin d were all alike One Day as he was taking a solitary Walk by the Side of a Thicket he espy d one of the Queen s Eunuchs with several of his Attendants coming towards him hunting about in deep Concern both here and there like Persons almost in Despair and seeking with Impatience for something lost of the utmost Importance Young Man said the Queen s chief Eunuch have not you seen pray her Majesty s Dog Zadig very cooly replied you mean her Bitch I presume You say very right Sir said the Eunuch tis a Spaniel Bitch indeed And very small said Zadig She has had Puppies too lately she s a little lame with her left Fore foot and has long Ears By your exact Description Sir you must doubtless have seen her said the Eunuch almost out of Breath But I have not Sir notwithstanding neither did I know but by you that the Queen ever had such a favourite Bitch Just at this critical Juncture so various are the Turns of Fortune s Wheel the best Palfrey in all the King s Stable had broke loose from the Groom and got upon the Plains of Babylon The Head Huntsman with all his inferior Officers were in Pursuit after him with as much Concern as the Eunuch about the Bitch The Head Huntsman address d himself to Zadig and ask d him whether he hadn t seen the King s Palfrey run by him No Horse said Zadig ever gallop d smoother he is about five Foot high his Hoofs are very small his Tail is about three Foot six Inches long the studs of his Bit are of pure Gold about twenty three Carats and his Shoes are of Silver about Eleven penny Weight a piece What Course did he take pray Sir Whereabouts is he said the Huntsman I never sat Eyes on him reply d Zadig not I neither did I ever hear before now that his Majesty had such a Palfrey The Head Huntsman as well as the Head Eunuch upon his answering their Interrogatories so very exactly not doubting in the least but that Zadig had clandestinely convey d both the Bitch and the Horse away secur d him and carried him before the grand Desterham who condemn d him to the Knout and to be confin d for Life in some remote and lonely Part of Siberia No sooner had the Sentence been pronounc d but the Horse and Bitch were both found The Judges were in some Perplexity in this odd Affair and yet thought it absolutely necessary as the Man was innocent to recal their Decree However they laid a Fine upon him of Four Hundred Ounces of Gold for his false Declaration of his not having seen what doubtless he did And the Fine was order d to be deposited in Court accordingly On the Payment whereof he was permitted to bring his Cause on to a Hearing before the grand Desterham On the Day appointed for that Purpose he open d the Cause himself in Terms to this or the like Effect Ye bright Stars of Justice ye profound Abyss of universal Knowledge ye Mirrors of Equity who have in you the Solidity of Lead the Hardness of Steel the Lustre of a Diamond and the Resemblance of the purest Gold Since ye have condescended so far as to admit of my Address to this August Assembly I here in the most solemn Manner swear to you by Orosmades that I never saw the Queen s illustrious Bitch nor the sacred Palfrey of the King of Kings I ll be ingenuous however and declare the Truth and nothing but the Truth As I was walking by the Thicket s Side where I met with her Majesty s most venerable chief Eunuch and the King s most illustrious chief Huntsman I perceiv d upon the Sand the Footsteps of an Animal and I easily inferr d that it must be a little one The several small tho long Ridges of Land between the Footsteps of the Creature gave me just Grounds to imagine it was a Bitch whose Teats hung down and for that Reason I concluded she had but lately pupp d As I observ d likewise some other Traces in some Degree different which seem d to have graz d all the Way upon the Surface of the Sand on the Side of the fore Feet I knew well enough she must have had long Ears And forasmuch as I discern d with some Degree of Curiosity that the Sand was every where less hollow d by one Foot in particular than by the other three I conceiv d that the Bitch of our most august Queen was somewhat lamish if I may presume to say so As to the Palfrey of the King of Kings give me leave to inform you that as I was walking down the Lane by the Thicket side I took particular Notice of the Prints made upon the Sand by a Horse s Shoes and found that their Distances were in exact Proportion from that Observation I concluded the Palfrey gallop d well In the next Place the Dust of some Trees in a narrow Lane which was but seven Foot broad was here and there swept off both on the Right and on the Left about three Feet and six Inches from the Middle of the Road For which Reason I pronounc d the Tail of the Palfrey to be three Foot and a half long with which he had whisk d off the Dust on both Sides as he ran along Again I perceiv d under the Trees which form d a Kind of Bower of five Feet high some Leaves that had been lately fallen on the Ground and I was sensible the Horse must have shook them off from whence I conjectur d he was five Foot high As to the Bits of his Bridle I knew they must be of Gold and of the Value I mention d for he had rubb d the Studs upon a certain Stone which I knew to be a Touch stone by an Experiment that I had made of it To conclude by the Prints which his Shoes had left of some Flint Stones of another Nature I concluded his Shoes were Silver and of eleven penny Weight Fineness as I before mention d The whole Bench of Judges stood astonish d at the Profundity of Zadig s nice Discernment The News was soon carried to the King and the Queen Zadig was not only the whole Subject of the Court s Conversation but his Name was mention d with the utmost Veneration in the King s Chambers and his Privy Council And notwithstanding several of their Magi declar d he ought to be burnt for a Sorcerer yet the King thought proper that the Fine he had deposited in Court should be peremptorily restor d The Clerk of the Court the Tipstaffs and other petty Officers waited on him in their proper Habit in order to refund the four Hundred Ounces of Gold pursuant to the King s express Order modestly reserving only three Hundred and ninety Ounces part thereof to defray the Fees of the Court And the Domesticks swarm d about him likewise in Hopes of some small Consideration Zadig upon winding up of the Bottom was fully convinc d that it was very dangerous to be over wise and was determin d to set a Watch before the Door of his Lips for the future An Opportunity soon offer d for the Trial of his Resolution A Prisoner of State had just made his Escape and pass d under the Window of Zadig s House Zadig was examin d thereupon but was absolutely dumb However as it was plainly prov d upon him that he did look out of the Window at the same Time he was sentenc d to pay five Hundred Ounces of Gold for that Misdemeanor and moreover was oblig d to thank the Court for their Indulgence a Compliment which the Magistrates of Babylon expect to be paid them Good God said he to himself have I not substantial Reason to complain that my impropitious Stars should direct me to walk by a Wood s Side where the Queen s Bitch and the King s Palfrey should happen to pass by How dangerous is it to pop one s Head out of one s Window And in a Word how difficult is it for a Man to be happy on this Side the Grave CHAP IV The ENVIOUS MAN As Zadig had met with such a Series of Misfortunes he was determin d to ease the Weight of them by the Study of Philosophy and the Conversation of select Friends He was still possess d of a little pretty Box in the Out parts of Babylon which was furnish d in a good Taste where every Artist was welcome and wherein he enjoy d all the rational Pleasures that a virtuous Man could well wish for In the Morning his Library was always open for the Use of the Learned at Night his Table was fill d with the most agreeable Companions but he was soon sensible by Experience how dangerous it was to keep learned Men Company A warm Dispute arose about a certain Law of Zoroaster which prohibited the Eating of Griffins But to what Purpose said some of the Company was that Prohibition since there is no such Animal in Nature Some again insisted that there must for otherwise Zoroaster could never have been so weak as to give his Pupils such a Caution Zadig in order to compromize the Matter said Gentlemen If there are such Creatures in Being let us never touch them and if there are not we are well assur d we can t touch them so in either Case we shall comply with the Commandment A learned Man at the upper End of the Table who had compos d thirteen Volumes expatiating on every Property of the Griffin took this Affair in a very serious Light which would greatly have embarrass d Zadig but for the Credit of a Magus who was Brother to his Friend Cador From that Day forward Zadig ever distinguish d and preferr d good before learned Company He associated with the most conversible Men and the most amiable Ladies in all Babylon he made elegant Entertainments which were frequently preceded by a Concert of Musick and enliven d by the most facetious Conversation in which as he had felt the Smart of it he had laid aside all Thoughts of shewing his Wit which is not only the surest Proof that a Man has none but the most infallible Means to spoil all good Company Neither the Choice of his Friends nor that of his Dishes was the Result of Pride or Ostentation He took Delight in appearing to be what he actually was and not in seeming to be what he was not and by that Means got a greater real Character than he actually aim d at Directly opposite to his House liv d Arimazes one puff d up with Pride who not meeting with Success in the World sought his Revenge in railing against all Mankind Rich as he was it was almost more than he could accomplish to procure ev n any Parasites about him Tho the rattling of the Chariots which stopp d at Zadig s Door was a perfect Nuisance to him yet the good Character which every Body gave him was still a higher Provocation He would sometimes intrude himself upon Zadig and set down at his Table without any Invitation when there he would most certainly interrupt the Mirth of the Company as Harpies they say infect the very Carrion that they eat Arimazes took it in his Head one Day to invite a young Lady to an Entertainment but she instead of accepting of his Offer spent the Evening at Zadig s Another Time as Zadig and he were chatting together at Court a Minister of State came up to them and invited Zadig to Supper but took no Notice of Arimazes The most implacable Aversions have frequently no better Foundations This Gentleman who was call d the envious Man would have taken away the Life of Zadig if he could because most People distinguish d him by the Title of the Happy Man An Opportunity of doing Mischief says Zoroaster offers itself a hundred Times a Day but that of doing a Friend a good Office but once a Year Arimazes went one Day to Zadig s House when he was walking in his Garden with two Friends and a young Lady to whom he said Abundance of fine Things with no other Design but the innocent Pleasure of saying them Their Conversation turn d on a War that the King had happily put an End to between him and his Vassal the Prince of Hyrcania Zadig having signaliz d himself in that short War commended his Majesty very highly but was more lavish of his Compliments on the Lady He took out his Pocket Book and wrote four extempore Verses on that Occasion and gave them the Lady to read The Gentlemen then present begg d to be oblig d with a Sight of them as well as the Lady But either thro Modesty or rather a self Consciousness that he hadn t happily succeeded he gave them a flat Denial He was sensible that a sudden poetic Flight must prove insipid to every one but the Person in whose Favour it is written whereupon he snapt the Table in two whereon the Lines were wrote and threw both Pieces into a Rose bush where they were hunted for but to no Purpose Soon after it happened to rain and all the Company flew into the House but Arimazes Notwithstanding the Shower he continued in the Garden and never quitted it till he had found one Moiety of the Tablet which was unfortunately broke in such a Manner that even the half Lines were good sense and good Metre tho very short But what was still more remarkably unfortunate they appear d at first View to be a severe satyr upon the King The Words were these To flagrant Crimes His Crown he owes To peaceful Times The worst of Foes This was the first Moment that ever Arimazes was happy He had it now in his Power to ruin the most virtuous and innocent of Men Big with his execrable Joy he flew to his Majesty with this virulent Satyr of Zadig s under his own Hand Not only Zadig but his two Friends and the Lady were immediately close confin d His Cause was soon over for the Judges turn d a deaf Ear to what he had to say When Sentence of Condemnation was pass d upon him Arimazes still spiteful was heard to say as he went out of Court with an Air of Contempt that Zadig s Lines were Treason indeed but nothing more Tho Zadig didn t value himself on Account of his Genius for Poetry yet he was almost distracted to find himself condemn d for the worst of Traitors and his two Friends and the Lady lock d up in a Dungeon for a Crime of which he was no ways guilty He wasn t permitted to speak one Word for himself His Pocket Book was sufficient Evidence against him So strict were the Laws of Babylon He was carried to the Place of Execution through a Croud of Spectators who durstn t condole with him and who flock d about him to observe whether his Countenance chang d or whether he died with a good Grace His Relations were the only real Mourners for there was no Estate in Reversion for them three Parts of his Effects were confiscated for the King s Use and the fourth was devoted as a Reward to the use of the Informer Just at the Time that he was preparing himself for Death the King s Parrot flew from her Balcony into Zadig s Garden and alighted on a Rose bush A Peach that had been blown down and drove by the Wind from an adjacent Tree just under the Bush was glew d as it were to the other Moiety of the Tablet Away flew the Parrot with her Booty and return d to the King s Lap The Monarch being somewhat curious read the Words on the broken Tablet which had no Meaning in them as he could perceive but seem d to be the broken Parts of a Tetrastick He was a great Admirer of Poetry and the odd Adventure of his Parrot put him upon Reflection The Queen who recollected full well the Lines that were wrote on the Fragment of Zadig s Tablet order d that Part of it to be produc d Both the broken Pieces being put together they answered exactly the Indentures and then the Verses which Zadig had written in a Flight of Loyalty ran thus Tyrants are prone to flagrant Crimes To Clemency his Crown he owes To Concord and to peaceful Times Love only is the worst of Foes Upon this the King order d Zadig to be instantly brought before him and his two Friends and the Lady to be that Moment discharg d Zadig as he stood before the King and Queen fix d his Eyes upon the Ground and begg d their Majesty s Pardon for his little worthless poetical Attempt He spoke however with such a becoming Grace and with so much Modesty and good Sense that the King and the Queen ordered him to be brought before them once again He was brought accordingly and he pleas d them still more and more In short they gave him all the immense Estate of Arimazes who had so unjustly accus d him but Zadig generously return d the wicked Informer the Whole to a Farthing The envious Man however was no ways affected but with the Restoration of his Effects Zadig every Day grew more and more in Favour at Court He was made a Party in all the King s Pleasures and nothing was done in the Privy Council without him The Queen from that very Hour shew d him so much Respect and spoke to him in such soft and endearing Terms that in Process of Time it prov d of fatal Consequence to herself her Royal Consort to Zadig and the whole Kingdom Zadig now began to think it was not so difficult a Thing to be happy as at first he imagin d CHAP V The Force of Generosity The Time now drew near for the Celebration of a grand Festival which was kept but once in five Years Twas a constant Custom in Babylon at the Expiration of the Term above mention d to distinguish that Citizen from all the Rest in the most solemn Manner who had done the most generous Action and the Grandees and Magi always sat as Judges The Satrap inform d them of every praise worthy Deed that occurr d within his District All were put to the Vote and the King himself pronounc d the Definitive Sentence People of all Ranks and Degrees came from the remotest Part of the Kingdom to be present at this Solemnity The Victor whoever he was receiv d from the King s own Hand a golden Cup enrich d with precious Stones and upon the Delivery the King made use of the following Salutation Receive this Reward of your Generosity and may the Gods grant me Thousands of such valuable Subjects Upon this memorable Day the King appear d in all the Pomp imaginable on his Throne of State surrounded by his Grandees the Magi and the Deputies from all the surrounding Nations of every Province that attended these public Sports where Honour was to be acquir d not by the Velocity of the best Race Horse or by bodily Strength but by intrinsic Merit The principal Satrap proclaim d with an audible Voice such Actions as would entitle the Victor to the inestimable Prize but never mention d one Word of Zadig s Greatness of Soul in returning his invidious Neighbour all his Estate notwithstanding he would have taken away his Life That was but a Trifle and not worth speaking of The first that was set up for the Prize was a Judge that had occasion d a Citizen to lose a very considerable Cause through some Mistake for which he was no ways responsible and made him Restitution out of his private Purse The next Candidate was a Youth that tho violently in Love with one that he intended shortly to make his Spouse yet resign d her to his Friend who was just expiring at her Feet and moreover gave her a Portion at the same Time After this appear d a Soldier who in the Hyrcanian War had done a much more glorious Action than the Lover A Gang of Hyrcanians having taken his Mistress from him he fought them bravely and rescued her out of their Hands Soon after he was inform d that another Band of the same Party had hurried away his Mother to a Place not far distant he left his Mistress all drown d in Tears and ran to his Mother s Assistance After that Skirmish was over he returned to his Sweet heart and found her just expiring He would fain have plung d a Dagger into his Heart that Moment but his Mother remonstrated to him that should he die she should be entirely helpless and upon that Account only he had Courage to live a little longer The Judges seem d very much inclin d to give their Votes for the Soldier but the King prevented them by saying that the Soldier s Action was praise worthy enough and so were those of the rest but none of them give me any Surprize What Zadig did Yesterday perfectly struck me with Astonishment I ll mention another Instance I had some few Days ago as a Testimony of my Resentment banish d my Prime Minister and Favourite Coreb from the Court I complain d of his Conduct in the warmest Terms and all my Sycophants about me told me that I was too merciful and loaded him with the sharpest Invectives I ask d Zadig what his Opinion was of Coreb and he dar d to give him the best of Characters I must confess I have read in our publick Records indeed of Instances where Restitution have been generally made for Injuries committed by Mistake where a Mistress has been resign d and where a Mother has been preferr d to a Mistress but I never read of a Courtier that would speak to the Advantage of a Minister in Disgrace and against whom the Sovereign was highly incens d I ll give twenty thousand Pieces of Gold to every Candidate that has been this Day proclaim d but I ll give the Cup to no one but Zadig Sire said Zadig tis your Majesty alone that deserves the Cup tis you alone who have done an Action of Generosity never heard of before since you who are King of Kings wasn t exasperated against your Slave when he contradicted you in the Heat of your Passion Every Body gaz d with Eyes of Admiration on the King and Zadig The Judge who had generously made Restitution for his Error the Lover who had married his Mistress to his Friend the Soldier who had preferr d the Welfare of his Mother to that of his Mistress received the promis d Donation from the Monarch and saw their Names register d in the Book of Fame But Zadig had the Cup The King got the universal Character of a good Prince which he did not long preserve This joyful Day was solemniz d with Festivals beyond the Time by Law establish d Tragedies were acted there that drew Tears from the Spectators and Comedies that made them laugh Entertainments that the Babylonians were perfect Strangers to The Commemoration of it is still preserv d in Asia Now said Zadig I am happy at last but he was grosly mistaken CHAP VI The JUDGMENTS Young as Zadig was he was constituted chief Judge of all the Tribunals throughout the Empire He fill d the Place like one whom the Gods had endow d with the strictest Justice and the most solid Wisdom It was to him the Nations round about were indebted for that generous Maxim that tis much more Prudence to acquit two Persons tho actually guilty than to pass Sentence of Condemnation in one that is virtuous and innocent It was his firm Opinion that the Laws were intended to be a Praise to those who did well as much as to be a Terror to Evildoers It was his peculiar Talent to render Truth as obvious as possible Whereas most Men study to render it intricate and obscure On the very first Day of his Entrance into his High Office he exerted this peculiar Talent A rich Merchant and a Native of Babylon died in the Indies He had made his Will and appointed his two Sons Joint Heirs of his Estate as soon as they had settled their Sister and married her with their mutual Approbation Moreover he left a specific Legacy of thirty thousand Pieces of Gold to that Son who should after his Decease be prov d to love him best The Eldest erected to his Memory a very costly Monument The Youngest appropriated a considerable Part of his Bequest to the Augmentation of his Sister s Fortune Every one without Hesitation gave the Preference to the Elder allowing the Younger to have the greatest Affection for his Sister The Legacy therefore was doubtless due to the Eldest Their Cause came before Zadig and he examin d them apart To the former said Zadig Your Father Sir is not dead as is reported but being happily recover d is on his Return to Babylon God be praised said the young Man but I hope the Expence I have been at in raising this superb Monument will be consider d After this Zadig repeated the same Story to the Younger God be praised said he I will immediately restore all that he has left me but I hope my Father will not recal the little Present I have made my Sister You have nothing to restore Sir you shall have the Legacy of the thirty thousand Pieces for tis you that have the greatest Veneration for your deceased Father A young Lady that was very rich had entred into a Marriage Contract with two Magis and having receiv d Instructions from both Parties for some Months she prov d with Child They were both ready and willing to marry her But said she he shall be my Husband that has put me into a Capacity of serving my Country by adding one to it Tis I Madam that have answered that valuable End said one but the other insisted twas his Operation Well said she since this is a Moot point I ll acknowledge him for the Father of the Child that will give him the most liberal Education In a short Time after my Lady was brought to Bed of a hopeful Boy Each of them insisted on being Tutor and the Cause was brought before Zadig The two Magi were order d to appear in Court Pray Sir said Zadig to the first what Method of Instruction do you propose to pursue for the Improvement of your young Pupil He shall first be grounded said this learned Pedagogue in the Eight Parts of Speech then I ll teach him Logic Astrology Magick the wide Difference between the Terms Substance and Accident Abstract and Concrete c c As for my Part Sir I shall take another Course said the second I ll do my utmost to make him an honest Man and acceptable to his Friends Upon this Zadig said you Sir shall marry the Mother let who will be the Father There came daily Complaints to Court against the Itimadoulet of Media whose Name was Irax He was a Person of Quality who was possess d of a very considerable Estate notwithstanding he had squander d away a great Part of it by indulging himself in all Manner of expensive Pleasures It was but seldom that an Inferior was suffer d to speak to him but not a Soul durst contradict him No Peacock was more gay no Turtle more amorous and no Tortoise more indolent and inactive He made false Glory and false Pleasures his sole Pursuit Zadig undertaking to cure him sent him forthwith as by express Order from the King a Musick Master with twelve Voices and twenty four Violins as his Attendants a Head Steward with six Men Cooks and four Chamberlains who were never to be out of his Sight The King issued out his Writ for the punctual Observance of his Royal Will and thus the Affair proceeded The first Morning as soon as the voluptuous Irax had open d his Eyes his Musick Master with the Voices and Violins entred his Apartment They sang a Cantata that lasted two Hours and three Minutes Every three Minutes the Chorus or Burthen of the Song was to this Effect Tisn t in Words to speak your Praise What mighty Honours are your Due To worth like yours we Altars raise No Monarch s happier Sir than you After the Cantata was over the Chamberlain address d him in a formal Harangue for three Quarters of an Hour without ceasing wherein he took Occasion to extol every Virtue to which he was a perfect Stranger when the Oration was over he was conducted to Dinner where the Musicians were all in waiting and play d as soon as he was seated at his Table Dinner lasted three Hours before he condescended to speak a Word When he did you say Right Sir said the chief Chamberlain scarce had he utter d four Words more but Right Sir said the second The other two Chamberlain s Time was taken up in laughing with Admiration at Irax s Smart Repartees or at least such as he ought to have made After the Cloth was taken away the adulating Chorus was repeated This first Day Irax was all in Raptures he imagin d that this Honour done him by the King of Kings was the sole Result of his exalted Merit The second wasn t altogether so agreeable The third prov d somewhat troublesome the fourth insupportable the fifth was tormenting and at last he was perfectly outrageous at the continual Peal in his Ears of No Monarch s happier Sir than you You say right c and at being daily harangu d at the same Hour Whereupon he wrote to Court and begg d of his Majesty to recal his Chamberlain his Musick Master and all his Retinue his Head Steward and his Cooks and promis d in the most submissive Manner to be less vain and more industrious for the future Tho he didn t require so much Adulations nor such grand Entertainments he was much more happy for as Sadder has it One continued Scene of Pleasure is no Pleasure at all Zadig every Day gave incontestable Proofs of his wondrous Penetration and the Goodness of his Heart he was ador d by the People and was the Darling of the King The little Difficulties that he met with in the first Stage of his Life serv d only to augment his present Felicity Every Night however he had some unlucky Dream or another that gave him some Disturbance One while he imagin d himself extended on a Bed of wither d Plants amongst which there were some that were sharp pointed and made him very restless and uneasy another Time he fancied himself repos d on a Bed of Roses out of which rush d a Serpent that stung him to the Heart with his envenom d Tongue Alas said he waking I was one while upon a Bed of hard and nauseous Plants and just this Moment repos d on a Bed of Roses But then the Serpent CHAP VII The Force of JEALOUSY The Misfortunes that attended Zadig proceeded in a great Measure from his Preferment but more from his intrinsic Merit Every Day he had familiar Converse with the King his Royal Master and his august Consort Astarte And the Pleasure arising from thence was greatly enhanc d from an innate Ambition of pleasing which in regard to Wit is the same as Dress is to Beauty His Youth and graceful Deportment had a greater Influence on Astarte than she was at first aware of Tho her Affection for him daily encreas d yet she was perfectly innocent Astarte would say without the least Reserve or Apprehension of Fear that she was extreamly pleas d with the Company of one who was not only a Favourite of her Husband but the Darling of the whole Empire She was continually speaking in his Commendation before the King He was the Subject of her whole Discourse amongst her Ladies of Honour who were as lavish of their Praises as herself Such repeated Discourses however innocent made a deeper Impression on her Heart than she at that Time apprehended She would every now and then send Zadig some little Present or another which he construed as the Result of a greater Value for him than she intended She said no more of him as she thought than a Queen might innocently do who was perfectly assur d of his Attachment to her Husband sometimes indeed she would express her self with an Air of Tenderness and Affection Astarte was much handsomer than either his Mistress Semira who had such a natural Antipathy to a one eyed Lord or Azora his late loving Spouse that would innocently have cut his Nose off The Freedoms which Astarte took her tender Expressions at which she began to blush the Glances of her Eye which she would turn away if perceiv d and which she fix d upon his kindled in the Heart of Zadig a Fire which struck him with Amazement He did all he could to smother it he call d up all the Philosophy he was Master of to his Aid but all in vain for no Consolation arose from those Reflections Duty Gratitude and an injur d Monarch presented themselves before his Eyes as avenging Deities He bravely struggled he triumph d indeed but this Conquest over his Passions which he was oblig d to check every Moment cost him many a deep Sigh and Tear He durst not talk with the Queen any more with that Freedom which was too engaging on both Sides his Eyes were obnubilated his Discourse was forc d and unconnected he turn d his Eyes another Way and when against his Inclination they met with those of the Queen he found that tho drown d in Tears they darted Flames of Fire They seem d in Silence to intimate that they were afraid of being in love with each other and that both burn d with a Fire which both condemn d Zadig flew from her Presence like one beside himself and in Despair his Heart was over charg d with a Burthen too great for him to bear In the Heat of his Conflicts he disclos d the Secrets of his Heart to his trusty Friend Cador as one who having long groan d under the Weight of an inexpressible Anguish of Mind at once makes known the Cause of his Torments by the Groans as it were extorted from him and by the Drops of a cold Sweat that trickled down his Cheeks Cador said to him tis now some considerable Time since I have discover d that secret Passion which you have foster d in your Bosom and yet endeavour d to conceal even from your self The Passions carry along with them such strong Impressions that they cannot be conceal d Tell me ingenuously Zadig and be your own Accuser whether or no since I have made this Discovery the King has not shewn some visible Marks of his Resentment He has no other Foible but that of being the most jealous Mortal breathing You take more Pains to check the Violence of your Passion than the Queen herself does because you are a Philosopher because in short you are Zadig Astarte is but a weak Woman and tho her Eyes speak too visibly and with too much Imprudence yet she does not think her self blame worthy Being conscious of her Innocence to her own Misfortune as well as yours she is too unguarded I tremble for her because I am sensible her Conscience acquits her Were you both agreed you might conceal your Regard for each other from all the World A rising Passion that is smother d breaks out into a Flame Love when once gratified knows how to conceal itself with Art Zadig shudder d at the Proposition of ungratefully violating the Bed of his Royal Benefactor and never was there a more loyal Subject to a Prince tho guilty of an involuntary Crime The Queen however repeated the Name of Zadig so often and her Cheeks glow d with such a red when ever she utter d it she was one while so transported and at another so dejected when the Discourse turn d upon him in the King s Presence she was in such a Reverie so confus d and stupid when he went out of the Presence that her Deportment made the King extremely uneasy He was convinc d of every Thing he saw and form d in his Mind an Idea of a thousand Things he did not see He observ d particularly that Astarte s Sandals were blue so Zadig s were blue likewise that as the Queen wore yellow Ribbands Zadig s Turbet was of the same Colour These were shocking Circumstances for a Monarch of his Cast of Mind to reflect on To a Mind in short so distemper d as his was Suspicions were converted into real Facts All Court Slaves and Sycophants are so many Spies on Kings and Queens They soon discover d that Astarte was fond and Moabdar jealous Arimazius his envious Foe who was as incorrigible as ever for Flints will never soften and Creatures that are by Nature venemous forever retain their Poison Arimazius I say wrote an anonymous Letter to Moabdar the infamous Recourse of sordid Spirits who are the Objects of universal Contempt but in this Case an Affair of the last Importance because this Letter tallied with the baneful Suggestions that Monarch had conceiv d In short his Thoughts were now wholly bent upon Revenge He determin d to poison Astarte on a certain Night and to have Zadig strangled by Break of Day Orders for that Purpose were expressly given to a merciless inhuman Eunuch the ready Executioner of his Vengeance At that critical Conjuncture there happen d to be a Dwarf who was dumb but not deaf in the King s Apartment Nobody regarded him He was an Eye and Ear witness of all that pass d and yet no more suspected than any irrational Domestic Animal This little Dwarf had conceiv d a peculiar Regard for Astarte and Zadig He heard with equal Horror and Surprize the King s Orders to destroy them both But how to prevent those Orders from being put into Execution as the Time was so short was all his Concern He could not write tis true but he had luckily learnt to draw and take a Likeness He spent a good Part of the Night in delineating with Crayons on a Piece of Paper the imminent Danger that thus attended the Queen In one Corner he represented the King highly incens d and giving his cruel Eunuch the fatal Orders in another a Bowl and a Cord upon a Table in the Center was the Queen expiring in the Arms of her Maids of Honour with Zadig strangled and laid dead at her Feet In the Horizon was the rising Sun to denote that this execrable Scene was to be exhibited by Break of Day No sooner was his Design finish d but he ran with it to one of Astarte s Female Favourites then in waiting call d her up and gave her to understand that she must carry the Draught to Astarte that very Moment In the mean Time the Queen s Attendants tho it was Dead of Night knock d at the Door of Zadig s Apartment wak d him and deliver d into his Hands a Billet from the Queen At first he could not well tell whether he was only in a Dream or not but soon read the Letter with a trembling Hand and a heavy Heart Words can t express his Surprise and the Agonies of Despair which he was in upon his perusal of the Contents Fly said she Dear Zadig this very Moment for your Life s in the utmost Danger Fly Dear Zadig I conjure you in the Name of that fatal Passion with which I have long struggled and which I now venture to discover as I am to make Atonement for it in a few Moments by the Loss of my Life Tho I am conscious to myself of my Innocence I find I am to feel the Weight of my Husband s Resentment and die the Death of a Traitor Zadig was scarce able to speak He order d his Friend Cador to be instantly call d and gave him the Letter the Moment he came without opening his Lips Cador press d him to regard the Contents and to make the best of his Way to Memphis If you presume said he to have an Interview with her Majesty first you inevitably hasten her Execution or if you wait upon the King the fatal Consequence will be the same I ll prevent her unhappy Fate if possible you follow but your own I ll give it out that you are gone to the Indies I ll wait on you as soon as the Hurricane is blown over and I ll let you know all that occurs material in Babylon Cador that Instant order d two of the fleetest Dromedaries that could be got to be in readiness at a private Back Door belonging to the Court he help d Zadig to mount his Beast tho ready to drop into the Earth He had but one trusty Servant to attend him and Cador overwhelm d with Grief soon lost Sight of his dearly beloved Friend This illustrious Fugitive soon reach d the Summit of a little Hill that afforded him a fair Prospect of the whole City of Babylon But turning his Eyes back towards the Queen s Palace he fainted away and when he had recover d his Senses he drown d his Eyes in a Flood of Tears and with Impatience wish d for Death To conclude after he had reflected with Horror on the deplorable Fate of the most amiable Creature in the Universe and of the most meritorious Queen that ever liv d he for a Moment commanded his Passion and with a Sigh made the following Exclamations What is this mortal Life O Virtue Virtue of what Service hast thou been to me Two young Ladies a Mistress and a Wife have prov d false to me a third who is perfectly innocent and ten thousand Times handsomer than either of them has suffer d Death tis probable before this on my Account All the Acts of Benevolence which I have shewn have been the Foundation of my Sorrows and I have been only rais d to the highest Spoke of Fortune s Wheel for no other Purpose than to be tumbled down with the greater Force Had I been as abandon d as some Miscreants are I had like them been happy His Head thus overwhelm d with these melancholy Reflections his Eyes thus sunk in his Head and his meagre Cheeks all pale and languid and in a Word his very Soul thus plung d in the Abyss of deep Despair he pursu d his Journey towards Egypt CHAP VIII The Thrash d WIFE Zadig steer d his Course by the Stars that shone over his Head The Constellation of Orion and the radiant Dog star directed him towards the Pole of Canope He reflected with Admiration on those immense Globes of Light which appear d to the naked Eye no more than little twinkling Lights whereas the Earth he was then traversing which in Reality is no more than an imperceptible Point in Nature seem d according to the selfish Idea we generally entertain of it something very immense and very magnificent He then reflected on the whole Race of Mankind and look d upon them as they are in Fact a Parcel of Insects or Reptiles devouring one another on a small Atom of Clay This just Idea of them greatly alleviated his Misfortunes recollecting the Nothingness if we may be allow d the Expression of his own Being and even of Babylon itself His capacious Soul now soar d into Infinity and he contemplated with the same Freedom as if she was disencumber d from her earthly Partner on the immutable Order of the Universe But as soon as she cower d her Wings and resumed her native Seat he began to consider that Astarte might possibly have lost her Life for his Sake upon which his Thoughts of the Universe vanish d all at once and no other Objects appear d before his distemper d Eyes but his Astarte giving up the Ghost and himself overwhelm d with a Sea of Troubles As he gave himself up to this Flux and Reflux of sublime Philosophy and Anxiety of Mind he was insensibly arriv d on the Frontiers of Egypt And his trusty Attendant had unknown to him stept into the first Village and sought out for a proper Apartment for his Master and himself Zadig in the mean Time made the best of his Way to the adjacent Gardens where he saw not far distant from the High way a young Lady all drown d in Tears calling upon Heaven and Earth for Succour in her Distress and a Man fir d with Rage and Resentment in pursuit after her He had now just overtaken her and she fell prostrate at his Feet imploring his Forgiveness He loaded her with a thousand Reproaches nor did he spare to chastise her in the most outrageous Manner By the Egyptian s cruel Deportment towards her he concluded that the Man was a jealous Husband and that the Lady was an Inconstant and had defil d his Bed But when he reflected that the Woman was a perfect Beauty and to his thinking something like the unfortunate Astarte he perceiv d his Heart yearn with Compassion towards the Lady and swell with Indignation against her Tyrant For Heaven s sake Sir assist me said she to Zadig sobbing as if her Heart would break Oh deliver me out of the Hands of this Barbarian Save Sir O save my Life Upon these her shocking Outcries Zadig threw himself between the injur d Lady and the inexorable Brute And as he had some smattering of the Egyptian Tongue he expostulated with him in his own Dialect and said Dear Sir if you are endow d with the least Spark of Humanity let me conjure you to have some Pity and Remorse for so beautiful a Creature have some Regard Sir to the Weakness of her Sex How can you treat a Lady who is one of Nature s Master pieces in such a rude and outrageous Manner one who lies weeping at your Feet for Forgiveness and one who has no other Recourse than her Tears for her Defence Oh Oh said the jealous pated Fellow in a Fury to Zadig What You are one of her Gallants I suppose I ll be reveng d of thee thou Villain this Moment No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth but he quits hold of the Lady in whose Hair he had twisted his Fingers before takes up his Lance in a Fury and endeavours to the utmost of his Pow r to plunge it in the Stranger s Heart Zadig however being cool warded the intended Blow with Ease He laid fast hold of his Lance towards the Point One strove to recover it and the other to snatch it away by Force They broke it between them Whereupon the Egyptian drew his Sword Zadig drew his They fought The former made a hundred rash Passes one after another which the latter parried with the utmost Dexterity The Lady sat herself upon a Grass plat adjusting her Head dress and looking on the Combatants The Egyptian was too strong for Zadig but Zadig was more nimble and active The latter fought as a Man whose Hand was guided by his Head the former as a Mad man who dealt about his Blows at random Zadig took the Advantage made a Plunge at him and disarm d him And forasmuch as he found that the Egyptian was hotter than ever and endeavour d all he could to throw him down by Dint of Strength Zadig laid fast hold of him flew upon him and tripp d up his Heels After that holding the Point of his Sword to his Breast like a Man of Honour gave him his Life The Egyptian fir d with Rage and having no Command of his Passion drew his Dagger and wounded Zadig like a Coward whilst the Victor generously forgave him Upon that unexpected Action Zadig being incens d to the last Degree plung d his Sword deep into his Bosom The Egyptian fetch d a hideous Groan and died upon the Spot Zadig then approach d the Lady and with a kind of Concern in the softest Terms told her that he was oblig d to kill her Insulter tho against his Inclinations I have aveng d your Cause and deliver d you out of the merciless Hands of the most outrageous Man I ever saw Now Madam let me know your farther Will and Pleasure with me You shall die you Villain You have murder d my Love Oh I could tear your Heart out Indeed Madam said Zadig you had one of the most hot headed oddest Lovers I ever saw He beat you most unmercifully and would have taken away my Life because you call d me in to your Assistance Would to God he was but alive to beat me again said she blubbering and roaring I deserv d to be beat I gave him too just Occasion to be jealous of me Would to God that he had beat me and you had died in his Stead Zadig more astonish d and more exasperated than ever he was in all his Life said to her Really Madam you put on such extravagant Airs that you tempt me pretty as you are to thresh you most cordially in my Turn but I scorn to concern my self any more about you Upon this he remounted his Dromedary and made the best of his Way towards the Village But before he had got near a hundred Yards he return d upon an Out cry that was made by four Couriers from Babylon They rode full Speed One of them spying the young Widow cried out There she is That s she She answers in every Respect to the Description we had of her They never took the least Notice of her dead Gallant but secur d her directly Oh Sir cried she to Zadig again and again dear Sir most generous Stranger once more deliver me from a Pack of Villains I most humbly beg your Pardon for my late Conduct and unjust Complaint of you Do but stand my Friend at this critical Conjuncture and I ll be your most obedient Vassal till Death Zadig had now no Inclination to fight for one so undeserving any more Find some other to be your Fool now Madam you shan t impose upon me a second Time I ll assure you Madam I know better Things Besides he was wounded and bled so fast that he wanted Assistance himself And tis very probable that the Sight of the Babylonian Couriers who were dispatch d from King Moabdar might discompose him very much He made all the Haste he could towards the Village not being able to conceive what should be the real Cause of the young Lady s being secur d by those Babylonish Officers and as much at a Loss at the same Time what to think of such a Termagant and a Coquet CHAP IX The CAPTIVE No sooner was Zadig arriv d at the Egyptian Village before mention d but he found himself surrounded by a Croud The People one and all cried out See See there s the Man that ran away with the beauteous Lady Missouf and murder d Cletofis Gentlemen said he God forbid that I should ever entertain a Thought of running away with the Lady you speak of She is too much of a Coquet And as to Cletofis I did not murder him but kill d him in my own Defence He endeavour d all he could to take my Life away because I entreated him to take some Pity and Compassion on the beauteous Missouf whom he beat most unmercifully I am a Stranger who am fled hither for Shelter and tis highly improbable that upon my first Entrance into a Country where I came for Safety and Protection I should be guilty of two such enormous Crimes as that of running away with another Man s Partner and that of clandestinely murdering him on her Account The Egyptians at that Time were just and humane The Populace tis true hurried Zadig to the Town Goal but they took care in the first Place to stop the Bleeding of his Wounds and afterwards examin d the suppos d Delinquents apart in order to discover if possible the real Truth They acquitted Zadig of the Charge of wilful and premeditated Murder but as he had taken a Subject s Life away tho in his own Defence he was sentenc d to be a Slave as the Law directed His two Beasts were sold in open Market for the Service of the Hamlet What Money he had was distributed amongst the Inhabitants and he and his Attendant were expos d in the Market place to public Sale An Arabian Merchant Setoc by Name purchas d them both but as the Valet or Attendant was a robust Man and better cut out for hard Labour than the Master he fetch d the most Money There was no Comparison to be made between them Zadig therefore was a Slave subordinate to his Valet they secur d them both however by a Chain upon their Legs and so link d they accompanied their Master home Zadig as they were on the Road comforted his Fellow Slave and exhorted him to bear his Misfortunes with Patience But according to Custom he made several Reflections on the Vicissitudes of human Life I am now sensible said he that my impropitious Fortune has some malignant Influence over thine every Occurrence of my Life hitherto has prov d strangely odd and unaccountable In the first Place I was sentenc d to die at Babylon for writing a short Panegyrick on the King my Master In the next I narrowly escap d being strangled for the Queen his Royal Consort s speaking a little too much in my Favour and here I am a joint Slave with thy self because a turbulent Fellow of a Gallant would beat his Lady However Comrade let us march on boldly let not our Courage be cast down all this may possibly have a happier Issue than we expect Tis absolutely necessary that these Arabian Merchants should have Slaves and why should not you and I as we are but Men be Slaves as Thousands of others are This Master of ours may not prove inexorable He must treat his Slaves with some Thought and Consideration if he expects them to do his Work This was his Discourse to his Comrade but his Mind was more attentive to the Misfortunes of the Queen of Babylon Two Days afterwards Setoc set out with his two Slaves and his Camels for Arabia Deserta His Tribe liv d near the Desert of Horeb The Way was long and tedious Setoc during the Journey paid a much greater Regard to Zadig s Valet than to himself because the former was the most able to load the Camels and therefore what little Distinctions were made they were in his Favour It so happen d that one of the Camels died upon the Road The Load which the Beast carried was immediately divided and thrown upon the Shoulders of the two Slaves Zadig had his Share Setoc couldn t forbear laughing to see his two Slaves crouching under their Burthen Zadig took the Liberty to explain the Reason thereof and convinc d him of the Laws of the Equilibrium The Merchant was a little startled at his philosophical Discourse and look d upon him with a more favourable Eye than at first Zadig perceiving he had rais d his Curiosity redoubled it by instructing him in several material Points which were in some Measure advantageous to him in his Way of Business Such as the specific Weight of Metals and other Commodities of various Kinds of an equal Bulk the Properties of several useful Animals and the best Ways and Means to make Such as were wild tame by Degrees and fit for Service In short Zadig was look d upon by his Master as a perfect Oracle Setoc now thought the Master the much better Man of the two He us d him courteously and had no Room to repent of his Indulgence towards him Being got to their Journey s End the first Step that Setoc took was to claim a Debt of five hundred Ounces of Silver of a Jew who had borrow d it in the Presence of two Witnesses but both of them were dead and as the Jew was conscious he couldn t be cast for Want of Evidence appropriated the Merchant s Money to his own Use and thank d God that it lay in his Power for once to bite an Arabian with Impunity Setoc discover d to Zadig the unhappy Situation of his Case as he was now become his Confident Where was it pray said Zadig that you lent this large Sum to that ungrateful Infidel Upon a large Stone said the Merchant at the Foot of Mount Horeb What sort of a Man is your Debtor said Zadig Oh he is as errand a Rogue as ever breath d reply d Setoc That I take for granted but says Zadig is he a lively active Man or is he a dull heavy headed Fellow He is one of the worst of Pay masters in the World but the merriest most sprightly Fellow I ever met with Very well said Zadig let me be one of your Council when your Cause comes to be heard In short he summon d the Jew to attend the Court where when the Judge was sat Zadig open d the Cause Thou impartial Judge of this Court of Equity I am come here in behalf of my Master to demand of the Defendant five hundred Ounces of Silver which he refuses to pay and would fain traverse the Debt Have you Friend your Witnesses ready to prove the Loan said the Judge No they are dead but there is a large Stone still subsisting on which the Money was deposited and if your Excellence will be pleas d to order the Stone to be brought in Court I don t doubt but the Evidence it will give will be Proof sufficient of the Fact I hope your Excellence will order that the Jew and myself shall be oblig d to attend the Court till the Stone comes and I ll dispatch a special Messenger to fetch it at my Master s Expence Your Request is very reasonable said the Judge Do as you propose and so call d another Cause When the Court was ready to break up Well said the Judge to Zadig is your Stone come yet The Jew with a Sneer replied your Excellence may wait here till this Time To morrow before the Stone will appear in Court for tis above six Mile off and it will require fifteen Men to remove it from its Place Tis well replied Zadig I told your Excellence that the Stone would be a very material Evidence Since the Defendant can point out the Place where the Stone lies he tacitly confesses that it was upon that Stone the Money was deposited The Jew thus unexpectedly confuted was soon oblig d to acknowledge the Debt The Judge order d that the Jew should be tied fast to the Stone without Victuals or Drink till he should advance the five hundred Ounces of Silver which were soon paid accordingly and the Jew releas d The Slave Zadig and this remarkable Stone Witness were in great Repute all over Arabia CHAP X The FUNERAL PILE Setoc transported with his good Success of a Slave made Zadig his Favourite Companion and Confident he found him as necessary in the Conduct of his Affairs as the King of Babylon had before done in the Administration of his Government and lucky it was for Zadig that Setoc had no Wife He discover d that his Master was in his Temper benevolent strictly honest and a Man of good natural Parts Zadig was very much concern d that One of so much Sense should pay divine Adoration to a whole Host of created tho Celestial Beings that is to say the Sun Moon and Stars according to the antient Custom of the Arabians He talk d at first to his Master with great Precaution on so important a Topick But at last told him in direct Terms that they were created Bodies as others tho of less Lustre and that there was no more Adoration due to them than to a Stock or a Stone But said Setoc they are eternal Beings to whom we are indebted for all the Blessings we enjoy they animate Nature they regulate the Seasons they are in a Word at such an infinite Distance from us that it would be downright impious not to adore them You are more indebted said Zadig to the Waters of the Red Sea which transport so many valuable Commodities into the Indies Why pray may not they be deem d as antient as the Stars And if you are so fond of paying your Adoration on Account of their vast Distance why don t you adore the Land of the Gangarides which lies in the utmost Extremities of the Earth No said Setoc there is something so surprisingly more brilliant in the Stars than what you speak of that a Man must adore them whether he will or not At the Close of the Evening Zadig planted a long Range of Candles in the Front of his Tent where Setoc and he were to sup that Night And as soon as he perceiv d his Patron to be at the Door he fell prostrate on his Knees before the Wax Lights O ye everlasting ever shining Luminaries be always propitious to your Votary said Zadig Having repeated these Words so loud as Setoc might hear them he sat down to Table without taking the least Notice of Setoc What said Setoc somewhat startled at his Conduct art thou at thy Prayers before Supper I act just as inconsistently Sir as you do I worship these Candles without reflecting on their Makers or yourself who are my most beneficent Patron Setoc took the Hint and was conscious of the Reproof that was conceal d so genteely under a Vail The superior Wisdom of his Slave enlightned his Mind and from that Hour he was less lavish than ever he had been of his Incense to those created Beings and for the future paid his Adoration to the eternal God who made them At that Time there was a most hideous Custom in high Repute all over Arabia which came originally from Scythia but having met with the Sanction of the bigotted Brachmans threatn d to spread its Infection all over the East When a married Man happen d to die if his dearly beloved Widow ever expected to be esteem d a Saint she must throw herself headlong upon her Husband s Funeral Pile This was look d upon as a solemn Festival and was call d the Widow s Sacrifice That Tribe which could boast of the greatest Number of burnt Widows was look d upon as the most meritorious An Arabian who was of the Tribe of Setoc happen d just at that Juncture to be dead and his Widow Almona by Name who was a noted Devotee publish d the Day nay the Hour that she propos d to throw herself according to Custom on her deceased Husband s Funeral Pile and be attended by a Concert of Drums and Trumpets Zadig remonstrated to Setoc what a shocking Custom this was and how directly repugnant to human Nature by permitting young Widows almost every Day to become wilful Self Murderers when they might be of Service to their Country either by the Addition of new Subjects or by the Education of such as demanded their Maternal Indulgence And by arguing seriously with Setoc for some Time he forc d from him at last an ingenuous Confession that the barbarous Custom then subsisting ought if possible to be abolish d Tis now replied Setoc above a thousand Years since the Widows of Arabia have been indulg d with this Privilege of dying with their Husbands and how shall any one dare to abrogate a Law that has been establish d Time out of Mind Is there any Thing more inviolable than even an antient Error But replied Zadig Reason is of more antient Date than the Custom you plead for Do you communicate these Sentiments to the Sovereigns of your Tribes and in the mean while I ll go and sound the Widow s Inclinations Accordingly he paid her a Visit and having insinuated himself into her Favour by a few Compliments on her Beauty after urging what a pity it was that a young Widow Mistress of so many Charms should make away with herself for no other reason but to mingle her Ashes with a Husband that was dead he notwithstanding applauded her for her heroic Constancy and Courage I perceive Madam said he you was excessively fond of your deceased Spouse Not I truly reply d the young Arabian Devotee He was a Brute infected with a groundless Jealousy of my Virtue and in short a perfect Tyrant But notwithstanding all this I am determin d to comply with our Custom Surely then Madam there s a Sort of secret Pleasure in being burnt alive Alas with a Sigh cried Almona tis a Shock indeed to Nature but must be complied with for all that I am a profess d Devotee and should I shew the least Reluctance my Reputation would be lost for ever all the World would laugh at me should I not burn myself on this Occasion Zadig having forc d her ingenuously to confess that she parted with her Life more out of Regard to what the World would say of her and out of Pride and Ostentation than any real Love for the deceas d he talk d to her for some considerable Time so rationally and us d so many prevailing Arguments with her to justify her due Regard for the Life which she was going to throw away that she began to wave the Thought and entertain a secret Affection for her friendly Monitor Pray Madam tell me said Zadig how would you dispose of yourself upon the Supposition that you could shake off this vain and barbarous Notion Why said Dame with an amorous Glance I think verily I should accept of yourself for a second Bed fellow The Memory of Astarte had made too strong an Impression on his Mind to close with this warm Declaration He took his leave however that Moment and waited on the Chiefs He communicated to them the Substance of their private Conversation and prevailed with them to make it a Law for the future that no Widow should be allow d to fall a Victim to a deceased Husband till after she had admitted some young Man to converse with her in private for a whole Hour together The Law was pass d accordingly and not one Widow in all Arabia from that Day to this ever observ d the Custom Twas to Zadig alone that the Arabian Dames were indebted for the Abolition in one Hour of a Custom so very inhuman that had been practis d for such a Number of Ages Zadig therefore with the strictest Justice was look d upon by all the Fair Sex in Arabia as their most bountiful Benefactor CHAP XI The Evening s Entertainment Setoc who would never stir out without his Bosom Friend in whom alone as he thought all Wisdom center d resolv d to take him with him to Balzora Fair whither the richest Merchants round the whole habitable Globe us d annually to resort Zadig was delighted to see such a Concourse of substantial Tradesmen from all Countries assembled together in one Place It appear d to him as if the whole Universe was but one large Family and all happily met together at Balzora On the second Day of the Fair he sat down to Table with an Egyptian an Indian that liv d on the Banks of the River Ganges an Inhabitant of Cathay a Grecian a Celt and several other Foreigners who by their frequent Voyages towards the Arabian Gulf 
2262-141714-0000	train-other-500	were so far conversant with the Arabic Language as to be able to discourse freely and be mutually understood The Egyptian began to fly into a Passion what a scandalous Place is this Balzora said he
2262-141714-0001	train-other-500	where they refuse to lend me a thousand Ounces of Gold upon the best Security that can possibly be offer d Pray said Setoc what may the Commodity be that you would deposit as a Pledge for the Sum you mention
none	none	 Why the 
2262-141714-0002	train-other-500	Corpse of my deceased Aunt said he who was one of the finest Women in all Egypt She was my constant Companion but unhappily died upon the Road I have taken so much Care
none	none	 that no Mummy whatever can equal it 
2262-141714-0003	train-other-500	And was I in my own Country
none	none	 I could be furnish d with what Sum soever I pleas d were I dispos d to mortgage it 
2262-141714-0004	train-other-500	Tis a strange Thing that Nobody here will advance so small a Sum upon so valuable a Commodity No sooner had he express d his Resentment but he was going to cut up a fine boil d Pullet in order to make a Meal on t
none	none	 when an Indian laid hold of his Hand and with deep Concern 
2262-141714-0005	train-other-500	cried out For God s Sake what are you about Why said the Egyptian I design to make a Wing of this Fowl one Part of my Supper Pray good Sir consider what you are doing said the Indian
2262-141714-0006	train-other-500	Tis very possible that the Soul of the deceas d Lady may have taken its Residence in that Fowl And you wouldn t surely run the Risque of eating up your Aunt To boil a Fowl is doubtless a most shameful Outrage done to Nature Pshaw
2262-141714-0007	train-other-500	What a Pother you make about the boiling of a Fowl and flying in the Face of Nature replied the Egyptian in a Pet tho we Egyptians pay divine Adoration to the Ox yet we can make a hearty Meal of a Piece of roast Beef for all that
2262-141714-0008	train-other-500	Is it possible Sir that your Country men should act so absurdly as to pay an Ox the Tribute of divine Worship said the Indian Absurd as you think it said the other the Ox has been the principal Object of Adoration
none	none	 all over Egypt for these hundred and thirty five thousand Years and the most abandon d Egyptian 
2262-141714-0009	train-other-500	has never been as yet so impious as to gain say it Ay Sir an hundred
none	none	 thirty five thousand Years say you 
2262-141714-0010	train-other-500	surely you must be out a little in your Calculation Tis but about fourscore thousand Years since India was first inhabited Sure I am
none	none	 we are a more antient People than you are 
2262-141714-0011	train-other-500	and our Brama prohibited the eating of Beef long before your Nation ever erected an Altar in Honour of the Ox or ever put one upon a Spit What a Racket you make about your Brama
2262-141714-0012	train-other-500	Is he able to stand the least in Competition with our Apis
none	none	 said the Egyptian 
2262-141714-0013	train-other-500	Let us hear pray what mighty Feats have been done by your boasted Brama Why replied the Bramin he first taught his Votaries to write and read and tis to him alone all the World is indebted for the Invention of the noble Game of Chess
2262-141714-0014	train-other-500	You are quite out Sir in your Notion said a Chaldean who sat within Hearing All these invaluable Blessings were deriv d from the Fish
none	none	 Oannes 
2262-141714-0015	train-other-500	and tis that alone to which the Tribute of divine Adoration is justly due All the World will tell you that twas a divine Being whose Tail was pure Gold whose Head resembled that of a Man tho indeed the Features were
none	none	 much more beautiful and that he condescended to 
2262-141714-0016	train-other-500	visit the Earth three Hours every Day for the Instruction of Mankind He had a numerous Issue as is very well known and all of them were powerful Monarchs I have a Picture of it at Home to which as in Duty I ought
2262-141714-0017	train-other-500	I Say my Prayers at Night before I go to Bed and every Morning that I rise There is no Harm Sir as I can conceive in partaking of a Piece of roast Beef but doubtless tis a mortal Sin a Crime of the blackest Dye
2262-141714-0018	train-other-500	to touch a Piece of Fish Besides you cannot justly boast of so illustrious an Origin and you are both of you mere Moderns in Comparison to us Chaldeans You Egyptians lay claim to
none	none	 no more than one hundred thirty five thousand Years 
2262-141714-0019	train-other-500	and you Indians but of eighty thousand Whereas we have Almanacks that are dated four thousand Centuries backwards Take my Word for it I speak nothing but Truth renounce your Errors and I ll make each of you
none	none	 a Present of a fine Portrait of our Oannes 
2262-141714-0020	train-other-500	A Native of Cambalu entring into the Debate said I have a very great Veneration not only for the Egyptians
none	none	 Chaldeans Greeks and Celtae but for Brama Apis and the Oannes 
2262-141714-0021	train-other-500	but in my humble Opinion the Li or as tis by some call d the Tien is an Object more deserving of divine Adoration than any Ox or Fish
2262-141714-0022	train-other-500	how much soever you may boast of their respective Perfections All I shall say in regard to my native Country tis of much greater Extent than all Egypt
none	none	 Chaldea and the Indies put together 
2262-141714-0023	train-other-500	I shall lay no Stress on the Antiquity of my Country for I imagine tis of much greater Importance to be the happiest People
none	none	 than the most antient under the Sun 
2262-141714-0024	train-other-500	However since you were talking of the Almanacks I must beg the Liberty to tell you that
none	none	 ours are look d upon to be the best all over Asia and that we had several very correct ones before the Art of Arithmetick was ever heard of in Chaldea The Chinese Term Li signifies properly speaking natural Light or Reason and Tien the Heavens or the supreme Being You are all of you a Parcel of illiterate ignorant Bigots cry d a Grecian Tis plain 
2262-141714-0025	train-other-500	you know nothing of the Chaos and that the World as it now stands is owing wholly to Matter and Form The Greek ran on for a considerable Time
none	none	 but was at last interrupted by a Celt who 
2262-141714-0026	train-other-500	having drank deep during the whole Time of this Debate thought himself ten Times wiser than any of his Antagonists and wrapping out a great Oath insisted that all their Gods were nothing
2262-141714-0027	train-other-500	if set in Competition with the Teutath or the Misletoe on the Oak
none	none	 As for my part said he 
2262-141714-0028	train-other-500	I carry some of it always in my Pocket As to my Ancestors
none	none	 they were Scythians 
2262-141714-0029	train-other-500	and the only Men worth talking of in the whole World Tis true indeed they would now and then make a Meal of their Country men but that ought not to be urg d as any Objection to his Country
none	none	 and in short if any one of you 
2262-141714-0030	train-other-500	or all of you shall dare to say any thing disrespectful of Teutath I ll defend its Cause to the last Drop of my Blood The Quarrel grew warmer and warmer and Setoc expected that the Table would be overset
2262-141714-0031	train-other-500	and that Blood shed would ensue Zadig who hadn t once open d his Lips during the whole Controversy at last rose up
none	none	 and address d himself to the Celt in the first Place 
2262-141714-0032	train-other-500	as being the most noisy and outrageous
none	none	 Sir said he Your Notions in this Affair are 
2262-141714-0033	train-other-500	very just Good Sir oblige me with a Bit of your Misletoe Then turning about he expatiated on the Eloquence of the Grecian
none	none	 and in a Word soften d in the most artful Manner 
2262-141714-0034	train-other-500	all the contending Parties He said but little indeed to the Cathayian because he was more cool and sedate than any of the others To conclude he address d them all in general Terms to this or the like Effect My dear Friends
none	none	 You have been contesting all this 
2262-141714-0035	train-other-500	while about an important Topick in which tis evident you are all unanimously agreed
none	none	 Agreed quotha they all cried 
2262-141714-0036	train-other-500	in an angry Tone How so pray Why said he to the hot testy Celt is it not true that you do not in effect adore this Misletoe but that Being who created that Misletoe and the Oak
none	none	 to which it is so closely united 
2262-141714-0037	train-other-500	Doubtless Sir reply d the Celt And you Sir said he to the Egyptian You revere thro your venerable Apis the great Author of every Ox s Being We do so said the Egyptian
none	none	 The mighty Oannes 
2262-141714-0038	train-other-500	tho the Sovereign of the Sea continued he
none	none	 must give Precedence to that Power 
2262-141714-0039	train-other-500	who made both the Sea and every Fish that dwells therein We allow it said the Chaldean The Indian adds he and the Cathayan acknowledge one supreme Being
none	none	 or first Cause 
2262-141714-0040	train-other-500	as well as you As to what that profound worthy Gentleman the Grecian has advanc d is I must own a little above my weak Comprehension but I am fully persuaded that he will allow there is a supreme Being on whom his favourite Matter and Form
2262-141714-0041	train-other-500	are entirely dependent The Grecian who was look d upon as a Sage amongst them said with Abundance of Gravity that Zadig had made a very just Construction of his Meaning Now Gentlemen I appeal to you all said Zadig
none	none	 whether you are not unanimous to a Man in the Debate upon the Carpet 
2262-141714-0042	train-other-500	and whether there are any just Grounds for the least Divisions or Animosities amongst you The whole Company cool at once caress d him
none	none	 and Setoc 
2262-141714-0043	train-other-500	after he had sold off all his Goods and Merchandize at a round Price took his Friend Zadig Home with him to the Land of Horeb
none	none	 Zadig upon his first Arrival was inform d that a Prosecution had been carried on against him during his Absence and that the Sentence pronounc d against him was that he should be burnt alive before a slow Fire CHAP XII The RENDEZVOUS Whilst Zadig attended his Friend Setoc to Balzora 
1572-141715-0000	train-other-500	the Priests of the Stars were determin d to punish him As all the costly Jewels and other valuable Decorations in which every young Widow that sacrificed her self on her Husband s Funeral pile
1572-141715-0001	train-other-500	were their customary Fees tis no great Wonder indeed that they were inclin d to burn poor Zadig for playing them such a scurvy Trick Zadig therefore
none	none	 was accus d of holding heretical and damnable Tenets in regard to the Celestial Host They depos d and swore point blank that he had been heard to aver that the Stars never sat in the Sea This horrid blasphemous Declaration thunder struck all the Judges and they were ready to rend their Mantles at the Sound of such an impious Assertion and they would have made Zadig had he been a Man of Substance paid very severely for his heretical Notions But in the Height of their Pity and Compassion for even such an Infidel they would lay no Fine upon him but content themselves with seeing him roasted alive before a slow Fire Setoc tho without Hopes of Success us d all the Interest he had to save his bosom Friend from so shocking a Death 
1572-141715-0002	train-other-500	but they turn d a deaf Ear to all his Remonstrances and oblig d him to hold his Tongue The young Widow Almona
1572-141715-0003	train-other-500	who by this Time was not only reconcil d to living a little longer but had some Taste for the Pleasures of Life and knew that she was entirely indebted to Zadig for it
1572-141715-0004	train-other-500	resolv d if possible to free her Benefactor from being burnt as he had before convinc d her of the Folly of it in her Case She ponder d upon this weighty Affair very seriously
1572-141715-0005	train-other-500	but said nothing to any one whomsoever Zadig was to be executed the next Day and she had only a few Hours left to carry her Project into Execution
1572-141715-0006	train-other-500	Now the Reader shall hear with how much Benevolence and Discretion this amiable Widow behav d on this emergent Occasion In the first Place
1572-141715-0007	train-other-500	she made use of the most costly Perfumes and drest herself to the utmost Advantage to render her Charms as conspicuous as possible

1572-141715-0008	train-other-500	demanded a private Audience of the High Priest of the Stars Upon her first Admittance into his august and venerable Presence she address d herself in the following Terms
none	none	 O thou first born and well beloved Son of the Great Bear Brother of the Bull and first Cousin to the Dog these you must know were the Pontiff s high Titles I come to confess myself before you 
1572-141715-0009	train-other-500	My Conscience is my Accuser and I am terribly afraid I have been guilty of a mortal Sin by declining the stated Custom of burning my self on my Husband s Funeral pile

2262-141716-0005	train-other-500	but as you appear Sir to me to be a Gentleman of uncommon Courage you shall prove an Exception to my general Rule Upon this he invited Zadig into his magnificent Mansion

2262-141716-0018	train-other-500	I aggrandiz d my Domains for he constituted me at the same Time Treasurer of the Imports that Arabia Petraea paid to the King of Kings I executed my Trust in every Respect as I ought in the Capacity of a Collector

none	none	 Astarte 
2262-141716-0026	train-other-500	I know nothing at all of that Affair replied Arbogad all that I have to say is that Moabdar became a perfect Madman and had his Brains beat out
2262-141716-0027	train-other-500	that all the People in Babylon are cutting one another s Throats and that the whole Empire is laid waste that there is still an Opportunity for making several bold Pushes and let me tell you Sir I have done my Part

2262-141716-0033	train-other-500	After this Declaration he drank so hard
none	none	 and confounded his Ideas in such a Manner 
2262-141716-0034	train-other-500	that Zadig was not one whit the wiser Upon which he was struck dumb confounded and stood as motionless as a Statue Arbogad in the mean while swill d down whole Bumpers told a Hundred merry Tales
2262-141716-0035	train-other-500	and swore a thousand Times over that he was the happiest Creature upon God s Earth persuading Zadig to be as merry and thoughtless as himself At last being gradually overcome by the Fumes of his Liquor
2262-141716-0036	train-other-500	he fell fast asleep Zadig spent the Remainder of the Night in deep Contemplation and in all the Uneasiness of Mind imaginable What said he the King first became crazy and then was murder d
2262-141716-0037	train-other-500	I think I have just Grounds for Complaint The whole Empire is in Confusion and torn to Pieces and this Free booter is as happy as a King O Fortune O Fate a Highwayman as happy as a Monarch
none	none	 and the most amiable Creature that Nature ever fram d has suffer d perhaps 
2262-141716-0038	train-other-500	an ignominious Death or perhaps is in a State of Life a thousand Times worse than Death itself O Astarte Astarte
none	none	 What art thou become As soon as it was Break of Day he went out 
2262-141716-0039	train-other-500	and ask d every one he saw if they knew any Thing of her But the whole Gang were too intent upon other Matters to return him any Answer By Virtue of their Night s Excursions they had brought in some fresh Booty and were busy in dividing the Spoil
2262-141716-0040	train-other-500	All the Favour he could procure in their Hurry and Tumult was to go away without the least Examination He took the Advantage of their Remissness and mov d off the Premises
2262-141716-0041	train-other-500	but more overwhelm d with Grief and deep Reflection than ever Zadig in his March was very restless and uneasy His Thoughts were forever rolling on the unfortunate Astarte the King of Babylon his Bosom Friend Cador

2262-141717-0000	train-other-500	When Zadig had travelled some few Leagues from Arbogad s Castle he found himself arriv d at the Banks of a little River incessantly deploring as he went along his unhappy Fate and looking upon himself as the very Picture of ill Luck

2262-141717-0005	train-other-500	No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth but he started up and ran to the River side like one that was resolutely bent to plunge in and get rid of a miserable Life at once Is it possible said Zadig
2262-141717-0006	train-other-500	Is there then the Man in Being more wretched than myself His Benevolence and good Will to save the poor Man s Life was as quick as the Reflection he had just made He ran to his Assistance he laid hold of him and ask d him
none	none	 with an Air of Pity and Concern 
2262-141717-0007	train-other-500	the Cause of his rash Intention Tis an old saying that a Person is less unhappy when he sees himself not singular in Misfortune But if we will credit Zoroaster this is not from a Principle of Malignity
2262-141717-0008	train-other-500	but the Effect of a fatal Necessity He was attracted as it were to any Person in Distress as being One in the same unhappy Circumstances The Transport of a happy Man would be a Kind of Insult
2262-141717-0009	train-other-500	but two Persons in bad Circumstances are like two weak Shrubs which by propping up each other are fenc d against a Storm Why are you thus cast down said Zadig to the Fisherman
2262-141717-0010	train-other-500	Never sink Man under the Weight of your Burden I can t help it said the poor Fisherman I have not the least Prospect of Redress
none	none	 I was once Sir the tip top Man of the whole Village of Derlbach near Babylon where I liv d and with the Help of my Wife

2262-141717-0012	train-other-500	and the famous Prime Minister Zadig were very fond of them I serv d the Court with about six Hundred of them I went the other Day in Hopes of being paid but before I had well got into the Suburbs of Babylon
2262-141717-0013	train-other-500	I was inform d that not only the Queen but Zadig too had privately left the Court Whereupon I ran directly to Zadig s House tho I never sat Eye on the Man in all my Life
none	none	 There I found the Court Marshals of the grand 
2262-141717-0014	train-other-500	Desterham plundering by Virtue of his Majesty s Mandate all his Effects in the most loyal Manner From thence I made the best of my Way to the Queen s Kitchin

none	none	 of whom we begg d for Shelter and Protection 
2262-141717-0018	train-other-500	The Favour I confess was readily granted to my Wife but as for my own Part I was absolutely rejected She was fairer Sir than the fairest Cheese I ever sold
2262-141717-0019	train-other-500	from whence I date all my Misfortunes and the red that adorn d her blushing Cheeks was ten Times more lively than any Tyrian Scarlet And between you and I Sir that was the main Cause of my Wife s Reception and my Disgrace
2262-141717-0020	train-other-500	Whereupon I wrote a doleful Letter to my Wife in all the Agonies of one in the deepest Despair Tis very well
none	none	 said she to the Messenger 
2262-141717-0021	train-other-500	I have some little Knowledge of the Man I have heard say no one sells better Cream Cheeses than he does desire him next Time he comes to bring a small Parcel with him and let him know I ll take care he shall be punctually paid
2262-141717-0022	train-other-500	In the Height of my Misfortunes I determin d to seek Redress in a Court of Equity I had but six Ounces of Gold left Two whereof went for a Fee to my Counsellor
none	none	 two to my Lawyer who took my Cause in Hand and 
2262-141717-0023	train-other-500	the other two to the Judge s Clerk Notwithstanding what I had done my Cause was not so much as commenc d and I had already disburs d more Money than all my Cheeses and my Wife with them were worth
2262-141717-0024	train-other-500	I return d therefore to my Native Habitation
none	none	 with a full Resolution to sell it for the Ransom of my Wife 
2262-141717-0025	train-other-500	My little Cot with the Appurtenances
none	none	 were worth about threescore Ounces of Gold 
2262-141717-0026	train-other-500	But as the Purchasers found I was necessitous and drove to my last Shifts the first whom I apply d to offer d me thirty Ounces the second twenty and the third but ten

2262-141717-0027	train-other-500	the Prince of Hyrcania came to Babylon and swept all before him My little Cottage with all its Furniture was first plunder d of all that was valuable and at last reduc d to Ashes Having thus lost my Money

2262-141717-0030	train-other-500	This long Detail of Particulars however was not deliver d without several Interruptions for said Zadig with Abundance of Warmth and Confusion Have you never heard Sir of what is become of the Queen Astarte
none	none	 No Sir not I said the disconsolate Fisherman 
2262-141717-0031	train-other-500	but this I know to my Sorrow that neither the Queen nor Zadig ever paid me the least Consideration in the World for my Cream Cheeses that my dear Spouse is taken from me and that I am drove to the very Brink of Despair
2262-141717-0032	train-other-500	I am verily persuaded said Zadig that you will not lose all your Money
none	none	 I have heard much talk of that same Zadig 
2262-141717-0033	train-other-500	they say he is very honest and that if ever he returns to Babylon as tis to be hop d he will he ll discharge his Debts with Interest like a Man of Honour But as for your Wife who appears to me to be no better than a Wag tail
2262-141717-0034	train-other-500	never take the Trouble if you ll take my Advice to hunt after her any more Be rul d and make the best of your Way to Babylon I shall be there before you as I shall ride and you will be on Foot

2262-141717-0035	train-other-500	tell him you met his Friend upon the Road and stay there still I come Observe my Orders

2262-141717-0036	train-other-500	you have made me tis true an Instrument of Comfort to this poor Man but what Friend will you raise for me to alleviate my Sorrows Having utter d this short Expostulation he gave the distrest Fisherman one full Moiety
2262-141717-0037	train-other-500	of all the Money he brought with him out of Arabia The Fisherman thunder struck and transported with Joy at so unexpected a Benefaction kiss d the Feet of Cador s Friend and cried out
2262-141717-0038	train-other-500	sure you are a Messenger of Heaven sent down to be my Saviour In the mean Time Zadig every now and then ask d him Questions and wept as he ask d them What Sir said the Fisherman
2262-141717-0039	train-other-500	can you who are so bountiful a Benefactor be in Distress yourself Alas said he Friend I am a hundred Times more unhappy than thou art But pray Sir said the good Man how can it possibly be
2262-141717-0040	train-other-500	that he who is so lavish of his Favours should be overwhelm d with greater Misfortunes than the Man he so generously relieves Your greatest Uneasiness said he arose from the Narrowness of your Circumstances
2262-141717-0041	train-other-500	but mine proceeds from an internal and much deeper Cause Pray Sir said the Fisherman has Orcan robb d you of your Wife This Interrogatory put Zadig in a Moment upon a Retrospection of all his past Adventures
2262-141717-0042	train-other-500	He recollected the whole Series of his Misfortunes commencing from that of the Eunuch and the Huntsman to his Arrival at the Free booter s Castle Alas said he to the Fisherman Orcan tis true
2262-141717-0043	train-other-500	deserves severely to be punish d But for the Generality we find such worthless Barbarians are the Favourites of Fortune Be that however as it will go as I bade you to my Friend Cador
none	none	 and wait there till I come They took their Leave the Fisherman blessing his propitious Stars and Zadig cursing every Step he went the Hour he was born CHAP XV The BASILISK As Zadig was traversing a verdant Meadow

1572-141718-0001	train-other-500	in the most courteous Manner if he might have the Honour to assist her in her Researches Have a care said she What we are hunting after Sir is an Animal that will not suffer itself to be touch d by a Man
1572-141718-0002	train-other-500	Tis somewhat surprizing said Zadig May I be so bold pray as to ask you what you are in Pursuit after that shuns the Touch of any Thing but the Hands of the Fair Sex
1572-141718-0003	train-other-500	Tis Sir said she the Basilisk A Basilisk Madam said he And pray if you will be so good as to inform me with what View are you searching after a Creature
none	none	 so very difficult to be met with Tis Sir said she 
1572-141718-0004	train-other-500	for our Lord and Master Ogul whose Castle you see situate on the River side at the Bottom of the Meadow We are all his Vassals
none	none	 Ogul you must know 
1572-141718-0005	train-other-500	is in a very bad State of Health and his first Physician has order d him as a Specific to eat a Basilisk boil d in Rose water And as that Animal is very hard to be catch d
1572-141718-0006	train-other-500	and will suffer nothing to approach it but one of our Sex our dying Sovereign Ogul has promis d to honour her that shall be so happy as to catch it for him so far as to make her his Consort
1572-141718-0007	train-other-500	The Case being thus circumstantiated Sir I hope you will not interrupt me any longer lest my Rivals here in the Field should happen to circumvent me Zadig withdrew
none	none	 and left the Syrian Ladies in Quest of their imaginary Booty in order to pursue his intended Journey But as he came to the Banks of a Rivulet at the remotest part of the Meadow he perceiv d another young Lady 
1572-141718-0008	train-other-500	reclin d on the Grass and entirely disengag d Her Stature seem d majestic but her Face was cover d with a Vail and her Eyes were fixt as one at her Looking glass on the River
1572-141718-0009	train-other-500	Every now and then a Sigh burst out as if her Heart were breaking In her Hand she held a little Wand or Rod with which she was tracing out some Characters on the dry Sand that lay

1572-141718-0013	train-other-500	but when he saw the additional Capitals of I and G his Astonishment was too great for Words to express He stood for some Time
1572-141718-0014	train-other-500	perfectly thunder struck and as motionless as a Statue At last in a soft faultring Tone he broke Silence O generous Lady said he
1572-141718-0015	train-other-500	forgive a Stranger one overwhelm d with Sorrows like yourself if he asks you by what amazing Accident he finds the Name of Zadig delineated by so angelick a Hand
none	none	 Thus unexpectedly interrupted and at the Sound of those Words she turn d her Head and with a trembling Hand lifting up her Vail she espy d Zadig himself Upon which she shriek d and as her Heart was flutter d between the two Extreams of Transport and Surprize she fainted away and gently dropp d into his Arms Twas it seems Astarte her self 
1572-141718-0016	train-other-500	twas the Queen of Babylon twas the very Goddess whom Zadig ador d twas in short the very identical Lady whose hard Fate he had so long deplor d
1572-141718-0017	train-other-500	and for whose sake he had felt so many agonizing Pains For a few Minutes he stood speechless
none	none	 and depriv d as it were of all his senses

none	none	 Ye have restor d me my Astarte but alas at what a Conjuncture in what a Place and in what a State and Condition do I view her 
1572-141718-0020	train-other-500	He threw himself prostrate on the Ground and kiss d the Dust of her Feet The Queen of Babylon rais d him up and oblig d him to sit by her on the flow ry Bank
none	none	 whereon she was repos d Every now and then she wip d her Eyes 
1572-141718-0021	train-other-500	as the Tears trickl d down afresh her lovely Cheeks Twenty times she endeavour d to renew her Discourse but was interrupted by her Sighs she ask d him over and over
none	none	 to relate to her the Hardships he had ran thro 
1572-141718-0022	train-other-500	since their parting and by what Chance he came to traverse that solitary Meadow but prevented him at the same Time from returning any Answer by repeating Question upon Question
1572-141718-0023	train-other-500	At last she gave him a particular Detail of her own Misfortunes and again requested to know his Both of them in short having in some Measure

XVII The HERMIT As Zadig was travelling along he met with a Hermit whose grey and venerable Beard descended to his Girdle He had in his Hand a little Book on which his Eyes were fix d Zadig threw himself in his Way and made him a profound Bow The Hermit return d the Compliment with such an Air of Majesty and Benevolence that Zadig s Curiosity prompted him to converse with so agreeable a Stranger Pray Sir said he what may be the Contents of the Treatise you are reading with such Attention Tis call d said the Hermit the Book of Fate will you please to look at it He put the Book into the Hands of Zadig who tho he was a perfect Master of several Languages couldn t decypher one single Character This rais d his Curiosity still higher You seem dejected said the good Father to him Alas I have Cause enough said Zadig If you ll permit me to accompany you said the old Hermit perhaps I may be of some Service to you I have sometimes instill d Sentiments of Consolation into the Minds of the Afflicted Zadig had a secret Regard for the Air of the old Man for his Beard and his Book He found by conversing with him that he was the most learned Person he had ever met with The Hermit harangu d on Destiny Justice Morality the sovereign Good the Frailty of Nature on Virtue and Vice in such a lively Manner and in such a Flow of Words that Zadig was attach d to him by an invincible Charm He begg d earnestly that he would favour him with his Company to Babylon That Favour I was going to ask my self said the old Man Swear to me by Orosmades that you won t leave me for some Days at least let me do what I please Zadig took the Oath requir d and both pursu d their Journey The two Travellers arriv d that Evening at a superb Castle The Hermit begg d for an hospitable Reception of himself and his young Comrade The Porter whom any One might have taken for some Grandee let them in but with a kind of Coldness and Contempt However he conducted them to the Head Steward who went with them thro every rich Apartment of his Master s House They were seated at Supper afterwards at the lower End indeed of the Table and where they were taken little or no Notice of by the Host but they were serv d with as much Delicacy and Profusion as any of the other Guests When they arose from Table they wash d their Hands in a Golden Bason set with Emeralds and other costly Stones When twas Time to go to Rest they were conducted into a Bed chamber richly furnish d and the next Morning two Pieces of Gold were presented to him for their mutual Service by a Valet in waiting and then they were dismiss d The Proprietor of this Castle said Zadig as they were upon the Road seems to me to be a very hospitable Gentleman tho somewhat too haughty indeed and too imperious The Words were no sooner out of his Mouth but he perceiv d that the Pocket of his Comrade s Garment tho very large was swell d and greatly extended He soon saw what was the Cause and that he had clandestinely brought off the Golden Laver He durst not immediately take Notice of the Fact but was ready to sink at the very Thoughts on t About Noon the Hermit rapp d at a petty Cottage with his Staff the beggarly Residence of an old rich Miser He desir d that he and his Companion might refresh themselves there for a few Hours An old shabby Domestick let them in indeed but with visible Reluctance and carried them into the Stable where all their Fare was a few musty Olives and a Draught or two of sower small Beer The Hermit seem d as content with his Repast as he was the Night before At last rising off from his Seat he paid his Compliments to the old Valet who had as watchful an Eye over them all the Time as if they had been a Brace of Thieves and intimated every now and then that he fear d they would be benighted and gave him the two Pieces of Gold he had but just receiv d that Morning as a Token of his Gratitude for his courteous Entertainment He added moreover I would willingly speak one Word with your Master before I go The Valet thunder struck at his unexpected Gratuity comply d with his Request Most hospitable Sir said the Hermit I couldn t go away without returning you my grateful Acknowledgments for the friendly Reception we have met with this Afternoon Be pleas d to accept this Golden Bason as a small Token of my Gratitude and Esteem The Miser started and was ready to fall down backwards at the Sight of so valuable a Present The Hermit gave him no Time to recover out of his Surprise but march d off that Moment with his young Comrade Father said Zadig What is all this that I have seen You seem to me to act in a quite different Manner from the Generality of Mankind You plunder One who entertain d you with all the Pomp and Profusion in the World to enrich a covetous sordid Wretch who treated you in the most unworthy Manner Son said the old Man that Grandee who receives Visits of Strangers with no other View than to gratify his Pride and to raise their Astonishment at the Furniture of his Palace will henceforward learn to be wiser and the Miser to be more liberal for the Time to come Don t be surpris d but follow me Zadig was at a stand at present and couldn t well determine whether his Companion was a Man of greater Wisdom than ordinary or a Mad man But the Hermit assum d such an Ascendency over him exclusive of the Oath he had taken that he couldn t tell how to leave him At Night they came to a House very commodiously built but neat and plain where nothing was wanting and yet nothing profuse The Master was a Philosopher that had retir d from the busy World in order to live in Peace and form his Mind to Virtue He was pleas d to build this little Box for the Reception of Strangers in a handsome Manner but without Ostentation He came in Person to meet them at the Door and for a Time advis d them to sit down and rest themselves in a commodious Apartment After some Respite he invited them to a frugal yet elegant Repast during which he talk d very intelligently about the late Revolutions in Babylon He seem d entirely to be in the Queen s Interest and heartily wish d that Zadig had entred the Lists for the regal Prize But Babylon said he don t deserve a King of so much Merit A modest Blush appear d in Zadig s Face at this unexpected Compliment which innocently aggravated his Misfortunes It was agreed on all Hands that the Affairs of this World took sometimes a quite different Turn from what the wisest Patriots would wish them The Hermit replied the Ways of Providence are often very intricate and obscure and Men were much to blame for casting Reflections on the Conduct of the Whole upon the bare Inspection of the minutest Part The next Topick they entred upon was the Passions Alas said Zadig how fatal in their Consequences However said the Hermit they are the Winds that swell the Sail of the Vessel Sometimes tis true they overset it but there is no such Thing as sailing without them Phlegm indeed makes Men peevish and sick but then there is no living without it Tho every Thing here below is dangerous yet All are necessary In the next Place their Discourse turn d on sensual Pleasures and the Hermit demonstrated that they were the Gifts of Heaven for said he Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on himself he receives them all his Pain and Pleasure as well as his Being proceed from a superior Cause Zadig stood astonish d to think how a Man that had committed such vile Actions could argue so well on such Moral Topicks At the proper Hour after an Entertainment not only instructive but ev ry way agreeable their Host conducted them to their Bed chamber thanking Heaven for directing two such polite and virtuous Strangers to his House He offer d them at the same Time some Silver to defray their Expences on the Road but with such an Air of Respect and Benevolence that twas impossible to give the least Disgust The Hermit however refus d it and took his leave as he propos d to set forward for Babylon by Break of Day Their Parting was very affectionate and friendly Zadig in particular express d a more than common Regard for a Man of so amiable a Behaviour When the Hermit and he were alone and preparing for Bed they talk d long in Praise of their new Host As soon as Day light appear d the old Hermit wak d his young Comrade Tis Time to be gone said he but as all the House are fast asleep I ll leave a Token behind me of my Respect and Affection for the Master of it No sooner were the Words out of his Mouth but he struck a Light kindled a Torch and set the Building in a Flame Zadig in the utmost Confusion shriek d out and would if possible have prevented him from being guilty of such a monstrous Act of Ingratitude The Hermit dragg d him away by a superior Force The House was soon in a Blaze When they had got at a convenient Distance the Hermit with an amazing Sedateness turn d back and survey d the destructive Flames Behold said he our fortunate Friend In the Ruins he will find an immense Treasure that will enable him from henceforth to exert his Beneficence and render his Virtues more and more conspicuous Zadig tho astonish d to the last Degree attended him to their last Stage which was to the Cottage of a very virtuous and well dispos d Widow who had a Nephew of about fourteen Years of Age He was a hopeful Youth and the Darling of her Heart She entertain d her two Guests with the best Provisions her little House afforded In the Morning she order d her Nephew to attend them to an adjacent Bridge which having been broken down some few Days before render d the Passage dangerous to Strangers The Lad being very attentive to wait on them went formost When they were got upon the Bridge come hither my pretty Boy said the Hermit I must give your Aunt some small Token of my Respect for her last Night s Favours Upon that he twisted his Fingers in the Hair of his Head and threw him very calmly into the River Down went the little Lad he came up once again to the Surface of the Water but was soon lost in the rapid Stream O thou Monster thou worst of Villains cry d Zadig Didn t you promise said the Hermit to view my Conduct with Patience Know then that had that Boy liv d but one Year longer he would have murder d his Foster Mother Who told you so you barbarous Wretch said Zadig And when did you read that inhuman Event in your Black Book of Fate Who gave you Permission pray to drown so innocent a Youth that had never disoblig d you No sooner had our young Babylonian ceas d his severe Reflections but he perceiv d that the old Hermit s long Beard grew shorter and shorter that the Furrows in his Face began to fill up and that his Cheeks glow d with a Rose coloured Red as if he had been in the Bloom of Fifteen His Mantle was vanish d at once and on his Shoulders which were before cover d appear d four angelic Wings each refulgent as the Sun O thou Messenger of Heaven O thou angelic Form cry d Zadig and fell prostrate at his Feet thou art descended from the Empireum I find to instruct such a poor frail Mortal as I am how to submit to the Mysteries of Fate Mankind in general said the Angel Jesrad judge of the Whole by only viewing the hither Link of the Chain Thou of all the human Race wast the only Man that deserv d to have thy Mind enlighten d Zadig begg d Leave to speak I am somewhat diffident of myself tis true but may I presume Sir to beg the Solution of one Scruple Would it not have been better to have chastiz d the Lad and by that Means reform d him than to have cut him off thus unprepar d in a Moment Jesrad replied had he been virtuous and had he liv d twas his Fate not only to be murder d himself but his Wife whom he would afterwards have married and the little Infant that was to have been the Pledge of their mutual Affection Is it necessary then venerable Guide that there should be Wickedness and Misfortunes in the World and that those Misfortunes should fall with Weight on the Heads of the Righteous The Wicked replied Jesrad are always unhappy Misfortunes are intended only as a Touch stone to try a small Number of the Just who are thinly scatter d about this terrestrial Globe Besides there is no Evil under the Sun but some Good proceeds from it But said Zadig Suppose the World was all Goodness and there was no such Thing in Nature as Evil Then that World of yours said Jesrad would be another World the Chain of Events would be another Wisdom and that other Order which would be perfect must of Necessity be the everlasting Residence of the supreme Being whom no Evil can approach That great and first Cause has created an infinite Number of Worlds and no two of them alike This vast Variety is an Attribute of his Omnipotence There are not two Leaves on the Trees throughout the Universe nor any two Globes of Light amongst the Myriad of Stars that deck the infinite Expanse of Heaven which are perfectly alike And whatever you see on that small Atom of Earth whereof you are a Native must exist in the Place and at the Time appointed according to the immutable Decrees of him who comprehends the Whole Mankind imagine that the Lad whom I plung d into the River was drown d by Chance and that our generous Benefactor s House was reduc d to Ashes by the same Chance but know there is no such Thing as Chance all Misfortunes are intended either as severe Trials Judgments or Rewards and are the Result of Foreknowledge You remember Sir the poor Fisherman in Despair that thought himself the most unhappy Mortal breathing The great Orasmades sent you to amend his Situation Frail Mortal Cease to contend with what you ought to adore But said Zadig whilst the Sound of the Word But dwelt upon his Tongue the Angel took his Flight towards the tenth Sphere Zadig sunk down upon his Knees and acknowledg d an over ruling Providence with all the Marks of the profoundest Submission The Angel as he was soaring towards the Clouds cried out in distinct Accents Make thy Way towards Babylon CHAP XVIII The AENIGMAS or RIDDLES Zadig as one beside himself and perfectly thunder struck beat his March at random He entred however into the City of Babylon on that very Day when those Combatants who had been before engag d in the List or Circus were already assembled in the spacious Outer Court of the Palace in order to solve the AEnigmas and give the wisest Answers they could to such Questions as the Grand Magus should propose All the Parties concern d were present except the Knight of the Green Armour No sooner had Zadig made his Appearance in the City but the Populace flock d round about him No Eye was satisfied with gazing at him All in general were lavish of their Praises and in their Hearts wish d him their Sovereign except the envious Man who as he pass d by fetch d a deep Sigh and turn d his Head aside 
296_141721_000002_000004	train-clean-360	The Populace with loud Acclamations attended him to the Palace Gate

none	none	Her Vexation had almost brought her to Death s Door she couldn t conceive why Zadig should appear without his Accoutrements nor imagine which Way Itobad could procure the snow white Armour At the Sight of Zadig a confus d Murmur ran thro the whole Place 
296_141721_000002_000008	train-clean-360	Every Eye was surpriz d tho charm d at the same Time to see him again But then none were to be admitted into the Assembly Room except the Knights 
none	none	I have fought as successfully as any one of them all said Zadig tho another appears clad in my Armour but in the mean Time before I can possibly prove my Assertion I insist upon being admitted into Court in order to give my Solutions to such AEnigmas as shall be propos d Twas put to the Vote 
296_141721_000003_000001	train-clean-360	As the Reputation of his being a Man of the strictest Honour and Veracity was so strongly imprinted on their Minds the Motion of his Admittance was carried in the Affirmative without the least Opposition 
none	none	The first Question the Grand Magus propos d was this What is the longest and yet the shortest Thing in the World the most swift and the most slow the most divisible and the most extended the least valu d and the most regretted And without which nothing can possibly be done Which in a Word devours every Thing how minute soever and yet gives Life and Spirit to every Object or Being however Great Itobad had the Honour to answer first 
296_141721_000005_000001	train-clean-360	His reply was that a Man of his Merit had something else to think on than idle Riddles twas enough for him that he was acknowledg d the Hero of the Circus 
none	none	One said the Solution of the AEnigma propos d was Fortune others said the Earth and others again the Light But Zadig pronounced it to be Time 
296_141721_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Nothing said he can be longer since tis the Measure of Eternity Nothing is shorter since there is Time always wanting to accomplish what we aim at 
none	none	Nothing passes so slowly as Time to him who is in Expectation and nothing so swift as Time to him who is in the perfect Enjoyment of his Wishes 
296_141721_000005_000005	train-clean-360	It s Extent is to Infinity in the Whole and divisible to Infinity in part 
296_141721_000005_000006	train-clean-360	All Men neglect it in the Passage and all regret the Loss of it when tis past 
296_141721_000005_000007	train-clean-360	Nothing can possibly be done without it it buries in Oblivion whatever is unworthy of being transmitted down to Posterity and it renders all illustrious Actions immortal 
none	none	The Assembly agreed unanimously that Zadig was in the Right 
296_141721_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The next Question that was started was What is the Thing we receive without being ever thankful for it which we enjoy without knowing how we came by it which we give away to others without knowing where tis to be found and which we lose without being any ways conscious of our Misfortune 
296_141721_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Each pass d his Verdict 
none	none	Zadig was the only Person that concluded it was LIFE He solv d every AEnigma propos d with equal Facility Itobad when he heard the Explications always said that nothing in the World was more easy than to solve such obvious Questions and that he could interpret a thousand of them without the least Hesitation were he inclin d to trouble his Head about such Trifles Other Questions were propos d in regard to Justice the sovereign Good and the Art of Government Zadig s Answers still carried the greatest Weight 
296_141721_000007_000003	train-clean-360	What Pity tis said some who were present that one of so comprehensive a Genius should make such a scurvy Cavalier 
none	none	Most illustrious Grandees said Zadig I was the Person that had the Honour of being Victor at your Circus the white Armour most puissant Lords was mine That awkward Warrior there Lord Itobad dress d himself in it whilst I was asleep 
296_141721_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He imagin d it is plain that it would do him more Honour than his own Green one 
none	none	Unaccoutred as I am I am ready before this august Assembly to give them incontestable Proof of my superior Skill to engage with the Usurper of the White Armour with my Sword only in my Mantle and Bonnet and to testify that I only was the happy Victor of the justly admired Hottam Itobad accepted of the Challenge with all the Assurance of Success imaginable He did not doubt but being properly accoutred with his Helmet his Cuirass and his Bracelets he should be able to hue down an Antagonist in his Mantle and Cap and nothing to skreen him from his Resentment but a single Sabre Zadig drew his Sword and saluted the Queen with it who view d him with Transport mix d with Fear Itobad drew his but paid his Compliments to Nobody He approach d Zadig as one whom he imagin d incapable of making any considerable Resistance He concluded twas in his Power to cut Zadig into Atoms Zadig however knew how to parry the Blow by dexterously receiving it upon his Fort as the Swords men call it by which Means Itobad s Sword was snapt in two With that Zadig in an Instant clos d his Adversary and by his superior Strength as well as Skill laid him sprawling on his Back Then holding the Point of his Sword to the opening of his Cuirass Submit to be stripp d of your borrow d Plumes or you are a dead Man this Moment Itobad always surpriz d that any Disappointment should attend a Man of such exalted Merit as himself very tamely permitted Zadig to disrobe him by Degrees of his pompous Helmet his superb Cuirass his rich Bracelets his brilliant Cuisses or Armour for his Thighs and other Martial Accoutrements When Zadig had equipp d himself Cap a pee in his now recover d Armour he flew to Astarte and threw himself prostrate at her Feet Cador prov d without any great Difficulty that the White Armour was Zadig s Property He was thereupon acknowledg d King of Babylon by the unanimous Content of the Whole Court but more particularly with the Approbation of Astarte who after such a long Series of Misfortunes now tasted the Sweets of seeing her darling Zadig thought worthy in the Opinion of the whole World to be the Partner of her royal Bed Itobad withdrew and contented himself with being call d my Lord within the narrow Compass of his own Domesticks Zadig in short was elected King and was as happy as any Mortal could be Now he began to reflect on what the Angel Jesrad had said to him Nay he reflected so far back as the Story of the Arabian Atom of Dust metamorphosed into a Diamond
