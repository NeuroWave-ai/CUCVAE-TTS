123-25083-0003	train-other-500	Lastly
none	none	 beside the table sat a man of between forty and forty five short stout thick set ruddy with flaming eyes and a strong stubbly beard he wore flannel tights and was in his shirt sleeves one hand held a book and the other brandished a very large pipe with an iron bowl cap Whilst reading heaven only knows what startling adventure of scalp hunters he pouted out his lower lip in a terrifying way which gave the honest phiz of the man living placidly on his means the same impression of kindly ferocity which abounded throughout the house This man was Tartarin himself the Tartarin of Tarascon the great dreadnought incomparable Tartarin of Tarascon II A general glance bestowed upon the good town of Tarascon and a particular one on the cap poppers AT the time I am telling of Tartarin of Tarascon had not become the present day Tartarin the great one so popular in the whole South of France 
123-25081-0000	train-other-500	but yet he was even then the cock of the walk at Tarascon Let us show whence arose this sovereignty In the first place you must know that everybody is shooting mad in these parts
123-25081-0001	train-other-500	from the greatest to the least The chase is the local craze and so it has ever been since the mythological times when the Tarasque as the county dragon was called
123-25081-0002	train-other-500	flourished himself and his tail in the town marshes and entertained shooting parties got up against him So you see the passion has lasted a goodish bit It follows that
none	none	 every Sunday morning Tarascon flies to arms lets loose the dogs of the hunt and rushes out of its walls with game bag slung and fowling piece on the shoulder 
123-25081-0003	train-other-500	together with a hurly burly of hounds cracking of whips and blowing of whistles and hunting horns It s splendid to see Unfortunately there s a lack of game an
123-25081-0004	train-other-500	absolute dearth Stupid as the brute creation is you can readily understand that in time it learnt some distrust
none	none	 For five leagues around about Tarascon forms lairs and burrows are empty and nesting places abandoned You ll not find a single quail or blackbird one little leveret or the tiniest tit 
123-25081-0005	train-other-500	And yet the pretty hillocks are mightily tempting sweet smelling as they are of myrtle lavender and rosemary and the fine muscatels plumped out with sweetness even unto bursting
123-25081-0006	train-other-500	as they spread along the banks of the Rhone are deucedly tempting too True true but Tarascon lies behind all this and Tarascon is down in the black books of the world of fur and feather
123-25081-0007	train-other-500	The very birds of passage have ticked it off on their guide books and when the wild ducks coming down towards the Camargue in long triangles
none	none	 spy the town steeples from afar the outermost flyers squawk out loudly Look out there s Tarascon give Tarascon the go by duckies And the flocks take a swerve In short as far as game goes there s not a specimen left in the land 
123-25081-0008	train-other-500	save one old rogue of a hare escaped by miracle from the massacres who is stubbornly determined to stick to it all his life He is very well known at Tarascon
123-25081-0009	train-other-500	and a name has been given him Rapid is what they call him
none	none	 It is known that he has his form on M Bompard s grounds which by the way 
123-25081-0010	train-other-500	has doubled ay tripled the value of the property but nobody has yet managed to lay him low At present
123-25081-0011	train-other-500	only two or three inveterate fellows worry themselves about him The rest have given him up as a bad job and old Rapid has long ago passed into the legendary world
123-25081-0012	train-other-500	although your Tarasconer is very slightly superstitious naturally and would eat cock robins on toast or the swallow which is Our Lady s own bird for that matter if he could find any But that won t do
none	none	 you will say Inasmuch as game is so scarce what can the sportsmen do every Sunday What can they do Why goodness gracious 
123-25081-0013	train-other-500	they go out into the real country two or three leagues from town They gather in knots of five or six
none	none	 recline tranquilly in the shade of some well old wall or olive tree 
123-25081-0014	train-other-500	extract from their game bags a good sized piece of boiled beef raw onions a sausage and anchovies and commence a next to endless snack washed down with one of those nice Rhone wines
123-25081-0015	train-other-500	which sets a toper laughing and singing After that when thoroughly braced up they rise whistle the dogs to heel set the guns on half cock and go on the shoot
123-25081-0016	train-other-500	another way of saying that every man plucks off his cap shies it up with all his might
none	none	 and pops it on the fly with No five six or two shot 
123-25081-0017	train-other-500	according to what he is loaded for The man who lodges most shot in his cap is hailed as king of the hunt and stalks back triumphantly at dusk into Tarascon
123-25081-0018	train-other-500	with his riddled cap on the end of his gun barrel amid any quantity of dog barks and horn blasts It is needless to say that cap selling is a fine business in the town
123-25081-0019	train-other-500	There are even some hatters who sell hunting caps ready shot torn and perforated for the bad shots but the only buyer known is the chemist Bezuquet
none	none	 This is dishonourable As a marksman at caps Tartarin of Tarascon never had his match 
123-25081-0020	train-other-500	Every Sunday morning out he would march in a new cap and back he would strut every Sunday evening with a mere thing of shreds The loft of Baobab Villa
none	none	 was full of these glorious trophies Hence all Tarascon acknowledged him as master and as Tartarin thoroughly understood hunting 
123-25081-0021	train-other-500	and had read all the handbooks of all possible kinds of venery from cap popping to Burmese tiger shooting the sportsmen constituted him their great cynegetical judge
123-25081-0022	train-other-500	and took him for referee and arbitrator in all their differences Between three and four daily at Costecalde the gunsmith s
none	none	 a stout stern pipe smoker might be seen in a green leather covered arm chair in the centre of the shop crammed with cap poppers they all on foot and wrangling This was Tartarin of Tarascon delivering judgement Nimrod plus Solomon III Naw naw naw The general glance protracted upon the good town AFTER the craze for sporting the lusty Tarascon race cherishes one love ballad singing There s no believing what a quantity of ballads is used up in that little region All the sentimental stuff turning into sere and yellow leaves in the oldest portfolios are to be found in full pristine lustre in Tarascon Ay the entire collection Every family has its own pet as is known to the town For instance it is an established fact that this is the chemist Bezuquet s family s Thou art the fair star that I adore The gunmaker Costecalde s family s Would saint thou come to the land Where the log cabins rise The official registrar s family s If I wore a coat of invisible green Do you think for a moment I could be seen And so on for the whole of Tarascon Two or three times a week there were parties where they were sung The singularity was their being always the same and that the honest Tarasconers had never had an inclination to change them during the long long time they had been harping on them They were handed down from father to son in the families without anybody improving on them or bowdlerising them they were sacred Never did it occur to Costecalde s mind to sing the Bezuquets or the Bezuquets to try Costecalde s And yet you may believe that they ought to know by heart what they had been singing for two score years But nay everybody stuck to his own and they were all contented In ballad singing as in cap popping Tartarin was still the foremost His superiority over his fellow townsmen consisted in his not having any one song of his own but in knowing the lot the whole mind you But there s a but it was the devil s own work to get him to sing them Surfeited early in life with his drawing room successes our hero preferred by far burying himself in his hunting story books or spending the evening at the club to making a personal exhibition before a Nimes piano between a pair of home made candles These musical parades seemed beneath him Nevertheless at whiles when there was a harmonic party at Bezuquet s he would drop into the chemist s shop as if by chance and after a deal of pressure consent to do the grand duo in Robert le Diable with old Madame Bezuquet Whoso never heard that never heard anything For my part even if I lived a hundred years I should always see the mighty Tartarin solemnly stepping up to the piano setting his arms akimbo working up his tragic mien and beneath the green reflection from the show bottles in the window trying to give his pleasant visage the fierce and satanic expression of Robert the Devil Hardly would he fall into position before the whole audience would be shuddering with the foreboding that something uncommon was at hand After a hush old Madame Bezuquet would commence to her own accompaniment Robert my love is thine To thee I my faith did plight Thou seest my affright Mercy for thine own sake And mercy for mine In an undertone she would add Now then Tartarin Whereupon Tartarin of Tarascon with crooked arms clenched fists and quivering nostrils would roar three times in a formidable voice rolling like a thunderclap in the bowels of the instrument No no no which like the thorough southerner he was he pronounced nasally as Naw naw naw Then would old Madame Bezuquet again sing Mercy for thine own sake And mercy for mine Naw naw naw bellowed Tartarin at his loudest and there the gem ended Not long you see but it was so handsomely voiced forth so clearly gesticulated and so diabolical that a tremor of terror overran the chemist s shop and the Naw naw naw would be encored several times running Upon this Tartarin would sponge his brow smile on the ladies wink to the sterner sex and withdraw upon his triumph to go remark at the club with a trifling offhand air I have just come from the Bezuquets where I was forced to sing em the duo from Robert le Diable The cream of the joke was that he really believed it IV They 
123-25083-0000	train-other-500	CHIEFLY to the account of these diverse talents
none	none	 did Tartarin owe his lofty position in the town of Tarascon Talking of captivating though this deuce of a fellow knew how to ensnare everybody Why the army at Tarascon was for Tartarin 
123-25083-0001	train-other-500	The brave commandant Bravida honorary captain retired in the Military Clothing Factory Department called him a game fellow and you may well admit that the warrior knew all about game fellows
123-25083-0002	train-other-500	he played such a capital knife and fork on game of all kinds So was the legislature on Tartarin s side Two or three times in open court the old chief judge
none	none	 Ladevese had said in alluding to him He is a character Lastly the masses were for Tartarin 
123-25083-0004	train-other-500	He had become the swell bruiser the aristocratic pugilist the crack bully of the local Corinthians for the Tarasconers from his build bearing style that aspect of a guard s
123-25083-0005	train-other-500	trumpeter s charger which fears no noise his reputation as a hero coming from nobody knew whence or for what and some scramblings for coppers and a few kicks to the little ragamuffins basking at his doorway
123-25083-0006	train-other-500	Along the waterside
none	none	 when Tartarin came home from hunting on Sunday evenings 
123-25083-0007	train-other-500	with his cap on the muzzle of his gun and his fustian shooting jacket belted in tightly the sturdy river lightermen would respectfully bob and blinking towards the huge biceps swelling out his arms
123-25083-0008	train-other-500	would mutter among one another in admiration Now there s a powerful chap if you like he has double muscles Double muscles why you never heard of such a thing outside of Tarascon
none	none	 For all this 
123-25083-0009	train-other-500	with all his numberless parts double muscles the popular favour and the so precious esteem of brave Commandant Bravida ex captain in the Army Clothing Factory Tartarin was not happy
123-25083-0010	train-other-500	this life in a petty town weighed upon him and suffocated him The great man of Tarascon was bored in Tarascon
none	none	 The fact is for a heroic temperament like his 
123-25083-0011	train-other-500	a wild adventurous spirit which dreamt of nothing but battles races across the pampas mighty battues desert sands blizzards and typhoons it was not enough to go out every Sunday to pop at a cap
123-25083-0012	train-other-500	and the rest of the time to ladle out casting votes at the gunmaker s
none	none	 Poor dear great man If this existence were only prolonged 
123-25083-0013	train-other-500	there would be sufficient tedium in it to kill him with consumption In vain did he surround himself with baobabs and other African trees to widen his horizon
123-25083-0014	train-other-500	and some little to forget his club and the market place in vain did he pile weapon upon weapon and Malay kreese upon Malay kreese in vain did he cram with romances
123-25083-0015	train-other-500	endeavouring like the immortal Don Quixote to wrench himself by the vigour of his fancy out of the talons of pitiless reality
none	none	 Alas all that he did to appease his thirst for deeds of daring only helped to augment it 
123-25083-0016	train-other-500	The sight of all the murderous implements kept him in a perpetual stew of wrath and exaltation His revolvers repeating rifles and ducking guns shouted Battle battle
123-25083-0017	train-other-500	out of their mouths Through the twigs of his baobab the tempest of great voyages and journeys
none	none	 soughed and blew bad advice To finish him came Gustave Aimard Mayne Reid and Fenimore Cooper Oh how many times did Tartarin with a howl spring up on the sultry summer afternoons 
123-25083-0018	train-other-500	when he was reading alone amidst his blades points and edges how many times did he dash down his book and rush to the wall to unhook a deadly arm The poor man forgot he was at home in Tarascon in his underclothes
123-25083-0019	train-other-500	and with a handkerchief round his head He would translate his readings into action and goading himself with his own voice
none	none	 shout out whilst swinging a battle axe or tomahawk 
123-25083-0020	train-other-500	Now only let em come Them who were they Tartarin did not himself any too clearly understand They was all that should be attacked and fought with
123-25083-0021	train-other-500	all that bites claws scalps whoops and yells
none	none	 the Sioux Indians dancing around the war stake to which the unfortunate pale face prisoner is lashed 
123-25083-0022	train-other-500	The grizzly of the Rocky Mountains who wobbles on his hind legs and licks himself with a tongue full of blood
none	none	 The Touareg too in the desert 
123-25083-0023	train-other-500	the Malay pirate the brigand of the Abruzzi in short they was warfare travel adventure and glory But alas it was to no avail that the fearless Tarasconer
123-25083-0024	train-other-500	called for and defied them never did they come Odsboddikins what would they have come to do in Tarascon Nevertheless Tartarin always expected to run up against them
none	none	 particularly some evening in going to the club V How Tartarin went round to his club 
123-25084-0000	train-other-500	LITTLE indeed
none	none	 beside Tartarin of Tarascon 
123-25084-0001	train-other-500	arming himself capa pie to go to his club at nine
none	none	 an hour after the retreat had sounded on the bugle was the Templar Knight preparing for a sortie upon the infidel 
123-25084-0002	train-other-500	the Chinese tiger equipping himself for combat or the Comanche warrior painting up for going on the war path All hands make ready for action as the men of war s men say
123-25084-0003	train-other-500	In his left hand
none	none	 Tartarin took a steel pointed knuckle duster 
123-25084-0004	train-other-500	in the right he carried a sword cane in his left pocket a life preserver in the right a revolver
none	none	 On his chest 
123-25084-0005	train-other-500	betwixt outer and under garment lay a Malay kreese But never any poisoned arrows they are weapons altogether too unfair Before starting
123-25084-0006	train-other-500	in the silence and obscurity of his study he exercised himself for a while warding off imaginary cuts and thrusts lunging at the wall and giving his muscles play then he took his master key
none	none	 and went through the garden leisurely 
123-25084-0007	train-other-500	without hurrying mark you Cool and calm British courage that is the true sort gentlemen At the garden end he opened the heavy iron door
123-25084-0008	train-other-500	violently and abruptly so that it should slam against the outer wall If they had been skulking behind it you may wager they would have been jam
123-25084-0009	train-other-500	Unhappily they were not there The way being open
none	none	 out Tartarin would sally 
123-25084-0010	train-other-500	quickly glancing to the right and left ere banging the door to and fastening it smartly with double locking Then on the way Not so much as a cat upon the Avignon road
123-25084-0011	train-other-500	all the doors closed and no lights in the casements
none	none	 All was black 
123-25084-0012	train-other-500	except for the parish lamps well spaced apart blinking in the river mist Calm and proud
none	none	 Tartarin of Tarascon marched on in the night 
123-25084-0013	train-other-500	ringing his heels with regularity and sending sparks out of the paving stones
none	none	 with the ferule of his stick 
123-25084-0014	train-other-500	Whether in avenues streets or lanes he took care to keep in the middle of the road an excellent method of precaution allowing one to see danger coming and above all
123-25084-0015	train-other-500	to avoid any droppings from windows as happens after dark in Tarascon and the Old Town of Edinburgh
none	none	 On seeing so much prudence in Tartarin pray do not conclude that Tartarin had any fear dear no he only was on his guard The best proof that Tartarin was not scared is 
123-25084-0016	train-other-500	that instead of going to the club by the shortest cut he went over the town by the longest and darkest way round through a mass of vile paltry alleys at the mouth of which the Rhone could be seen ominously gleaming
none	none	 The poor knight 
123-25084-0017	train-other-500	constantly hoped that beyond the turn of one of these cut throats haunts they would leap from the shadow and fall on his back I warrant you they would have been warmly received though
123-25084-0018	train-other-500	but alack by reason of some nasty meanness of destiny
none	none	 never indeed did Tartarin of Tarascon enjoy the luck to meet any ugly customers 
123-25084-0019	train-other-500	not so much as a dog or a drunken man nothing at all Still there were false alarms somewhiles He would catch a sound of steps and muffled voices Ware hawks
none	none	 Tartarin would mutter 
123-25084-0020	train-other-500	and stop short as if taking root on the spot scrutinising the gloom sniffing the wind even glueing his ear to the ground in the orthodox Red Indian mode
123-25084-0021	train-other-500	The steps would draw nearer and the voices grow more distinct till no more doubt was possible They were coming in fact here they were
123-25084-0022	train-other-500	Steady with eye afire and heaving breast
none	none	 Tartarin would gather himself like a jaguar 
123-25084-0023	train-other-500	in readiness to spring forward whilst uttering his war cry when all of a sudden out of the thick of the murkiness
none	none	 he would hear honest Tarasconian voices quite tranquilly hailing him with Hullo you by Jove it s Tartarin 
123-25084-0024	train-other-500	Good night old fellow Maledictions upon it It was the chemist Bezuquet with his family coming from singing their family ballad at Costecalde s Oh good even good even
none	none	 Tartarin would growl furious at his blunder 
123-25084-0025	train-other-500	and plunging fiercely into the gloom with his cane waved on high
none	none	 On arriving in the street where stood his club house 
123-25084-0026	train-other-500	the dauntless one would linger yet a moment
none	none	 walking up and down before the portals ere entering 
123-25084-0027	train-other-500	But finally weary of awaiting them and certain they would not show themselves he would fling a last glare of defiance into the shades
123-25084-0028	train-other-500	and snarl wrathfully Nothing nothing at all there never is nothing Upon which double negation which he meant as a stronger affirmative
none	none	 the worthy champion would walk in to play his game of bezique with the commandant VI The two Tartarins ANSWER me you will say how the mischief is it that Tartarin of Tarascon never left Tarascon with all this mania for adventure need of powerful sensations and folly about travel rides and journeys from the Pole to the Equator 
123-25085-0000	train-other-500	For that is a fact up to the age of five and forty the dreadless Tarasconian
none	none	 had never once slept outside his own room 
123-25085-0001	train-other-500	He had not even taken that obligatory trip to Marseilles
none	none	 which every sound Provencal makes upon coming of age The most of his knowledge 
123-25085-0002	train-other-500	included Beaucaire and yet that s not far from Tarascon there being merely the bridge to go over Unfortunately this rascally bridge has so often been blown away by the gales it is so long and frail
none	none	 and the Rhone has such a width at this spot that well faith you understand Tartarin of Tarascon 
123-25085-0003	train-other-500	preferred terra firma We are afraid we must make a clean breast of it in our hero there were two very distinct characters
123-25085-0004	train-other-500	Some Father of the Church has said I feel there are two men in me
none	none	 He would have spoken truly in saying this about Tartarin 
123-25085-0005	train-other-500	who carried in his frame the soul of Don Quixote the same chivalric impulses
none	none	 heroic ideal 
123-25085-0006	train-other-500	and crankiness for the grandiose and romantic but worse is the luck he had not the body of the celebrated hidalgo that thin and meagre apology for a body on which material life failed to take a hold
123-25085-0007	train-other-500	one that could get through twenty nights without its breast plate being unbuckled off and forty eight hours on a handful of rice On the contrary
none	none	 Tartarin s body 
123-25085-0008	train-other-500	was a stout honest bully of a body very fat very weighty most sensual and fond of coddling highly touchy full of low class appetite and homely requirements
123-25085-0009	train-other-500	the short paunchy body on stumps of the immortal Sancho Panza Don Quixote and Sancho Panza in the one same man you will readily comprehend what a cat and dog couple they made
123-25085-0010	train-other-500	what strife what clapper clawing Oh the fine dialogue for Lucian or Saint Evremond to write between the two Tartarins
none	none	 Quixote Tartarin and Sancho Tartarin Quixote Tartarin firing up on the stories of Gustave Aimard 
123-25085-0011	train-other-500	and shouting Up and at em
none	none	 and Sancho Tartarin thinking only of the rheumatics ahead 
123-25085-0012	train-other-500	and murmuring I mean to stay at home THE DUET
none	none	 QUIXOTE TARTARIN SANCHO TARTARIN Highly excited Quite calmly Cover yourself with glory Tartarin cover yourself Tartarin with flannel Still more excitedly Still more calmly O for the terrible double O for the thick knitted barrelled rifle O for waistcoats and warm bowie knives lassoes knee caps O for the and moccasins welcome padded caps with ear flaps 
123-25085-0013	train-other-500	Above all self control
none	none	 Ringing up the maid A battle axe fetch me a Now then Jeannette do battle axe bring up that chocolate Whereupon Jeannette would appear with an unusually good cup of chocolate just right in warmth 
123-25085-0014	train-other-500	sweetly smelling and with the play of light on watered silk upon its unctuous surface and with succulent grilled steak flavoured with anise seed
none	none	 which would set Sancho Tartarin off on the broad grin and into a laugh that drowned the shouts of Quixote Tartarin Thus it came about that Tartarin of Tarascon never had left Tarascon VII Tartarin The Europeans at Shanghai Commerce The Tartars Can Tartarin of Tarascon be an Impostor The Mirage UNDER one conjunction of circumstances Tartarin did however once almost start out upon a great voyage The three brothers Garcio Camus relatives of Tarascon established in business at Shanghai offered him the managership of one of their branches there This undoubtedly presented the kind of life he hankered after Plenty of active business a whole army of under strappers to order about and connections with Russia Persia Turkey in Asia in short to be a merchant prince In Tartarin s mouth the title of Merchant Prince thundered out as something stunning The house of Garcio Camus had the further advantage of sometimes being favoured with a call from the Tartars Then the doors would be slammed shut all the clerks flew to arms up ran the consular flag and zizz phit bang out of the windows upon the Tartars I need not tell you with what enthusiasm Quixote Tartarin clutched this proposition sad to say Sancho Tartarin did not see it in the same light and as he was the stronger party it never came to anything But in the town there was much talk about it Would he go or would he not I ll lay he will and I ll wager he won t It was the event of the week In the upshot Tartarin did not depart but the matter redounded to his credit none the less Going or not going to Shanghai was all one to Tarascon Tartarin s journey was so much talked about that people got to believe he had done it and returned and at the club in the evening members would actually ask for information on life at Shanghai the manners and customs and climate about opium and commerce Deeply read up Tartarin would graciously furnish the particulars desired and in the end the good fellow was not quite sure himself about not having gone to Shanghai so that after relating for the hundredth time how the Tartars came down on the trading post it would most naturally happen him to add Then I made my men take up arms and hoist the consular flag and zizz phit bang out of the windows upon the Tartars On hearing this the whole club would quiver But according to that this Tartarin of yours is an awful liar No no a thousand times over no Tartarin was no liar But the man ought to know that he has never been to Shanghai Why of course he knows that but still But still you see mark that It is high time for the law to be laid down once for all on the reputation as drawers of the long bow which Northerners fling at Southerners There are no Baron Munchausens in the south of France neither at Nimes nor Marseilles Toulouse nor Tarascon The Southerner does not deceive but is self deceived He does not always tell the cold drawn truth but he believes he does His falsehood is not any such thing but a kind of mental mirage Yes purely mirage The better to follow me you should actually follow me into the South and you will see I am right You have only to look at that Lucifer s own country where the sun transmogrifies everything and magnifies it beyond life size The little hills of Provence are no bigger than the Butte Montmartre but they will loom up like the Rocky Mountains the Square House at Nimes a mere model to put on your sideboard will seem grander than saint Peter s You will see in brief the only exaggerator in the South is Old Sol for he does enlarge everything he touches What was Sparta in its days of splendour a pitiful hamlet What was Athens at the most a second class town and yet in history both appear to us as enormous cities This is a sample of what the sun can do Are you going to be astonished after this that the same sun falling upon Tarascon should have made of an ex captain in the Army Clothing Factory like Bravida the brave commandant of a sprout an Indian fig tree and of a man who had missed going to Shanghai one who had been there VIII Mitaine s Menagerie A Lion from the Atlas at Tarascon A Solemn and Fearsome Confrontation EXHIBITING Tartarin of Tarascon as we are in his private life before Fame kissed his brow and garlanded him with her well worn laurel wreath and having narrated his heroic existence in a modest state his delights and sorrows his dreams and his hopes let us hurriedly skip to the grandest pages of his story and to the singular event which was to give the first flight to his incomparable career It happened one evening at Costecalde the gunmaker s where Tartarin was engaged in showing several sportsmen the working of the needle gun then in its first novelty The door suddenly flew open and in rushed a bewildered cap popper howling A lion a lion General was the alarm stupor uproar and tumult Tartarin prepared to resist cavalry with the bayonet whilst Costecalde ran to shut the door The sportsman was surrounded and pressed and questioned and here follows what he told them Mitaine s Menagerie returning from Beaucaire Fair had consented to stay over a few days at Tarascon and was just unpacking to set up the show on the Castle green with a lot of boas seals crocodiles and a magnificent lion from the Atlas Mountains An African lion in Tarascon Never in the memory of living man had the like been seen Hence our dauntless cap poppers looked at one another how proudly What a beaming on their sunburned visages and in every nook of Costecalde s shop what hearty congratulatory grips of the hand were silently exchanged The sensation was so great and unforeseen that nobody could find a word to say not even Tartarin Blanched and agitated with the needle gun still in his fist he brooded erect before the counter A lion from the Atlas Range at pistol range from him a couple of strides off a lion mind you the beast heroic and ferocious above all others the King of the Brute Creation the crowning game of his fancies something like the leading actor in the ideal company which played such splendid tragedies in his mind s eye A lion heaven be thanked and from the Atlas to boot It was more than the great Tartarin could bear Suddenly a flush of blood flew into his face His eyes flashed With one convulsive movement he shouldered the needle gun and turning towards the brave Commandant Bravida formerly captain in the Army Clothing Department please to remember he thundered to him Let s go have a look at him commandant Here here I say that s my gun my needle gun you are carrying off timidly ventured the wary Costecalde but Tartarin had already got round the corner with all the cap poppers proudly lock stepping behind him When they arrived at the menagerie they found a goodly number of people there Tarascon heroic but too long deprived of sensational shows had rushed upon Mitaine s portable theatre and had taken it by storm Hence the voluminous Madame Mitaine was highly contented In an Arab costume her arms bare to the elbow iron anklets on a whip in one hand and a plucked though live pullet in the other the noted lady was doing the honours of the booth to the Tarasconians and as she also had double muscles her success was almost as great as her animals The entrance of Tartarin with the gun on his shoulder was a damper All our good Tarasconians who had been quite tranquilly strolling before the cages unarmed and with no distrust without even any idea of danger felt momentary apprehension naturally enough on beholding their mighty Tartarin rush into the enclosure with his formidable engine of war There must be something to fear when a hero like he was came weaponed so in a twinkling all the space along the cage fronts was cleared The youngsters burst out squalling for fear and the women looked round for the nearest way out The chemist Bezuquet made off altogether alleging that he was going home for his gun Gradually however Tartarin s bearing restored courage With head erect the intrepid Tarasconian slowly and calmly made the circuit of the booth passing the seal s tank without stopping glancing disdainfully on the long box filled with sawdust in which the boa would digest its raw fowl and going to take his stand before the lion s cage A terrible and solemn confrontation this The lion of Tarascon and the lion of Africa face to face On the one part Tartarin erect with his hamstrings in tension and his arms folded on his gun barrel on the other the lion a gigantic specimen humped up in the straw with blinking orbs and brutish mien resting his huge muzzle and tawny full bottomed wig on his forepaws Both calm in their gaze Singular thing whether the needle gun had given him the needle if the popular idiom is admissible or that he scented an enemy of his race the lion who had hitherto regarded the Tarasconians with sovereign scorn and yawned in their faces was all at once affected by ire At first he sniffed then he growled hollowly stretching out his claws rising he tossed his head shook his mane opened a capacious maw and belched a deafening roar at Tartarin A yell of fright responded as Tarascon precipitated itself madly towards the exit women and children lightermen cap poppers even the brave Commandant Bravida himself But alone Tartarin of Tarascon had not budged There he stood firm and resolute before the cage lightnings in his eyes and on his lip that gruesome grin with which all the town was familiar In a moment s time when all the cap poppers some little fortified by his bearing and the strength of the bars re approached their leader they heard him mutter as he stared Leo out of countenance Now this is something like a hunt All the rest of that day never a word farther could they draw from Tartarin of Tarascon IX Singular effects of Mental Mirage CONFINING his remarks to the sentence last recorded Tartarin had unfortunately still said overmuch On the morrow there was nothing talked about through town but the near at hand departure of Tartarin for Algeria and lion hunting You are all witness dear readers that the honest fellow had not breathed a word on that head but you know the mirage had its usual effect In brief all Tarascon spoke of nothing but the departure On the Old Walk at the club in Costecalde s friends accosted one another with a startled aspect And furthermore you know the news at least And furthermore rather Tartarin s setting out at least For at Tarascon all phrases begin with and furthermore and conclude with at least with a strong local accent Hence on this occasion more than upon others these peculiarities rang out till the windows shivered The most surprised of men in the town on hearing that Tartarin was going away to Africa was Tartarin himself But only see what vanity is Instead of plumply answering that he was not going at all and had not even had the intention poor Tartarin on the first of them mentioning the journey to him observed with a neat little evasive air Aha maybe I shall but I do not say as much The second time a trifle more familiarised with the idea he replied Very likely and the third time It s certain Finally in the evening at Costecalde s and the club carried away by the egg nogg cheers and illumination intoxicated by the impression that bare announcement of his departure had made on the town the hapless fellow formally declared that he was sick of banging away at caps and that he would shortly be on the trail of the great lions of the Atlas A deafening hurrah greeted this assertion Whereupon more egg nogg bravoes handshaking slappings of the shoulder and a torchlight serenade up to midnight before Baobab Villa It was Sancho Tartarin who was anything but delighted This idea of travel in Africa and lion hunting made him shudder beforehand and when the house was re entered and whilst the complimentary concert was sounding under the windows he had a dreadful row with Quixote Tartarin calling him a cracked head a visionary imprudent and thrice an idiot and detailing by the card all the catastrophes awaiting him on such an expedition shipwreck rheumatism yellow fever dysentery the black plague elephantiasis and the rest of them In vain did Quixote Tartarin vow that he had not committed any imprudence that he would wrap himself up well and take even superfluous necessaries with him Sancho Tartarin would listen to nothing The poor craven saw himself already torn to tatters by the lions or engulfed in the desert sands like his late royal highness Cambyses and the other Tartarin only managed to appease him a little by explaining that the start was not immediate as nothing pressed It is clear enough indeed that none embark on such an enterprise without some preparations A man is bound to know whither he goes hang it all and not fly off like a bird Before anything else the Tarasconian wanted to peruse the accounts of great African tourists the narrations of Mungo Park Du Chaillu doctor Livingstone Stanley and so on In them he learnt that these daring explorers before donning their sandals for distant excursions hardened themselves well beforehand to support hunger and thirst forced marches and all kinds of privation Tartarin meant to act like they did and from that day forward he lived upon water broth alone The water broth of Tarascon is a few slices of bread drowned in hot water with a clove of garlic a pinch of thyme and a sprig of laurel Strict diet at which you may believe poor Sancho made a wry face To the regimen of water broth Tartarin of Tarascon joined other wise practices To break himself into the habit of long marches he constrained himself to go round the town seven or eight times consecutively every morning either at the fast walk or run his elbows well set against his body and a couple of white pebbles in the mouth according to the antique usage To get inured to fog dew and night coolness he would go down into his garden every dusk and stop out there till ten or eleven alone with his gun on the lookout behind the baobab Finally so long as Mitaine s wild beast show tarried in Tarascon the cap poppers who were belated at Costecalde s might spy in the shadow of the booth as they crossed the Castle green a mysterious figure stalking up and down It was Tartarin of Tarascon habituating himself to hear without emotion the roarings of the lion in the sombre night X Before the Start PENDING Tartarin s delay of the event by all sorts of heroic means all Tarascon kept an eye upon him and nothing else was busied about Cap popping was winged and ballad singing dead The piano in Bezuquet s shop mouldered away under a green fungus and the Spanish flies dried upon it belly up Tartarin s expedition had a put a stopper on everything Ah you ought to have seen his success in the parlours He was snatched away by one from another fought for loaned and borrowed ay stolen There was no greater honour for the ladies than to go to Mitaine s Menagerie on Tartarin s arms and have it explained before the lion s den how such large game are hunted where they should be aimed at at how many paces off if the accidents were numerous and the like of that Tartarin furnished all the elucidation desired He had read The Life of Jules Gerard the Lion Slayer and had lion hunting at his finger ends as if he had been through it himself Hence he orated upon these matters with great eloquence But where he shone the brightest was at dinner at Chief Judge Ladeveze s or brave Commandant Bravida s the former captain in the Army Clothing Factory you will keep in mind when coffee came in and all the chairs were brought up closer together whilst they chatted of his future hunts Thereupon his elbow on the cloth his nose over his Mocha our hero would discourse in a feeling tone of all the dangers awaiting him thereaway He spoke of the long moonless night lyings in wait the pestilential fens the rivers envenomed by leaves of poison plants the deep snow drifts the scorching suns the scorpions and rains of grasshoppers he also descanted on the peculiarities of the great lions of the Atlas their way of fighting their phenomenal vigour and their ferocity in the mating season Heating with his own recital he would rise from table bounding to the middle of the dining room imitating the roar of a lion and the going off of a rifle crack bang the zizz of the explosive bullet gesticulating and roaring about till he had overset the chairs Everybody turned pale around the board the gentlemen looking at one another and wagging their heads the ladies shutting their eyes with pretty screams of fright the elderly men combatively brandishing their canes and in the side apartments the little boys who had been put to bed betimes were greatly startled by the sudden outcries and imitated gun fire and screamed for lights Meanwhile Tartarin did not start XI Let s have it out with swords gentleman not pins A DELICATE question whether Tartarin really had any intention of going and one which the historian of Tartarin would be highly embarrassed to answer In plain words Mitaine s Menagerie had left Tarascon over three months and still the lion slayer had not started After all blinded by a new mirage our candid hero may have imagined in perfectly good faith that he had gone to Algeria On the strength of having related his future hunts he may have believed he had performed them as sincerely as he fancied he had hoisted the consular flag and fired on the Tartars zizz phit bang at Shanghai Unfortunately granting Tartarin was this time again dupe of an illusion his fellow townsfolk were not When after the quarter s expectation they perceived that the hunter had not packed even a collar box they commenced murmuring This is going to turn out like the Shanghai expedition remarked Costecalde smiling The gunsmith s comment was welcomed all over town for nobody believed any longer in their late idol The simpletons and poltroons all the fellows of Bezuquet s stamp whom a flea would put to flight and who could not fire a shot without closing their eyes were conspicuously pitiless In the club rooms or on the esplanade they accosted poor Tartarin with bantering mien And furthermore when is that trip coming off In Costecalde s shop his opinions gained no credence for the cap poppers renounced their chief Next epigrams dropped into the affair Chief Judge Ladevese who willingly paid court in his leisure hours to the native Muse composed in local dialect a song which won much success It told of a sportsman called Master Gervais whose dreaded rifle was bound to exterminate all the lions in Africa to the very last Unluckily this terrible gun was of a strange kind though loaded daily it never went off It never went off you will catch the drift In less than no time this ditty became popular and when Tartarin came by the longshoremen and the little shoeblacks before his door sang in chorus Muster Jarvey s roifle Allus gittin chaarged Muster Jarvey s roifle il hev to git enlaarged Muster Jarvey s roifle s Loaded oft don t scoff Muster Jarvey s roifle Nivver do go off But it was shouted out from a safe distance on account of the double muscles Oh the fragility of Tarascon s fads The great object himself feigned to see and hear nothing but under the surface this sullen and venomous petty warfare much afflicted him He felt aware that Tarascon was slipping out of his grip and that popular favour was going to others and this made him suffer horribly Ah the huge bowl of popularity it s all very well to have a seat in front of it but what a scalding you catch when it is overturned Notwithstanding his pain Tartarin smiled and peacefully jogged on in the same life as if nothing untoward had happened Still the mask of jovial heedlessness glued by pride on his face would sometimes be suddenly detached Then in lieu of laughter one saw grief and indignation Thus it was that one morning when the little blackguards yelped Muster Jarvey s Roifle beneath his window the wretches voices rose even into the poor great man s room where he was shaving before the glass Tartarin wore a full beard but as it grew very thick he was obliged to keep it trimmed orderly All at once the window was violently opened and Tartarin appeared in shirt sleeves and nightcap smothered in lather flourishing his razor and shaving brush and roaring with a formidable voice Let s have it out with swords gentlemen not pins Fine words worthy of history s record with only the blemish that they were addressed to little scamps not higher than their boot boxes and who were quite incapable of holding a smallsword XII A memorable Dialogue in the little Baobab Villa AMID the general falling off the army alone stuck out firmly for Tartarin Brave Commandant Bravida the former captain in the Army Clothing Department continued to show him the same esteem as ever He s game he persisted in saying an assertion I beg to believe fully worth the chemist Bezuquet s Not once did the brave officer let out any allusion to the trip to Africa but when the public clamour grew too loud he determined to have his say One evening the luckless Tartarin was in his study in a brown study himself when he saw the commandant stride in stern wearing black gloves buttoned up to his ears Tartarin said the ex captain authoritatively Tartarin you ll have to go And there he dwelt erect in the doorway frame grand and rigid as embodied Duty Tartarin of Tarascon comprehended all the sense in Tartarin you ll have to ago Very pale he rose and looked around with a softened eye upon the cosy snuggery tightly closed in full of warmth and tender light upon the commodious easy chair his books the carpet the white blinds of the windows beyond which trembled the slender twigs of the little garden Then advancing towards the brave officer he took his hand grasped it energetically and said in a voice somewhat tearful but stoical for all that I am going Bravida And go he did as he said he would Not straight off though for it takes time to get the paraphernalia together To begin with he ordered of Bompard two large boxes bound with brass and an inscription to be on them I TARTARIN OF TARASCON I I Firearms c I The binding in brass and the lettering took much time He also ordered at Tastavin s a showy album in which to keep a diary and his impressions of travel for a man cannot help having an idea or two strike him even when he is busy lion hunting Next he had over from Marseilles a downright cargo of tinned eatables pemmican compressed in cakes for making soup a new pattern shelter tent opening out and packing up in a minute sea boots a couple of umbrellas a waterproof coat and blue spectacles to ward off ophthalmia To conclude Bezuquet the chemist made him up a miniature portable medicine chest stuffed with diachylon plaister arnica camphor and medicated vinegar Poor Tartarin he did not take these safeguards on his own behalf but he hoped by dint of precaution and delicate attentions to allay Sancho Tartarin s fury who since the start was fixed never left off raging day or night XIII The Departure EFTSOON arrived the great and solemn day From dawn all Tarascon had been on foot encumbering the Avignon road and the approaches to Baobab Villa People were up at the windows on the roofs and in the trees the Rhone bargees porters dredgers shoeblacks gentry tradesfolk warpers and weavers taffety workers the club members in short the whole town moreover people from Beaucaire had come over the bridge market gardeners from the environs carters in their huge carts with ample tilts vinedressers upon handsome mules tricked out with ribbons streamers bells rosettes and jingles and even here and there a few pretty maids from Arles come on the pillion behind their sweethearts with bonny blue ribbons round the head upon little iron grey Camargue horses All this swarm squeezed and jostled before our good Tartarin s door who was going to slaughter lions in the land of the Turks For Tarascon Algeria Africa Greece Persia Turkey and Mesopotamia all form one great hazy country almost a myth called the land of the Turks They say Tur s but that s a linguistic digression In the midst of all this throng the cap poppers bustled to and fro proud of their captain s triumph leaving glorious wakes where they had passed In front of the Indian fig tree house were two large trucks From time to time the door would open and allow several persons to be spied gravely lounging about the little garden At every new box the throng started and trembled The articles were named in a loud voice That there s the shelter tent these the potted meats that s the physic chest these the gun cases the cap poppers giving explanations All of a sudden about ten o clock there was a great stir in the multitude for the garden gate banged open Here he is here he is they shouted It was he indeed When he appeared upon the threshold two outcries of stupefaction burst from the assemblage He s a Turk He s got on spectacles In truth Tartarin of Tarascon had deemed it his duty on going to Algeria to don the Algerian costume Full white linen trousers small tight vest with metal buttons a red sash two feet wide around the waist the neck bare and the forehead shaven and a vast red fez or chechia on his head with something like a long blue tassel thereto Together with this two heavy guns one on each shoulder a broad hunting knife in the girdle a bandolier across the breast a revolver on the hip swinging in its patent leather case that is all No I cry your pardon I was forgetting the spectacles a pantomimically large pair of azure barnacles which came in partly to temper what was rather too fierce in the bearing of our hero Long life to Tartarin hip hip hurrah for Tartarin roared the populace The great man smiled but did not salute on account of the firearms hindering him Moreover he knew now on what popular favour depends it may even be that in the depths of his soul he cursed his terrible fellow townsfolk who obliged him to go away and leave his pretty little pleasure house with whitened walls and green venetians But there was no show of this Calm and proud although a little pallid he stepped out on the footway glanced at the hand carts and seeing all was right lustily took the road to the railway station without even once looking back towards Baobab Villa Behind him marched the brave Commandant Bravida Ladevese the Chief Judge Costecalde the gunsmith next and then all the sportsmen who pop at caps preceding the hand carts and the rag tag and bobtail Before the station the station master awaited them an old African veteran of eighteen thirty who shook Tartarin s hand many times with fervency The Paris to Marseilles express was not yet in so Tartarin and his staff went into the waiting rooms To prevent the place being overrun the station master ordered the gates to be closed During a quarter of an hour Tartarin promenaded up and down in the rooms in the midst of his brother marksmen speaking to them of his journey and his hunting and promising to send them skins they put their names down in his memorandum book for a lionskin apiece as waltzers book for a dance Gentle and placid as Socrates on the point of quaffing the hemlock the intrepid Tarasconian had a word and a smile for each He spoke simply with an affable mien it looked as if before departing he meant to leave behind him a wake of charms regrets and pleasant memories On hearing their leader speak in this way all the sportsmen felt tears well up and some were stung with remorse to wit Chief Judge Ladevese and the chemist Bezuquet The railway employees blubbered in the corners whilst the outer public squinted through the bars and bellowed Long live Tartarin At length the bell rang A dull rumble was heard and a piercing whistle shook the vault The Marseilles express general lemen Good bye Tartarin Good luck old fellow Good bye to you all murmured the great man as with his arms around the brave Commandant Bravida he embraced his dear native place collectively in him Then he leaped out upon the platform and clambered into a carriage full of Parisian ladies who were ready to die with fright at sight of this stranger with so many pistols and rifles XIV The Port of Marseilles All aboard all aboard UPON the first of December eighteen in clear brilliant splendid weather under a south winter sun the startled inhabitants of Marseilles beheld a Turk come down the Canebiere or their Regent Street A Turk a regular Turk never had such a one been seen and yet Heaven knows there is no lack of Turks at Marseilles The Turk in question have I any necessity of telling you it was the great Tartarin of Tarascon waddled along the quays followed by his gun cases medicine chest and tinned comestibles to reach the landing stage of the Touache Company and the mail steamer the Zouave which was to transport him over the sea With his ears still ringing with the home applause intoxicated by the glare of the heavens and the reek of the sea Tartarin fairly beamed as he stepped out with a lofty head and between his guns on his shoulders looking with all his eyes upon that wondrous dazzling harbour of Marseilles which he saw for the first time The poor fellow believed he was dreaming He fancied his name was Sinbad the Sailor and that he was roaming in one of those fantastic cities abundant in the Arabian Nights As far as eye could reach there spread a forest of masts and spars cris crossing in every way Flags of all countries floated English American Russian Swedish Greek and Tunisian The vessels lay alongside the wharves ay head on so that their bowsprits stuck up out over the strand like rows of bayonets Over it too sprawled the mermaids goddesses madonnas and other figure heads in carved and painted wood which gave names to the ships all worn by sea water split mildewed and dripping Ever and anon between the hulls a patch of harbour like watered silk splashed with oil In the intervals of the yards and booms what seemed swarms of flies prettily spotted the blue sky These were the shipboys hailing one another in all languages On the waterside amidst thick green or black rivulets coming down from the soap factories loaded with oil and soda bustled a mass of custom house officers messengers porters and truckmen with their bogheys or trolleys drawn by Corsican ponies There were shops selling quaint articles smoky shanties where sailors were cooking their own queer messes dealers in pipes monkeys parrots ropes sailcloth fanciful curios amongst which were mingled higgledy piggledy old culverins huge gilded lanterns worn out pulley blocks rusty flukeless anchors chafed cordage battered speaking trumpets and marine glasses almost contemporary with the Ark Sellers of mussels and clams squatted beside their heaps of shellfish and yawped their goods Seamen rolled by with tar pots smoking soup bowls and big baskets full of cuttlefish from which they went to wash the ink in the milky waters of the fountains Everywhere a prodigious collection of all kinds of goods silks minerals wood in stacks lead in pigs cloths sugars caruba wood logs colza seed liquorice sticks sugar canes The East and the West cheek by jowl even to pyramids of Dutch cheeses which the Genoese were dyeing red by contact with their hands Yonder was the corn market porters discharging sacks down the shoots of lofty elevators upon the pier and loose grain rolling as a golden torrent through a blonde dust Men in red skullcaps were sifting it as they caught it in large asses skin sieves and loading it upon carts which took their millward way followed by a regiment of women and youngsters with wisps and gleaning baskets Farther on the dry docks where large vessels were laid low on their sides till their yards dipped in the water they were singed with thorn bushes to free them of sea weed there rose an odour of pitch and the deafening clatter of the sheathers coppering the bottoms with broad sheets of yellow metal At whiles a gap in between the masts in which Tartarin could see the haven mouth where the vessels came and went a British frigate off for Malta dainty and thoroughly washed down with the officer in primrose gloves or a large home port brig hauling out in the midst of uproar and oaths whilst the fat captain in a high silk hat and frockcoat ordered the operations in Provencal dialect Other craft were making forth under all sail and still farther out more were slowly looming up in the sunshine as if they were sailing in the air All the time a frightful riot the rumbling of carts the Haul all haul away of the shipmen oaths songs steamboat whistles the bugles and drums in Forts Saint Jean and Saint Nicolas the bells of the Major the Accoules and Saint Victor with the mistral atop of all catching up the noises and clamour and rolling them up together with a furious shaking till confounded with its own voice which intoned a mad wild heroic melody like a grand charging tune one that filled hearers with a longing to be off and the farther the better a craving for wings It was to the sound of this splendid blast that the intrepid Tartarin Tarasco of Tarascon embarked for the land of lions EPISODE THE SECOND AMONG THE TURKS I The Passage The Five Positions of the Fez The Third Evening Out Mercy upon us JOYFUL would I be my dear readers if I were a painter a great artist I mean in order to set under your eyes at the head of this second episode the various positions taken by Tartarin s red cap in the three days passage it made on board of the Zouave between France and Algeria First would I show you it at the steaming out upon deck arrogant and heroic as it was forming a glory round that handsome Tarasconian head Next would I show you it at the harbour mouth when the bark began to caper upon the waves I would depict it for you all of a quake in astonishment and as though already experiencing the preliminary qualms of sea sickness Then in the Gulf of the Lion proportionably to the nearing the open sea where the white caps heaved harder I would make you behold it wrestling with the tempest and standing on end upon the hero s cranium with its mighty mane of blue wool bristling out in the spray and breeze Position Fourth at six in the afternoon with the Corsican coast in view the unfortunate chechia hangs over the ship s side and lamentably stares down as though to plumb the depths of ocean Finally and lastly the Fifth Position at the back of a narrow state room in a box bed so small it seemed one drawer in a nest of them something shapeless rolled on the pillow with moans of desolation This was the fez the fez so defiant at the sailing now reduced to the vulgar condition of a nightcap and pulled down over the very ears of the head of a pallid and convulsed sufferer How the people of Tarascon would have kicked themselves for having constrained the great Tartarin to leave home if they had but seen him stretched in the bunk in the dull wan gleam through the dead light amid the sickly odour of cooking and wet wood the heart heaving perfume of mail boats if they had but heard him gurgle at every turn of the screw wail for tea every five minutes and swear at the steward in a childish treble On my word of honour as a story teller the poor Turk would have made a paste board dummy pity him Suddenly overcome by the nausea the hapless victim had not even the power to undo the Algerian girdle cloth or lay aside his armoury the lumpy handled hunting sword pounded his ribs and the leather revolver case made his thigh raw To finish him arose the taunts of Sancho Tartarin who never ceased to groan and inveigh Well for the biggest kind of imbecile you are the finest specimen I told you truly how it would be Ha ha you were bound to go to Africa of course Well old merriman now you are going to Africa how do you like it The cruellest part of it was that from the retreat where he was moaning the hapless invalid could hear the passengers in the grand saloon laughing munching singing and playing at cards On board the Zouave the company was as jolly as numerous composed of officers going back to join their regiments ladies from the Marseilles Alcazar Music Hall strolling players a rich Mussulman returning from Mecca and a very jocular Montenegrin prince who favoured them with imitations of the low comedians of Paris Not one of these jokers felt the sea sickness and their time was passed in quaffing champagne with the steamer captain a good fat born Marseillais who had a wife and family as well at Algiers as at home and who answered to the merry name of Barbassou Tartarin of Tarascon hated this pack of wretches their mirthfulness deepened his ails At length on the third afternoon there was such an extraordinary hullabaloo on the deck that our hero was roused out of his long torpor The ship s bell was ringing and the seamen s heavy boots ran over the planks Go ahead Stop her Turn astern barked the hoarse voice of Captain Barbassou and then Stop her dead There was an abrupt check of movement a shock and no more save the silent rolling of the boat from side to side like a balloon in the air This strange stillness alarmed the Tarasconian Heaven ha mercy upon us he yelled in a terrifying voice as recovering his strength by magic he bounded out of his berth and rushed upon deck with his arsenal II To arms to arms ONLY the arrival not a foundering The Zouave was just gliding into the roadstead a fine one of black deep water but dull and still almost deserted On elevated ground ahead rose Algiers the White City with its little houses of a dead cream colour huddling against one another lest they slid into the sea It was like Meudon slope with a laundress s washing hung out to dry Over it a vast blue satin sky and such a blue A little restored from his fright the illustrious Tartarin gazed on the landscape and listened with respect to the Montenegrin prince who stood by his side as he named the different parts of the capital the Kasbah the upper town and the Rue Bab Azoon A very finely brought up prince was this Montenegrin moreover knowing Algeria thoroughly and fluently speaking Arabic Hence Tartarin thought of cultivating his acquaintance All at once along the bulwark against which they were leaning the Tarasconian perceived a row of large black hands clinging to it from over the side Almost instantly a Negro s woolly head shot up before him and ere he had time to open his mouth the deck was overwhelmed on every side by a hundred black or yellow desperadoes half naked hideous and fearsome Tartarin knew who these pirates were they of course the celebrated they who had too often been hunted after by him in the by ways of Tarascon At last they had decided to meet him face to face At the outset surprise nailed him to the spot But when he saw the outlaws fall upon the luggage tear off the tarpaulin covering and actually commence the pillage of the ship then the hero awoke Whipping out his hunting sword To arms to arms he roared to the passengers and away he flew the foremost of all upon the buccaneers Ques aco What s the stir What s the matter with you exclaimed Captain Barbassou coming out of the tweendecks About time you did turn up captain Quick quick arm your men Eh what for dash it all Why can t you see See what There before you the corsairs Captain Barbassou stared bewildered At this juncture a tall blackamoor tore by with our hero s medicine chest upon his back You cut throat just wait for me yelled the Tarasconer as he ran after with the knife uplifted But Barbassou caught him in the spring and holding him by the waist sash bade him be quiet Tron de ler by the throne on high they re no pirates It s long since there were any pirates hereabout Those dark porters are light porters Ha ha P p porters Rather only come after the luggage to carry it ashore So put up your cook s galley knife give me your ticket and walk off behind that nigger an honest dog who will see you to land and even into a hotel if you like A little abashed Tartarin handed over his ticket and falling in behind the representative of the Dark Continent clambered down by the hanging ladder into a big skiff dancing alongside All his effects were already there boxes trunks gun cases tinned food so cramming up the boat that there was no need to wait for any other passengers The African scrambled upon the boxes and squatted there like a baboon with his knees clutched by his hands Another Negro took the oars Both laughingly eyed Tartarin and showed their white teeth Standing in the stern sheets making that terrifying face which had daunted his fellow countrymen the great Tarasconian feverishly fumbled with his hunting knife haft for despite what Barbassou had told him he was only half at ease as regarded the intention of these ebony skinned porters who so little resembled their honest mates of Tarascon Five minutes afterwards the skiff landed Tartarin and he set foot upon the little Barbary wharf where three hundred years before a Spanish galley slave yclept Miguel Cervantes devised under the cane of the Algerian taskmaster a sublime romance which was to bear the title of Don Quixote III An Invocation to Cervantes The Disembarkation Where are the Turks Not a sign of them Disenchantment O MIGUEL CERVANTES SAAVEDRA if what is asserted be true to wit that wherever great men have dwelt some emanation of their spirits wanderingly hovers until the end of ages then what remained of your essence on the Barbary coast must have quivered with glee on beholding Tartarin of Tarascon disembark that marvellous type of the French Southerner in whom was embodied both heroes of your work Don Quixote and Sancho Panza The air was sultry on this occasion On the wharf ablaze with sunshine were half a dozen revenue officers some Algerians expecting news from France several squatting Moors who drew at long pipes and some Maltese mariners dragging large nets between the meshes of which thousands of sardines glittered like small silver coins But hardly had Tartarin set foot on earth before the quay sprang into life and changed its aspect A horde of savages still more hideous than the pirates upon the steamer rose between the stones on the strand and rushed upon the new comer Tall Arabs were there nude under woollen blankets little Moors in tatters Negroes Tunisians Port Mahonese M zabites hotel servants in white aprons all yelling and shouting hooking on his clothes fighting over his luggage one carrying away the provender another his medicine chest and pelting him in one fantastic medley with the names of preposterously entitled hotels Bewildered by all this tumult poor Tartarin wandered to and fro swore and stormed went mad ran after his property and not knowing how to make these barbarians understand him speechified them in French Provencal and even in dog Latin Rosa the rose bonus bona bonum all that he knew but to no purpose He was not heeded Happily like a god in Homer intervened a little fellow in a yellow collared tunic and armed with a long running footman s cane who dispersed the whole riff raff with cudgel play He was a policeman of the Algerian capital Very politely he suggested Tartarin should put up at the Hotel de l Europe and he confided him to its waiters who carted him and his impedimenta thither in several barrows At the first steps he took in Algiers Tartarin of Tarascon opened his eyes widely Beforehand he had pictured it as an Oriental city a fairy one mythological something between Constantinople and Zanzibar but it was back into Tarascon he fell Cafes restaurants wide streets four storey houses a little market place macadamised where the infantry band played Offenbachian polkas whilst fashionably clad gentlemen occupied chairs drinking beer and eating pancakes some brilliant ladies some shady ones and soldiers more soldiers no end of soldiers but not a solitary Turk or better to say there was a solitary Turk and that was he Hence he felt a little abashed about crossing the square for everybody looked at him The musicians stopped the Offenbachian polka halting with one foot in the air With both guns on his shoulders and the revolver flapping on his hip as fierce and stately as Robinson Crusoe Tartarin gravely passed through the groups but on arriving at the hotel his powers failed him All spun and mingled in his head the departure from Tarascon the harbour of Marseilles the voyage the Montenegrin prince the corsairs They had to help him up into a room and disarm and undress him They began to talk of sending for a medical adviser but hardly was our hero s head upon the pillow than he set to snoring so loudly and so heartily that the landlord judged the succour of science useless and everybody considerately withdrew IV The First Lying in Wait THREE o clock was striking by the Government clock when Tartarin awoke He had slept all the evening night and morning and even a goodish piece of the afternoon It must be granted though that in the last three days the red fez had caught it pretty hot and lively Our hero s first thought on opening his eyes was I am in the land of the lions And well why should we not say it at the idea that lions were nigh hereabouts within a couple of steps almost at hand s reach and that he would have to disentangle a snarled skein with them ugh a deadly chill struck him and he dived intrepidly under the coverlet But before a moment was over the outward gaiety the blue sky the glowing sun that streamed into the bedchamber a nice little breakfast that he ate in bed his window wide open upon the sea the whole flavoured with an uncommonly good bottle of Crescia wine it very speedily restored him his former pluckiness Let s out and at the lion he exclaimed throwing off the clothes and briskly dressing himself His plan was as follows he would go forth from the city without saying a word to a soul plunge into the great desert await nightfall to ambush himself and bang away at the first lion who walked up Then would he return to breakfast in the morning at the hotel receive the felicitations of the natives and hire a cart to bring in the quarry So he hurriedly armed himself attached upright on his back the shelter tent which when rolled up left its centre pole sticking out a clear foot above his head and descended to the street as stiffly as though he had swallowed it Not caring to ask the way of anybody from fear of letting out his project he turned fairly to the right and threaded the Bab Azoon arcade to the very end where swarms of Algerian Jews watched him pass from their corner ambushes like so many spiders crossing the Theatre place he entered the outer ward and lastly came upon the dusty Mustapha highway Upon this was a quaint conglomeration omnibuses hackney coaches corricolos the army service waggons huge hay carts drawn by bullocks squads of Chasseurs d Afrique droves of microscopic asses trucks of Alsatian emigrants spahis in scarlet cloaks all filed by in a whirlwind cloud of dust amidst shouts songs and trumpetcalls between two rows of vile looking booths at the doors of which lanky Mahonnais women might be seen doing their hair drinking dens filled with soldiers and shops of butchers and knackers What rubbish to din me about the Orient grumbled the great Tartarin there are not even as many Turks here as at Marseilles All of a sudden he saw a splendid camel strut by him quite closely stretching its long legs and puffing out its throat like a turkey cock and that made his heart throb Camels already eh Lions could not be far Off now and indeed in five minutes time he did see a whole band of lion hunters coming his way under arms Cowards thought our hero as he skirted them downright cowards to go at a lion in companies and with dogs For it never could occur to him that anything but lions were objects of the chase in Algeria For all that these Nimrods wore such complacent phizzes of retired tradesmen and their style of lion hunting with dogs and game bags was so patriarchal that the Tarasconian a little perplexed deemed it incumbent to question one of the gentlemen And furthermore comrade is the sport good Not bad responded the other regarding the speaker s imposing warlike equipment with a scared eye Killed any Rather Not so bad only look Whereupon the Algerian sportsman showed that it was rabbits and woodcock stuffing out the bag What do you call that your bag Do you put such like in your bag Where else should I put em But it s such little game Some run small and some run large observed the hunter In haste to catch up with his companions he joined them with several long strides The dauntless Tartarin remained rooted in the middle of the road with stupefaction Pooh he ejaculated after a moment s reflection these are jokers They haven t killed anything whatever and he went his way Already the houses became scarcer and so did the passengers Dark came on and objects were blurred though Tartarin walked on for half an hour more when he stopped for it was night A moonless night too but sprinkled with stars On the highroad there was nobody The hero concluded that lions are not stage coaches and would not of their own choice travel the main ways So he wheeled into the fields where there were brambles and ditches and bushes at every step but he kept on nevertheless But suddenly he halted I smell lions about here said our friend sniffing right and left V Bang bang CERTAINLY a great wilderness bristling with odd plants of that Oriental kind which look like wicked creatures Under the feeble starlight their magnified shadows barred the ground in every way On the right loomed up confusedly the heavy mass of a mountain perhaps the Atlas range On the heart hand the invisible sea hollowly rolling The very spot to attract wild beasts With one gun laid before him and the other in his grasp Tartarin of Tarascon went down on one knee and waited an hour ay a good couple and nothing turned up Then he bethought him how in his books the great lion slayers never went out hunting without having a lamb or a kid along with them which they tied up a space before them and set bleating or baa ing by jerking its foot with a string Not having any goat the Tarasconer had the idea of employing an imitation and he set to crying in a tremulous voice Baa a a At first it was done very softly because at bottom he was a little alarmed lest the lion should hear him but as nothing came he baa ed more loudly Still nothing Losing patience he resumed many times running at the top of his voice till the Baa baa baa came out with so much power that the goat began to be mistakable for a bull Unexpectedly a few steps in front some gigantic black thing appeared He was hushed This thing lowered its head sniffed the ground bounded up rolled over and darted off at the gallop but returned and stopped short Who could doubt it was the lion for now its four short legs could plainly be seen its formidable mane and its large eyes gleaming in the gloom Up went his gun into position Fire s the word and bang bang it was done And immediately there was a leap back and the drawing of the hunting knife To the Tarasconian s shot a terrible roaring replied He s got it cried our good Tartarin as steadying himself on his sturdy supporters he prepared to receive the brute s charge But it had more than its fill and galloped off howling He did not budge for he expected to see the female mate appear as the story books always lay it down she should Unhappily no female came After two or three hours waiting the Tarasconian grew tired The ground was damp the night was getting cool and the sea breeze pricked sharply I have a good mind to take a nap till daylight he said to himself To avoid catching rheumatism he had recourse to his patent tent But here s where Old Nick interfered This tent was of so very ingenious a construction that he could not manage to open it In vain did he toil over it and perspire an hour through the confounded apparatus would not come unfolded There are some umbrellas which amuse themselves under torrential rains with just such tricks upon you Fairly tired out with the struggle the victim dashed down the machine and lay upon it swearing like the regular Southron he was Tar tar rar tar tar rar tar What on earth s that wondered Tartarin suddenly aroused It was the bugles of the Chasseurs d Afrique sounding the turn out in the Mustapha barracks The stupefied lion slayer rubbed his eyes for he had believed himself out in the boundless wilderness and do you know where he really was in a field of artichokes between a cabbage garden and a patch of beets His Sahara grew kitchen vegetables Close to him on the pretty verdant slope of Upper Mustapha the snowy villas glowed in the rosy rising sun anybody would believe himself in the neighbourhood of Marseilles amongst its bastides and bastidons The commonplace and kitchen gardenish aspect of this sleep steeped country much astonished the poor man and put him in bad humour These folk are crazy he reasoned to plant artichokes in the prowling ground of lions for in short I have not been dreaming Lions have come here and there s the proof What he called the proof was blood spots left behind the beast in its flight Bending over this ruddy trail with his eye on the lookout and his revolver in his fist the valiant Tarasconian went from artichoke to artichoke up to a little field of oats In the trampled grass was a pool of blood and in the midst of the pool lying on its flank with a large wound in the head was a guess what A lion of course Not a bit of it An ass one of those little donkeys so common in Algeria where they are called bourriquots VI Arrival of the Female A Terrible Combat Game Fellows Meet Here LOOKING on his hapless victim Tartarin s first impulse was one of vexation There is such a wide gap between a lion and poor Jack His second feeling was one of pity The poor bourriquot was so pretty and looked so kindly The hide on his still warm sides heaved and fell like waves Tartarin knelt down and strove with the end of his Algerian sash to stanch the blood and all you can imagine in the way of touchingness was offered by the picture of this great man tending this little ass At the touch of the silky cloth the donkey who had not twopennyworth of life in him opened his large grey eye and winked his long ears two or three times as much as to say Oh thank you before a final spasm shook it from head to tail whereafter it stirred no more Noiraud Blackey suddenly screamed a voice choking with anguish as the branches in a thicket hard by moved at the same time Tartarin had no more than enough time to rise and stand upon guard This was the female She rushed up fearsome and roaring under form of an old Alsatian woman her hair in a kerchief armed with large red umbrella and calling for her ass till all the echoes of Mustapha rang It certainly would have been better for Tartarin to have had to deal with a lioness in fury than this old virago In vain did the luckless sportsman try to make her understand how the blunder had occurred and he had mistaken Noiraud for a lion The harridan believed he was making fun of her and uttering energetical Der Teufels fell upon our hero to bang him with the gingham A little bewildered Tartarin defended himself as best he could warding off the blows with his rifle streaming with perspiration panting jumping about and crying out But Madame but Much good his buts were Madame was dull of hearing and her blows continued hard as ever Fortunately a third party arrived on the battlefield the Alsatian s husband of the same race a roadside innkeeper as well as a very good ready reckoner which was better When he saw what kind of a customer he had to deal with a slaughterer who only wanted to pay the value of his victim he disarmed his better half and they came to an understanding Tartarin gave two hundred francs the donkey being worth about ten at least that is the current price in the Arab markets Then poor Blackey was laid to rest at the root of a fig tree and the Alsatian raised to joviality by the colour of the Tarascon ducats invited the hero to have a quencher with him in his wine shop which stood only a few steps off on the edge of the highway Every Sunday the sportsmen from the city came there to regale of a morning for the plain abounded with game and there was no better place for rabbits for two leagues around How about lions inquired Tartarin The Alsatian stared at him greatly astounded Lions Yes lions Don t you see them sometimes resumed the poor fellow with less confidence The Boniface burst out in laughter Ho ho bless us lions What would we do with lions here Are there then none in Algeria Pon my faith I never saw any albeit I have been twenty years in the colony Still I believe I have heard tell of such a thing leastwise I fancy the newspapers said but that is ever so much farther inland down South you know At this point they reached the hostelry a suburban pothouse with a withered green bough over the door crossed billiard cues painted on the wall and this harmless sign over a picture of wild rabbits feeding GAME FELLOWS MEET HERE Game fellows It made Tartarin think of Captain Bravida VII About an Omnibus a Moorish Beauty and a Wreath of Jessamine COMMON people would have been discouraged by such a first adventure but men of Tartarin s mettle do not easily get cast down The lions are in the South are they mused the hero Very well then South I go As soon as he had swallowed his last mouthful he jumped up thanked his host nodded good bye to the old hag without any ill will dropped a final tear over the hapless Blackey and quickly returned to Algiers with the firm intention of packing up and starting that very day for the South The Mustapha highroad seemed unfortunately to have stretched since overnight and what a sun and dust there were and what a weight in that shelter tent Tartarin did not feel to have the courage to walk to the town and he beckoned to the first omnibus coming along and climbed in Oh our poor Tartarin of Tarascon how much better it would have been for his name and fame not to have stepped into that fatal ark on wheels but to have continued on his road afoot at the risk of falling suffocated beneath the burden of the atmosphere the tent and his heavy double barrelled rifles When Tartarin got in the bus was full At the end with his nose in his prayer book sat a large and black bearded vicar from town facing him was a young Moorish merchant smoking coarse cigarettes and a Maltese sailor and four or five Moorish women muffled up in white cloths so that only their eyes could be spied These ladies had been to offer up prayers in the Abdel Kader cemetery but this funereal visit did not seem to have much saddened them for they could be heard chuckling and chattering between themselves under their coverings whilst munching pastry Tartarin fancied that they watched him narrowly One in particular seated over against him had fixed her eyes upon his and never took them off all the drive Although the dame was veiled the liveliness of the big black eyes lengthened out by k hol a delightfully slender wrist loaded with gold bracelets of which a glimpse was given from time to time among the folds the sound of her voice the graceful almost childlike movements of the head all revealed that a young pretty and loveable creature bloomed underneath the veil The unfortunate Tartarin did not know where to shrink The fond mute gaze of these splendrous Oriental orbs agitated him perturbed him and made him feel like dying with flushes of heat and fits of cold shivers To finish him the lady s slipper meddled in the onslaught he felt the dainty thing wander and frisk about over his heavy hunting boots like a tiny red mouse What could he do Answer the glance and the pressure of course Ay but what about the consequences A loving intrigue in the East is a terrible matter With his romantic southern nature the honest Tarasconian saw himself already falling into the grip of the eunuchs to be decapitated or better we mean worse than that sewn up in a leather sack and sunk in the sea with his head under his arm beside him This somewhat cooled him In the meantime the little slipper continued its proceedings and the eyes widely open opposite him like twin black velvet flowers seemed to say Come cull us The bus stopped on the Theatre place at the mouth of the Rue Bab Azoon One by one embedded in their voluminous trousers and drawing their mufflers around them with wild grace the Moorish women alighted Tartarin s confrontatress was the last to rise and in doing so her countenance skimmed so closely to our hero s that her breath enveloped him a veritable nosegay of youth and freshness with an indescribable after tang of musk jessamine and pastry The Tarasconian stood out no longer Intoxicated with love and ready for anything he darted out after the beauty At the rumpling sound of his belts and boots she turned laid a finger on her veiled mouth as one who would say Hush and with the other hand quickly tossed him a little wreath of sweet scented jessamine flowers Tartarin of Tarascon stooped to pick it up but as he was rather clumsy and much overburdened with implements of war the operation took rather long When he did straighten up with the jessamine garland upon his heart the donatrix had vanished VIII Ye Lions of the Atlas repose in peace LIONS of the Atlas sleep sleep tranquilly at the back of your lairs amid the aloes and cacti For a few days to come any way Tartarin of Tarascon will not massacre you For the time being all his warlike paraphernalia gun cases medicine chest alimentary preserves dwelt peacefully under cover in a corner of room thirty six in the Hotel de l Europe Sleep with no fear great red lions the Tarasconian is engaged in looking up that Moorish charmer Since the adventure in the omnibus the unfortunate swain perpetually fancied he felt the fidgeting of that pretty red mouse upon his huge backwoods trapper s foot and the sea breeze fanning his lips was ever scented do what he would with a love exciting odour of sweet cakes and patchouli He hungered for his indispensable light of the harem and he meant to behold her anew But it was no joke of a task To find one certain person in a city of a hundred thousand souls only known by the eyes breath and slipper none but a son of Tarascon panoplied by love would be capable of attempting such an adventure The plague is that under their broad white mufflers all the Moorish women resemble one another besides they do not go about much and to see them a man has to climb up into the native or upper town the city of the Turks and that is a regular cut throat s den Little black alleys very narrow climbing perpendicularly up between mysterious house walls whose roofs lean to touching and form a tunnel low doors and sad silent little casements well barred and grated Moreover on both hands stacks of darksome stalls wherein ferocious Turks smoked long pipes stuck between glittering teeth in piratical heads with white eyes and mumbled in undertones as if hatching wicked attacks To say that Tartarin traversed this grisly place without any emotion would be putting forth falsehood On the contrary he was much affected and the stout fellow only went up the obscure lanes where his corporation took up all the width with the utmost precaution his eye skinned and his finger on his revolver trigger in the same manner as he went to the clubhouse at Tarascon At any moment he expected to have a whole gang of eunuchs and janissaries drop upon his back yet the longing to behold that dark damsel again gave him a giant s strength and boldness For a full week the undaunted Tartarin never quitted the high town Yes for all that period he might have been seen cooling his heels before the Turkish bath houses awaiting the hour when the ladies came forth in troops shivering and still redolent of soap and hot water or squatting at the doorways of mosques puffing and melting in trying to get out of his big boots in order to enter the temples Betimes at nightfall when he was returning heart broken at not having discovered anything at either bagnio or mosque our man from Tarascon in passing mansions would hear monotonous songs smothered twanging of guitars thumping of tambourines and feminine laughter peals which would make his heart beat Haply she is there he would say to himself Thereupon granting the street was unpeopled he would go up to one of these dwellings lift the heavy knocker of the low postern and timidly rap The songs and merriment would instantly cease There would be audible behind the wall nothing excepting low dull flutterings as in a slumbering aviary Let s stick to it old boy our hero would think Something will befall us yet What most often befell him was the contents of the cold water jug on the head or else peel of oranges and Barbary figs never anything more serious Well might the lions of the Atlas Mountains doze in peace IX Prince Gregory of Montenegro IT was two long weeks that the unfortunate Tartarin had been seeking his Algerian flame and most likely he would have been seeking after her to this day if the little god kind to lovers had not come to his help under the shape of a Montenegrin nobleman It happened as follows Every Saturday night in winter there is a masked ball at the Grand Theatre of Algiers just as at the Paris Opera House It is the undying and ever tasteless county fancy dress ball very few people on the floor several castaways from the Parisian students ballrooms or midnight dance houses Joans of Arc following the army faded characters out of the Java costume book of eighteen forty and half a dozen laundress s underlings who are aiming to make loftier conquests but still preserve a faint perfume of their former life garlic and saffron sauce The real spectacle is not there but in the green room transformed for the nonce into a hall of green cloth or gaming saloon An enfevered and motley mob hustle one another around the long green table covers Turcos out for the day and staking their double halfpence Moorish traders from the native town Negroes Maltese colonists from the inland who have come forty leagues in order to risk on a turning card the price of a plough or of a yoke of oxen all a quivering pale clenching their teeth and with that singular wavering sidelong look of the gamester become a squint from always staring at the same card in the lay out A little apart are the tribes of Algerian Jews playing among acquaintances The men are in the Oriental costume hideously varied with blue stockings and velvet caps The puffy and flabby women sit up stiffly in tight golden bodices Grouped around the tables the whole tribe wail squeal combine reckon on the fingers and play but little Now and anon however after long conferences some old patriarch with a beard like those of saints by the Old Masters detaches himself from the party and goes to risk the family duro As long as the game lasted there would be a scintillation of Hebraic eyes directed on the board dreadful black diamonds which made the gold pieces shiver and ended by gently attracting them as if drawn by a thread Then arose wrangles quarrels battles oaths of every land mad outcries in all tongues knives flashing out the guard marching in and the money disappearing It was into the thick of this saturnalia that the great Tartarin came straying one evening to find oblivion and heart s ease He was roving alone through the gathering brooding about his Moorish beauty when two angered voices arose suddenly from a gaming table above all the clamour and chink of coin I tell you M sieu that I am twenty francs short Stuff M sieu Stuff yourself M sieu You shall learn whom you are addressing M sieu I am dying to do that M sieu I am Prince Gregory of Montenegro M sieu Upon this title Tartarin much excited cleft the throng and placed himself in the foremost rank proud and happy to find his prince again the Montenegrin noble of such politeness whose acquaintance he had begun on board of the mail steamer Unfortunately the title of Highness which had so dazzled the worthy Tarasconian did not produce the slightest impression upon the Chasseurs officer with whom the noble had his dispute I am much the wiser observed the military gentleman sneeringly and turning to the bystanders he added Prince Gregory of Montenegro who knows any such a person Nobody The indignant Tartarin took one step forward Allow me I know the prince said he in a very firm voice and with his finest Tarasconian accent The light cavalry officer eyed him hard for a moment and then shrugging his shoulders returned Come that is good Just you two share the twenty francs lacking between you and let us talk no more on the score Whereupon he turned his back upon them and mixed with the crowd The stormy Tartarin was going to rush after him but the prince prevented that Let him go I can manage my own affairs Taking the interventionist by the arm he drew him rapidly out of doors When they were upon the square Prince Gregory of Montenegro lifted his hat off extended his hand to our hero and as he but dimly remembered his name he began in a vibrating voice Monsieur Barbarin Tartarin prompted the other timidly Tartarin Barbarin no matter Between us henceforward it is a league of life and death The Montenegrin noble shook his hand with fierce energy You may infer that the Tarasconian was proud Prince prince he repeated enthusiastically In a quarter of an hour subsequently the two gentlemen were installed in the Platanes Restaurant an agreeable late supper house with terraces running out over the sea where before a hearty Russian salad seconded by a nice Crescia wine they renewed the friendship You cannot image any one more bewitching than this Montenegrin prince Slender fine with crisp hair curled by the tongs shaved a week under and pumice stoned on that bestarred with out of the way decorations he had the wily eye the fondling gestures and vaguely the accent of an Italian which gave him an air of Cardinal Mazarin without his chin tuft and moustaches He was deeply versed in the Latin tongues and lugged in quotations from Tacitus Horace and Caesar s Commentaries at every opening Of an old noble strain it appeared that his brothers had had him exiled at the age of ten on account of his liberal opinions since which time he had roamed the world for pleasure and instruction as a philosophical noble A singular coincidence the prince had spent three years in Tarascon and as Tartarin showed amazement at never having met him at the club or on the esplanade His Highness evasively remarked that he never went about Through delicacy the Tarasconian did not dare to question further All great existences have such mysterious nooks To sum up this Signor Gregory was a very genial aristocrat Whilst sipping the rosy Crescia juice he patiently listened to Tartarin s expatiating on his lovely Moor and he even promised to find her speedily as he had full knowledge of the native ladies They drank hard and lengthily in toasts to The ladies of Algiers and The freedom of Montenegro Outside upon the terrace heaved the sea and its rollers slapped the strand in the darkness with much the sound of wet sails flapping The air was warm and the sky full of stars In the plane trees a nightingale was piping It was Tartarin who paid the piper X Tell me your father s name and I will tell you the name of that flower PRINCES of Montenegro are the ones to find the love bird On the morrow early after this evening at the Platanes Prince Gregory was in the Tarasconian s bedroom Quick Dress yourself quickly Your Moorish beauty is found Her name is Baya She s scarce twenty as pretty as a love and already a widow A widow What a slice of luck joyfully exclaimed Tartarin who dreaded Oriental husbands Ay but woefully closely guarded by her brother Oh the mischief A savage chap who vends pipes in the Orleans bazaar Here fell a silence A fig for that proceeded the prince you are not the man to be daunted by such a trifle and anyhow this old corsair can be pacified I daresay by having some pipes bought of him But be quick On with your courting suit you lucky dog Pale and agitated with his heart brimming over with love the Tarasconian leaped out of his couch and as he hastily buttoned up his capacious nether garment wanted to know how he should act Write straightway to the lady and ask for a tryst Do you mean to say she knows French queried the Tarasconian simpleton with the disappointed mien of one who had believed thoroughly in the Orient Not one word of it rejoined the prince imperturbably but you can dictate the billet doux and I will translate it bit by bit O prince how kind you are The lover began striding up and down the bedroom in silent meditation Naturally a man does not write to a Moorish girl in Algiers in the same way as to a seamstress of Beaucaire It was a very lucky thing that our hero had in mind his numerous readings which allowed him by amalgamating the Red Indian eloquence of Gustave Aimard s Apaches with Lamartine s rhetorical flourishes in the Voyage en Orient and some reminiscences of the Song of Songs to compose the most Eastern letter that you could expect to see It opened with Like unto the ostrich upon the sandy waste and concluded by Tell me your father s name and I will tell you the name of that flower To this missive the romantic Tartarin would have much liked to join an emblematic bouquet of flowers in the Eastern fashion but Prince Gregory thought it better to purchase some pipes at the brother s which could not fail to soften his wild temper and would certainly please the lady a very great deal as she was much of a smoker Let s be off at once to buy them said Tartarin full of ardour No no Let me go alone I can get them cheaper Eh what Would you save me the trouble O prince prince you do me proud Quite abashed the good hearted fellow offered his purse to the obliging Montenegrin urging him to overlook nothing by which the lady would be gratified Unfortunately the suit albeit capitally commenced did not progress as rapidly as might have been anticipated It appeared that the Moorish beauty was very deeply affected by Tartarin s eloquence and for that matter three parts won beforehand so that she wished nothing better than to receive him but that brother of hers had qualms and to lull them it was necessary to buy pipes by the dozens nay the gross well we had best say by the shipload at once What the plague can Baya do with all these pipes poor Tartarin wanted to know more than once but he paid the bills all the same and without niggardliness At length after having purchased a mountainous stack of pipes and poured forth lakes of Oriental poesy an interview was arranged I have no need to tell you with what throbbings of the heart the Tarasconian prepared himself with what carefulness he trimmed brilliantined and perfumed his rough cap popper s beard and how he did not forget for everything must be thought of to slip a spiky life preserver and two or three six shooters into his pockets The ever obliging prince was coming to this first meeting in the office of interpreter The lady dwelt in the upper part of the town Before her doorway a boy Moor of fourteen or less was smoking cigarettes this was the brother in question the celebrated Ali On seeing the pair of visitors arrive he gave a double knock on the postern gate and delicately glided away The door opened A negress appeared who conducted the gentlemen without uttering a word across the narrow inner courtyard into a small cool room where the lady awaited them reclining on a low ottoman At first glance she appeared smaller and stouter than the Moorish damsel met in the omnibus by the Tarasconian In fact was it really the same But the doubt merely flashed through Tartarin s brain like a stroke of lightning The dame was so pretty thus with her feet bare and plump fingers fine and pink loaded with rings Under her bodice of gilded cloth and the folds of her flower patterned dress was suggested a lovable creature rather blessed materially rounded everywhere and nice enough to eat The amber mouthpiece of a narghileh smoked at her lips and enveloped her wholly in a halo of light coloured smoke On entering the Tarasconian laid a hand on his heart and bowed as Moorlike as possible whilst rolling his large impassioned eyes Baya gazed on him for a moment without making any answer but then dropping her pipe stem she threw her head back hid it in her hands and they could only see her white neck rippling with a wild laugh like a bag full of pearls XI Sidi Tart ri Ben Tart ri SHOULD you ever drop into the coffee houses of the Algerian upper town after dark even at this day you would still hear the natives chatting among themselves with many a wink and slight laugh of one Sidi Tart ri Ben Tart ri a rich and good humoured European who dwelt a few years back in that neighbourhood with a buxom witch of local origin named Baya This Sidi Tart ri who has left such a merry memory around the Kasbah is no other than our Tartarin as will be guessed How could you expect things otherwise In the lives of heroes of saints too it happens the same way there are moments of blindness perturbation and weakness The illustrious Tarasconian was no more exempt from this than another and that is the reason during two months that oblivious of fame and lions he revelled in Oriental amorousness and dozed like Hannibal at Capua in the delights of Algiers the white The good fellow took a pretty little house in the native style in the heart of the Arab town with inner courtyard banana trees cool verandahs and fountains He dwelt afar from noise in company with the Moorish charmer a thorough woman to the manner born who pulled at her hubble bubble all day when she was not eating Stretched out on a divan in front of him Baya would drone him monotonous tunes with a guitar in her fist or else to distract her lord and master favour him with the Bee Dance holding a hand glass up in which she reflected her white teeth and the faces she made As the Esmeralda did not know a word of French and Tartarin none in Arabic the conversation died away sometimes and the Tarasconian had plenty of leisure to do penance for the gush of language of which he had been guilty in the shop of Bezuquet the chemist or that of Costecalde the gunmaker But this penance was not devoid of charm for he felt a kind of enjoyable sullenness in dawdling away the whole day without speaking and in listening to the gurgling of the hookah the strumming of the guitar and the faint splashing of the fountain on the mosaic pavement of the yard The pipe the bath and caresses filled his entire life They seldom went out of doors Sometimes with his lady love upon a pillion Sidi Tart ri would ride upon a sturdy mule to eat pomegranates in a little garden he had purchased in the suburbs But never without exception did he go down into the European quarter This kind of Algiers appeared to him as ugly and unbearable as a barracks at home with its Zouaves in revelry its music halls crammed with officers and its everlasting clank of metal sabre sheaths under the arcades The sum total is that our Tarasconian was very happy Sancho Tartarin particularly being very sweet upon Turkish pastry declared that one could not be more satisfied than by this new existence Quixote Tartarin had some twinges at whiles on thinking of Tarascon and the promises of lion skins but this remorse did not last and to drive away such dampening ideas there sufficed one glance from Baya or a spoonful of those diabolical dizzying and odoriferous sweetmeats like Circe s brews In the evening Gregory came to discourse a little about a free Black Mountain Of indefatigable obligingness this amiable nobleman filled the functions of an interpreter in the household or those of a steward at a pinch and all for nothing for the sheer pleasure of it Apart from him Tartarin received none but Turks All those fierce headed pirates who had given him such frights from the backs of their black stalls turned out when once he made their acquaintance to be good inoffensive tradesmen embroiderers dealers in spice pipe mouthpiece turners well bred fellows humble clever close and first class hands at homely card games Four or five times a week these gentry would come and spend the evening at Sidi Tart ri s winning his small change eating his cakes and dainties and delicately retiring on the stroke of ten with thanks to the Prophet Left alone Sidi Tart ri and his faithful spouse by the broomstick wedding would finish the evening on their terrace a broad white roof which overlooked the city All around them a thousand of other such white flats placid beneath the moonshine were descending like steps to the sea The breeze carried up tinkling of guitars Suddenly like a shower of firework stars a full clear melody would be softly sprinkled out from the sky and on the minaret of the neighbouring mosque a handsome muezzin would appear his blanched form outlined on the deep blue of the night as he chanted the glory of Allah with a marvellous voice which filled the horizon Thereupon Baya would let go her guitar and with her large eyes turned towards the crier seem to imbibe the prayer deliciously As long as the chant endured she would remain thrilled there in ecstasy like an Oriental saint The deeply impressed Tartarin would watch her pray and conclude that it must be a splendid and powerful creed that could cause such frenzies of faith Tarascon veil thy face here is a son of thine on the point of becoming a renegade XII The Latest Intelligence from Tarascon PARTING from his little country seat Sidi Tart ri was returning alone on his mule on a fine afternoon when the sky was blue and the zephyrs warm His legs were kept wide apart by ample saddle bags of esparto cloth swelled out with cedrats and water melons Lulled by the ring of his large stirrups and rocking his body to the swing and swaying of the beast the good fellow was thus traversing an adorable country with his hands folded on his paunch three quarters gone through heat in a comfortable doze All at once on entering the town a deafening appeal aroused him Ahoy What a monster Fate is Anybody d take this for Monsieur Tartarin On this name and at the jolly southern accent the Tarasconian lifted his head and perceived a couple of steps away the honest tanned visage of Captain Barbassou master of the Zouave who was taking his absinthe at the door of a little coffee house Hey Lord love you Barbassou said Tartarin pulling up his mule Instead of continuing the dialogue Barbassou stared at him for a space ere he burst into a peal of such hilarity that Sidi Tart ri sat back dumbfounded on his melons What a stunning turban my poor Monsieur Tartarin Is it true what they say of your having turned Turk How is little Baya Is she still singing Marco la Bella Marco la Bella repeated the indignant Tartarin I ll have you to know captain that the person you mention is an honourable Moorish lady and one who does not know a word of French Baya does not know French What lunatic asylum do you hail from then The good captain broke into still heartier laughter but seeing the chops of poor Sidi Tart ri fall he changed his course Howsoever may happen it is not the same lass Let s reckon that I have mixed em up Still mark you Monsieur Tartarin you will do well nonetheless to distrust Algerian Moors and Montenegrin princes Tartarin rose in the stirrups making a wry face The prince is my friend captain Come come don t wax wrathy Won t you have some bitters to sweeten you No Haven t you anything to say to the folks at home neither Well then a pleasant journey By the way mate I have some good French bacco upon me and if you would like to carry away a few pipefuls you have only to take some Take it won t you It s your beastly Oriental baccoes that have befogged your brain Upon this the captain went back to his absinthe whilst the moody Tartarin trotted slowly on the road to his little house Although his great soul refused to credit anything Barbassou s insinuations had vexed him and the familiar adjurations and home accent had awakened vague remorse He found nobody at home Baya having gone out to the bath The negress appeared sinister and the dwelling saddening A prey to inexpressible melancholy he went and sat down by the fountain to load a pipe with Barbassou s tobacco It was wrapped up in a piece of the Marseilles Semaphore newspaper On flattening it out the name of his native place struck his eyes Our Tarascon correspondent writes The city is in distress There has been no news for several months from Tartarin the lion slayer who set off to hunt the great feline tribe in Africa What can have become of our heroic fellow countryman Those hardly dare ask who know as we do how hot headed he was and what boldness and thirst for adventures were his Has he like many others been smothered in the sands or has he fallen under the murderous fangs of one of those monsters of the Atlas Range of which he had promised the skins to the municipality What a dreadful state of uncertainty It is true some Negro traders come to Beaucaire Fair assert having met in the middle of the deserts a European whose description agreed with his he was proceeding towards Timbuctoo May Heaven preserve our Tartarin When he read this the son of Tarascon reddened blanched and shuddered All Tarascon appeared unto him the club the cap poppers Costecalde s green arm chair and hovering over all like a spread eagle the imposing moustaches of brave Commandant Bravida At seeing himself here as he was cowardly lolling on a mat whilst his friends believed him slaughtering wild beasts Tartarin of Tarascon was ashamed of himself and could have wept had he not been a hero Suddenly he leaped up and thundered The lion the lion Down with him And dashing into the dusty lumber hole where mouldered the shelter tent the medicine chest the potted meats and the gun cases he dragged them out into the middle of the court Sancho Tartarin was no more Quixote Tartarin occupied the field of active life Only the time to inspect his armament and stores don his harness get into his heavy boots scribble a couple of words to confide Baya to the prince and slip a few bank notes sprinkled with tears into the envelope and then the dauntless Tarasconian rolled away in the stage coach on the Blidah road leaving the house to the negress stupor stricken before the pipe the turban and babooshes all the Moslem shell of Sidi Tart ri which sprawled piteously under the little white trefoils of the gallery EPISODE THE THIRD AMONG THE LIONS I What becomes of the Old Stage coaches COME to look closely at the vehicle it was an old stage coach all of the olden time upholstered in faded deep blue cloth with those enormous rough woollen balls which after a few hours journey finally establish a raw spot in the small of your back Tartarin of Tarascon had a corner of the inside where he installed himself most free and easily and preliminarily to inspiring the rank emanations of the great African felines the hero had to content himself with that homely old odour of the stage coach oddly composed of a thousand smells of man and woman horses and harness eatables and mildewed straw There was a little of everything inside a Trappist monk some Jew merchants two fast ladies going to join their regiment the Third Hussars a photographic artist from Orleansville and so on But however charming and varied was the company the Tarasconian was not in the mood for chatting he remained quite thoughtful with an arm in the arm rest sling strap and his guns between his knees All churned up his wits the precipitate departure Baya s eyes of jet the terrible chase he was about to undertake to say nothing of this European coach with its Noah s Ark aspect rediscovered in the heart of Africa vaguely recalling the Tarascon of his youth with its races in the suburbs jolly dinners on the river side a throng of memories in short Gradually night came on The guard lit up the lamps The rusty diligence danced creakingly on its old springs the horses trotted and their bells jangled From time to time in the boot arose a dreadful clank of iron that was the war material Tartarin of Tarascon nearly overcome dwelt a moment scanning the fellow passengers comically shaken by the jolts and dancing before him like the shadows in galanty shows till his eyes grew cloudy and his mind befogged and only vaguely he heard the wheels grind and the sides of the conveyance squeak complainingly Suddenly a voice called Tartarin by his name the voice of an old fairy godmother hoarse broken and cracked Monsieur Tartarin three times Who s calling me It s I Monsieur Tartarin Don t you recognise me I am the old stage coach who used to do the road betwixt Nimes and Tarascon twenty year agone How many times I have carried you and your friends when you went to shoot at caps over Joncquieres or Bellegarde way I did not know you again at the first on account of your Turk s cap and the flesh you have accumulated but as soon as you began snoring what a rascal is good luck I twigged you straight away All right that s all right enough observed the Tarasconian a shade vexed but softening he added But to the point my poor old girl whatever did you come out here for Pooh my good Monsieur Tartarin I assure you I never came of my own free will As soon as the Beaucaire railway was finished I was considered good for nought and shipped away into Algeria And I am not the only one either Bless you next to all the old stage coaches of France have been packed off like me We were regarded as too much the conservative the slow coaches d ye see and now we are here leading the life of a dog This is what you in France call the Algerian railways Here the ancient vehicle heaved a long drawn sigh before proceeding My wheels and linchpin Monsieur Tartarin how I regret my lovely Tarascon That was the good time for me when I was young You ought to have seen me starting off in the morning washed with no stint of water and all a shine with my wheels freshly varnished my lamps blazing like a brace of suns and my boot always rubbed up with oil It was indeed lovely when the postillion cracked his whip to the tune of Lagadigadeou the Tarasque the Tarasque and the guard his horn in its sling and laced cap cocked well over one ear chucking his little dog always in a fury upon the top climbed up himself with a shout Right away Then would my four horses dash off to the medley of bells barks and horn blasts and the windows fly open for all Tarascon to look with pride upon the royal mail coach dart over the king s highway What a splendid road that was Monsieur Tartarin broad and well kept with its mile stones its little heaps of road metal at regular distances and its pretty clumps of vines and olive trees on either hand Then again the roadside inns so close together and the changes of horses every five minutes And what jolly honest chaps my patrons were village mayors and parish priests going up to Nimes to see their prefect or bishop taffety weavers returning openly from the Mazet collegians out on holiday leave peasants in worked smock frocks all fresh shaven for the occasion that morning and up above on the top you gentlemen sportsmen always in high spirits and singing each your own family ballad to the stars as you came back in the dark Deary me it s a change of times now Lord knows what rubbish I am carting here come from nobody guesses where They fill me with small deer these negroes Bedouin Arabs swashbucklers adventurers from every land and ragged settlers who poison me with their pipes and all jabbering a language that the Tower of Babel itself could make nothing of And furthermore you should see how they treat me I mean how they never treat me never a brush or a wash They begrudge me grease for my axles Instead of my good fat quiet horses of other days little Arab ponies with the devil in their frames who fight and bite caper as they run like so many goats and break my splatterboard all to smithereens with their lashing out behind Ouch ouch there they are at it again And such roads Just here it is bearable because we are near the governmental headquarters but out a bit there s nothing Monsieur not the ghost of a road at all We get along as best we can over hill and dale over dwarf palms and mastic trees Ne er a fixed change of horses the stopping being at the whim of the guard now at one farm again at another Somewhiles this rogue goes a couple of leagues out of the way to have a glass of absinthe or champoreau with a chum After which Crack on postillion to make up for the lost time Though the sun be broiling and the dust scorching we whip on We catch in the scrub and spill over but whip on We swim rivers we catch cold we get swamped we drown but whip whip whip Then in the evening streaming a nice thing for my age with my rheumatics I have to sleep in the open air of some caravanseral yard open to all the winds In the dead o night jackals and hyaenas come sniffing of my body and the marauders who don t like dews get into my compartment to keep warm Such is the life I lead my poor Monsieur Tartarin and that I shall lead to the day when burnt up by the sun and rotted by the damp nights until unable to do anything else I shall fall in some spot of bad road where the Arabs will boil their kouskous with the bones of my old carcass Blidah Blidah called out the guard as he opened the door II A little gentleman drops in and drops upon Tartarin VAGUELY through the mud dimmed glass Tartarin of Tarascon caught a glimpse of a second rate but pretty town market place regular in shape surrounded by colonnades and planted with orange trees in the midst of which what seemed toy leaden soldiers were going through the morning exercise in the clear roseate mist The cafes were shedding their shutters In one corner there was a vegetable market It was bewitching but it did not smack of lions yet To the South farther to the South muttered the good old desperado sinking back in his corner At this moment the door opened A puff of fresh air rushed in bearing upon its wings in the perfume of the orange blossoms a little person in a brown frock coat old and dry wrinkled and formal his face no bigger than your fist his neckcloth of black silk five fingers wide a notary s letter case and umbrella the very picture of a village solicitor On perceiving the Tarasconian s warlike equipment the little gentleman who was seated over against him appeared excessively surprised and set to studying him with burdensome persistency The horses were taken out and the fresh ones put in whereupon the coach started off again The little weasel still gazed at Tartarin who in the end took snuff at it Does this astonish you he demanded staring the little gentleman full in the face in his turn Oh dear no it only annoys me responded the other very tranquilly And the fact is that with his shelter tent revolvers pair of guns in their cases and hunting knife not to speak of his natural corpulence Tartarin of Tarascon did take up a lot of room The little gentleman s reply angered him Do you by any chance fancy that I am going lion hunting with your umbrella queried the great man haughtily The little man looked at his umbrella smiled blandly and still with the same lack of emotion inquired Oho then you are Monsieur Tartarin of Tarascon lion killer In uttering these words the dauntless son of Tarascon shook the blue tassel of his fez like a mane Through the vehicle was a spell of stupefaction The Trappist brother crossed himself the dubious women uttered little screams of affright and the Orleansville photographer bent over towards the lion slayer already cherishing the unequalled honour of taking his likeness The little gentleman though was not awed Do you mean to say that you have killed many lions Monsieur Tartarin he asked very quietly The Tarasconian received his charge in the handsomest manner Is it many have I killed Monsieur I wish you had only as many hairs on your head as I have killed of them All the coach laughed on observing three yellow bristles standing up on the little gentleman s skull In his turn the Orleansville photographer struck in Yours must be a terrible profession Monsieur Tartarin You must pass some ugly moments sometimes I have heard that poor Monsieur Bombonnel Oh yes the panther killer said Tartarin rather disdainfully Do you happen to be acquainted with him inquired the insignificant person Eh of course Know him Why we have been out on the hunt over twenty times together The little gentleman smiled So you also hunt panthers Monsieur Tartarin he asked Sometimes just for pastime said the fiery Tarasconian But he added as he tossed his head with a heroic movement that inflamed the hearts of the two sweethearts of the regiment that s not worth lion hunting When all s said and done ventured the photographer a panther is nothing but a big cat Right you are said Tartarin not sorry to abate the celebrated Bombonnel s glory a little particularly in the presence of ladies Here the coach stopped The conductor came to open the door and addressed the insignificant little gentleman most respectfully saying We have arrived Monsieur The little gentleman got up stepped out and said before the door was closed again Will you allow me to give you a bit of advice Monsieur Tartarin What is it Monsieur Faith you wear the look of a good sort of fellow so I would rather than not let you have it Get you back quickly to Tarascon Monsieur Tartarin for you are wasting your time here There do remain a few panthers in the colony but out upon the big cats they are too small game for you As for lion hunting that s all over There are none left in Algeria my friend Chassaing having lately knocked over the last Upon which the little gentleman saluted closed the door and trotted away chuckling with his document wallet and umbrella Guard asked Tartarin screwing up his face contemptuously who under the sun is that poor little mannikin What don t you know him Why that there s Monsieur Bombonnel III A Monastery of Lions AT Milianah Tartarin of Tarascon alighted leaving the stage coach to continue its way towards the South Two days rough jolting two nights spent with eyes open to spy out of window if there were not discoverable the dread figure of a lion in the fields beyond the road so much sleeplessness well deserved some hours repose Besides if we must tell everything since his misadventure with Bombonnel the outspoken Tartarin felt ill at ease notwithstanding his weapons his terrifying visage and his red cap before the Orleansville photographer and the two ladies fond of the military So he proceeded through the broad streets of Milianah full of fine trees and fountains but whilst looking up a suitable hotel the poor fellow could not help musing over Bombonnel s words Suppose they were true Suppose there were no more lions in Algeria What would be the good then of so much running about and fatigue Suddenly at the turn of a street our hero found himself face to face with with what Guess A donkey of course A donkey A splendid lion this time waiting before a coffee house door royally sitting up on his hind quarters with his tawny mane gleaming in the sun What possessed them to tell me that there were no more of them exclaimed the Tarasconian as he made a backward jump On hearing this outcry the lion lowered his head and taking up in his mouth a wooden bowl that was before him on the footway humbly held it out towards Tartarin who was immovable with stupefaction A passing Arab tossed a copper into the bowl and the lion wagged his tail Thereupon Tartarin understood it all He saw what emotion had prevented him previously perceiving that the crowd was gathered around a poor tame blind lion and that two stalwart Negroes armed with staves were marching him through the town as a Savoyard does a marmot The blood of Tarascon boiled over at once Wretches that you are he roared in a voice of thunder thus to debase such noble beasts Springing to the lion he wrenched the loathsome bowl from between his royal jaws The two Africans believing they had a thief to contend with rushed upon the foreigner with uplifted cudgels There was a dreadful conflict the blackamoors smiting the women screaming and the youngsters laughing An old Jew cobbler bleated out of the hollow of his stall Dake him to the shustish of the beace The lion himself in his dark state tried to roar as his hapless champion after a desperate struggle rolled on the ground among the spilt pence and the sweepings At this juncture a man cleft the throng made the Negroes stand back with a word and the women and urchins with a wave of the hand lifted up Tartarin brushed him down shook him into shape and sat him breathless upon a corner post What prince is it you said the good Tartarin rubbing his ribs Yes indeed it is I my valiant friend As soon as your letter was received I entrusted Baya to her brother hired a post chaise flew fifty leagues as fast as a horse could go and here I am just in time to snatch you from the brutality of these ruffians What have you done in the name of just Heaven to bring this ugly trouble upon you What done prince It was too much for me to see this unfortunate lion with a begging bowl in his mouth humiliated conquered buffeted about set up as a laughing stock to all this Moslem rabble But you are wrong my noble friend On the contrary this lion is an object of respect and adoration This is a sacred beast who belongs to a great monastery of lions founded three hundred years ago by Mahomet Ben Aouda a kind of fierce and forbidding La Trappe full of roarings and wild beastly odours where strange monks rear and feed lions by hundreds and send them out all over Northern Africa accompanied by begging brothers The alms they receive serve for the maintenance of the monastery and its mosques and the two Negroes showed so much displeasure just now because it was their conviction that the lion under their charge would forthwith devour them if a single penny of their collection were lost or stolen through any fault of theirs On hearing this incredible and yet veracious story Tartarin of Tarascon was delighted and sniffed the air noisily What pleases me in this he remarked as the summing up of his opinion is that whether Monsieur Bombonnel likes it or not there are still lions in Algeria I should think there were ejaculated the prince enthusiastically We will start to morrow beating up the Shelliff Plain and you will see lions enough What prince have you an intention to go a hunting too Of course Do you think I am going to leave you to march by yourself into the heart of Africa in the midst of ferocious tribes of whose languages and usages you are ignorant No no illustrious Tartarin I shall quit you no more Go where you will I shall make one of the party O Prince prince The beaming Tartarin hugged the devoted Gregory to his breast at the proud thought of his going to have a foreign prince to accompany him in his hunting after the example of Jules Gerard Bombonnel and other famous lion slayers IV The Caravan on the March LEAVING Milianah at the earliest hour next morning the intrepid Tartarin and the no less intrepid Prince Gregory descended towards the Shelliff Plain through a delightful gorge shaded with jessamine carouba tuyas and wild olive trees between hedges of little native gardens and thousands of merry lively rills which scampered down from rock to rock with a singing splash a bit of landscape meet for the Lebanon As much loaded with arms as the great Tartarin Prince Gregory had over and above that donned a queer but magnificent military cap all covered with gold lace and a trimming of oak leaves in silver cord which gave His Highness the aspect of a Mexican general or a railway station master on the banks of the Danube This plague of a cap much puzzled the beholder and as he timidly craved some explanation the prince gravely answered It is a kind of headgear indispensable for travel in Algeria Whilst brightening up the peak with a sweep of his sleeve he instructed his simple companion in the important part which the military cap plays in the French connection with the Arabs and the terror this article of army insignia alone has the privilege of inspiring so that the Civil Service has been obliged to put all its employees in caps from the extra copyist to the receiver general To govern Algeria the prince is still speaking there is no need of a strong head or even of any head at all A military cap does it alone if showy and belaced and shining at the top of a non human pole like Gessler s Thus chatting and philosophising the caravan proceeded The barefooted porters leaped from rock to rock with ape like screams The guncases clanked and the guns themselves flashed The natives who were passing salaamed to the ground before the magic cap Up above on the ramparts of Milianah the head of the Arab Department who was out for an airing with his wife hearing these unusual noises and seeing the weapons gleam between the branches fancied there was a revolt and ordered the drawbridge to be raised the general alarm to be sounded and the whole town put under a state of siege A capital commencement for the caravan Unfortunately before the day ended things went wrong Of the black luggage bearers one was doubled up with atrocious colics from having eaten the diachylon out of the medicine chest another fell on the roadside dead drunk with camphorated brandy the third carrier of the travelling album deceived by the gilding on the clasps into the persuasion that he was flying with the treasures of Mecca ran off into the Zaccar on his best legs This required consideration The caravan halted and held a council in the broken shadow of an old fig tree It s my advice that we turn up Negro porters from this evening forward said the prince trying without success to melt a cake of compressed meat in an improved patent triple bottomed sauce pan There is haply an Arab trader quite near here The best thing to do is to stop there and buy some donkeys No no no donkeys quickly interrupted Tartarin becoming quite red at memory of Noiraud How can you expect he added hypocrite that he was that such little beasts could carry all our apparatus The prince smiled You are making a mistake my illustrious friend However weakly and meagre the Algerian bourriquot may appear to you he has solid loins He must have them so to support all that he does Just ask the Arabs Hark to how they explain the French colonial organisation On the top they say is Mossoo the Governor with a heavy club to rap the staff the staff for revenge canes the soldier the soldier clubs the settler and he hammers the Arab the Arab smites the Negro the Negro beats the Jew and he takes it out of the donkey The poor bourriquot having nobody to belabour arches up his back and bears it all You see clearly now that he can bear your boxes All the same remonstrated Tartarin it strikes me that jackasses will not chime in nicely with the effect of our caravan I want something more Oriental For instance if we could only get a camel As many as you like said His Highness and off they started for the Arab mart It was held a few miles away on the banks of the Shelliff There were five or six thousand Arabs in tatters here grovelling in the sunshine and noisily trafficking amid jars of black olives pots of honey bags of spices and great heaps of cigars huge fires were roasting whole sheep basted with butter in open air slaughter houses stark naked Negroes with ruddy arms and their feet in gore were cutting up kids hanging from crosspoles with small knives In one corner under a tent patched with a thousand colours a Moorish clerk of the market in spectacles scrawled in a large book Here was a cluster of men shouting with rage it was a spinning jenny game set on a corn measure and Kabyles were ready to cut one another s throats over it Yonder were laughs and contortions of delight it was a Jew trader on a mule drowning in the Shelliff Then there were dogs scorpions ravens and flies rather flies than anything else But a plentiful lack of camels abounded They finally unearthed one though of which the M zabites were trying to get rid the real ship of the desert the classical standard camel bald woe begone with a long Bedouin head and its hump become limp in consequence of unduly long fasts hanging melancholically on one side Tartarin considered it so handsome that he wanted the entire party to get upon it Still his Oriental craze The beast knelt down for them to strap on the boxes The prince enthroned himself on the animal s neck For the sake of the greater majesty Tartarin got them to hoist him on the top of the hump between two boxes where proud and cosily settled down he saluted the whole market with a lofty wave of the hand and gave the signal of departure Thunderation if the people of Tarascon could only have seen him The camel rose straightened up its long knotty legs and stepped out Oh stupor At the end of a few strides Tartarin felt he was losing colour and the heroic chechia assumed one by one its former positions in the days of sailing in the Zouave This devil s own camel pitched and tossed like a frigate Prince prince gasped Tartarin pallid as a ghost as he clung to the dry tuft of the hump prince let s get down I find I feel that I m m must get off or I shall disgrace France A deal of good that talk was the camel was on the go and nothing could stop it Behind it raced four thousand barefooted Arabs waving their hands and laughing like mad so that they made six hundred thousand white teeth glitter in the sun The great man of Tarascon had to resign himself to circumstances He sadly collapsed on the hump where the fez took all the positions it fancied and France was disgraced V The Night watch in a Poison tree Grove SWEETLY picturesque as was their new steed our lion hunters had to give it up purely out of consideration for the red cap of course So they continued the journey on foot as before the caravan tranquilly proceeding southwardly by short stages the Tarasconian in the van the Montenegrin in the rear and the camel with the weapons in their cases in the ranks The expedition lasted nearly a month During that seeking for lions which he never found the dreadful Tartarin roamed from douar to douar on the immense plain of the Shelliff through the odd but formidable French Algeria where the old Oriental perfumes are complicated by a strong blend of absinthe and the barracks Abraham and the Zouzou mingled something fairy tale like and simply burlesque like a page of the Old Testament related by Tommy Atkins A curious sight for those who have eyes that can see A wild and corrupted people whom we are civilising by teaching them our vices The ferocious and uncontrolled authority of grotesque bashaws who gravely use their grand cordons of the Legion of Honour as handkerchiefs and for a mere yea or nay order a man to be bastinadoed It is the justice of the conscienceless bespectacled cadis under the palm tree Maw worms of the Koran and Law who dream languidly of promotion and sell their decrees as Esau did his birthright for a dish of lentils or sweetened kouskous Drunken and libertine cadis are they formerly servants to some General Yusuf or the like who get intoxicated on champagne along with laundresses from Port Mahon and fatten on roast mutton whilst before their tents the whole tribe waste away with hunger and fight with the harriers for the bones of the lordly feast All around spread the plains in waste burnt grass leafless shrubs thickets of cactus and mastic the Granary of France a granary void of grain alas and rich alone in vermin and jackals Abandoned camps frightened tribes fleeing from them and famine they know not whither and strewing the road with corpses At long intervals French villages with the dwellings in ruins the fields untilled the maddened locusts gnawing even the window blinds and all the settlers in the drinking places absorbing absinthe and discussing projects of reform and the Constitution This is what Tartarin might have seen had he given himself the trouble but wrapped up entirely in his leonine hunger the son of Tarascon went straight on looking to neither right nor left his eyes steadfastly fixed on the imaginary monsters which never really appeared As the shelter tent was stubborn in not unfolding and the compressed meat cakes would not dissolve the caravan was obliged to stop morn and eve at tribal camps Everywhere thanks to the gorgeous cap of Prince Gregory our hunters were welcomed with open arms They lodged in the aghas odd palaces large white windowless farmhouses where they found pell mell narghilehs and mahogany furniture Smyrna carpets and moderator lamps cedar coffers full of Turkish sequins and French statuette decked clocks in the Louis Philippe style Everywhere too Tartarin was given splendrous galas diffas and fantasias which being interpreted mean feasts and circuses In his honour whole goums blazed away powder and floated their burnouses in the sun When the powder was burnt the agha would come and hand in his bill This is what is called Arab hospitality But always no lions no more than on London Bridge Nevertheless the Tarasconian did not grow disheartened Ever bravely diving more deeply into the South he spent the days in beating up the thickets probing the dwarf palms with the muzzle of his rifle and saying Boh to every bush And every evening before lying down he went into ambush for two or three hours Useless trouble however for the lion did not show himself One evening though going on six o clock as the caravan scrambled through a violet hued mastic grove where fat quails tumbled about in the grass drowsy through the heat Tartarin of Tarascon fancied he heard though afar and very vague and thinned down by the breeze that wondrous roaring to which he had so often listened by Mitaine s Menagerie at home At first the hero feared he was dreaming but in an instant further the roaring recommenced more distinct although yet remote and this time the camel s hump shivered in terror and made the tinned meats and arms in the cases rattle whilst all the dogs in the camps were heard howling in every corner of the horizon Beyond doubt this was the lion Quick quick to the ambush There was not a minute to lose Near at hand there happened to be an old marabout s or saint s tomb with a white cupola and the defunct s large yellow slippers placed in a niche over the door and a mass of odd offerings hems of blankets gold thread red hair hung on the wall Tartarin of Tarascon left his prince and his camel and went in search of a good spot for lying in wait Prince Gregory wanted to follow him but the Tarasconian refused bent on confronting Leo alone But still he besought His Highness not to go too far away and as a measure of foresight he entrusted him with his pocket book a good sized one full of precious papers and bank notes which he feared would get torn by the lion s claws This done our hero looked up a good place A hundred steps in front of the temple a little clump of rose laurel shook in the twilight haze on the edge of a rivulet all but dried up There it was that Tartarin went and ensconced himself one knee on the ground according to the regular rule his rifle in his hand and his huge hunting knife stuck boldly before him in the sandy bank Night fell The rosy tint of nature changed into violet and then into dark blue A pretty pool of clear water gleamed like a hand glass over the river pebbles this was the watering place of the wild animals On the other slope the whitish trail was dimly to be discerned which their heavy paws had traced in the brush a mysterious path which made one s flesh creep Join to this sensation that from the vague swarming sound in African forests the swishing of branches the velvety pads of roving creatures the jackal s shrill yelp and up in the sky two or three hundred feet aloft vast flocks of cranes passing on with screams like poor little children having their weasands slit You will own that there were grounds for a man being moved Tartarin was so and even more than that for the poor fellow s teeth chattered and on the cross bar of his hunting knife planted upright in the bank as we repeat his rifle barrel rattled like a pair of castanets Do not ask too much of a man There are times when one is not in the mood and moreover where would be the merit if heroes were never afraid Well yes Tartarin was afraid and all the time too for the matter of that Nevertheless he held out for an hour better for two but heroism has its limits Nigh him in the dry part of the rivulet bed the Tarasconian unexpectedly heard the sound of steps and of pebbles rolling This time terror lifted him off the ground He banged away both barrels at haphazard into the night and retreated as fast as his legs would carry him to the marabout s chapel vault leaving his knife standing up in the sand like a cross commemorative of the grandest panic that ever assailed the soul of a conqueror of hydras Help this Way prince the lion is on me There was silence Prince prince are you there The prince was not there On the white moonlit wall of the fane the camel alone cast the queer shaped shadow of his protuberance Prince Gregory had cut and run with the wallet of bank notes His Highness had been for the month past awaiting this opportunity VI Bagged him at Last IT was not until early on the morrow of this adventurous and dramatic eve that our hero awoke and acquired assurance doubly sure that the prince and the treasure had really gone off without any prospect of return When he saw himself alone in the little white tombhouse betrayed robbed abandoned in the heart of savage Algeria with a one humped camel and some pocket money as all his resources then did the representative of Tarascon for the first time doubt He doubted Montenegro friendship glory and even lions and the great man blubbered bitterly Whilst he was pensively seated on the sill of the sanctuary holding his head between his hands and his gun between his legs with the camel mooning at him the thicket over the way was divided and the stupor stricken Tartarin saw a gigantic lion appear not a dozen paces off It thrust out its high head and emitted powerful roars which made the temple walls shake beneath their votive decorations and even the saint s slippers dance in their niche The Tarasconian alone did not tremble At last you ve come he shouted jumping up and levelling the rifle Bang bang went a brace of shells into its head It was done For a minute on the fiery background of the African sky there was a dreadful firework display of scattered brains smoking blood and tawny hair When all fell Tartarin perceived two colossal Negroes furiously running towards him brandishing cudgels They were his two Negro acquaintances of Milianah Oh misery This was the domesticated lion the poor blind beggar of the Mohammed Monastery whom the Tarasconian s bullets had knocked over This time spite of Mahound Tartarin escaped neatly Drunk with fanatical fury the two African collectors would have surely beaten him to pulp had not the god of chase and war sent him a delivering angel in the shape of the rural constable of the Orleansville commune By a bypath this garde champetre came up his sword tucked under his arm The sight of the municipal cap suddenly calmed the Negroes choler Peaceful and majestic the officer with the brass badge drew up a report on the affair ordered the camel to be loaded with what remained of the king of beasts and the plaintiffs as well as the delinquent to follow him proceeding to Orleansville where all was deposited with the law courts receiver There issued a long and alarming case After the Algeria of the native tribes which he had overrun Tartarin of Tarascon became thence acquainted with another Algeria not less weird and to be dreaded the Algeria in the towns surcharged with lawyers and their papers He got to know the pettifogger who does business at the back of a cafe the legal Bohemian with documents reeking of wormwood bitters and white neckcloths spotted with champoreau the ushers the attorneys all the locusts of stamped paper meagre and famished who eat up the colonist body and boots ay to the very straps of them and leave him peeled to the core like an Indian cornstalk stripped leaf by leaf Before all else it was necessary to ascertain whether the lion had been killed on the civil or the military territory In the former case the matter regarded the Tribunal of Commerce in the second Tartarin would be dealt with by the Council of War and at the mere name the impressionable Tarasconian saw himself shot at the foot of the ramparts or huddled up in a casemate silo The puzzle lay in the limitation of the two territories being very hazy in Algeria At length after a month s running about entanglements and waiting under the sun in the yards of Arab Departmental offices it was established that whereas the lion had been killed on the military territory on the other hand Tartarin was in the civil territory when he shot So the case was decided in the civil courts and our hero was let off on paying two thousand five hundred francs damages costs not included How could he pay such a sum The few piashtres escaped from the prince s sweep had long since gone in legal documents and judicial libations The unfortunate lion destroyer was therefore reduced to selling the store of guns by retail rifle by rifle so went the daggers the Malay kreeses and the life preservers A grocer purchased the preserved aliments an apothecary what remained of the medicaments The big boots themselves walked off after the improved tent to a dealer of curiosities who elevated them to the dignity of rarities from Cochin China When everything was paid up only the lion s skin and the camel remained to Tartarin The hide he had carefully packed to be sent to Tarascon to the address of brave Commandant Bravida and later on we shall see what came of this fabulous trophy As for the camel he reckoned on making use of him to get back to Algiers not by riding on him but by selling him to pay his coach fare the best way to employ a camel in travelling Unhappily the beast was difficult to place and no one would offer a copper for him Still Tartarin wanted to regain Algiers by hook or crook He was in haste again to behold Baya s blue bodice his little snuggery and his fountains as well as to repose on the white trefoils of his little cloister whilst awaiting money from France So our hero did not hesitate distressed but not downcast he undertook to make the journey afoot and penniless by short stages In this enterprise the camel did not cast him off The strange animal had taken an unaccountable fancy for his master and on seeing him leave Orleansville he set to striding steadfastly behind him regulating his pace by this and never quitting him by a yard At the first outset Tartarin found this touching such fidelity and devotion above proof went to his heart all the more because the creature was accommodating and fed himself on nothing Nevertheless after a few days the Tarasconian was worried by having this glum companion perpetually at his heels to remind him of his misadventures Ire arising he hated him for his sad aspect hump and gait of a goose in harness To tell the whole truth he held him as his Old Man of the Sea and only pondered on how to shake him off but the follower would not be shaken off Tartarin attempted to lose him but the camel always found him he tried to outrun him but the camel ran faster He bade him begone and hurled stones at him The camel stopped with a mournful mien but in a minute resumed the pursuit and always ended by overtaking him Tartarin had to resign himself For all that when after eight full days of tramping the dusty and harassed Tarasconian espied the first white housetops of Algiers glimmer from afar in the verdure and when he got to the city gates on the noisy Mustapha Avenue amid the Zouaves Biskris and Mahonnais all swarming around him and staring at him trudging by with his camel overtasked patience escaped him No no he growled it is not likely I cannot enter Algiers with such an animal Profiting by a jam of vehicles he turned off into the fields and jumped into a ditch In a minute or so he saw over his head on the highway the camel flying off with long strides and stretching his neck with a wistful air Relieved of a great weight thereby the hero sneaked out of his covert and entered the town anew by a circuitous path which skirted the wall of his own little garden VII Catastrophes upon Catastrophes ENTIRELY astonished was Tartarin before his Moorish dwelling when he stopped Day was dying and the street deserted Through the low pointed arch doorway which the negress had forgotten to close laughter was heard and the clink of wine glasses the popping of champagne corks and floating over all the jolly uproar a feminine voice singing clearly and joyously Do you like Marco la Bella to dance in the hall hung with bloom Throne of heaven ejaculated the Tarasconian turning pale as he rushed into the enclosure Hapless Tartarin what a sight awaited him Beneath the arches of the little cloister amongst bottles pastry scattered cushions pipes tambourines and guitars Baya was singing Marco la Bella with a ship captain s cap over one ear She had on no blue vest or bodice indeed her only wear was a silvery gauze wrapper and full pink trousers At her feet on a rug surfeited with love and sweetmeats Barbassou the infamous skipper Barbassou was bursting with laughter at hearing her The apparition of Tartarin haggard thinned dusty his flaming eyes and the bristling up fez tassel sharply interrupted this tender Turkish Marseillais orgie Baya piped the low whine of a frightened leveret and ran for safety into the house But Barbassou did not wince he only laughed the louder saying Ha ha Monsieur Tartarin What do you say to that now You see she does know French Tartarin of Tarascon advanced furiously crying Captain Digo li que vengue moun bon Tell him what s happened old dear screamed the Moorish woman leaning over the first floor gallery with a pretty low bred gesture The poor man overwhelmed let himself collapse upon a drum His genuine Moorish beauty not only knew French but the French of Marseilles I told you not to trust the Algerian girls observed Captain Barbassou sententiously They re as tricky as your Montenegrin prince Tartarin lifted his head Do you know where the prince is Oh he s not far off He has gone to live five years in the handsome prison of Mustapha The rogue let himself be caught with his hand in the pocket Anyways this is not the first time he has been clapped into the calaboose His Highness has already done three years somewhere and stop a bit I believe it was at Tarascon At Tarascon cried out her worthiest son abruptly enlightened That s how he only knew one part of the Town Hey Of course Tarascon a jail bird s eye view from the state prison I tell you my poor Monsieur Tartarin you have to keep your peepers jolly well skinned in this deuce of a country or be exposed to very disagreeable things For a sample there s the muezzin s game with you What game Which muezzin Why your n of course The chap across the way who is making up to Baya That newspaper the Akbar told the yarn t other day and all Algiers is laughing over it even now It is so funny for that steeplejack up aloft in his crow s nest to make declarations of love under your very nose to the little beauty whilst singing out his prayers and making appointments with her between bits of the Koran Why then they re all scamps in this country howled the unlucky Tarasconian Barbassou snapped his fingers like a philosopher My dear lad you know these new countries are rum But anyhow if you ll believe me you d best cut back to Tarascon at full speed It s easy to say Cut back Where s the money to come from Don t you know that I was plucked out there in the desert What does that matter said the captain merrily The Zouave sails tomorrow and if you like I will take you home Does that suit you mate Ay Then all goes well You have only one thing to do There are some bottles of fizz left and half the pie Sit you down and pitch in without any grudge After the minute s wavering which self respect commanded the Tarasconian chose his course manfully Down he sat and they touched glasses Baya gliding down at that chink sang the finale of Marco la Bella and the jollification was prolonged deep into the night About three A M with a light head but a heavy foot our good Tarasconian was returning from seeing his friend the captain off when in passing the mosque the remembrance of his muezzin and his practical jokes made him laugh and instantly a capital idea of revenge flitted through his brain The door was open He entered threaded long corridors hung with mats mounted and kept on mounting till he finally found himself in a little oratory where an openwork iron lantern swung from the ceiling and embroidered an odd pattern in shadows upon the blanched walls There sat the crier on a divan in his large turban and white pelisse with his Mostaganam pipe and a bumper of absinthe before him which he whipped up in the orthodox manner whilst awaiting the hour to call true believers to prayer At view of Tartarin he dropped his pipe in terror Not a word knave said the Tarasconian full of his project Quick Off with turban and coat The Turkish priest crier tremblingly handed over his outer garments as he would have done with anything else Tartarin donned them and gravely stepped out upon the minaret platform In the distance the sea shone The white roofs glittered in the moonbeams On the sea breeze was heard the strumming of a few belated guitars The Tarasconian muezzin gathered himself up for the effort during a space and then raising his arms he set to chanting in a very shrill voice La Allah il Allah Mahomet is an old humbug The Orient the Koran bashaws lions Moorish beauties they are all not worth a fly s skip There is nothing left but gammoners Long live Tarascon Whilst the illustrious Tartarin in his queer jumbling of Arabic and Provencal flung his mirthful maledictions to the four quarters sea town plain and mountain the clear solemn voices of the other muezzins answered him taking up the strain from minaret to minaret and the believers of the upper town devoutly beat their bosoms VIII Tarascon again MID DAY has come The Zouave had her steam up ready to go Upon the balcony of the Valentin Cafe high above the officers were levelling telescopes and with the colonel at their head looking at the lucky little craft that was going back to France This is the main distraction of the staff On the lower level the roads glittered The old Turkish cannon breaches stuck up along the waterside blazed in the sun The passengers hurried Biskris and Mahonnais piled their luggage up in the wherries Tartarin of Tarascon had no luggage Here he comes down the Rue de la Marine through the little market full of bananas and melons accompanied by his friend Barbassou The hapless Tarasconian left on the Moorish strand his gun cases and his illusions and now he had to sail for Tarascon with his hands in his otherwise empty pockets He had barely leaped into the captain s cutter before a breathless beast slid down from the heights of the square and galloped towards him It was the faithful camel who had been hunting after his master in Algiers during the last four and twenty hours On seeing him Tartarin changed countenance and feigned not to know him but the camel was not going to be put off He scampered along the quay he whinnied for his friend and regarded him with affection Take me away his sad eyes seemed to say take me away in your ship far far from this sham Arabia this ridiculous Land of the East full of locomotives and stage coaches where a camel is so sorely out of keeping that I do not know what will become of me You are the last real Turk and I am the last camel Do not let us part O my Tartarin Is that camel yours the captain inquired Not a bit of it replied Tartarin who shuddered at the idea of entering Tarascon with that ridiculous escort and impudently denying the companion of his misfortunes he spurned the Algerian soil with his foot and gave the cutter the shoving off start The camel sniffed of the water extended its neck cracked its joints and jumping in behind the row boat at haphazard he swam towards the Zouave with his humpback floating like a bladder and his long neck projecting over the wave like the beak of a galley Cutter and camel came alongside the mail steamer together This dromedary regularly cuts me up observed Captain Barbassou quite affected I have a good mind to take him aboard and make a present of him to the Zoological Gardens at Marseilles And so they hauled up the camel with many blocks and tackles upon the deck being increased in weight by the brine and the Zouave started Tartarin spent the two days of the crossing by himself in his stateroom not because the sea was rough or that the red fez had too much to suffer but because the deuced camel as soon as his master appeared above decks showed him the most preposterous attentions You never did see a camel make such an exhibition of a man as this From hour to hour through the cabin portholes where he stuck out his nose now and then Tartarin saw the Algerian blue sky pale away until one morning in a silvery fog he heard with delight Marseilles bells ringing out The Zouave had arrived and cast anchor Our man having no luggage got off without saying anything hastily slipped through Marseilles for fear he was still pursued by the camel and never breathed till he was in a third class carriage making for Tarascon Deceptive security Hardly were they two leagues from the city before every head was stuck out of window There were outcries and astonishment Tartarin looked in his turn and what did he descry the camel reader the inevitable camel racing along the line behind the train and keeping up with it The dismayed Tartarin drew back and shut his eyes After this disastrous expedition of his he had reckoned on slipping into his house incognito But the presence of this burdensome quadruped rendered the thing impossible What kind of a triumphal entry would he make Good heavens not a sou not a lion nothing to show for it save a camel Tarascon Tarascon He was obliged to get down O amazement Scarce had the hero s red fez popped out of the doorway before a loud shout of Tartarin for ever made the glazed roof of the railway station tremble Long life to Tartarin the lion slayer And out burst the windings of horns and the choruses of the local musical societies Tartarin felt death had come he believed in a hoax But no all Tarascon was there waving their hats all of the same way of thinking Behold the brave Commandant Bravida Costecalde the armourer the Chief Judge the chemist and the whole noble corps of cap poppers who pressed around their leader and carried him in triumph out through the passages Singular effects of the mirage the hide of the blind lion sent to Bravida was the cause of all this riot With that humble fur exhibited in the club room the Tarasconians and at the back of them the whole South of France had grown exalted The Semaphore newspaper had spoken of it A drama had been invented It was not merely a solitary lion which Tartarin had slain but ten nay twenty pooh a herd of lions had been made marmalade of Hence on disembarking at Marseilles Tartarin was already celebrated without being aware of it and an enthusiastic telegram had gone on before him by two hours to his native place But what capped the climax of the popular gladness was to see a fancifully shaped animal covered with foam and dust appear behind the hero and stumble down the station stairs Tarascon for an instant believed that its dragon was come again Tartarin set his fellow citizens at ease This is my camel he said Already feeling the influence of the splendid sun of Tarascon which makes people tell bouncers unwittingly he added as he fondled the camel s hump It is a noble beast It saw me kill all my lions Whereupon he familiarly took the arm of the commandant who was red with pleasure and followed by his camel surrounded by the cap hunters acclaimed by all the population he placidly proceeded towards the Baobab Villa and on the march thus commenced the account of his mighty hunting Once upon an evening you are to imagine that out in the depths of the Sahara APPENDIX Obituary of Alphonse Daudet seventeenth
