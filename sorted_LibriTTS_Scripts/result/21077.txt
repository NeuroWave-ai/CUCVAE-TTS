Description of matter Definition of mind Objections to answered Incomplete existence of mind Other theories Nervous system must add its own effect to that of its excitant BOOK I THE DEFINITION OF MATTER THE MIND AND THE BRAIN one CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION This book is a prolonged effort to establish a distinction between what is called mind and what is called matter Nothing is more simple than to realise this distinction when you do not go deeply into it nothing is more difficult when you analyse it a little At first sight it seems impossible to confuse things so far apart as a thought and a block of stone but on reflection this great contrast vanishes and other differences have to be sought which are less apparent and of which one has not hitherto dreamed First let us say how the question presents itself to us The fact which we must take as a starting point for it is independent of every kind of theory is that there exists something which is knowable Not only science but ordinary life and our everyday conversation imply that there are things that we know It is with regard to these things that we have to ask ourselves if some belong to what we call the mind and others to what we call matter Let us suppose by way of hypothesis the knowable to be entirely and absolutely homogeneous In that case we should be obliged to set aside the question as one already decided Where everything is homogeneous there is no distinction to be drawn But this hypothesis is as we all know falsified by observation The whole body of the knowable is formed from an agglomeration of extremely varied elements amongst which it is easy to distinguish a large number of divisions Things may be classified according to their colour their shape their weight the pleasure they give us their quality of being alive or dead and so on one much given to classification would only be troubled by the number of possible distinctions Since so many divisions are possible at which shall we stop and say this is the one which corresponds exactly to the opposition of mind and matter The choice is not easy to make for we shall see that certain authors put the distinction between the physical and the mental in one thing others in another Thus there have been a very large number of distinctions proposed and their number is much greater than is generally thought Since we propose to make ourselves judges of these distinctions since in fact we shall reject most of them in order to suggest entirely new ones it must be supposed that we shall do so by means of a criterion Otherwise we should only be acting fantastically We should be saying peremptorily In my opinion this is mental and there would be no more ground for discussion than if the assertion were I prefer the Romanticists to the Classicists or I consider prose superior to poetry The criterion which I have employed and which I did not analyse until the unconscious use I had made of it revealed its existence to me is based on the two following rules one A Rule of Method The distinction between mind and matter must not only apply to the whole of the knowable but must be the deepest which can divide the knowable and must further be one of a permanent character A priori there is nothing to prove the existence of such a distinction it must be sought for and when found closely examined two An Indication of the Direction in which the Search must be Made Taking into account the position already taken up by the majority of philosophers the manifestation of mind if it exists must be looked for in the domain of facts dealt with by psychology and the manifestation of matter in the domain explored by physicists I do not conceal from myself that there may be much that is arbitrary in my own criterion but this does not seem to me possible to avoid We must therefore appeal to psychology and ask whether it is cognisant of any phenomenon offering a violent lasting and ineffaceable contrast with all the rest of the knowable The Method of Concepts and the Method of Enumeration Many authors are already engaged in this research and employ a method which I consider very bad and very dangerous the method of concepts This consists in looking at real and concrete phenomena in their most abstract form For example in studying the mind they use this word mind as a general idea which is supposed to contain all the characteristics of psychical phenomena but they do not wait to enumerate these characteristics or to realise them and they remain satisfied with the extremely vague idea springing from an unanalysed concept Consequently they use the word mind with the imprudence of a banker who should discount a trade bill without ascertaining whether the payment of that particular piece of paper had been provided for This amounts to saying that the discussion of philosophical problems takes especially a verbal aspect and the more complex the phenomena a concept thus handled contains the more dangerous it is A concept of the colour red has but a very simple content and by using it this content can be very clearly represented But how can the immense meaning of the word mind be realised every time that it is used For example to define mind and to separate it from the rest of the knowable which is called matter the general mode of reasoning is as follows all the knowable which is apparent to our senses is essentially reduced to motion mind that something which lives feels and judges is reduced to thought To understand the difference between matter and mind it is necessary to ask one s self whether there exists any analogy in nature between motion and thought Now this analogy does not exist and what we comprehend on the contrary is their absolute opposition Thought is not a movement and has nothing in common with a movement A movement is never anything else but a displacement a transfer a change of place undergone by a particle of matter What relation of similarity exists between this geometrical fact and a desire an emotion a sensation of bitterness Far from being identical these two facts are as distinct as any facts can be and their distinction is so deep that it should be raised to the height of a principle the principle of heterogeneity This is almost exactly the reasoning that numbers of philosophers have repeated for several years without giving proof of much originality This is what I term the metaphysics of concept for it is a speculation which consists in juggling with abstract ideas The moment that a philosopher opposes thought to movement I ask myself under what form he can think of a thought I suppose he must very poetically and very vaguely represent to himself something light and subtle which contrasts with the weight and grossness of material bodies And thus our philosopher is punished in the sinning part his contempt of the earthly has led him into an abuse of abstract reasoning and this abuse has made him the dupe of a very naive physical metaphor At bottom I have not much faith in the nobility of many of our abstract ideas In a former psychological study two I have shown that many of our abstractions are nothing else than embryonic and above all loosely defined concrete ideas which can satisfy only an indolent mind and are consequently full of snares The opposition between mind and matter appears to me to assume a very different meaning if instead of repeating ready made formulas and wasting time on the game of setting concept against concept we take the trouble to return to the study of nature and begin by drawing up an inventory of the respective phenomena of mind and matter examining with each of these phenomena the characteristics in which the first named differ from the second It is this last method more slow but more sure than the other that we shall follow and we will commence by the study of matter FOOTNOTES Footnote one L Ame et la Corps Disagreeable as it is to alter an author s title the words Soul and Body had to be abandoned because of their different connotation in English The title Mind and Body was also preoccupied by Bain s work of that name in this series The title chosen has M Binet s approval ED Footnote two Etude experimentale de l Intelligence Paris Schleicher CHAPTER II OUR KNOWLEDGE OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS IS ONLY SENSATIONS Of late years numerous studies have been published on the conception of matter especially by physicists chemists and mathematicians Among these recent contributions to science I will quote the articles of Duhem on the Evolution of Mechanics published in nineteen oh three in the Revue generale des Sciences and other articles by the same author in nineteen oh four in the Revue de Philosophie Duhem s views have attracted much attention and have dealt a serious blow at the whole theory of the mechanics of matter Let me also quote that excellent work of Dastre La Vie et la Mort wherein the author makes so interesting an application to biology of the new theories on energetics the discussion between Ostwald and Brillouin on matter in which two rival conceptions find themselves engaged in a veritable hand to hand struggle Revue generale des Sciences Nov and Dec eighteen ninety five the curious work of Dantec on les Lois Naturelles in which the author ingeniously points out the different sensorial districts into which science is divided although through a defect in logic he accepts mechanics as the final explanation of things And last it is impossible to pass over in silence the rare works of Lord Kelvin so full for French readers of unexpected suggestions for they show us the entirely practical and empirical value which the English attach to mechanical models My object is not to go through these great studies in detail It is the part of mathematical and physical philosophers to develop their ideas on the inmost nature of matter while seeking to establish theories capable of giving a satisfactory explanation of physical phenomena This is the point of view they take up by preference and no doubt they are right in so doing The proper role of the natural sciences is to look at phenomena taken by themselves and apart from the observer My own intention in setting forth these same theories on matter is to give prominence to a totally different point of view Instead of considering physical phenomena in themselves we shall seek to know what idea one ought to form of their nature when one takes into account that they are observed phenomena While the physicist withdraws from consideration the part of the observer in the verification of physical phenomena our role is to renounce this abstraction to re establish things in their original complexity and to ascertain in what the conception of matter consists when it is borne in mind that all material phenomena are known only in their relation to ourselves to our bodies our nerves and our intelligence This at once leads us to follow in the exposition of the facts an order which the physicist abandons Since we seek to know what is the physical phenomenon we perceive we must first enunciate this proposition which will govern the whole of our discussion to wit Of the outer world we know nothing except our sensations Before demonstrating this proposition let us develop it by an example which will at least give us some idea of its import Let us take as example one of those investigations in which with the least possible recourse to reasoning the most perfected processes of observation are employed and in which one imagines that one is penetrating almost into the very heart of nature We are let us suppose dissecting an animal After killing it we lay bare its viscera examine their colour form dimensions and connections then we dissect the organs in order to ascertain their internal nature their texture structure and function then not content with ocular anatomy we have recourse to the perfected processes of histology we take a fragment of the tissues weighing a few milligrammes we fix it we mount it we make it into strips of no more than a thousandth of a millimetre thick we colour it and place it under the microscope we examine it with the most powerful lenses we sketch it and we explain it All this work of complicated and refined observation sometimes lasting months and years results in a monograph containing minute descriptions of organs of cells and of intra cellular structures the whole represented and defined in words and pictures Now these descriptions and drawings are the display of the various sensations which the zoologist has experienced in the course of his labours to those sensations are added the very numerous interpretations derived from the memory reasoning and often also from the imagination on the part of the scholar the last a source at once of errors and of discoveries But everything properly experimental in the work of the zoologist proceeds from the sensations he has felt or might have felt and in the particular case treated of these sensations are almost solely visual This observation might be repeated with regard to all objects of the outer world which enter into relation with us Whether the knowledge of them be of the common place or of a scientific order matters little Sensation is its limit and all objects are known to us by the sensations they produce in us and are known to us solely in this manner A landscape is nothing but a cluster of sensations The outward form of a body is simply sensation and the innermost and most delicate material structure the last visible elements of a cell for example are all in so far as we observe them with the microscope nothing but sensation This being understood the question is why we have just admitted with the majority of authors that we cannot really know a single object as it is in itself and in its own nature otherwise than by the intermediary of the sensations it provokes in us This comes back to saying that we here require explanations on the two following points why do we admit that we do not really perceive the objects but only something intermediate between them and us and why do we call this something intermediate a sensation On this second point I will offer for the time being one simple remark we use the term sensation for lack of any other to express the intermediate character of our perception of objects and this use does not on our part imply any hypothesis Especially do we leave completely in suspense the question whether sensation is a material phenomenon or a state of being of the mind These are questions we will deal with later For the present it must be understood that the word sensation is simply a term for the something intermediate between the object and our faculty of cognition three We have therefore simply to state why we have admitted that the external perception of objects is produced mediately or by procuration There are a few philosophers and those not of the lowest rank who have thought that this intermediate character of all perception was so evident that there was no need to insist further upon it John Stuart Mill who was certainly and perhaps more than anything a careful logician commences an exposition of the idealist thesis to which he was so much attached by carelessly saying It goes without saying that objects are known to us through the intermediary of our senses The senses are equivalent to our sensations four and on those propositions he rears his whole system It goes without saying is a trifle thoughtless I certainly think he was wrong in not testing more carefully the solidity of his starting point In the first place this limit set to our knowledge of the objects which stimulate our sensations is only accepted without difficulty by well informed persons it much astonishes the uninstructed when first explained to them And this astonishment although it may seem so is not a point that can be neglected for it proves that in the first and simple state of our knowledge we believe we directly perceive objects as they are Now if we the cultured class have for the most part five abandoned this primitive belief we have only done so on certain implicit conditions of which we must take cognisance This is what I shall now demonstrate as clearly as I can Take the case of an unlearned person To prove to him that he knows sensations alone and not the bodies which excite them a very striking argument may be employed which requires no subtle reasoning and which appeals to his observation This is to inform him supposing he is not aware of the fact that every time he has the perception of an exterior object there is something interposed between the object and himself and that that something is his nervous system If we were not acquainted with the existence of our nervous system we should unhesitatingly admit that our perception of objects consisted in some sort of motion towards the places in which they were fixed Now a number of experiments prove to us that objects are known to us as excitants of our nervous system which only act on this system by entering into communication or coming into contact with its terminal extremities They then produce in the interior of this system a peculiar modification which we are not yet able to define It is this modification which follows the course of the nerves and is carried to the central parts of the system The speed of the propagation of this nerve modification has been measured by certain precise experiments in psychometry the journey is made slowly at the rate of twenty to thirty metres per second and it is of interest that this rate of speed lets us know at what moment and consequently by what organic excitement the phenomenon of consciousness is produced This happens when the cerebral centres are affected the phenomenon of consciousness is therefore posterior to the fact of the physical excitement I believe it has required a long series of accepted observations for us to have arrived at this idea now so natural in appearance that the modifications produced within our nervous system are the only states of which we can have a direct consciousness and as experimental demonstration is always limited there can be no absolute certainty that things never happen otherwise that we never go outside ourselves and that neither our consciousness nor our nervous influx can exteriorise itself shoot beyond our material organs and travel afar in pursuit of objects in order to know or to modify them Before going further we must make our terminology more precise We have just seen the necessity of drawing a distinction between the sensations of which we are conscious and the unknown cause which produces these sensations by acting on our nervous systems This exciting cause I have several times termed in order to be understood the external object But under the name of external object are currently designated groups of sensations such as those which make up for us a chair a tree an animal or any kind of body I see a dog pass in the street I call this dog an external object but as this dog is formed for me who am looking at it of my sensations and as these sensations are states of my nervous centres it happens that the term external object has two meanings Sometimes it designates our sensations at another the exciting cause of our sensations To avoid all confusion we will call this exciting cause which is unknown to us the X of matter It is however not entirely unknown for we at least know two facts with regard to it We know first that this X exists and in the second place that its image must not be sought in the sensations it excites in us How can we doubt we say that it exists The same external observation proves to us at once that there exists an object distinct from our nerves and that our nerves separate us from it I insist on this point for the reason that some authors after having unreservedly admitted that our knowledge is confined to sensations have subsequently been hard put to it to demonstrate the reality of the excitant distinct from the sensations six Of this we need no demonstration and the testimony of our senses suffices We have seen the excitant and it is like a friend who should pass before us in disguise so well costumed and made up that we can attribute to his real self nothing of what we see of him but yet we know that it is he And in fact let us remember what it is that we have argued upon viz on an observation I look at my hand and I see an object approaching it which gives me a sensation of feeling I at first say that this object is an excitant It is pointed out to me that I am in error This object which appears to me outside my nervous system is composed I am told of sensations Be it so I have the right to answer but if all that I perceive is sensation my nervous system itself is a sensation if it is only that it is no longer an intermediary between the excitant and myself and it is the fact that we perceive things as they are For it to be possible to prove that I perceive not the object but that tertium quid which is sensation it has to be admitted that the nervous system is a reality external to sensation and that objects which assume in relation to it the role of excitants and of which we perceive the existence are likewise realities external to sensation This is what is demonstrated by abstract reasoning and this reasoning is further supported by a common sense argument The outer world cannot be summarised in a few nervous systems suspended like spiders in empty space The existence of a nervous system implies that of a body in which it is lodged This body must have complicated organs its limbs presuppose the soil on which the animal rests its lungs the existence of oxygen vivifying its blood its digestive tube aliments which it digests and assimilates to its substance and so on We may indeed admit that this outer world is not in itself exactly as we perceive it but we are compelled to recognise that it exists by the same right as the nervous system in order to put it in its proper place The second fact of observation is that the sensations we feel do not give us the true image of the material X which produces them The modification made in our substance by this force X does not necessarily resemble in its nature the nature of that force This is an assertion opposed to our natural opinions and must consequently be demonstrated It is generally proved by the experiments which reveal what is called the law of the specific energy of the nerves This is an important law in physiology discovered by Mueller two centuries ago and consequences of a philosophical order are attached to it The facts on which this law is based are these It is observed that if the sensory nerves are agitated by an excitant which remains constant the sensations received by the patient differ according to the nerve affected Thus the terminals of an electric current applied to the ball of the eye give the sensation of a small luminous spark to the auditory apparatus the current causes a crackling sound to the hand the sensation of a shock to the tongue a metallic flavour Conversely excitants wholly different but affecting the same nerve give similar sensations whether a ray of light is projected into the eye or the eyeball be excited by the pressure of a finger whether an electric current is directed into the eye or by a surgical operation the optic nerve is severed by a bistoury the effect is always the same in the sense that the patient always receives a sensation of light To sum up in addition to the natural excitant of our sensory nerves there are two which can produce the same sensory effects that is to say the mechanical and the electrical excitants Whence it has been concluded that the peculiar nature of the sensation felt depends much less on the nature of the excitant producing it than on that of the sensory organ which collects it the nerve which propagates it or the centre which receives it It would perhaps be going a little too far to affirm that the external object has no kind of resemblance to the sensations it gives us It is safer to say that we are ignorant of the degree in which the two resemble or differ from each other On thinking it over it will be found that this contains a very great mystery for this power of distinction specificite of our nerves is not connected with any detail observable in their structure It is very probably the receiving centres which are specific It is owing to them and to their mechanism that we ought to feel from the same excitant a sensation of sound or one of colour that is to say impressions which appear when compared as the most different in the world Now so far as we can make out the histological structure of our auditory centre is the same as that of our visual centre Both are a collection of cells diverse in form multipolar and maintained by a conjunctive pellicule stroma The structure of the fibres and cells varies slightly in the motor and sensory regions but no means have yet been discovered of perceiving a settled difference between the nerve cells of the optic centre and those of the auditory centre There should be a difference as our mind demands it but our eye fails to note it Let us suppose however that to morrow or several centuries hence an improved technique should show us a material difference between the visual and the auditory neurone There is no absurdity in this supposition it is a possible discovery since it is of the order of material facts Such a discovery however would lead us very far for what terribly complicates this problem is that we cannot directly know the structure of our nervous system Though close to us though so to speak inside us it is not known to us otherwise than is the object we hold in our hands the ground we tread or the landscape which forms our horizon For us it is but a sensation a real sensation when we observe it in the dissection of an animal or the autopsy of one of our own kind an imaginary and transposed sensation when we are studying anatomy by means of an anatomical chart but still a sensation It is by the intermediary of our nervous system that we have to perceive and imagine what a nervous system is like consequently we are ignorant as to the modification impressed on our perceptions and imaginations by this intermediary the nature of which we are unable to grasp Therefore when we attempt to understand the inmost nature of the outer world we stand before it as before absolute darkness There probably exists in nature outside of ourselves neither colour odour force resistance space nor anything that we know as sensation Light is produced by the excitement of the optic nerve and it shines only in our brain as to the excitement itself there is nothing to prove that it is luminous outside of us is profound darkness or even worse since darkness is the correlation of light In the same way all the sonorous excitements which assail us the creakings of machines the sounds of nature the words and cries of our fellows are produced by excitements of our acoustic nerve it is in our brain that noise is produced outside there reigns a dead silence The same may be said of all our other senses Not one of our senses absolutely none is the revealer of external reality From this point of view there is no higher and no lower sense The sensations of sight apparently so objective and so searching no more take us out of ourselves than do the sensations of taste which are localised in the tongue In short our nervous system which enables us to communicate with objects prevents us on the other hand from knowing their nature It is an organ of relation with the outer world it is also for us a cause of isolation We never go outside ourselves We are walled in And all we can say of matter and of the outer world is that it is revealed to us solely by the sensations it affords us that it is the unknown cause of our sensations the inaccessible excitant of our organs of the senses and that the ideas we are able to form as to the nature and the properties of that excitant are necessarily derived from our sensations and are subjective to the same degree as those sensations themselves But we must make haste to add that this point of view is the one which is reached when we regard the relations of sensation with its unknown cause the great X of matter seven Positive science and practical life do not take for an objective this relation of sensation with the Unknowable they leave this to metaphysics They distribute themselves over the study of sensation and examine the reciprocal relations of sensations with sensations Those last condemned as misleading appearances when we seek in them the expression of the Unknowable lose this illusory character when we consider them in their reciprocal relations Then they constitute for us reality the whole of reality and the only object of human knowledge The world is but an assembly of present past and possible sensations the affair of science is to analyse and company ordinate them by separating their accidental from their constant relations FOOTNOTES Footnote three Connaissance The word cognition is used throughout as the English equivalent of this except in places where the context shows that it means acquaintance merely ED Footnote four J S MILL An Examination of Sir Wm Hamilton s Philosophy pp five and six London eighteen sixty five Footnote five A few subtle philosophers have returned to it as I shall show later in chapter iv Footnote six Thus the perplexity in which John Stuart Mill finds himself is very curious Having admitted unreservedly that our knowledge is confined to sensations he is powerless to set up a reality outside this and acknowledges that the principle of causality cannot legitimately be used to prove that our sensations have a cause which is not a sensation because this principle cannot be applied outside the world of phenomena Footnote seven See p eighteen sup ED CHAPTER III THE MECHANICAL THEORIES OF MATTER ARE ONLY SYMBOLS If we keep firmly in mind the preceding conclusion a conclusion which is neither exclusively my own nor very new we shall find a certain satisfaction in watching the discussions of physicists on the essence of matter on the nature of force and of energy and on the relations of ponderable and imponderable matter We all know how hot is the fight raging on this question At the present time it is increasing in intensity in consequence of the disturbance imported into existing theories by the new discoveries of radio activity eight We psychologists can look on very calmly at these discussions with that selfish pleasure we unavowedly feel when we see people fighting while ourselves safe from knocks We have in fact the feeling that come what may from the discussions on the essence of matter there can be no going beyond the truth that matter is an excitant of our nervous system and is only known in connection with the perception we have of this last If we open a work on physics or physiology we shall note with astonishment how the above considerations are misunderstood Observers of nature who seek and rightly to give the maximum of exactness to their observations show that they are obsessed by one constant prejudice they mistrust sensation A great part of their efforts consists by what they say in reducing the role of sensation to its fitting part in science and the invention of mechanical aids to observation is constantly held up as a means of remedying the imperfection of our senses In physics the thermometer replaces the sensation of heat that our skin our hand for example experiences by the measurable elevation of a column of mercury and the scale pan of a precise balance takes the place of the vague sensation of trifling weights in physiology a registering apparatus replaces the sensation of the pulse which the doctor feels with the end of his forefinger by a line on paper traced with indelible ink of which the duration and the intensity as well as the varied combinations of these two elements can be measured line by line Learned men who pride themselves on their philosophical attainments vaunt in very eloquent words the superiority of the physical instrument over mere sensation Evidently however the earnestness of this eulogy leads them astray The most perfect registering apparatus must in the long run after its most scientific operations address itself to our senses and produce in us some small sensation The reading of the height reached by the column of mercury in a thermometer when heated is accomplished by a visual sensation and it is by the sight that the movements of the balance are controlled and that the traces of the sphygmograph are analysed We may readily admit to physicists and physiologists all the advantages of these apparatus This is not the question It simply proves that there are sensations and sensations and that certain of these are better and more precise than others The visual sensation of relation in space seems to be par excellence the scientific sensation which it is sought to substitute for all the rest But after all it is but a sensation Let us recognise that there is in all this contempt on the part of physicists for sensation only differences in language and that a paraphrase would suffice to correct them without leaving any trace Be it so But something graver remains When one is convinced that our knowledge of the outer world is limited to sensations we can no longer understand how it is possible to give oneself up as physicists do to speculations upon the constitution of matter Up to the present there have been three principal ways of explaining the physical phenomena of the universe The first the most abstract and the furthest from reality is above all verbal It consists in the use of formulas in which the quality of the phenomena is replaced by their magnitude in which this magnitude ascertained by the most precise processes of measurement becomes the object of abstract reasoning which allows its modifications to be foreseen under given experimental conditions This is pure mathematics a formal science depending upon logic Another conception less restricted than the above and of fairly recent date consists in treating all manifestations of nature as forms of energy This term energy has a very vague content At the most it expresses but two things first it is based on a faint recollection of muscular force and it reminds one dimly of the sensation experienced when clenching the fists and secondly it betrays a kind of very natural respect for the forces of nature which in all the images man has made of them constantly appear superior to his own We may say the energy of nature but we should never say what would be experimentally correct the weakness of nature The word weakness we reserve for ourselves Apart from these undecided suggestions the term energy is quite the proper term to designate phenomena the intimate nature of which we do not seek to penetrate but of which we only wish to ascertain the laws and measure the degrees A third conception more imaginative and bolder than the others is the mechanical or kinetic theory This last absolutely desires that we should represent to ourselves that we should imagine how phenomena really take place and in seeking for the property of nature the most clearly perceived the easiest to define and analyse and the most apt to lend itself to measurement and calculation it has chosen motion Consequently all the properties of matter have been reduced to this one and in spite of the apparent contradiction of our senses it has been supposed that the most varied phenomena are produced in the last resort by the displacement of material particles Thus sound light heat electricity and even the nervous influx would be due to vibratory movements varying only by their direction and their periods and all nature is thus explained as a problem of animated geometry This last theory which has proved very fertile in explanations of the most delicate phenomena of sound and light has so strongly impressed many minds that it has led them to declare that the explanation of phenomena by the laws of mechanics alone has the character of a scientific explanation Even recently it seemed heresy to combat these ideas Still more recently however a revulsion of opinion has taken place Against the physicists the mathematicians in particular have risen up and taking their stand on science have demonstrated that all the mechanisms invented have crowds of defects First in each particular case there is such a complication that that which is defined is much more simple than the definition then there is such a want of unity that quite special mechanisms adapted to each phenomenal detail have to be imagined and lastly most serious argument of all so much comprehensiveness and suppleness is employed that no experimental law is found which cannot be understood mechanically and no fact of observation which shows an error in the mechanical explanation a sure proof that this mode of explanation has no meaning My way of combating the mechanical theory starts from a totally different point of view Psychology has every right to say a few words here as upon the value of every kind of scientific theory for it is acquainted with the nature of the mental needs of which these theories are the expression and which these theories seek to satisfy It has not yet been sufficiently noticed that psychology does not allow itself to be confined like physics or sociology within the logical table of human knowledge for it has by a unique privilege a right of supervision over the other sciences We shall see that the psychological discussion of mechanics has a wider range than that of the mathematicians Since our cognition cannot go beyond sensation shall we first recall what meaning can be given to an explanation of the inmost nature of matter It can only be an artifice a symbol or a process convenient for classification in order to combine the very different qualities of things in one unifying synthesis a process having nearly the same theoretical value as a memoria technica which by substituting letters for figures helps us to retain the latter in our minds This does not mean that figures are in fact letters but it is a conventional substitution which has a practical advantage What memoria technica is to the ordinary memory the theory of mechanics should be for our needed unification Unfortunately this is not so The excuse we are trying to make for the mechanicians is illusory There is no mistaking their ambition Notwithstanding the prudence of some and the equivocations in which others have rejoiced they have drawn their definition in the absolute and not in the relative To take their conceptions literally they have thought the movement of matter to be something existing outside our eye our hands and our sense in a word something noumenal as Kant would have said The proof that this is their real idea is that movement is presented to us as the true outer and explanatory cause of our sensations the external excitement to our nerves The most elementary works on physics are impregnated with this disconcerting conception If we open a description of acoustics we read that sound and noise are subjective states which have no reality outside our auditory apparatus that they are sensations produced by an external cause which is the vibratory movement of sonorous bodies whence the conclusion that this vibratory movement is not itself a sensation Or shall we take another proof still more convincing This is the vibratory and silent movement which is invoked by physicists to explain the peculiarities of subjective sensation so that the interferences the pulsations of sound and in fine the whole physiology of the ear is treated as a problem in kinematics and is explained by the composition of movements What kind of reality do physicists then allow to the displacements of matter Where do they place them since they recognise otherwise that the essence of matter is unknown to us Are we to suppose that outside the world of noumena outside the world of phenomena and sensations there exists a third world an intermediary between the two former the world of atoms and that of mechanics A short examination will moreover suffice to show of what this mechanical model is formed which is presented to us as constituting the essence of matter This can be nothing else than the sensations since we are incapable of perceiving or imagining anything else It is the sensations of sight of touch and even of the muscular sense Motion is a fact seen by the eye felt by the hand it enters into us by the perception we have of the solid masses visible to the naked eye which exist in our field of observation of their movements and their equilibrium and the displacement we ourselves effect with our bodies Here is the sensory origin very humble and very gross of all the mechanics of the atoms Here is the stuff of which our lofty conception is formed Our mind can it is true by a work of purification strip movement of most of its concrete qualities separate it even from the perception of the object in motion and make of it a something or other ideal and diagrammatic but there will still remain a residuum of visual tactile and muscular sensations and consequently it is still nothing else than a subjective state bound to the structure of our organs We are for the rest so wrapped up in sensations that none of our boldest conceptions can break through the circle But it is not the notion of movement alone which proceeds from sensation There is also that of exteriority of space of position and by opposition that of external or psychological events Without declaring it to be certain I will remind you that it is infinitely probable that these notions are derived from our muscular experience Free motion arrested motion the effort the speed and the direction of motion such are the sensorial elements which in all probability constitute the foundation of our ideas on space and its properties And those are so many subjective notions which we have no right to treat as objects belonging to the outer world What is more remarkable also is that even the ideas of object of body and of matter are derived from visual and tactile sensations which have been illegitimately set up as entities We have come in fact to consider matter as a being separate from sensations superior to our sensations distinct from the properties which enable us to know it and binding together these properties as it were in a sheaf Here again is a conception at the base of visualisation and muscularisation it consists in referring to the visual and other sensations raised for the occasion to the dignity of external and permanent causes the other sensations which are considered as the effects of the first named upon our organs of sense It demands a great effort to clear our minds of these familiar conceptions which it is plain are nothing but naive realism Yes the mechanical conception of the universe is nothing but naive realism To recapitulate our idea and to make it more plain by an illustration here is a tuning fork on the table before me With a vigorous stroke of the bow I set it vibrating The two prongs separate oscillate rapidly and a sound of a certain tone is heard I connect this tuning fork by means of electric wires with a Deprez recording apparatus which records the vibrations on the blackened surface of a revolving cylinder and we can thus by an examination of the trace made under our eyes ascertain all the details of the movement which animates it We see parallel to each other two different orders of phenomena the visual phenomena which show us that the tuning fork is vibrating and the auditory phenomena which convey to us the fact that it is making a sound The physicist asked for an explanation of all this will answer It is the vibration of the tuning fork which transmitted by the air is carried to our auditory apparatus causes a vibration in the tympanum the movements of which are communicated to the small bones of the middle ear thence abridging details to the terminations of the auditory nerve and so produces in us the subjective sensation of sound Well in so saying the physicist commits an error of interpretation outside our ears there exists something we do not know which excites them this something cannot be the vibratory movement of the tuning fork for this vibratory movement which we can see is likewise a subjective sensation it no more exists outside our sight than sound exists outside our ears In any case it is as absurd to explain a sensation of sound by one of sight as a sensation of sight by one of sound One would be neither further from nor nearer to the truth if we answered that physicist as follows You give the preponderance to your eye I myself give it to my ear This tuning fork appears to you to vibrate Wrong This is how the thing occurs This tuning fork produces a sound which by exciting our retina gives us a sense of movement This visual sensation of vibration is a purely subjective one the external cause of the phenomenon is the sound The outer world is a concert of sounds which rises in the immensity of space Matter is noise and nothingness is silence This theory of the above experiment is not absurd but as a matter of fact it is probable that no one would or could accept it except verbally for amusement as a challenge or for the pleasure of talking metaphysics The reason is that all our evolution for causes which would take too long to detail has established the hegemony of certain of our senses over the others We have above all become visual and manual beings It is the eye and the hand which give us the perceptions of the outer world of which we almost exclusively make use in our sciences and we are now almost incapable of representing to ourselves the foundation of phenomena otherwise than by means of these organs Thus all the preceding experiment from the stroke of the bow to the final noise presents itself to us in visual terms and further these terms are not confined to a series of detached sensations Visual sensation combines with the tactile and muscular sensations and forms sensorial constructions which succeed each other continue and arrange themselves logically in lieu of sensations there are objects and relations of space between these objects and the actions which connect them and the phenomena which pass from one to the other All that is only sensation if you will but merely as the agglutinated molecules of cement and of stone are a palace Thus the whole series of visual events which compose our experiment with the tuning fork can be coherently explained One understands that It is the movement of my hand equipped with the bow which is communicated to the tuning fork One understands that this movement passing into the fork has changed its form and rhythm that the waves produced by the fork transmit themselves by the oscillations of the air molecules to our tympanum and so on There is in all this series of experiments an admirable continuity which fully satisfies our minds However much we might be convinced by the theoretical reasons given above that we have quite as much right to represent the same series of events in an auditory form we should be incapable of realising that form to ourselves What would be the structure of the ear to any one who only knew it through the sense of hearing What would become of the tympanum the small bones the cochlea and the terminations of the acoustic nerve if it were only permitted to represent them in the language of sound It is very difficult to imagine Since however we are theorising let us not be stopped by a few difficulties of comprehension Perhaps a little training might enable us to overcome them Perhaps musicians who discern as much reality in what one hears as in what one sees would be more apt than other folk to understand the necessary transposition Some of them in their autobiographies have made by the way very suggestive remarks on the importance they attribute to sound and moreover the musical world with its notes its intervals and its orchestration lives and develops in a manner totally independent of vibration Perhaps we can here quote one or two examples which may give us a lead To measure the length of a body instead of applying to it a yard wand one might listen to its sound for the pitch of the sound given by two cords allows us to deduce their difference of length and even the absolute length of each The chemical composition of a body might be noted by its electric resistance and the latter verified by the telephone that is to say by the ear Or to take a more subtle example We might make calculations with sounds of which we have studied the harmonic relations as we do nowadays with figures A sum in rule of three might even be solved sonorously for given three sounds the ear can find a fourth which should have the same relation to the third as the second to the first Every musical ear performs this operation easily now this fourth sound what else is it but the fourth term in a rule of three And by taking into consideration the number of its vibrations a numerical solution would be found to the problem This novel form of calculating machine might serve to fix the price of woollen stuffs to calculate brokerages and percentages and the solution would be obtained without the aid of figures without calculation without visualisation and by the ear alone By following up this idea also we might go a little further We might arrive at the conviction that our present science is human petty and contingent that it is closely linked with the structure of our sensory organs that this structure results from the evolution which fashioned these organs that this evolution has been an accident of history that in the future it may be different and that consequently by the side or in the stead of our modern science the work of our eyes and hands and also of our words there might have been constituted there may still be constituted sciences entirely and extraordinarily new auditory olfactory and gustatory sciences and even others derived from other kinds of sensations which we can neither foresee nor conceive because they are not for the moment differentiated in us Outside the matter we know a very special matter fashioned of vision and touch there may exist other matter with totally different properties But let us bring our dream to an end The interest of our discussion does not lie in the hypothetical substitution of hearing or any other sense for sight It lies in the complete suppression of all explanation of the noumenal object in terms borrowed from the language of sensation And that is our last word We must by setting aside the mechanical theory free ourselves from a too narrow conception of the constitution of matter And this liberation will be to us a great advantage which we shall soon reap We shall avoid the error of believing that mechanics is the only real thing and that all that cannot be explained by mechanics must be incomprehensible We shall then gain more liberty of mind for understanding what the union of the soul with the body nine may be FOOTNOTES Footnote eight I would draw attention to a recent volume by GUSTAVE LE BON on Evolution de la Matiere a work full of original and bold ideas Footnote nine See Note one on p three ED CHAPTER IV ANSWERS TO SOME OBJECTIONS AND SUMMARY I have set forth the foregoing ideas by taking the road which to me seemed the best On reflection it has occurred to me that my manner of exposition and demonstration may be criticised much more than my conclusion Now as it is the conclusion alone which here is of importance it is expedient not to make it responsible for the arguments by which I have supported it These arguments resolve themselves into the attestation that between objects and our consciousness there exists an intermediary our nervous system We have even established that the existence of this intermediary is directly proved by observation and from this I have concluded that we do not directly perceive the object itself but a tertium quid which is our sensations Several objections to this might be made Let us enumerate them one It is not inconceivable that objects may act directly on our consciousness without taking the intermediary of our nervous system Some authors the spiritualists notably believe in the possibility of disembodied souls and they admit by implication that these souls remain in communication with the terrestrial world witness our actions and hear our speech Since they no longer have organs of sense we must suppose that these wandering souls if they exist can directly perceive material objects It is evident that such hypotheses have up till now nothing scientific in them and that the demonstrations of them which are given raise a feeling of scepticism more than anything else Nevertheless we have not the right to exclude by a priori argument the possibility of this category of phenomena two Several German authors have maintained in recent years that if the nervous system intervenes in the perception of external objects it is a faithful intermediary which should not work any change on those physical actions which it gathers from outside to transmit to our consciousness From this point of view colour would exist as colour outside our eyes sound would exist as sound and in a general way there would not be in matter any mysterious property left since we should perceive matter as it is This is a very unexpected interpretation by which men of science have come to acknowledge the correctness of the common belief they rehabilitate an opinion which philosophers have till now turned to ridicule under the name of naive realism All which proves that the naivete of some may be the excessive refinement of others To establish scientifically this opinion they batter down the theory of the specific energy of the nerves I have recalled in a previous page ten of what this theory consists I have shown that if by mechanical or electrical means our different sensory nerves are excited notwithstanding the identity of the excitant a different sensation is provoked in each case light when the optic nerve is stimulated sound when the acoustic and so on It is now answered to this argument based on fact that the nature of these excitants must be complex It is not impossible it is thought that the electric force contains within itself both luminous and sonorous actions it is not impossible that a mechanical excitement should change the electric state of the nerve affected and that consequently these subsidiary effects explain how one and the same agent may according to the nerves employed produce different effects three After the spiritualists and the experimentalists let us take the metaphysicians Among them one has always met with the most varying specimens of opinions and with arguments for and against all possible theories Thus it is for example with the external perception Some have supposed it indirect others on the contrary that it acts directly on the object Those who uphold the direct theory are inspired by Berkeley who asserts that the sensitive qualities of the body have no existence but in our own minds and consist really in representative ideas This doctrine is expressly based on this argument that thought differs too much in nature from matter for one to be able to suppose any link between these two substances In this particular some authors often make an assertion without endeavouring to prove it They are satisfied with attesting or even with supposing that mind can have no consciousness of anything but its own states Other philosophers as I have said maintain that things which have a real existence are the very things we perceive It is Thomas Reid who has upheld in some passages of his writings at all events the theory of instantaneous perception or intuition It has also been defended by Hamilton in a more explicit manner eleven It has been taken up again in recent years by a profound and subtle philosopher M Bergson who unable to admit that the nervous system is a substratum of knowledge and serves us as a percipient takes it to be solely a motor organ and urges that the sensory parts of the system that is to say the centripetal optic acoustic c nerves do not call forth when excited any kind of sensation their sole purpose being to convey disturbances from periphery to periphery or say from external objects to the muscles of the body This hypothesis surely a little difficult to comprehend places if I mistake not the mind as a power of perception and representation within the interval comprised between the external object and the body so that the mind is in direct contact with external objects and knows them as they are It will be noticed that these three interpretations the spiritualistic the experimental and the metaphysical are in formal opposition with that which I have set forth earlier in these pages They deny the supposition that the nervous system serves us as an intermediary with nature and that it transforms nature before bringing it to our consciousness And it might seem that by contradicting my fundamental proposition those three new hypotheses must lead to a totally different conclusion Now this is not so at all The conclusion I have enunciated remains entirely sound notwithstanding this change in the starting point and for the following reason It is easy to see that we cannot represent to ourselves the inner structure of matter by using all our sensations without distinction because it is impossible to bring all these sensations within one single and identical synthetic construction for this they are too dissimilar Thus we should try in vain to unite in any kind of scheme a movement of molecules and an odour these elements are so heterogeneous that there is no way of joining them together and combining them The physicists have more or less consciously perceived this and not being able to overcome by a frontal attack the difficulty created by the heterogeneity of our sensations they have turned its flank The ingenious artifice they have devised consists in retaining only some of these sensations and in rejecting the remainder the first being considered as really representing the essence of matter and the latter as the effects of the former on our organs of sense the first being reputed to be true we may say and the second being reputed false that is subjective that is not representing the X of matter twelve I have refuted this argument by showing that all our sensations without exception are subjective and equally false in regard to the X of matter and that no one of them consequently has any claim to explain the others Now by a new interpretation we are taught that all sensations are equally true and that all faithfully represent the great X If they be all equally true it is absolutely the same as if they were all false no one sensation can have any privilege over the others none can be truer than the others none can be capable of explaining the others none can usurp to itself the sole right of representing the essence of matter and we thus find ourselves in this case as in the preceding in presence of the insurmountable difficulty of creating a synthesis with heterogeneous elements All that has been said above is summed up in the following points one Of the external world we only know our sensations All the physical properties of matter resolve themselves for us into sensations present past or possible We may not say that it is by the intermediary by the means of sensation that we know these properties for that would mean that the properties are distinct from the sensations Objects are to us in reality only aggregates of sensations two The sensations belong to the different organs of the senses sight hearing touch the muscular sense c Whatever be the sense affected one sensation has the same rights as the others from the point of view of the cognition of external objects It is impossible to distinguish them into subjective and objective by giving to this distinction the meaning that certain sensations represent objects as they are while certain others simply represent our manner of feeling This is an illegitimate distinction since all sensations have the same physiological condition the excitement of a sensory nerve and result from the properties of this nerve when stimulated three Consequently it is impossible for us to form a conception of matter in terms of movement and to explain by the modalities of movement the properties of bodies for this theory amounts to giving to certain sensations especially those of the muscular sense the hegemony over the others We cannot explain we have not the right to explain one sensation by another and the mechanical theory of matter has simply the value of a symbol FOOTNOTES Footnote ten See p

MIND CHAPTER I THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN COGNITION thirteen AND ITS OBJECT After having thus studied matter and reduced it to sensations we shall apply the same method of analysis to mind and inquire whether mind possesses any characteristic which allows it to be distinguished from matter Before going any further let me clear up an ambiguity All the first part of this work has been devoted to the study of what is known to us in and by sensation and I have taken upon myself without advancing any kind of justifying reason to call that which is known to us by this method by the name of matter thus losing sight of the fact that matter only exists by contra distinction and opposition to mind and that if mind did not exist neither would matter I have thus appeared to prejudge the question to be resolved The whole of this terminology must now be considered as having simply a conventional value and must be set aside for the present These are the precise terms in which this question presents itself to my mind A part of the knowable consists in sensations We must therefore without troubling to style this aggregate of sensations matter rather than mind make an analysis of the phenomena known by the name of mind and see whether they differ from the preceding ones Let us therefore make an inventory of mind By the process of enumeration we find quoted as psychological phenomena the sensations the perceptions the ideas the recollections the reasonings the emotions the desires the imaginations and the acts of attention and of will These appear to be at the first glance the elements of mind but on reflection one perceives that these elements belong to two distinct categories of which it is easy to recognise the duality although in fact and in reality these two elements are constantly combined The first of these elements may receive the generic name of objects of cognition or objects known and the second that of acts of cognition Here are a few examples of concrete facts which only require a rapid analysis to make their double nature plain In a sensation which we feel are two things a particular state or an object which one knows and the act of knowing it of feeling it of taking cognisance of it in other words every sensation comprises an impression and a cognition In a recollection there is in like manner a certain image of the past and the fact consisting in the taking cognisance of this image It is in other terms the distinction between the intelligence and the object Similarly all reasoning has an object there must be matter on which to reason whether this matter be supplied by the facts or the ideas Again a desire a volition an act of reflection has need of a point of application One does not will in the air one wills something one does not reflect in the void one reflects over a fact or over some difficulty We may then provisionally distinguish in an inventory of the mind a something which is perceived understood desired or willed and beyond that the fact of perceiving of understanding or desiring or of willing To illustrate this distinction by an example I shall say that an analogous separation can be effected in an act of vision by showing that the act of vision which is a concrete operation comprises two distinct elements the object seen and the eye which sees But this is of course only a rough comparison of which we shall soon see the imperfections when we are further advanced in the study of the question To this activity which exists and manifests itself in the facts of feeling perceiving c we can give a name in order to identify and recognise it we will call it the consciousness fourteen la conscience and we will call object everything which is not the act of consciousness After this preliminary distinction to which we shall often refer we will go over the principal manifestations of the mind and we will first study the objects of cognition reserving for another chapter the study of the acts of cognition that is to say of consciousness We will thus examine successively sensation idea emotion and will It has been often maintained that the peculiar property of mind is to perceive sensations It has also been said that thought that is the property of representing to one s self that which does not exist distinguishes mind from matter Lastly it has not failed to be affirmed that one thing which the mind brings into the material world is its power of emotion and moralists choosing somewhat arbitrarily among certain emotions have said that the mind is the creator of goodness We will endeavour to analyse these different affirmations FOOTNOTES Footnote thirteen See Note three sup on p fifteen ED Footnote fourteen The word conscience is one of those which has been used in the greatest number of different meanings Let it be at least understood that I use it here in an intellectual and not a moral sense I do not attach to the conscience the idea of a moral approbation or disapprobation of a duty of a remorse The best example to illustrate conscience has perhaps been formed by LADD It is the contrast between a person awake and sleeping a dreamless sleep The first has consciousness of a number of things the latter has consciousness of nothing Let me now add that we distinguish from consciousness that multitude of things of which one has consciousness of Of these we make the object of consciousness Conscience has throughout been rendered consciousness ED CHAPTER II DEFINITION OF SENSATION When making the analysis of matter we impliedly admitted two propositions first that sensation is the tertium quid which is interposed between the excitant of our sensory nerves and ourselves secondly that the aggregate of our sensations is all we can know of the outer world so that it is correct to define this last as the collection of our present past and possible sensations It is not claimed that the outer world is nothing else than this but it is claimed with good reason that the outer world is nothing else to us It would be possible to draw from the above considerations a clear definition of sensation and especially it would be possible to decide henceforth from the foregoing whether sensation is a physical or a mental phenomenon and whether it belongs to matter or to mind This is the important point the one which we now state and which we will endeavour to resolve To make the question clearer we will begin it afresh as if it were new and as if the facts hitherto analysed did not already prejudge the solution Let us begin by giving a definition of sensation from the point of view of experimental psychology Sensation then is the phenomenon which is produced and which one experiences when an excitant has just acted on one of our organs of sense This phenomenon is therefore composed of two parts an action exercised from outside by some body or other on our nervous substance and then the fact of feeling this action This fact of feeling this state of consciousness is necessary to constitute sensation when it does not exist it is preferable to give the phenomenon another name otherwise the fault is committed of mixing up separate facts Physiologists have on this point some faults of terminology with which to reproach themselves for they have employed the word sensibility with too little of the critical spirit Sensibility being capacity for sensation presupposes like sensation itself consciousness It has therefore been wrong in physiology to speak of the sensibility of the tissues and organs which like the vegetable tissues or the animal organs of vegetative life properly speaking feel nothing but react by rapid or slow movements to the excitements they are made to receive Reaction by a movement or any kind of modification to an excitement does not constitute a sensation unless consciousness is joined with it and consequently it would be wiser to give unfelt excitements and reactions the name of excitability The clearest examples of sensation are furnished by the study of man and are taken from cases where we perceive an external object The object produces upon us an action and this action is felt only in such cases the fact of sensation comprises but a very small part of the event It only corresponds by definition to the actual action of the object Analysis after analysis has shown that we constantly perceive far beyond this actual action of objects Our mind as we say outruns our senses To our sensations images come to attach themselves which result from sensations anteriorly felt in analogous circumstances These images produce in us an illusion and we take them for sensations so that we think we perceive something which is but a remembrance or an idea the reason being that our mind cannot remain in action in the presence of a sensation but unceasingly labours to throw light upon it to sound it and to arrive at its meaning and consequently alters it by adding to it This addition is so constant so unavoidable that the existence of an isolated sensation which should be perceived without the attachment of images without modification or interpretation is well nigh unrealisable in the consciousness of an adult It is a myth Let us however imagine this isolation to be possible and that we have before us a sensation free from any other element What is this sensation Does it belong to the domain of physical or of moral things Is it a state of matter or of mind I can neither doubt nor dispute that sensation is in part a psychological phenomenon since I have admitted by the very definition I have given of it that sensation implies consciousness We must therefore acknowledge those who define it as a state of consciousness to be right but it would be more correct to call it the consciousness of a state and it is with regard to the nature of this state that the question presents itself It is only this state which we will now take into consideration It is understood that sensation contains both an impression and a cognition Let us leave till later the study of the act of cognition and deal with the impression Is this impression now of a physical or a mental nature Both the two opposing opinions have been upheld In this there is nothing astonishing for in metaphysics one finds the expression of every possible opinion But a large an immense majority of philosophers has declared in favour of the psychological nature of the impression Without even making the above distinction between the impression and the act of cognition it has been admitted that the entire sensation taken en bloc is a psychological phenomenon a modification of our consciousness and a peculiar state of our minds Descartes has even employed this very explicit formula The objects we perceive are within our understanding It is curious to see how little trouble authors take to demonstrate this opinion they declare it to be self evident which is a convenient way of avoiding all proof John Stuart Mill has no hesitation in affirming that The mind in perceiving external objects can only take notice of its own conditions And Renouvier expresses the same arbitrary assertion with greater obscurity when he writes The monad is constituted by this relation the connection of the subject with the object within the subject fifteen In other words it is laid down as an uncontrovertible principle that the mental can only enter into direct relations with the mental That is what may be called the principle of Idealism This principle seems to me very disputable and it is to me an astonishing thing that the most resolute of sceptics Hume for example should have accepted it without hesitation I shall first enunciate my personal opinion then make known another which only differs from mine by a difference of words and finally I will discuss a third opinion which seems to me radically wrong My personal opinion is that sensation is of a mixed nature It is psychical in so far as it implies an act of consciousness and physical otherwise The impression on which the act of cognition operates that impression which is directly produced by the excitant of the nervous system seems to me without any doubt to be of an entirely physical nature This opinion which I make mine own has only been upheld by very few philosophers Thomas Reid perhaps and William Hamilton for certain but neither has perceived its deep lying consequences What are the arguments on which I rely They are of different orders and are arguments of fact and arguments of logic I shall first appeal to the natural conviction of those who have never ventured into metaphysics So long as no endeavour has been made to demonstrate the contrary to them they believe with a natural and naive belief that matter is that which is seen touched and felt and that consequently matter and our senses are confounded They would be greatly astonished to be informed that when we appear to perceive the outer world we simply perceive our ideas that when we take the train for Lyons we enter into one state of consciousness in order to attain another state of consciousness Now the adherents of this natural and naive opinion have as they say in the law the right of possession possession d etat they are not plaintiffs but defendants it is not for them to prove they are in the right it has to be proved against them that they are in the wrong Until this proof is forthcoming they have a presumption in their favour Are we here making use of the argument of common opinion of mankind of which ancient philosophy made so evident an abuse Yes and no Yes for we here adopt the general opinion No for we only adopt it till the contrary be proved But who can exhibit this proof to the contrary On a close examination of the question it will be perceived that sensation taken as an object of cognition becomes confused with the properties of physical nature and is identified with them both by its mode of apparition and by its content By its mode of apparition sensation holds itself out as independent of us for it is at every instant an unexpected revelation a source of fresh cognitions and it offers a development which takes place without and in spite of our will while its laws of company existence and of succession declare to us the order and march of the material universe Besides by its content sensation is confounded with matter When a philosopher seeks to represent to himself the properties of a material object of a brain for example in order to contrast them with the properties of a psychical activity it is the properties of sensation that he describes as material and in fact it is by sensation and sensation alone that we know these properties Sensation is so little distinct from them that it is an error to consider it as a means a process an instrument for the knowledge of matter All that we know of matter is not known in or by sensation but constitutes sensation itself it is not by the aid of sensation that we know colour colour is a sensation and the same may be said of form resistance and the whole series of the properties of matter They are only our sensations clothed with external bodies It is therefore absolutely legitimate to consider a part of our sensations the object part as being of physical nature This is the opinion to which I adhere We come to the second opinion we have formulated It is in appearance at least very different from the first Its supporters agree that the entire sensation taken en bloc and unanalysed is to be termed a psychological phenomenon In this case the act of consciousness included in the sensation continues to represent a psychical element They suppose besides that the object on which this act operates is psychical and finally they suppose that this object or this impression was provoked in us by a physical reality which is kept in concealment which we do not perceive and which remains unknowable This opinion is nowise absurd in itself but let us examine its consequences If we admit this thesis that sensations are manifestations of mind which although provoked by material causes are of a purely mental nature we are forced to the conclusion that we know none of the properties of material bodies since we do not enter into relations with these bodies The object we apprehend by perception is according to this hypothesis solely mental To draw therefrom any notion on material objects it would have to be supposed that by some mysterious action the mental which we know resembles the physical which we do not know that it retains the reflection of it or even that it allows its colour and form to pass like a transparent pellicle applied on the contour of bodies Here are hypotheses very odd in their realism Unless we accept them how is it comprehensible that we can know anything whatever of physical nature We should be forced to acknowledge following the example of several philosophers that the perception of the physical is an illusion As a compensation that which this system takes from matter it attributes to mind which turns our familiar conceptions upside down The qualities of sensation detached from matter will when applied to mind change its physiognomy There are sensations of extent weight space and form If these sensations are turned into psychical events we shall have to grant to these events to these manifestations of the mind the properties of extent of weight of form We shall have to say that mind is a resisting thing and that it has colour It may be said that this fantasy of language is not very serious So be it But then what remains of the dualism of mind and matter It is at least singularly compromised We may continue to suppose that matter exists and even that it is matter which provokes in our mind those events which we call our sensations but we cannot know if by its nature its essence this matter differs from that of mind since we shall be ignorant of all its properties Our ignorance on this point will be so complete that we shall not even be able to know whether any state which we call mental may not be physical The distinction between physical and mental will have lost its raison d etre since the existence of the physical is necessary to give a meaning to the existence of the mental We are brought whether we like it or not to an experimental monism which is neither psychical nor physical panpsychism and panmaterialism will have the same meaning sixteen But this monism can be only transitory for it is more in the words than in the thing itself It is brought about by the terminology adopted by the resolution to call mental all the phenomena that it is possible to know Luckily our speculations are not at the mercy of such trifling details as the details of language Whatever names may be given to this or that it will remain none the less true that nature will continue to present to us a contrast between phenomena which are flints pieces of iron clods of earth brains and some other phenomena which we call states of consciousness Whatever be the value of this dualism it will have to be discussed even in the hypothesis of panpsychism seventeen As for myself I shall also continue to make a distinction between what I have called objects of cognition and acts of cognition because this is the most general distinction that can be traced in the immense field of our cognitions There is no other which succeeds to the same degree in dividing this field into two moreover this distinction is derived directly from observation and does not depend for its validity on the physical or mental nature of the objects Here is then a duality and this duality even when it does not bear the names physical and moral should necessarily play the same part since it corresponds to the same distinction of fact In the end nothing will be changed and this second opinion must gradually merge into the one first stated by me and of which I take the responsibility We may therefore put it out of consideration I have mentioned a third opinion stating that it appeared to me to be radically false Outwardly it is the same as the last looked at superficially it seems even confused with it but in reality it is of a totally different nature It supposes that sensation is an entirely psychological phenomenon Then having laid down this thesis it undertakes to demonstrate it by asserting that sensation differs from the physical fact which amounts to supposing that we cannot know anything but sensations and that physical facts are known to us directly and by another channel This is where the contradiction comes in It is so apparent that one wonders how it has been overlooked by so many excellent minds In order to remove it it will be sufficient to recollect that we do not know anything other than sensations it is therefore impossible to make any distinction between the physical object and the object of cognition contained in every sensation The line of demarcation between the physical and the moral cannot pass this way since it would separate facts which are identical We can therefore only deplore the error of all those who to express the difference between mind and matter have sought a contrast between sensation and physical facts Physiologists with hardly an exception have fallen into this error when contemplating in imagination the material working of the brain they have thought that between the movement of cerebral matter and sensation there was a gulf fixed The comparison to have been correct required to be presented in quite another way A parallel for instance should have been drawn between a certain cerebral movement and the act of consciousness and there should have been said The cerebral motion is the physical phenomenon the act of consciousness the psychical But this distinction has not been made It is sensation en bloc which is compared to the cerebral movement as witness a few passages I will quote as a matter of curiosity which are borrowed from philosophers and especially from physiologists While philosophers take as a principle of idealism that the mental can only know the mental physiologists take as a like principle the heterogeneity existing or supposed to exist between the nerve impression and the sensation However much we may follow the excitement through the whole length of the nerve writes Lotze eighteen or cause it to change its form a thousand times and to metamorphose itself into more and more delicate and subtle movements we shall never succeed in showing that a movement thus produced can by its very nature cease to exist as movement and be reborn in the shape of sensation It will be seen that it is on the opposition between molecular movement and sensation that Lotze insists In like manner Ferrier But how is it that the molecular modifications in the cerebral cells coincide with the modifications of the consciousness how for instance do luminous vibrations falling upon the retina excite the modification of consciousness called visual sensation These are problems we cannot solve We may succeed in determining the exact nature of the molecular changes which take place in the cerebral cells when a sensation is felt but this will not bring us an inch nearer to the explanation of the fundamental nature of sensation Finally Du Bois Reymond in his famous discussion in eighteen eighty on the seven enigmas of the world speaks somewhat as follows The astronomical knowledge of the encephalon that is the most intimate to which we can aspire only reveals to us matter in motion But no arrangement nor motion of material particles can act as a bridge by which we can cross over into the domain of intelligence What imaginable link is there between certain movements of certain molecules in my brain on the one hand and on the other hand primitive undefinable undeniable facts such as I have the sensation of softness I smell the odour of a rose I hear the sound of an organ I see a red colour c These three quotations show very conclusively that their authors thought they could establish the heterogeneity of the two phenomena by opposing matter to sensation It must be recognised that they have fallen into a singular error for matter whatever it may be is for us nothing but sensation matter in motion I have often repeated is only a quite special kind of sensation the organic matter of the brain with its whirling movements of atoms is only sensation Consequently to oppose the molecular changes in the brain to the sensation of red blue green or to an undefined sensation of any sort is not crossing a gulf and bringing together things which cannot be compared it is simply comparing one sensation to another sensation There is evidently something equivocal in all this and I pointed this out when outlining and discussing the different theories of matter It consists in taking from among the whole body of sensations certain of them which are considered to be special and which are then invested with the privilege of being more important than the rest and the causes of all the others This is about as illegitimate as to choose among men a few individuals to whom is attributed the privilege of commanding others by divine right These privileged sensations which belong to the sight the touch and the muscular sense and which are of large extent are indeed extensive They have been unduly considered as objective and as representing matter because they are better known and measurable while the other sensations the unextensive sensations of the other senses are considered as subjective for the reasons that they are less known and less measurable and they are therefore looked on as connected with our sensibility our Ego and are used to form the moral world We cannot subscribe to this way of establishing the contrast between matter and thought since it is simply a contrast between two categories of sensations and I have already asserted that the partitioning out of sensations into two groups having different objective values is arbitrary FOOTNOTES

together with the two subsequent are borrowed from an excellent lecture by FLOURNOY on Metaphysique et Physiologie Georg Geneva eighteen ninety CHAPTER III DEFINITION OF THE IMAGE Going on with our inventory after sensations come images ideas and concepts in fact quite a collection of phenomena which are generally considered as essentially psychological So long as one does not carefully analyse the value of ideas one remains under the impression that ideas form a world apart which is sharply distinguished from the physical world and behaves towards it as an antithesis For is not conception the contrary of perception and is not the ideal in opposition to reality Thoughts have some characteristics of fancy of freedom even of unreality which are wanting to the prosaicness of heavy material things Thoughts sport with the relations of time and space they fly in a moment across the gulf between the most distant objects they travel back up the course of time they bring near to us events centuries away they conceive objects which are unreal they imagine combinations which upset all physical laws and further these conceptions remain invisible to others as well as to ourselves They are outside the grip of reality and constitute a world which becomes for any one with the smallest imagination as great and as important as the world called real One may call in evidence the poets novelists artists and the dreamers of all kinds When life becomes too hard for us we fly to the ideal world there to seek forgetfulness or compensation It is therefore easy to understand that it should have been proposed to carry into ideation the dichotomy between the physical and the moral Many excellent authors have made the domain of the mind begin in the ideal Matter is that which does not think Descartes in his Discours de la Methode fourth part remarking that he may pretend not to have a body and that there is no world or place in which he exists but that he cannot pretend that he does not think concludes by saying that the mind is a substance all whose essence or nature is merely to think and which has no need of either place or any other material thing in order to exist in short that the soul is absolutely distinct from the body nineteen Let us then examine in what measure this separation between perception and ideation can be legitimately established If we accept this separation we must abandon the distinction I proposed between acts and objects of cognition or at least admit that this distinction does not correspond to that between the physical and the moral since thoughts images recollections and even the most abstract conceptions all constitute in a certain sense objects of cognition They are phenomena which when analysed are clearly composed of two parts an object and a cognition Their logical composition is indeed that of an external perception and there is in ideation exactly the same duality as in sensation Consequently if we maintain the above distinction as a principle of classification for all knowable phenomena we shall be obliged to assign the same position to ideas as to sensations The principal difference we notice between sensation and idea is it would seem the character of unreality in the last named but this opposition has not the significance we imagine Our mental vision only assumes this wholly special character of unreality under conditions in which it is unable to harmonise with the real vision Taine has well described the phases of the reduction of the image by sensation it is at the moment when it receives the shock of an image which contradicts it that the image appears as illusory twenty Let us suppose that we are sitting down dreaming and watching the passing by of our images If at this moment a sudden noise calls us back to reality the whole of our mental phantasmagoria disappears as if by the wave of a magic wand and it is by thus vanishing that the image shows its falsity It is false because it does not accord with the present reality But when we do not notice a disagreement between these two modes of cognition both alike give us the impression of reality If I evoke a reminiscence and dwell attentively on the details I have the impression that I am in face of the reality itself I feel as if I were there still is a common saying and among the recollections I evoke there are some which give me the same certitude as the perception of the moment Certain witnesses would write their depositions with their blood One does not see this every day but still one does see it Further there are thousands of circumstances where the ideation is neither in conflict with the perception nor isolated from it but in logical continuity with it This continuity must even be considered as the normal condition We think in the direction of that which we perceive The image seems to prepare the adaptation of the individual to his surroundings it creates the foresight the preparation of the means and in a word everything which constitutes for us a final cause Now it is very necessary that the image appear real to be usefully the substitute of the sensation past or to come Let us establish one thing more Acting as a substitute the image not only appears as real as the sensation it appears to be of the same nature and the proof is that they are confounded one with the other and that those who are not warned of the fact take one for the other Every time a body is perceived as I previously explained there are images which affix themselves to the sensation unnoticed We think we perceive when we are really remembering or imagining This addition of the image to the sensation is not a petty and insignificant accessory it forms the major part perhaps nine tenths of perception Hence arise the illusions of the senses which are the result not of sensations but of ideas From this also comes the difficulty of knowing exactly what under certain circumstances is observation or perception where the fact perceived ends and where conjecture begins Once acquainted with all these possibilities of errors how can we suppose a radical separation between the sensation and the image Examined more closely images appear to us to be divisible into as many kinds as sensations visual images correspond to visual sensations tactile to tactile and so on with all the senses That which we experience in the form of sensation we can experience over again in the form of image and the repetition generally weaker in intensity and poorer in details may under certain favourable circumstances acquire an exceptional intensity and even equal reality as is shown by hallucinations Here certainly are very sound reasons for acknowledging that the images which are at the bottom of our thoughts and form the object of them are the repetition the modification the transposition the analysis or the synthesis of sensations experienced in the past and possessing in consequence all the characteristics of bodily states I believe that there is neither more nor less spirituality in the idea than in the sensation That which forms its spirituality is the implied act of cognition but its object is material I foresee a final objection I shall be told that even when the unreality of the image is not the rule and appears only under certain circumstances it nevertheless exists This is an important fact It has been argued from the unreality of dreams and hallucinations in which we give a body to our ideas that we do not in reality perceive external bodies but simply psychical states and modifications of our souls If our ideas consist according to the hypothesis I uphold in physical impressions which are felt we shall be told that these particular impressions must participate in the nature of everything physical that they are real and always real that they cannot be unreal fictitious and mendacious and that consequently the fictitious character of ideation becomes inexplicable Two words of answer are necessary to this curious argument which is nothing less than an effort to define the mental by the unreal and to suppose that an appearance cannot be physical No doubt we say every image fantastical as it may seem as signification is real in a certain sense since it is the perception of a physical impression but this physical nature of images does not prevent our making a distinction between true and false images To take an analogous example we are given a sheet of proofs to correct we delete certain redundant letters and although they are printed with the same type as the other letters we have the right to say they are false Again in a musical air we may hear a false note though it is as real as the others since it has been played This distinction between reality and truth ought to be likewise applied to mental images All are real but some are false They are false when they do not accord with the whole reality they are true when they agree and every image is partly false because being an image it does not wholly accord with the actual perceptions It creates a belief in a perception which does not occur and by developing these ideas we could easily demonstrate how many degrees of falsehood there are Physiologically we may very easily reconcile the falsity of the image with the physical character of the impression on which it is based The image results from a partial cerebral excitement which sensation results from an excitement which also acts upon the peripheral sensory nerves and corresponds to an external object an excitant which the image does not possess This difference explains how it is that the image while resulting from a physical impression may yet be in a great number of cases declared false that is to say may be recognised as in contradiction to the perceptions To other minds perhaps metaphysical reasoning will be more satisfactory For those we propose to make a distinction between two notions Existence or Reality on the one hand and Truth on the other Existence or Reality is that of which we have an immediate apprehension This apprehension occurs in several ways In perception in the first place I perceive the reality of my body of a table the sky the earth in proportion to my perception of them They exist for if they did not I could not perceive them Another way of understanding reality is conception or thought However much I may represent a thing to myself as imaginary it nevertheless exists in a certain manner since I can represent it to myself I therefore in this case say that it is real or it exists It is of course understood that in these definitions I am going against the ordinary acceptation of the terms I am taking the liberty of proposing new meanings This reality is then perceived in one case and conceived in the other Perceptibility or conceivability are then the two forms which reality may assume But reality is not synonymous with truth notwithstanding the custom to the contrary we may well introduce a difference between these two terms Reality is that which is perceived or conceived truth is that which accords with the whole of our knowledge Reality is a function of the senses or of ideation truth is a function of reasoning or of the reason For cognition to be complete it requires the aid of all these functions And in fact what does conception by itself give It allows us to see if a thing is capable of representation This is not a common place thing I will observe in passing for many things we name are not capable of representation and there is often a criticism to be made we think we are representing and we are not What is capable of representation exists as a representation but is it true Some philosophers have imagined so but they are mistaken what we succeed in conceiving is alone possible Let us now take the Perceptible Is what one perceives true Yes in most cases it is so in fact but an isolated perception may be false and disturbed by illusions of all kinds It is all very well to say I see I touch There is no certainty through the senses alone in many circumstances that the truth has been grasped If I am shown the spirit of a person I know to be dead I shall not notwithstanding the testimony of my eyes believe it to be true for this apparition would upset all my system of cognitions Truth is that which being deemed conceivable and being really perceived has also the quality of finding its place its relation and its confirmation in the whole mass of cognitions previously acquired These distinctions twenty one if developed would readily demonstrate that the advantages of observation are not eclipsed by those of speculation and that those of speculation in their turn do not interfere with those of observation But we have not time to develop these rules of logic it will be sufficient to point out their relation to the question of the reality of mental images Here are my conclusions in two words Physical phenomena and images are always real since they are perceived or conceived what is sometimes wanting to them and makes them false is that they do not accord with the rest of our cognitions twenty two Thus then are all objections overruled in my opinion at least We can now consider the world of ideas as a physical world but it is one of a peculiar nature which is not like the other accessible to all and is subject to its own laws which are laws of association By these very different characteristics it separates itself so sharply from the outer world that all endeavour to bring the two together seems shocking and it is very easy to understand that many minds should wish to remain faithful to the conception that ideas form a mental or moral world No metaphysical reasoning could prevail against this sentiment and we must give up the idea of destroying it But we think we have shown that idea like sensation comprises at the same time the physical and the mental FOOTNOTES Footnote nineteen Let me say in passing that this separation that DESCARTES thinks he can establish between perception and ideation is only conceivable on condition that it be not too closely examined and that no exact definition of ideation be given If we remark in fact that all thought is a reproduction in some degree of a sensation we arrive at this conclusion that a thought operated by a soul distinct from the body would be a thought completely void and without object it would be the thought of nothingness It is not therefore conceivable Consequently the criterion already so dangerous which DESCARTES constantly employs to wit that what we clearly conceive is true cannot apply to thought if we take the trouble to analyse it and to replace a purely verbal conception by intuition Footnote twenty I somewhat regret that TAINE fell into the common place idea of the opposition of the brain and thought he took up again this old idea without endeavouring to analyse it and only made it his own by the ornamentation of his style And as his was a mind of powerful systematisation the error which he committed led him into much wider consequences than the error of a more common mind would have done Footnote twenty one I have just come across them again in an ingenious note of C L HERRICK The Logical and Psychological Distinction between the True and the Real Psych reverend May nineteen oh four I entirely agree with this author But it is not he who exercised a suggestion over my mind it was M BERGSON See Matiere et Memoire p one hundred fifty nine Footnote twenty two In order to remain brief I have not thought fit to allude in the text to a question of metaphysics which closely depends on the one broached by me the existence of an outer world Philosophers who define sensation as a modality of our Ego are much embarrassed later in demonstrating the existence of an outer world Having first admitted that our perception of it is illusory since when we think we perceive this world we have simply the feeling of the modalities of our Ego they find themselves powerless to demonstrate that this illusion corresponds to a truth and invoke in despair for the purpose of their demonstration instinct hallucination or some a priori law of the mind The position we have taken in the discussion is far more simple Since every sensation is a fragment of matter perceived by a mind the aggregate of sensations constitutes the aggregate of matter There is in this no deceptive appearance and consequently no need to prove a reality distinct from appearances As to the argument drawn from dreams and hallucinations which might be brought against this I have shown how it is set aside by a distinction between perceptibility and truth It is no longer a matter of perception but of reasoning In other words all that we see even in dreams is real but is not in its due place CHAPTER IV DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS 
296_142727_000002_000000	train-clean-360	After sensations and images we have to name among the phenomena of consciousness the whole series of affective states our pleasures and our pains our joys and our griefs our sentiments our emotions and our passions 
none	none	It is universally admitted that these states are of a mental nature for several reasons one We never objectivate them as we do our sensations but we constantly consider them as indwelling or subjective states This rule however allows an exception for the pleasure and the pain termed physical which are often localised in particular parts of our bodies although the position attributed to them is less precise than with indifferent sensations two We do not alienate them as we do our indifferent sensations The sensations of weight of colour and of form serve us for the construction of bodies which appear to us as perceived by us but as being other than ourselves On the contrary we constantly and without hesitation refer our emotional states to our Ego 
296_142727_000002_000005	train-clean-360	It is I who suffer we say I who complain I who hope 
296_142727_000002_000006	train-clean-360	It is true that this attribution is not absolutely characteristic of mental phenomena for it happens that we put a part of our Ego into material objects such as our bodies and even into objects separate from our bodies and whose sole relation to us is that of a legal proprietorship 
296_142727_000002_000007	train-clean-360	We must guard against the somewhat frequent error of identifying the Ego with the psychical 
296_142727_000003_000000	train-clean-360	These two reasons sufficiently explain the tendency to see only psychological states in the emotional ones and in fact those authors who have sought to oppose mind to matter have not failed to introduce emotion into their parallel as representing the essence of mind 
296_142727_000003_000001	train-clean-360	On this point I will recall the fine ironical image used by Tyndall the illustrious English physicist to show the abyss which separates thought from the molecular states of the brain 
none	none	Let us suppose he says that the sentiment love for example corresponds to a right hand spiral movement of the molecules of the brain and the sentiment hatred to a left hand spiral movement 
296_142727_000003_000003	train-clean-360	We should then know that when we love a movement is produced in one direction and when we hate in another 
296_142727_000003_000004	train-clean-360	But the Why would remain without an answer 
296_142727_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The question of knowing what place in our metaphysical theory we ought to secure for emotion seems difficult to resolve and we even find some pleasure in leaving it in suspense in order that it may be understood that a metaphysician is not compelled to explain everything 
296_142727_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Besides the difficulties which atop us here are peculiarly of a psychological order 
296_142727_000004_000002	train-clean-360	They proceed from the fact that studies on the nature of the emotions are still very little advanced The physical conditions of these states are pretty well known and their psychical and social effects have been abundantly described but very little is known as to what distinguishes an emotion from a thought 
296_142727_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Two principal opinions may be upheld in the actual state of our acquaintance with the psychology of the feelings 
296_142727_000005_000001	train-clean-360	When we endeavour to penetrate their essential and final nature we have a choice between two contrary theories 
none	none	The first and traditional one consists in seeing in emotion a phenomenon sui generis this is very simple and leaves nothing more to be said 
296_142727_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The second bears the name of the intellectualist theory 
296_142727_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It consists in expunging the characteristic of the affective states 
none	none	We consider them as derivative forms of particular modes of cognition and they are only confused intelligence This intellectualist thesis is of early date it will be found in Herbart who by the by gave it a peculiar form by causing the play of images to intervene in the formation of the feelings 
296_142727_000007_000003	train-clean-360	However this particular point is of slight Importance 
296_142727_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The intellectualist theory is more vast than Herbartism it exists in all doctrines in which the characteristic difference between thought and feeling is expunged and feeling is brought back to thought 
none	none	One of the clearest means of so doing consists in only seeing in the feeling the fact of perceiving something 
296_142727_000007_000006	train-clean-360	To perceive is in fact the property of intelligence to reason to imagine to judge to understand is always in a certain sense to perceive 
296_142727_000007_000007	train-clean-360	It has been imagined that emotion is nothing else than a perception of a certain kind an intellectual act strictly comparable to the contemplation of a landscape 
296_142727_000007_000008	train-clean-360	Only in the place of a landscape with placid features you must put a storm a cataclysm of nature and instead of supposing this storm outside us let it burst within us let it reach us not by the outer senses of sight and condition but by the inner senses 
296_142727_000007_000009	train-clean-360	What we then perceive will be an emotion 
none	none	Such is the theory that two authors W James and Lange happened to discover almost at the same time Lange treating it as a physiologist and W James as a philosopher 
296_142727_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Their theory at first sight appears singular like everything which runs counter to our mental habits 
none	none	It lays down that the symptoms which we all till now have considered as the physiological consequence the translation and the distant effects of the emotions constitute their essential base These effects are the expression of the physiognomy the gesture the cry and the speech or the reflex action on the circulation the pallor or blushing the heat mounting to the head or the cold of the shiver which passes over the body 
296_142727_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Or it is the heart which hastens or slackens its beats or makes them irregular or enfeebles or augments them 
none	none	Or the respiration which changes its rhythm or increases or is suspended 
296_142727_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Or else it is the secretion of the saliva or of the sweat which flows in abundance or dries up 
296_142727_000008_000008	train-clean-360	Or the muscular force which is increased or decays 
296_142727_000008_000009	train-clean-360	Or the almost undefinable organic troubles revealed to us by the singing in the ears constriction of the epigastrium the jerks the trembling vertigo or nausea all this collection of organic troubles which comes more or less confusedly to our consciousness under the form of tactile muscular thermal and other sensations 
296_142727_000008_000010	train-clean-360	Until now this category of phenomena has been somewhat neglected because we saw in it effects and consequences of which the role in emotion itself seemed slight since if they could have been suppressed it was supposed that emotion would still remain 
296_142727_000008_000011	train-clean-360	The new theory commences by changing the order of events 
none	none	It places the physical symptoms of the emotions at the very beginning and considers them the direct effects of the external excitant which is expressed by this elegant formula It used to be said I perceive a danger I am frightened I tremble Now we must say I tremble before a danger first and it is after having trembled that I am frightened This is not a change in order only it is something much more serious 
296_142727_000008_000013	train-clean-360	The change is directed to the nature of emotion 
296_142727_000008_000014	train-clean-360	It is considered to exist in the organic derangements indicated above 
296_142727_000008_000015	train-clean-360	These derangements are the basis of emotion its physical basis and to be moved is to perceive them 
296_142727_000008_000016	train-clean-360	Take away from the consciousness this physical reflex and emotion ceases It is no longer anything but an idea 
296_142727_000009_000000	train-clean-360	This theory has at least the merit of originality 
none	none	It also pleases one by its great clearness an entirely intellectual clearness we may say for it renders emotion comprehensible by enunciating it in terms of cognition 
296_142727_000009_000002	train-clean-360	It eliminates all difference which may exist between a perception and an emotion 
296_142727_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Emotion is no longer anything but a certain kind of perception the perception of the organic sensations 
296_142727_000010_000000	train-clean-360	This reduction if admitted would much facilitate the introduction of emotion into our system which being founded on the distinction between the consciousness and the object is likewise an intellectualist system 
296_142727_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The definition of emotion as it is taught by W James seems expressly made for us who are seeking to resolve all intellectual states into physical impressions accompanied by consciousness 
296_142727_000011_000000	train-clean-360	By the side of emotion we may place as demanding the same analytical study the feeling of effort 
none	none	We ought to inquire with effort as has been done with emotion what is the psychological nature of this phenomenon and in the same way that there exists an intellectualist theory of the emotions viz that of James who reduces all the history of the emotions to intelligence so there exists an intellectualist theory of effort which likewise tends to bring back all will to intelligence 
296_142727_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It is again the same author that true genius W James who has attempted this reduction

296_142727_000011_000005	train-clean-360	To be conscious of an effort would then be nothing else than to receive all these centripetal sensations and what proves this is that the consciousness of effort when most clearly manifested is accompanied by some muscular energy some strong contraction or some respiratory trouble and yields if we render the respiration again regular and put the muscles back into repose

none	none	CHAPTER V DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS THE RELATION SUBJECT OBJECT After having separated from the consciousness that which it is not let us try to define what it is This and the two following chapters are devoted to this study A theory has often been maintained with regard to the consciousness namely that it supposes a relation between two terms a subject and an object and that it consists exactly in the feeling of this relation By subject is understood the something that has consciousness the object is the something of which we are conscious Every thought we are told implies subject and object the representer and the represented the sentiens and the sensum the one active the other passive the active acting on the passive the ego opposed to the non ego This opinion is almost legitimised by current language When speaking of our states of consciousness we generally say I am conscious it is I who have consciousness and we attribute to our I to our Ego to our personality the role of subject But this is not a peremptory argument in favour of the above opinion it is only a presumption and closely examined this presumption seems very weak Hitherto when analysing the part of mind we have employed non committal terms we have said that sensation implied consciousness and not that sensation implied something which is conscious twenty three The difference may appear too subtle but it is not it consists in taking from consciousness the notion of a subject being conscious and replacing it by the very act of consciousness My description applies very exactly I think to the facts When we are engaged in a sensation or when we perceive something a phenomenon occurs which simply consists in having consciousness of a thing If to this we add the idea of the subject which has consciousness we distort the event At the very moment when it is taking place it is not so complicated we complicate it by adding to it the work of reflection It is reflection which constructs the notion of the subject and it is this which afterwards introduces this construction into the states of consciousness in this way the state of consciousness by receiving this notion of subject acquires a character of duality it did not previously possess There are in short two separate acts of consciousness and one is made the subject of the other Primitively says Rabier there is neither representative nor represented there are sensations representations facts of consciousness and that is all Nothing is more exact in my opinion than this view of Condillac s that primitively the inanimate statue is entirely the sensation that it feels To itself it is all odour and all savour it is nothing more and this sensation includes no duality for the consciousness It is of an absolute simplicity Two arguments may be advanced in favour of this opinion The first is one of logic We have divided all knowledge into two groups objects of cognition and acts of cognition What is the subject of cognition Does it form a new group By no means it forms part of the first group of the object group for it is something to be known Our second argument is one of fact It consists in remembering that which in practice we understand by the subject of cognition or rather metaphorically we represent this subject to ourselves as an organ the eye that sees or the hand that touches and we represent to ourselves the relation subject object in the shape of a material relation between two distinct bodies which are separated by an interval and between which some action is produced which unites them Or else confusing the subject and the Ego which are nevertheless two different notions we place the Ego in the consciousness of the muscular effort struggling against something which resists Or finally and still more frequently we represent the subject to ourselves by confusing it with our own personality it is a part of our biography our name our profession our social status our body our past life foreshortened our character or in a word our civil personality which becomes the subject of the relation subject object We artificially endow this personality with the faculty of having consciousness and it results from this that the entity consciousness so difficult to define and to imagine profits by all this factitious addition and becomes a person visible and even very large in flesh and bone distinct from the object of cognition and capable of living a separate life It is not difficult to explain that all this clearness in the representation of ideas is acquired by a falsification of the facts So sensorial a representation of consciousness is very unfaithful for our biography does not represent what we have called acts of consciousness but a large slice of our past experience that is to say a synthesis of bygone sensations and images a synthesis of objects of consciousness therefore a complete confusion between the acts of consciousness and their objects The formation of the personality seems to me to have above all a legal and social importance twenty four It is a peculiar grouping of states of consciousness imposed by our relations with other individuals But metaphysically the subject thus understood is not distinguished from the object and there is nothing to add to our distinction between the object and the act of consciousness Those who defend the existence of the subject point out that this subject properly constitutes the Ego and that the distinction of the subject and the object corresponds to the distinction of the Ego and non Ego and furnishes the separation between the physical and the moral so long sought It is evidently very enticing to make of the Ego thus a primitive notion of the consciousness but this view of the Ego as opposed to the non Ego in no way corresponds to that of the mental and the physical The notion of the Ego is much larger much more extensible than that of the mental it is as encroaching as human pride it grasps in its conquering talons all that belongs to us for we do not in life make any great difference between what is we and what is ours an insult to our dog our dwelling or our work wounds us as much as an insult to ourselves The possessive pronoun expresses both possession and possessor In fact we consider our body as being ourselves Here then are numbers of material things introducing themselves into the category of mental things If we wished to expel them and to reduce the domain of the Ego to the domain of the mental we could only do so if we already possessed the criterion of what is essentially mental The notion of the Ego cannot therefore supply us with this criterion Another opinion consists in making of the subject a spiritual substance of which the consciousness becomes a faculty By substance is understood an entity which possesses the two following principal characteristics unity and identity this latter merging into unity for it is nothing else but the persistence of unity through the course of time Certain philosophers have asserted that through intuition we can all establish that we are a spiritual substance I am compelled to reject this idea because I think the expression spiritual substance has no meaning nothing but the sonorous value of six syllables It has also been supposed that there exists a corporeal substance hidden under the sensations in which are implanted the qualities of bodies as the various organs of a flower are in its calyx I will return later to this conception of a material substance That of a spiritual substance cannot be defended and the chief and fatal argument I urge against it is that we cannot represent it to our minds we cannot think it and we cannot see in these words spiritual substance any intelligible idea for that which is mental is limited to that which is of the consciousness So soon as we endeavour to go beyond the fact of having consciousness to imagine a particular state which must be mental one of two things happen either we only grasp the void or else we construct a material and persistent object in which we recognise psychical attributes These are two conclusions which ought to be rejected FOOTNOTES Footnote twenty three This second method of expression which I consider inexact is constantly found in DESCARTES Different philosophers have explicitly admitted that every act of cognition implies a relation subject object This is one of the corner stones of the neo criticism of RENOUVIER He asserts that all representation is double faced and that what is known to us presents itself in the character of both representative and represented He follows this up by describing separately the phenomena and laws of the representative and of the represented respectively Footnote twenty four The preceding ten lines in the text I wrote after reading a recent article of WILLIAM JAMES who wishes to show that the consciousness does not exist but results simply from the relation or the opposition raised between one part of our experience the actual experience for instance in the example of the perception of an object and another part the remembrance of our person But the argument of JAMES goes too far he is right in contesting the relation subject object but not in contesting the existence of the consciousness W JAMES Does consciousness exist in J of Philosophy c Sept nineteen oh four CHAPTER VI DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS CATEGORIES OF THE UNDERSTANDING It has often been said that the role of intelligence consists in uniting or grasping the relations of things An important question therefore to put is if we know whereof these relations consist and what is the role of the mind in the establishment of a relation It now and then happens to us to perceive an isolated object without comparing it with any other or endeavouring to find out whether it differs from or resembles another or presents with any other a relation of cause to effect or of sign to thing signified or of company existence in time and space Thus I may see a red colour and occupy all the intellect at my disposal in the perception of this colour seeing nothing but it and thinking of nothing but it Theoretically this is not impossible to conceive and practically I ask myself if these isolated and solitary acts of consciousness do not sometimes occur It certainly seems to me that I have noticed in myself moments of intellectual tonelessness when in the country during the vacation I look at the ground or the grass without thinking of anything or at least of anything but what I am looking at and without comparing my sensation with anything I do not think we should admit in principle as do many philosophers that we take no cognisance save of relations This is the principle of relativity to which so much attention has been given Taken in this narrow sense it seems to me in no way imperative for our thoughts We admit that it is very often applied but without feeling obliged to admit that it is of perpetual and necessary application These reserves once made it remains to remark that the objects we perceive very rarely present themselves in a state of perfect isolation On the contrary they are brought near to other objects by manifold relations of resemblance of difference or of connection in time or space and further they are compared with the ideas which define them best We do not have consciousness of an object but of the relations existing between several objects Relation is the new state produced by the fact that one perceives a plurality of objects and perceives them in a group Show me two colours in juxtaposition and I do not see two colours only but in addition their resemblance in colour or value Show me two lines and I do not see only their respective lengths but their difference in length Show me two points marked on a white sheet of paper and I do not see only the colour form and dimension of the points but their distance from each other In our perceptions as in our conceptions we have perpetually to do with the relations between things The more we reflect the more we understand things the more clearly we see their relations the multiplication of relations is the measure of the depth of cognition twenty five The nature of these relations is more difficult to ascertain than that of objects It seems to be more subtle When two sounds make themselves heard in succession there is less difficulty in making the nature of these two sounds understood than the nature of the fact that one occurs before the other It would appear that in the perception of objects our mind is passive and reduced to the state of reception working like a registering machine or a sensitive surface while in the perception of relations it assumes a more important part Two principal theories have been advanced of which one puts the relations in the things perceived and the other makes them a work of the mind Let us begin with this last opinion It consists in supposing that the relations are given to things by the mind itself These relations have been termed categories The question of categories plays an important part in the history of philosophy Three great philosophers Aristotle Kant and Renouvier have drawn up a list or as it is called a table of them and this table is very long To give a slight idea of it I will quote a few examples such as time space being resemblance difference causality becoming finality c By making the categories the peculiar possession of the mind we attribute to these cognitions the essential characteristic of being anterior to sensation or as it is also termed of existing a priori we are taught that not only are they not derived from experience nor taught us by observation but further that they are presupposed by all observation for they set up in scholastic jargon the conditions which make experience possible They represent the personal contribution of the mind to the knowledge of nature and consequently to admit them is to admit that the mind is not in the presence of the world reduced to the passive state of a tabula rasa and that the faculties of the mind are not a transformation of sensation Only these categories do not supplement sensation they do not obviate it nor allow it to be conjectured beforehand They remain empty forms so long as they are not applied to experience they are the rules of cognition and not the objects of cognition the means of knowing and not the things known they render knowledge possible but do not of themselves constitute it Experience through the senses still remains a necessary condition to the knowledge of the external world It may be said that the senses give the matter of knowledge and that the categories of the understanding give the form of it Matter cannot exist without form nor form without matter it is the union of the two which produces cognition Such is the simplest idea that can be given of the Kantian theory of categories or if it is preferred to employ the term often used and much discussed such is the theory of the Kantian idealism This theory I will say frankly hardly harmonises with the ideas I have set forth up to this point To begin with let us scrutinise the relation which can exist between the subject and the object We have seen that the existence of the subject is hardly admissible for it could only be an object in disguise Cognition is composed in reality of an object and an act of consciousness Now how can we know if this act of consciousness by adding itself to the object modifies it and causes it to appear other than it is This appears to me an insoluble question and probably even a factitious one The idea that an object can be modified in its nature or in its aspect comes to us through the perception of bodies We see that by attacking a metal with acids this metal is modified and that by heating a body its colour and form become changed or that by electrifying a thread it acquires new properties or that when we place glasses before our eyes we change the visible aspect of objects or that if we have inflammation of the eyelids light is painful and so on All these familiar experiments represent to us the varied changes that a body perceived can undergo but it must be carefully remarked that in cases of this kind the alteration in the body is produced by the action of a second body that the effect is due to an intercourse between two objects On the contrary when we take the Kantian hypothesis that the consciousness modifies that which it perceives we are attributing to the consciousness an action which has been observed in the case of the objects and are thus transporting into one domain that which belongs to a different one and we are falling into the very common error which consists in losing sight of the proper nature of the consciousness and making out of it an object If we set aside this incorrect assimilation there no longer remains any reason for refusing to admit that we perceive things as they are and that the consciousness by adding itself to objects does not modify them Phenomena and appearances do not then strictly speaking exist Till proof to the contrary we shall admit that everything we perceive is real that we perceive things always as they are or in other words that we always perceive noumena twenty six After having examined the relations of the consciousness with its objects let us see what concerns the perception by the consciousness of the relations existing between these objects themselves The question is to ascertain whether the a priorists are right in admitting that the establishment of these relations is the work of the consciousness The role of synthetic power that is thus attributed to consciousness is difficult to conceive unless we alter the definition of consciousness to fit the case In accordance with the definition we have given and the idea we have of it the consciousness makes us acquainted with what a thing is but it adds nothing to it It is not a power which begets objects nor is it a power which begets relations Let us carefully note the consequence at which we should arrive if while admitting on the one hand that our consciousness lights up and reveals the objects without creating them we were on the other hand to admit that it makes up for this passivity by creating relations between objects We dare not go so far as to say that this creation of relations is arbitrary and corresponds in no way to reality or that when we judge two neighbouring or similar objects the relations of contiguity and resemblance are pure inventions of our consciousness and that these objects are really neither contiguous nor similar It must therefore be supposed that the relation is already in some manner attracted into the objects it must be admitted that our intelligence does not apply its categories haphazard or from the caprice of the moment and it must be admitted that it is led to apply them because it has perceived in the objects themselves a sign and a reason which are an invitation to this application and its justification On this hypothesis therefore contiguity and resemblance must exist in the things themselves and must be perceived for without this we should run the risk of finding similar that which is different and contiguous that which has no relation of time or space Whence it results evidently that our consciousness cannot create the connection completely and then we are greatly tempted to conclude that it only possesses the faculty of perceiving it when it exists in the objects twenty seven According to this conception the role of the consciousness in the perception of a connection is that of a witness as in the perception of objects The consciousness does not create but it verifies Resemblance is a physical property of objects like colour and contiguity is a physical property of objects like form The connections between the objects form part of the group object and not of the group consciousness and they are just as independent of consciousness as are the objects themselves Against this conclusion we must anticipate several objections One of them will probably consist in accentuating the difference existing between the object and the connection from the dynamical point of view That the object may be passively contemplated by the consciousness can be understood it will be said but the relation is not only an object of perception it is further a principle of action a power of suggestion and an agent of change It might then he supposed that the consciousness here finds a compensation for the role that has been withdrawn from it If it is not the thing that creates the relation it will be said at least it is that which creates its efficacity of suggestion Many psychologists have supposed that a relation has the power of evocation only when it has been perceived The perception of resemblance precedes the action of resemblance It is consequently the consciousness which assembles the ideas and gives them birth by perceiving their relations This error for it is one has long been wide spread indeed it still persists twenty eight We have however no difficulty in understanding that the perception of a resemblance between two terms supposes them to be known so long as only one of the terms is present to the consciousness this perception does not exist it cannot therefore possess the property of bringing to light the second term Suggestion is therefore distinct from recognition it is when suggestion has acted when the resemblance in fact has brought the two terms together that the consciousness taking cognisance of the work accomplished verifies the existence of a resemblance and that this resemblance explains the suggestion Second objection we are told that the relations between the objects that is the principal categories must be of a mental nature because they are a priori That they are a priori means that they are at once anterior and superior to the experience Let us see what this argument is worth It appears that it is somewhat misused With regard to many of the categories we are content to lay down the necessity of an abstract idea in order to explain the comprehension of a concrete one It is said for example how can it be perceived that two sensations are successive if we do not already possess the idea of time The argument is not very convincing because for every kind of concrete perception it is possible to establish an abstract category It might be said of colour that it is impossible to perceive it unless it is known beforehand what colour is and so on for a heap of other things A more serious argument consists in saying that relations are a priori because they have a character of universality and of necessity which is not explained by experience this last being always contingent and peculiar But it is not necessary that a function should be mental for it to be a priori The identification of the a priori with the mental is entirely gratuitous We should here draw a distinction between the two senses of the a priori anteriority and superiority A simple physical mechanism may be a priori in the sense of anteriority A house is a priori in regard to the lodgers it receives this book is a priori in regard to its future readers There is no difficulty in imagining the structure of our nervous system to be a priori in regard to the excitements which are propagated in it A nerve cell is formed with its protoplasm its nucleus and its nucleoli before being irritated its properties precede its functions If it be possible to admit that as a consequence of ancestral experiences the function has created the organ the latter is now formed and this it is which in its turn becomes anterior to the function The notion of a priori has therefore nothing in it which is repugnant to physical nature Let us now take the a priori in the sense of superiority Certain judgments of ours are we are told universal and necessary and through this double character go beyond the evidence of experience This is an exact fact which deserves to be explained but it is not indispensable to explain it by allowing to the consciousness a source of special cognitions The English school of philosophy have already attacked this problem in connection with the origin of axioms The principle of their explanation lies in the virtue of what they have termed inseparable association They have supposed that when an association is often repeated it creates a habit of thought against which no further strife is possible The mechanism of association itself should then add a special virtue to the contingency of facts A hundred repetitions of related facts for example would give rise to so firm an association that no further repetition would increase it I consider this explanation a very sound one in principle It is right to put into association something more than into experience I would only suggest a slight correction in detail It is not the association forged by repetition which has this virtue of conveying the idea of necessity and universality it is simply the uncontradicted association It has been objected in fact and with reason to the solution of Mill that it insists on a long duration of experience while axioms appear to be of an irresistible and universal truthfulness the moment they are conceived And this is quite just I should prefer to lay down as a law that every representation appears true and that every link appears necessary and universal as soon as it is formed This is its character from the first It preserves it so long as no contradiction in fact in reasoning or in idea comes to destroy it twenty nine What seems to stand out most clearly after all these explanations is the role which we ought to attribute to the consciousness Two rival theories have been maintained that of the mirror consciousness and that of the focus consciousness It would seem I merely say it would seem that the first of these best harmonises with the preceding facts For what seems most probable is that the consciousness illuminates and reveals but does not act The theory of the focus consciousness adapts itself less to the mechanism of the association of ideas From this we come quite naturally to see in the intelligence only an inactive consciousness at one moment it apprehends an object and it is a perception or an idea at another time it perceives a connection and it is a judgment at yet another it perceives connections between connections and it is an act of reason But however subtle the object it contemplates may become it does not depart from its contemplative attitude and cognition is but a consciousness One step further and we should get so far as to admit that the consciousness serves no purpose whatever and that it is a useless luxury since if all efficacious virtue is to be found in the sensations and the ideas which we consider as material facts the consciousness which reveals them adds nothing to takes nothing from and modifies nothing in them and everything would go on the same nor would anything in this world be changed if one day the light of consciousness were by chance to be put out We might imagine a collection of automatons forming a human society as complicated as and not different in appearance from that of conscious beings these automatons would make the same gestures utter the same words as ourselves would dispute complain cry and make love like us we might even imagine them capable like us of psychology This is the thesis of the epiphenomenal consciousness which Huxley has boldly carried to its uttermost conclusions I indicate here these possible conclusions without discussing them It is a question I prefer to leave in suspense it seems to me that one can do nothing on this subject but form hypotheses FOOTNOTES Footnote twenty five At the risk of being deemed too subtle I ask whether we are conscious of a relation between objects or whether that which occurs is not rather the perception of an object which has been modified in its nature by its relation with another object Footnote twenty six This conclusion may seem contradictory to that which I enunciated when studying the constitution of matter I then asserted that we only know our sensations and not the excitants which produce them But these sensations are matter they are matter modified by other matter viz our nervous centres We therefore take up very distinctly an opposite standpoint to the principle of relativity in other terms we reject the phenomenism of Berkeley When we go into metaphysics we are continually astounded to see how different conceptions of things which have a classic value are independent of each other In general phenomenism is opposed to substantialism and it is supposed that those who do not accept the former doctrine must accept the latter while on the contrary those who reject substantialism must be phenomenists We know that it is in this manner that Berkeley conquered corporeal substantialism and taught phenomenism while Hume more radical than he went so far as to question the substantialism of mind On reflection it seems to me that after having rejected phenomenism we are in no way constrained to accept substance By saying that we perceive things as they are and not through a deluding veil we do not force ourselves to acknowledge that we perceive the substance of bodies that is to say that something which should be hidden beneath its qualities and should be distinct from it The distinction between the body and its qualities is a thing useful in practice but it answers to no perception or observation The body is only a group a sheaf of qualities If the qualities seem unable to exist of themselves and to require a subject this is only a grammatical difficulty which is due to the fact that while calling certain sensations qualities we suppose a subject to be necessary On the other hand the representation which we make to ourselves of a material substance and its role as the support of the qualities is a very naive and mechanical representation thanks to which certain sensations become the supports of other and less important sensations It would suffice to insist on the detail of this representation and on its origin to show its artificial character The notion we have of the stability of bodies and of the persistence of their identity notwithstanding certain superficial changes is the reason for which I thought proper to attribute a substance to them that is to say an invariable element But we can attain the same end without this useless hypothesis we have only to remark that the identity of the object lies in the aggregate of its properties including the name it bears If the majority of its properties especially of those most important to us subsists without alteration or if this alteration though of very great extent takes place insensibly and by slow degrees we decide that the object remains the same We have no need for that purpose to give it a substance one and indestructible Thus we are neither adherents of phenomenism nor of substantialism Footnote twenty seven I borrow from RABIER this argument which has thoroughly convinced me see Psychologie p two hundred eighty one Footnote twenty eight PILON is the psychologist who has the most forcibly demonstrated that resemblance acts before being perceived I refer the readers to my Psychologie du Raisonnement where I have set forth this little problem in detail Footnote twenty nine We think spontaneously of the general and the necessary It is this which serves as a basis for the suggestion and the catchword reclame and it explains how minds of slender culture always tend towards absolute assertions and hasty generalisations CHAPTER VII DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS THE SEPARABILITY OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ITS OBJECT DISCUSSION OF IDEALISM One last question suggests itself with regard to the consciousness In what measure is it separable from the object Do the consciousness and its object form two things or only one Under observation these two terms constantly show themselves united We experience a sensation and have consciousness of it it is the same fact expressed in two different ways All facts of our perception thus present themselves and they are one But our reason may outstrip our observation We are able to make a distinction between the two elements being and being perceived This is not an experimental but an ideological distinction and an abstraction that language makes easy Can we go further and suppose one of the parts thus analysed capable of existing without the other Can sensation exist as physical expression as an object without being illuminated by the consciousness Can the consciousness exist without having an object Let us first speak of the existence of the object when considered as separated from the consciousness The problem is highly complicated It has sometimes been connected with the idealist thesis according to which the object of consciousness being itself a modality of the consciousness cannot exist apart from it that is to say outside the periods in which it is perceived It would therefore result from this that this separation between existence and perception might be made when it is admitted contrary to the idealist hypothesis that the object perceived is material and the consciousness which perceives it mental In this case it will be thought there is no link of solidarity between the consciousness and its continuity But I am not of that opinion The union of the consciousness and its object is one of fact which presents itself outside any hypothesis on the nature of the object It is observation which demonstrates to us that we must perceive an object to be assured of its existence the reason moreover confirms the necessity of this condition which remains true whatever may be the stuff of the object Having stated this the question is simply to know whether this observation of fact should be generalised or not We may it seems to me decline to generalise it without falling into a contradiction in terms It may be conceived that the objects which we are looking at continue to exist without change during the moments when we have lost sight of them This seems reasonable enough and is the opinion of common sense thirty The English philosophers Bain and Mill have combated this proposition with extraordinary ardour like believers combating a heresy But notwithstanding their attacks it remains intelligible and the distinction between being and being perceived preserves its logical legitimacy This may be represented or may be thought but can it be realised So far as regards external objects I think we all in fact admit it We all admit a distinction between the existence of the outer world and the perception we have of it its existence is one thing and our perception of it is another The existence of the world continues without interruption our perception is continually interrupted by the most fortuitous causes such as change of position or even the blinking of the eyes its existence is general universal independent of time and space our perception is partial particular local limited by the horizon of our senses determined by the geographical position of our bodies riddled by the distractions of our intelligence deceived by the illusions of our minds and above all diminished by the infirmity of our intelligence which is able to comprehend so little of what it perceives This is what we all admit in practice the smallest of our acts implies the belief in something perceptible which is wider and more durable than our astonished perceptions I could not write these lines unless I implicitly supposed that my inkstand my paper my pen my room and the surrounding world subsist when I do not see them It is a postulate of practical life It is also a postulate of science which requires for its explanations of phenomena the supposition in them of an indwelling continuity Natural science would become unintelligible if we were forced to suppose that with every eclipse of our perceptions material actions were suspended There would be beginnings without sequences and ends without beginnings Let us note also that acquired notions on the working of our nervous system allow us to give this postulate a most precise form the external object is distinct from the nervous system and from the phenomena of perception which are produced when the nervous system is excited it is therefore very easy to understand that this object continues to exist and to develop its properties even when no brain vibrates in its neighbourhood Might we not with the view of strengthening this conclusion as to the continuous existence of things dispense with this postulate which seems to have the character of a grace of an alms granted to us Might not this continuous existence of objects during the eclipses of our acts of consciousness be demonstrated It does not seem to me impossible Let us suppose for a moment the correctness of the idealist thesis all our legitimate knowledge of objects is contained within the narrow limits of actual sensation then we may ask of what use is the reason What is the use of the memory These functions have precisely for their object the enlarging of the sphere of our sensations which is limited in two principal ways by time and by space Thanks to the reason we manage to see in some way that which our senses are unable to perceive either because it is too distant from us or because there are obstacles between us and the object or because it is a past event or an event which has not yet taken place which is in question That the reason may be deceived is agreed But will it be asserted that it is always deceived Shall we go so far as to believe that this is an illegitimate mode of cognition The idealist thesis if consistent cannot refuse to extend itself to this extreme conclusion for a reasoned conclusion contains when it has a meaning a certain assertion on the order of nature and this assertion is not a perception since its precise object is to fill up the gaps in our perceptions Not being a perception it must be rejected if one is an idealist The idealist will therefore keep strictly to the perception of the moment and this is so small a thing when deprived of all the conjectures which enrich it that the world if reduced to this alone would be but the skeleton of a world There would then be no more science no possibility of knowledge But who could make up his mind thus to shut himself up in perception I suppose indeed that there will here be quibbling This objection will be made that in the hypothesis of a discontinuous existence of things reason may continue to do its work provided the intervention of a possible perception be supposed Thus I notice this morning on going into my garden that the pond which was dry yesterday is full of water I conclude from this It has rained in the night To be consistent with idealism one must simply add If some one had been in the garden last night he would have seen it rain In this manner one must re establish every time the rights of perception Be it so But let us notice that this addition has no more importance than a prescribed formula in a notarial act for instance the presence of a second notary prescribed by the law but always dispensed with in practice This prescribed formula can always be imagined or even understood We shall be in accord with idealism by the use of this easy little formula If some one had been there or even by saying For a universal consciousness The difference of the realist and idealist theory becomes then purely verbal This amounts to saying that it disappears But there is always much verbalism in idealism One more objection if this witness the consciousness suffices to give objects a continuity of existence we may content ourselves with a less important witness Why a man The eyes of a mollusc would suffice or those of infusoria or even of a particle of protoplasm living matter would become a condition of the existence of dead matter This we must acknowledge is a singular condition and this conclusion condemns the doctrine FOOTNOTES Footnote thirty That is to say the sense of the multitude ED CHAPTER VIII DEFINITION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS THE SEPARATION OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ITS OBJECT THE UNCONSCIOUS I ask myself whether it is possible by going further along this road of the separation between the consciousness and its object to admit that ideas may subsist during the periods when we are not conscious of them It is the problem of unconsciousness that I am here stating One of the most simple processes of reasoning consists in treating ideas in the same manner as we have treated the external objects We have admitted that the consciousness is a thing superadded to the external objects like the light which lights up a landscape but does not constitute it and may be extinguished without destroying it We continue the same interpretation by saying that ideas prolong their existence while they are not being thought in the same way and for the same motive that material bodies continue theirs while they are not being perceived All that it seems permissible to say is that this conception is not unrealisable Let us now place ourselves at the point of view of the consciousness We have supposed up to the present the suppression of the consciousness and have seen that we can still imagine the object continuing to exist Is the converse possible Let us suppose that the object is suppressed Can the consciousness then continue to exist On this last point it seems that doubt is not possible and we must answer in the negative A consciousness without an object an empty consciousness in consequence cannot be conceived it would be a zero a pure nothingness it could not manifest itself We might admit in strictness that such a consciousness might exist virtually as a power which is not exercised a reserve a potentiality or a possibility of being but we cannot comprehend that this power can realise or actualize itself There is therefore no actual consciousness without an object The problem we have just raised that of the separability of the elements which compose an act of consciousness is continued by another problem that of unconsciousness It is almost the same problem for to ask one s self what becomes of a known thing when we separate from it the consciousness which at first accompanied it is to ask one s self in what an unconscious phenomenon consists We have till now considered the two principal forms of unconsciousness that in nature and that in thought The first named unconsciousness does not generally bear that name but is rather discussed under the name of idealism and realism Whatever be their names these two kinds of unconsciousness are conceivable and the more so that they both belong to physical nature If we allow ourselves to be guided by the concept of separability we shall now find that we have exhausted the whole series of possible problems for we have examined all the possible separations between the consciousness and its objects but if we use another concept that of unconsciousness we can go further and propound a new problem can the consciousness become unconscious But it is proper first to make a few distinctions It is the role of metaphysics to make distinctions thirty one Unconsciousness presupposes a death of the consciousness but this death has its degrees and before complete extinction we may conceive it to undergo many attenuations There is first the diminution of consciousness Consciousness is a magnitude capable of increase and decrease like sensation itself According to the individual consciousness may have a very large or a very small field and may embrace at the same time a variable number of objects I can pay attention to several things at the same time but when I am tired it becomes more difficult to me I lose in extension or as is still said the field of consciousness is restricted It may also lose not only in extent of surface but in depth We have all of us observed in our own selves moments of obscure consciousness when we understand dimly and moments of luminous consciousness which carry one almost to the very bottom of things It is difficult to consider those in the wrong who admit with Leibnitz the existence of small states of consciousness The lessening of the consciousness is already our means of understanding the unconscious unconsciousness is the limit of this reduction thirty two This singular fact has also been noticed that in the same individual there may company exist several kinds of consciousness which do not enter into communication with each other and which are not acquainted with each other There is a principal consciousness which speaks and in addition accessory kinds of consciousness which do not speak but reveal their existence by the use of other modes of expression of which the most frequent is writing This doubling or fractionation of the consciousness and personality have often been described in the case of hysterical subjects They sometimes occur quite spontaneously but mostly they require a little suggestion and cultivation In any case that they are produced in one way or other proves that they are possible and for the theory this possibility is essential Facts of this kind do not lead to a theory of the unconscious but they enable us to understand how certain phenomena unconscious in appearance are conscious to themselves because they belong to states of consciousness which have been separated from each other A third thesis more difficult of comprehension than the other two supposes that the consciousness may be preserved in an unconscious form This is difficult to admit because unconsciousness is the negation of consciousness It is like saying that light can be preserved when darkness is produced or that an object still exists when by the hypothesis it has been radically destroyed This idea conveys no intelligible meaning and there is no need to dwell on it We have not yet exhausted all the concepts whereby we may get to unconsciousness Here is another the last I shall quote without however claiming that it is the last which exists We might call it the physiological concept for it is the one which the physiologists employ for choice It is based upon the observation of the phenomena which are produced in the nervous system during our acts of consciousness these phenomena precede consciousness as a rule and condition it According to a convenient figure which has been long in use the relations of the physiological phenomenon to the consciousness are represented as follows the physiological phenomenon consists in an excitement which at one time follows a direct and short route from the door by which it enters the nervous system to the door by which it makes its exit In this case it works like a simple mechanical phenomenon but sometimes it makes a longer journey and takes a circuitous road by which it passes into the higher nerve centres and it is at the moment when it takes this circuitous road that the phenomenon of consciousness is produced The use of this figure does not prejudge any important question Going further many contemporary authors do not content themselves with the proposition that the consciousness is conditioned by the nervous phenomenon but suggest also that it is continually accompanied by it Every psychical fact of perception of emotion or of idea should have it is supposed a physiological basis It would therefore be taken in its entirety psycho physiological This is called the parallelist theory We cannot discuss this here as we shall meet with it again in the third part of this book It has the advantage of leading to a very simple definition of unconsciousness The unconscious is that which is purely physiological We represent to ourselves the mechanical part of the total phenomenon continuing to produce itself in the absence of the consciousness as if this last continued to follow and illuminate it Such are the principal conceptions that may be formed of the unconscious They are probably not the only ones and our list is not exhaustive After having indicated what the unconscious is we will terminate by pointing out what it is not and what it cannot be We think or at least we have impliedly supposed in the preceding definitions that the unconscious is only something unknown which may have been known or which might become known under certain conditions and which only differs from the known by the one characteristic of not being actually known If this notion be correct one has really not the right to arm this unconsciousness with formidable powers It has the power of the reality to which it corresponds but its character of unconsciousness adds nothing to this It is the same with it as with the science of the future No scholar will hesitate to admit that that science will be deeper and more refined than that already formed But it is not from the fact that it is unknown that it will deserve its superiority it is from the phenomena that it will embrace To give to that which is unconscious as we here understand it an overwhelming superiority over the conscious as such we must admit that the consciousness is not only a useless luxury but the dethronement of the forces that it accompanies In the next place I decline to admit that the consciousness itself can become unconscious and yet continue in some way under an unconscious form This would be in my opinion bringing together two conceptions which contradict each other and thus denying after having affirmed From the moment that the consciousness dies there remains nothing of it unless it be the conditions of its appearance conditions which are distinct from itself Between two moments of consciousness separated by time or by a state of unconsciousness there does not and cannot exist any link I feel incapable of imagining of what this link could be composed unless it were material that is to say unless it were supplied from the class of objects I have already said that the substantialist thesis endeavours to establish a continuity between one consciousness and another separated by time by supposing a something durable of which the consciousness would be a property of intermittent manifestation They would thus explain the interruptions of consciousness as the interruptions in the light of a lamp When the light is extinguished the lamp remains in darkness but is still capable of being lighted Let us discard this metaphor which may lead to illusion The concept of consciousness can furnish no link and no mental state which remains when the consciousness is not made real if this link exists it is in the permanence of the material objects and of the nervous organism which allows the return of analogous conditions of matter FOOTNOTES Footnote thirty one In metaphysics we reason not on facts but most often on conceptions Now just as facts are precise so conceptions are vague in outline Facts are like crystallised bodies ideas like liquids and gases We think we have an idea and it changes form without our perceiving it We fancy we recognise one idea and it is but another which differs slightly from the preceding one By means of distinctions we ought to struggle against this flowing away and flight of ideas Footnote thirty two I think I have come across in ARISTOTLE the ingenious idea that the enfeeblement of the consciousness and its disorder may be due to the enfeeblement and disorder of the object It is a theory which is by no means improbable CHAPTER IX DEFINITIONS OF PSYCHOLOGY Let us resume the study of the preceding ideas in another form Since moreover to define mind is at the same time to define psychology let us seek for the truth which we can glean from the definitions of this science Our object is not to discover an exact definition but to make use of those already existing To define psychology is to describe the features of the domain over which this science holds sway and at the same time to indicate the boundaries which separate it from its neighbours At first sight this is an affair of geometric survey presenting no kind of difficulty for psychology does not merge by insensible transitions into the neighbouring sciences as physics does with chemistry for example or chemistry with biology To all the sciences of external nature psychology offers the violent opposition of the moral to the physical world It cannot be put in line with the physical sciences It occupies on the contrary a position apart It is the starting point the most abstract and simple of the moral sciences and it bears the same relation to them that mechanics does to the physical All this is doubtless true and yet a very great difficulty has been experienced in condensing into a clear definition the essence of psychology This is proved by the multiplicity of definitions attempted They are so many because none of them has proved completely satisfactory Their abundance shows their insufficiency I will try to introduce a little order into these attempts and propose to distribute the definitions of psychology into the following categories one The definition by substance the metaphysical definition par excellence two The definition by enumeration three method four degree of certainty five content six point of view seven the peculiar nature of mental laws We will rapidly run through this series of efforts at definition and shall criticise and reject nearly the whole of them for the last alone seems exact that is to say in harmony with the ideas laid down above Metaphysical definition has to day taken a slightly archaistic turn Psychology used to be considered as the science of the soul This is quite abandoned Modern authors have adopted the expression and also the idea of Lange thirty three who was I think the first to declare that we ought to cultivate a soulless psychology This categorical declaration caused an uproar and a few ill informed persons interpreted it to mean that the new psychology which has spread in France under cover of the name of Ribot sought to deny the existence of the soul and was calculated to incline towards materialism This is an error It is very possible indeed that several adepts of the new or experimental psychology may be materialists from inward conviction The exclusive cultivation of external facts of phenomena termed material evidently tends this is a mystery to none to incline the mind towards the metaphysical doctrine of materialism But after making this avowal it is right to add at once that psychology as a science of facts is the vassal of no metaphysical doctrine It is neither spiritualist materialist nor monist but a science of facts solely Ribot and his pupils have proclaimed this aloud at every opportunity Consequently it must be recognised that the rather amphibological expression soulless psychology implies no negation of the existence of the soul It is and this is quite a different thing rather an attitude of reserve in regard to this problem We do not solve this problem we put it on one side And certainly we are right to do so The soul viewed as a substance that is as a something distinct from psychical phenomena which while being their cause and support yet remains inaccessible to our direct means of cognition is only an hypothesis and it cannot serve as objective to a science of facts This would imply a contradiction in terms Unfortunately we must confess that if it be right to relegate to metaphysics the discussion on the concept of the soul it does not really suffice to purge our minds of all metaphysics and a person who believes himself to be a simple and strict experimentalist is often a metaphysician without knowing it These excommunications of metaphysics also seem rather childish at the present day There is less risk than some years ago in declaring that Here metaphysics commence and positive science ends and I will go no further There is even a tendency in modern psychologists to interest themselves in the highest philosophical problems and to take up a certain position with regard to them The second kind of definition is we have said that by enumeration It consists in placing before the eyes of the reader an assortment of psychological phenomena and then saying These are the things psychology studies One will take readily as samples the ideas reasonings emotions and other manifestations of mental life If this is only a strictly provisional definition a simple introduction to the subject we accept it literally It may serve to give us a first impression of things and to refresh the memories of those who by a rather extraordinary chance would not doubt that psychology studies our thoughts But whatever may be the number of these deeply ignorant persons they constitute I think a negligible quantity and after these preliminaries we must come to a real definition and not juggle with the problem which consists in indicating in what the spiritual is distinguished from the material Let us leave on one side therefore the definitions by enumeration Now comes the definition by method Numbers of authors have supposed that it is by its method that psychology is distinguished from the other sciences To the mind is attached the idea of the within to nature the idea of being without the mind of constituting a without un dehors It is a vague idea but becomes precise in a good many metaphors and has given rise to several forms of speech Since the days of Locke we have always spoken of the internal life of the mind as contrasted with the external life of subjective reality as contrasted with objective reality and in the same way we oppose the external senses to the inner sense the internal perception which it has at times been proposed to erect into a sixth sense Though no longer quite the Cartesian dualism this is still a dualism It has also been said that psychology is the science of introspection and in addition that scientific psychology is a controlled introspection This science of the internal facts of man would thus be distinguished from the other natural sciences which are formed by the use of our outer senses by external observation that is to say to use a neologism by externospection This verbal symmetry may satisfy for a moment minds given to words but on reflection it is perceived that the distinction between introspection and externospection does not correspond to a fundamental and constant difference in the nature of things or in the processes of cognition I acknowledge it with some regret and thus place myself in contradiction with myself for I for a long time believed and have even said in print that psychology is the science of introspection My error arose from my having made too many analyses of detail and not having mounted to a sufficiently wide reaching conception The definition I have given of consciousness is the implied condemnation of the above ideas Consciousness being nothing but an act of revelation has neither a within nor a without it does not correspond to a special domain which would be an inner one with regard to another domain Every consideration on the position of things is borrowed from the sphere of the object and remains foreign to the sphere of the consciousness It is by an abuse of language that we speak of the outer world in relation to the world of consciousness and it is pure imagination on the part of philosophers to have supposed that our sensations are first perceived as internal states and states of consciousness and are subsequently projected without to form the outer world The notion of internal and external is only understood for certain objects which we compare by position to certain others In fact we find that the opposition between an external and an internal series is generally founded on two characteristics sensation is considered external in relation to the idea and an object of cognition is considered as internal when it is accessible only to ourselves When these two characteristics are isolated from each other one may have doubts but when they company exist then the outwardness or inwardness appears fully evidenced We see then that this distinction has nothing to do with the value of consciousness and has nothing mental about it It is thus that our ideas are judged from internal events It is our microcosm opposed to the macrocosm It is the individual opposed to the social Looking at an external object we remain in communion with our fellows for we receive or think we receive identical sensations At all events we receive corresponding sensations On the other hand my thought is mine and is known to me alone it is my sanctuary my private closet where others do not enter Every one can see what I see but no one knows what I think But this difference in the accessibility of phenomena is not due to their peculiar nature It is connected with a different fact with the modes of excitement which call them forth If the visual sensation is common to all it is because the exciting cause of the sensation is an object external to our nervous systems and acting at a distance on all thirty four The tactile sensation is at the beginning more personal to the one who experiences it since it requires contact and the lower sensations are in this intimacy still in progress And then the same object can give rise in common place circumstances to a sensation either common to all beings or special to one alone The capsule of antipyrine which I swallow is before my doing so visible to all eyes once in my mouth I am the only one to perceive it It is therefore possible that the same sensation according to the displacements of the object which excites it may make part of the internal or of the external series and as all psychic life is sensation even effort and as we are assured emotion it follows that our argument extends to all the psychical elements Finally the internal or external character of events which might be called their geographical position is a characteristic which has no influence upon the method destined to take cognisance of it The method remains one Introspection does not represent a source of cognition distinct from externospection for the same faculties of the mind reason attention and reflection act on sensation the source of the so called external sciences and on the idea the source of the so called inner science A fact can be studied by essentially the same process whether regarded by the eyes or depicted by the memory The consciousness changes its object and orientation not its nature It is as if with the same opera glass we looked in turn at the wall of the room and through the window I can even quote on this point a significant fact there are observers who are organised in such a way that they especially observe by memory Placed before the sensorial phenomenon which strikes their senses they are sometimes amazed as if hypnotised they require to get away from it to regain consciousness of themselves to analyse the fact and to master it and it is by means of the memory that they study it on condition of course of afterwards coming back to verify their conclusions by a fresh observation from nature Will it be said that the physicist the chemist or the biologist who follows this slow method and who thus observes retroactively practises physics and biology by introspection Evidently this would be ridiculous Conversely introspection may in certain cases adopt the procedure of externospection No doubt it would be inexact to say that the perception of one of our ideas always takes place through the same mechanism as the perception of one of our sensations To give an account of what we think does not imply the same work as in the case of what we see for generally our thoughts and our images do not appear to us spontaneously They are first sought for by us and are only realised after having been wished for We go from the vague to the precise from the confused to the clear the direction of thought precedes then its realisation in images and the latter being expected is necessarily comprehended when it is formed But we may come across curious circumstances in which it is the image which has precedence over its appearance and in that case it is exact to say that this uninvoked image must be interpreted and recognised as if it were an external object In cases of this kind there passes through our mind something which surprises us I see by internal vision a face with a red nose and I have to search my memory for a long time even for days in order to give precision to the vague feeling that I have seen it before so as to finally say with confidence It is So and So Or else I hear in my inner ear a certain voice with a metallic tone and authoritative inflections this voice pronounces scientific phrases gives a series of lectures but I know not to whom it belongs and it costs me a long effort to reach the interpretation it is the voice of M Dastre There is then a certain space of time more or less long in which we can correctly assert that we are not aware of what we are thinking we are in the presence of a thought in the same state of uncertainty as in that of an external unknown and novel object The labour of classification and of interpretation cast upon us is of the same order and when this labour is effected incorrectly it may end in an illusion Therefore illusions of thought are quite as possible as illusions of the senses though rarer for the reasons above stated But the question of frequency has no theoretical importance I have shown elsewhere by experiments on hysterics that it is possible by the intermediary of their insensibility to touch to suggest ideas on the value of which the patients make mistakes For instance you take the finger in which they have no sensation you touch it you bend it The patient not seeing what is done does not feel it but the tactile sensation unfelt by their principal consciousness somehow awakes the visual image of the finger this enters into the field of consciousness and most often is not recognised by the subject who describes the occurrence in his own way he claims for instance that he thinks of sticks or of columns In reality he does not know of what he is thinking and we know better than he He is thinking of his finger and does not recognise it All these examples show that the clearly defined characteristics into which it is sought to divide extrospection and introspection do not exist There is however a reason for preserving the distinction because it presents a real interest for the psychology of the individual These two words introspection and extrospection admirably convey the difference in the manner of thinking between those who from preference look and those who from preference reflect On the one hand the observers who are often men of action on the other the speculators who are often mystics But it would be no more legitimate by this means to separate psychology and physics than to say for instance There are two kinds of geology one is the geology of France for one is acquainted with it without going from home and the other is that of the rest of the world because in order to know it one must cross the frontier We reject therefore the definition drawn from the difference of method At bottom there is no difference of method but only differences of process of technique The method is always the same for it is derived from the application of a certain number of laws to the objects of cognition and these laws remain the same in all spheres of application Here is another difference of method which if it were true would have an incalculable importance Psychology we are told is a science of direct and immediate experiment it studies facts as they present themselves to our consciousness while the natural sciences are sciences of indirect and mediate experiment for they are compelled to interpret the facts of consciousness and draw from them conclusions on nature It has also been said in a more ambitious formula The science of physical objects is relative logical science is absolute Let us examine this by the rapid analysis of any perception taken at haphazard What I perceive directly immediately we are told is not the object it is my state of consciousness the object is inferred concluded and taken cognisance of through the intermediary of my state of consciousness We only know it says Lotze circa rem It is therefore apprehended less immediately and every natural science employs a more roundabout method than that of psychology This last by studying states of consciousness which alone are known to us directly comprehends reality itself absolute reality There is more absolute reality M Rabier boldly says in the simple feeling that a man or even an animal has of its pain when beaten than in all the theories of physics for beyond these theories it can be asked what are the things that exist But it is an absurdity to ask one s self if beyond the pain of which one is conscious there be not another pain different from that one thirty five Let us excuse in psychologists this petty and common whim for exaggerating the merit of the science they pursue But here the limit is really passed and no scholar will admit that the perception and representation of a body as it may take place in the brain of a Berthelot can present any inferiority as a cognition of the absolute to the pain felt by the snail I crush under my foot Nobody except metaphysicians will acknowledge that psychology is a more precise and certain science than physics or chemistry The criterion furnished by the development of the respective sciences would prove just the contrary The observations of psychology are always rather unprecise Psychological phenomena notwithstanding the efforts of Fechner and his school are not yet measured with the same strictness and ease as the tangible reality To speak plainly the psychologist who vaunts the superiority of his method and only shows inferior results places himself in a somewhat ridiculous and contradictory position he deserves to be compared to those spiritualists who claim the power of evoking the souls of the illustrious dead and only get from them platitudes In the main the arguments of the metaphysicians given above appear to me to contain a grave error This consists in supposing that the natural sciences study the reality hidden beneath sensation and only make use of this fact as of a sign which enables them to get back from effect to cause This is quite inexact That the natural sciences are limited by sensation is true but they do not go outside it they effect their constructions with sensation alone And the reason is very simple it is the only thing they know To the metaphysical psychologist who claims sensation as his own property saying But this sensation is a state of my consciousness it is mine it is myself the physicist has the right to answer I beg your pardon this sensation is the external object that I am studying it is my column of mercury my spring my precipitate my amoeba I comprehend these objects directly and I want no other Psychology finds itself therefore exactly on the same footing as the other sciences in the degree in which it studies sensations that it considers as its own property I have already said that the sensations proper to psychology are hardly represented otherwise than by the emotional sensations produced by the storms in the apparatus of organic life We now come to the definitions by content They have been numerous but we shall only quote a few The most usual consists in saying that Psychology studies the facts of consciousness This formula passes in general as satisfactory The little objection raised against it is that it excludes the unconscious facts which play so important a part in explaining the totality of mental life but it only requires some usual phrase to repair this omission One might add for instance to the above formula conscious facts and those which while unconscious under certain conditions are yet conscious in others This is not however the main difficulty which is far more serious On close examination it is seen that the term fact of consciousness is very elastic and that for a reason easy to state This is that all facts which exist and are revealed to us reach us by the testimony of the consciousness and are consequently facts of consciousness If I look at a locomotive and analyse its machinery I act like a mechanic if I study under the microscope the structure of infusoria I practise biology and yet the sight of the locomotive the perception of the infusoria are just facts of consciousness and should belong to psychology if one takes literally the above definition which is so absolute that it absorbs the entire world into the science of the mind It might indeed be remarked that certain phenomena would remain strictly psychological such as for instance the emotions the study of which would not be disputed by any physical science for the world of nature offers us nothing comparable to an emotion or an effort of will while on the other hand everything which is the object of physical science that is everything which can be perceived by our external senses may be claimed by psychology Therefore it is very evident the above definition is much too wide and does not agree with solo definito It does not succeed in disengaging the essential characteristic of physics This characteristic indeed exists and we foresee it but we do not formulate it Another definition by content has not been much more happy To separate the material from the moral the conception of Descartes was remembered and we were told that Psychology is the science of what exists only in time while physics is the science of what exists at once in time and in space To this theoretical reasoning it might already be objected that in fact and in the life we lead we never cease to localise in space though somewhat vaguely our thought our Ego and our intellectual whole At this moment I am considering myself and taking myself as an example I am writing these lines in my study and no metaphysical argument can cause me to abandon my firm conviction that my intellectual whole is in this room on the second floor of my house at Meudon I am here and not elsewhere My body is here and my soul if I have one is here I am where my body is I believe even that I am within my body This localisation which certainly has not the exactness nor even the characteristics of the localisation of a material body in space seems to me to result from the very great importance we attach to the existence of our body in perception and in movement Our body accompanies all our perceptions its changes of position cause these perceptions to vary the accidents which happen to it bring us pleasure or pain Some of its movements are under our orders we observe that others are the consequences of our thoughts and our emotions It occupies therefore among the objects of cognition a privileged place which renders it more intimate and more dear to us than other objects There is no need to inquire here whether in absolute reality I am lodged within it for this I is an artificial product manufactured from memories I have before explained what is the value of the relation subject object It is indisputable that in the manufacture of the subject we bring in the body This is too important an element for it not to have the right to form part of the synthesis it is really its nucleus As on the other hand all the other elements of the synthesis are psychical invisible and reduced to being faculties and powers it may be convenient to consider them as occupying the centre of the body or of the brain There is no need to discuss this synthesis for it is one of pure convenience As well inquire whether the personality of a public company is really localised at its registered offices round the green baize cover which adorns the table in the boardroom Another definition of psychology which is at once a definition by content and a definition by method has often been employed by philosophers and physiologists It consists in supposing that there really exist two ways of arriving at the cognition of objects the within and the without These two ways are as opposed to each other as the right and wrong side of a stuff It is in this sense that psychology is the science of the within and looks at the wrong side of the stuff while the natural sciences look at the right side And it is so true they add that the same phenomenon appears under two radically different forms according as we look at it from the one or the other point of view Thus it is pointed out to us every one of our thoughts is in correlation with a particular state of our cerebral matter our thought is the subjective and mental face the corresponding cerebral process is the objective and material face Then the difference between representation which is a purely psychological phenomenon and a cerebral state which is a material one and reducible to movement is insisted upon and it is declared that these two orders of phenomena are separated by irreducible differences Lastly to take account of the meaning of these differences and to explain them it is pointed out that they are probably connected with the modes of cognition which intervene to comprehend the mental and the physical The mental phenomenon we are told is comprehended by itself and as it is it is known without any mystery and in its absolute reality The physical phenomenon on the contrary only reaches us through the intermediary of our nerves more or less transformed in consequence by the handling in transport It is an indirect cognition which causes us to comprehend matter we have of this last only a relative and apparent notion which sufficiently explains how it may differ from a phenomenon of thought I have already had occasion to speak of this dualism when we were endeavouring to define sensation We return to its criticism once more for it is a conception which in these days has become classic and it is only by repeatedly attacking it that it will be possible to demonstrate its error To take an example I look at the plain before me and see a flock of sheep pass over it At the same time an observer is by my side and is not looking at the same thing as myself It is not at the plain that he looks it is I will suppose within my brain Armed with a microscope a la Jules Verne he succeeds in seeing what is passing beneath my skull and he notices within my fibres and nerve cells those phenomena of undulation which physiologists have hitherto described hypothetically This observer notices then that while I am looking over the plain my optic nerve conveys a certain kind of movements these are I suppose displacements of molecules which execute a complicated kind of dance The movement follows the course of the optic nerve traverses the chiasma goes along the fascia passes the internal capsule and finally arrives at the visual centres of the occipital region Here then are the two terms of comparison constituted on the one hand we have a certain representation that is my own and on the other hand coinciding with this representation we have the dynamic changes in the nerve centres These are the two things constituting the right and wrong side of the stuff We shall be told See how little similarity there is here A representation is a physical fact a movement of molecules a material fact And further If these two facts are so little like each other it is because they reach us by two different routes I think both these affirmations equally disputable Let us begin with the second Where does one see that we possess two different sources of knowledge Or that we can consider an object under two different aspects Where are our duplicate organs of the senses of which the one is turned inward and the other outward In the example chosen for this discussion I have supposed two persons each of whom experiences a visual perception One looks at one object the other at another but both are looking with the same organs of sense that is with their eyes How is it possible to understand that these eyes can in turn according to the necessity of the moment see the two faces physical and mental of the same object They are the two faces of an identical object is the answer made to us because the two visions although applied to the same object are essentially different On the one hand is a sensation of displacement of movement of a dance executed by the molecules of some proteid substance on the other hand is a flock of sheep passing over the plain at a distance of a hundred metres away It seems to me that here also the argument advanced is not sound In the first place it is essential to notice that not only are the two paths of cognition identical but also that the perceptions are of the same nature There is in this no opposition between the physical and the mental What is compared are the two phenomena which are both mixed and are physico mental physical through the object to which they are applied mental through the act of cognition they imply To perceive an object in the plain and to perceive a dynamic state of the brain are two operations which each imply an act of cognition and in addition the object of this knowledge is as material in the one as in the other case A flock of sheep is matter just as much as my brain No doubt here are objects which differ my observer and myself have not the same perception I acknowledge but do not wonder at it How could our two perceptions be similar I look at the sheep and he at the interior of my brain It is not astonishing that looking at such different objects we should receive images also different Or again if this other way of putting it be preferred I would say the individual A looks at the flock through the intermediary of his nervous system while B looks at it through that of two nervous systems put as it were end to end though not entirely his own nervous system first and then that of A How then could they experience the same sensation They could only have an identical sensation if the idea of the ancients were to be upheld who understood the external perception of bodies to result from particles detaching themselves from their bodies and after a more or less lengthy flight striking and entering into our organs of sense thirty six Let us imagine just for a moment one of our nerves the optic nerve for instance transformed into a hollow tube along which the emissions of miniatures should wend their way In this case evidently if so strange a disposition were to be realised and if B could see what was flowing in the optic nerve of A he would experience a sensation almost analogous to that of A Whenever the latter saw a dog a sheep or a shepherd B would likewise see in the optic canal minute dogs microscopic sheep and Lilliputian shepherds At the cost of such a childish conception a parity of content in the sensations of our two spectators A and B might be supposed But I will not dwell on this The above considerations seem to me to explain the difference generally noticed between thought and the physiological process It is not a difference of nature an opposition of two essences or of two worlds it is simply a difference of object just that which separates my visual perception of a tree and my visual perception of a dog There remains to know in what manner we understand the relation of these two processes this is another problem which we will examine later Since the content does not give us the differentiation we desire we will abandon the definitions of psychology by content What now remains The definitions from the point of view The same fact may he looked at like a landscape from different points of view and appears different with the changes therein It is so with the facts we consider psychical and the autonomy of psychology would thus be a matter of point of view It has then been supposed and this is a very important proposition that the distinctive feature of psychical facts does not consist in their forming a class of particular events On the contrary their characteristic is to be studied in their dependency on the persons who bring them about This interesting affirmation is not new it may be read in the works of Mach Kuelpe Muensterberg and especially of Ebbinghaus from whom I quote the following lines of quite remarkable clearness Psychology is not distinguished from sciences like physics and biology which are generally and rightly opposed to it by a different content in the way that for instance zoology is distinguished from mineralogy or astronomy It has the same content but considers it from a different point of view and with a different object It is the science not of a given part of the world but of the whole world considered however in a certain relation It studies in the world those formations processes and relations the properties of which are essentially determined by the properties and functions of an organism of an organised individual Psychology in short considers the world from an individual and subjective point of view while the science of physics studies it as if it were independent of us Over these definitions by point of view one might quibble a little for those who thus define psychology are not always consistent with themselves In other passages of their writings they do not fail to oppose psychical to physiological phenomena and they proclaim the irreducible heterogeneity of these two orders of phenomena and the impossibility of seeing in physics the producing cause of the moral Ebbinghaus is certainly one of the modern writers who have most strongly insisted on this idea of opposition between the physiological and the psychical and he is a convinced dualist Now I do not very clearly understand in what the principle of heterogeneity can consist to a mind which admits on the other hand that psychology does not differ from the physical sciences by its content However I confine myself here to criticising the consequences and not the starting point The definition of the psychical phenomenon by the point of view seems to me correct although it has more concision than clearness for it rests especially upon a material metaphor and the expression point of view hardly applies except to the changes of perspective furnished by visible objects It would be more exact to say that psychology specially studies certain objects of cognition such as those which have the character of representations reminiscences ideas concepts the emotions the volitions and the reciprocal influences of these objects among themselves It studies then a part of the material world of that world which till now has been called psychological because it does not come under the senses and because it is subjective and inaccessible to others than ourselves it studies the laws of those objects which laws have been termed mental thirty seven These laws are not recognised popularly speaking either in physics or in biology they constitute for us a cognition apart from that of the natural world Association by resemblance for example is a law of consciousness it is a psychological law which has no application nor counterpart in the world of physics or biology We may therefore sum up what has been said by the statement that psychology is the study of a certain number of laws relations and connections As to the particular feature which distinguishes mental from physical laws we can formulate it as does William James by saying that the essence of a mental law is to be teleological or if the phrase be preferred we can say that mental activity is a finalistic activity which expends itself as will in the pursuit of future ends and as intelligence in the choice of the means deemed capable of serving those ends An act of intelligence is recognised by the fact of its aiming at an end and employing for this end one means chosen out of many Finality and intelligence are thus synonymous In opposition to mental law physical law is mechanical by which expression is simply implied the absence of finality Finality opposed to mechanism such is the most concise and truest expression in which must be sought the distinctive attribute of psychology and of the moral sciences the essential characteristic by which psychological are separated from physical facts I think it may be useful to dwell a little on the mental laws which I have just opposed to the physical and whose object is to assure preadaptation and form a finality thirty eight Their importance cannot be exaggerated Thanks to his power of preadaptation the being endowed with intelligence acquires an enormous advantage over everything which does not reason No doubt as has been shrewdly remarked natural selection resembles a finality for it ends in an adaptation of beings to their surroundings There is therefore strictly speaking such a thing as finality without intelligence But the adaptation resulting therefrom is a crude one and proceeds by the elimination of all that does not succeed in adapting itself it is a butchery Real finalism saves many deaths many sufferings and many abortions thirty nine Let us examine then the process of preadaptation it will enable us to thoroughly comprehend not only the difference between the physical and the psychical laws but the reason why the psychical manages in some fashion to mould itself upon the physical law Now the means employed by preadaptation is if we take the matter in its simplest form to be aware of sensations before they are experienced If we reflect that all prevision implies a previous knowledge of the probable trend of events it will be understood that the part played by intelligence consists in becoming imbued with the laws of nature for the purpose of imitating its workings By the laws of nature we understand here only that order of real sensations the knowledge of which is sufficient to fulfil the wants of practical life To us there are always gaps in this order because the sensation it is important for us to know is separated from us either by the barriers of time or of space or by the complication of useless sensations Thence the necessity of interpolations That which we do not perceive directly by our senses we are obliged to represent to ourselves by our intelligence the image does the work of sensation and supplements the halting sensation in everything which concerns adaptation To replace the inaccessible sensation by the corresponding image is therefore to create in ourselves a representation of the outer world which is on all the points most useful to us more complete than the direct and sensorial presentation of the moment There is in us a power of creation and this power exercises itself in the imitation of the work of nature it imitates its order it reconstitutes on the small scale adapted to our minds the great external order of events Now this work of imitation is only really possible if the imitator has some means at his disposal analogous to those of the model Our minds could not divine the designs of nature if the laws of images had nothing in common with the laws of nature We are thus led to confront these two orders of laws with each other but before doing so one more preliminary word is necessary We have up till now somewhat limited the problem in order to understand it We have reduced the psychological being to one single function the intellectual and to one single object of research the truth This is however an error which has often been committed which is now known and catalogued called intellectualism or the abuse of intellectualism It is committed for this very simple reason that it is the intellectual part of our being which best allows itself to be understood and so to speak intellectualised But this leaves out of the question a part of our entire mental being so important and so eminent that if this part be suppressed the intelligence would cease to work and would have no more utility than a machine without motive power Our own motive power is the will the feeling or the tendency Will is perhaps the most characteristic psychical function since as I have already had occasion to say nothing analogous to it is met with in the world of nature Let us therefore not separate the will from the intelligence let us incarnate them one in the other and instead of representing the function of the mind as having for its aim knowledge foresight the combination of means and self adaptation we shall be much nearer the truth in representing to ourselves a being who wills to know wills to foresee and wills to adapt himself for after all he wills to live Having said this let us compare the psychological law and that of nature Are they identical We shall be told that they are not since as a fact errors are committed at every moment by the sudden failures of human reason This is the first idea which arises Human error it would seem is the best proof that the two laws in question are not alike and we will readily add that a falling stone does not mistake its way that the crystal in the course of formation does not miss taking the crystalline shape because they form part of physical nature and are subject in consequence to its determinism But this is faulty reasoning and a moment of reflection demonstrates it in the clearest possible manner for adaptation may miss its aim without the being who adapts himself and his surroundings necessarily obeying different laws When the heat of a too early spring causes buds to burst forth prematurely which are afterwards destroyed by frost there is produced a fault of adjustment which resembles an error of adaptation and the bringing forward of this error does not necessarily imply that the tree and the whole of physical nature are obeying different laws Moreover the difference between the laws of nature and those of the understanding does not need deduction by reasoning from an abstract principle it is better to say that it is directly observable and this is how I find that it presents itself to us The essential law of nature is relatively easy to formulate as it is comprised in the very definition of law It simply consists in the sentence uniformity under similar conditions We might also say a constant relation between two or several phenomena which can also be expressed in a more abstract way by declaring that the law of nature rests on the combination of two notions identity and constancy On the other hand the laws of our psychical activity partly correspond to the same tendencies and it would be easy to demonstrate that the microcosm of our thoughts is governed by laws which are also an expression of these two combined notions of constancy and identity It is above all in the working of the intellectual machine the best known and the most clearly analysed up till now that we see the application of this mental law which resembles as we say on certain sides the physical law and the best we can do for our demonstration will doubtless be to dissect our reasoning powers Reason a process essential to thought in action is developed in accordance with a law which resembles in the most curious manner a physical law It resembles it enough to imitate it to conform to it and so to speak to mould itself on it Now the reason does not follow the caprices of thought it is subject to rules it results from the properties of the images those properties which we have above referred to the material character of which we have recognised and which are two in number similarity and contiguity as they are termed in the jargon of the schools They are properties which have for their aim to bring things together to unite and to synthetise They are unceasingly at work and so apparent in their labour that they have long been known We know since the time of Aristotle that two facts perceived at the same time reproduce themselves together in the memory this is the law of contiguity and that two facts perceived separately but which are similar are brought together in our mind this is the law of similarity Now similarity and contiguity form by combination the essential part of all kinds of reasoning and this reasoning thus understood works in a fashion which much resembles we shall see exactly in what degree a physical law I wish to show this in a few words What renders my demonstration difficult and perhaps obscure is that we shall be obliged to bring together rather unexpectedly categories of phenomena which are generally considered separate The distinctive attribute of the reason consists as I have said in the setting to work of these two elementary properties similarity and contiguity It consists in fact in extending continuity by similarity in endowing with identical properties and similar accompaniments things which resemble each other in other words it consists in impliedly asserting that the moment two things are identical in one point they are so for all the rest This will be fairly well understood by imagining what takes place when mental images having the above mentioned properties meet Suppose that B is associated with C and that A resembles B In consequence of their resemblance the passing from A to B is easy and then B suggesting C by contiguity it happens that this C is connected with A connected though in reality they have never been tried together I say they are associated on the basis of their relation to B which is the rallying point It is thus that on seeing a piece of red hot iron A I conclude it is hot C because I recollect distinctly or unconsciously another piece of red hot iron B of which I once experienced the heat It is this recollection B which logicians in their analysis of logical verbal and formal argument call the middle term Our representation of the process of reasoning is not special to argument It also expresses the process of invention and every kind of progress from the known to the unknown It is an activity which creates relations which assembles and binds together and the connections made between different representations are due to their partial identities which act as solder to two pieces of metal It will now be understood that these relations between the images curiously resemble the external order of things the order of our sensations the order of nature the physical law This is because this physical law also has the same character and expresses itself similarly We might say all things which resemble each other have the same properties or all things alike on one point resemble each other on all other points But immediately we do so the difference between the physical and the mental law becomes apparent The formula we have given is only true on condition that many restrictions and distinctions are made The process of nature is so to do that the same phenomenon always unfolds itself in the same order But this process is not always comprehended in real life for it is hidden from our eyes by the manifold combinations of chance in the reality that we perceive there is a crowd of phenomena which resemble each other but are not really the same There are a number of phenomena which company exist or follow each other without this order of company existence or succession being necessary or constant In other words there are resemblances which are the marks of something as a logician would say and others which are not the marks of anything there are relations of time and space which are the expression of a law there are some which are accidental and may possibly never be reproduced It would be a wonderful advantage if every scientific specialist would make out a list of the non significant properties that he recognises in matter The chemist for example would show us that specific weight has hardly any value in diagnosis that the crystalline form of a salt is often not its own that its colour especially is almost negligible because an immense number of crystals are white or colourless that precipitation by a given substance does not ordinarily suffice to characterise a body and so on The botanist on his part would show us that in determining plants absolute dimension is less important than proportion colour less important than form certain structures of organs less important than others The pathologist would teach us that most pathological symptoms have but a trivial value the cries the enervation the agitation of a patient even the delirium which so affects the bystanders are less characteristic of fever than the rate of his pulse and the latter less than the temperature of the armpit or the dryness of the tongue c At every moment the study of science reveals resemblances of facts and contiguities of facts which must be neglected for the sake of others And if we pass from this profound knowledge of the objects to the empirical knowledge to the external perception of bodies it is in immense number that one espies around one traps laid by nature The sound we hear resembles several others all produced by different causes many of our visual sensations likewise lend themselves to the most varied interpretations by the side of the efficient cause of an event we find a thousand entangled contingencies which appear so important that to disentangle them we are as much perplexed as the savage who unable to discriminate between causes and coincidences returns to drink at the well which has cured him carefully keeping to the same hour the same gestures and the same finery The reason of this is that the faculty of similarity and the faculty of contiguity do not give the distinction necessary as it is between resemblances and company existences which are significant and those which are not The causal nexus between two phenomena is not perceived as something apart and sui generis it is not even perceived at all We perceive only their relation in time and space and it is our mind which raises a succession to the height of a causal connection by intercalating between cause and effect something of what we ourselves feel when we voluntarily order the execution of a movement This is not the place to inquire what are the experimental conditions in which we subject phenomena to this anthropomorphic transformation it will suffice for us to repeat here that in perception a chance relation between phenomena impresses us in the same way as when it is the expression of a law Our intellectual machine sometimes works in accord with the external law and at others makes mistakes and goes the wrong way Then we are obliged to correct it and to try a better adjustment either by profounder experimenting with nature methods of concordance discordance variations c or by a comparison of different judgments and arguments made into a synthesis and this collaboration of several concordant activities ends in a conclusion which can never represent the truth but only the probable truth The study of the laws of the mind shows us too clearly in fact their fluidity with regard to the laws of nature for us not to accept probabilism There exists no certitude only very varied degrees of probability Daily practice contents itself with a very low degree of probability judicial logic demands a rather higher one especially when it is a question of depriving one of our fellow creatures of liberty or life Science claims one higher still But there is never anything but differences of degrees in probability and conjecture This then is the definition of psychology that we propose It studies a certain number of laws which we term mental in opposition to those of external nature from which they differ but which properly speaking do not deserve the qualification of mental since they are or at least the best known of them are laws of the images and the images are material elements Although it may seem absolutely paradoxical psychology is a science of matter the science of a part of matter which has the property of preadaptation FOOTNOTES Footnote thirty three LANGE Histoire du Materialisme II twome partie chap iii Footnote thirty four Let us remark in passing how badly nature has organised the system of communication between thinking beings In what we experience we have nothing in common with our fellows each one experiences his own sensations and not those of others The only meeting point of different minds is found in the inaccessible domain of the noumena Footnote thirty five E RABIER Lecons de Philosophie Psychologie p thirty three Footnote thirty six This seems to have been the opinion of Democritus The modern doctrine of radiation from the human body if established would go nearly as far as the supposition in the text Up till now however it lacks confirmation ED Footnote thirty seven I am compelled much against my will to use throughout this passage an equivocal expression that of mental law or law of consciousness or psychological law I indicate by this the laws of contiguity and of similarity as they result from the properties of the images and as these are of a material nature they are really physical and material laws like those of external nature But how can all these laws be called physical laws without running the risk of confusing them one with the other Footnote thirty eight Finality seems to be here used in the sense of the doctrine which regards perfection as the final cause of existence ED Footnote thirty nine See a very interesting article by E GOBLOT La Finalite sans Intelligence Revue de Metaphysique July nineteen hundred BOOK III THE UNION OF THE SOUL forty AND THE BODY CHAPTER I THE MIND HAS AN INCOMPLETE LIFE 
1779_142733_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The problem of the union of the mind and the body is not one of those which present themselves in pure speculation it has its roots in experimental facts and is forced upon us by the necessity of explaining observations such as those we are about to quote 
none	none	The force of our consciousness the correctness of our judgments our tempers and our characters the state of health of our minds and also their troubles their weaknesses and even their existence are all in a state of strict dependence on the condition of our bodies more precisely with that of our nervous systems or more precisely still with the state of those three pounds of proteid substance which each of us has at the back of his forehead and which are called our brains 
1779_142733_000006_000001	train-clean-360	This is daily demonstrated by thousands upon thousands of observations 
1779_142733_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The question is to know how this union of the body with the consciousness is to be explained it being assumed that the two terms of this union present a great difference in their nature 
1779_142733_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The easier it seems to demonstrate that this union exists the more difficult it appears to explain how it is realised and the proof of this difficulty is the number of divergent interpretations given to it Were it a simple question of fact the perpetual discussions and controversies upon it would not arise 
none	none	Many problems here present themselves 
1779_142733_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The first is that of the genesis or origin of the consciousness 
none	none	It has to be explained how a psychical phenomenon can appear in the midst of material ones 
1779_142733_000008_000003	train-clean-360	In general one begins by supposing that the material phenomena are produced first they consist for instance in the working of the nervous centres 
1779_142733_000008_000004	train-clean-360	All this is physical or chemical and therefore material 
1779_142733_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Then at a given moment after this mechanical process a quite different phenomenon emerges 
1779_142733_000008_000006	train-clean-360	This is thought consciousness emotion 
none	none	Then comes the question whether this production of thought in the midst of physical phenomena is capable of explanation and how thought is connected with its physical antecedents 
1779_142733_000008_000008	train-clean-360	What is the nature of the link between them 
1779_142733_000008_000009	train-clean-360	Is it a relation of cause to effect of genesis or a coincidence or the interaction of two distinct forces Is this relation constant or necessary 
1779_142733_000008_000010	train-clean-360	Can the mind enjoy an existence independent of the brain 
1779_142733_000008_000011	train-clean-360	Can it survive the death of the brain 
1779_142733_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The second question is that of knowing what is the role the utility and the efficacity of the psychical phenomenon 
none	none	Once formed this phenomenon evolves in a certain direction and assumes to us who have consciousness of it a very great importance What is its action on the material phenomena of the brain which surround it Does it develop according to laws of its own which have no relation to the laws of brain action 
1779_142733_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Does it exercise any action on these intra cerebral functions 
1779_142733_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Does it exercise any action on the centrifugal currents which go to the motor nerves 
1779_142733_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Is it capable of exciting a movement 
1779_142733_000009_000007	train-clean-360	or is it deprived of all power of creating effect 
none	none	We will briefly examine the principal solutions which the imagination of mankind has found for these very difficult problems 
1779_142733_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Some of the best known of these solutions bear the names of spiritualism materialism parallelism and monism 
none	none	We will speak of these and of some others also 
1779_142733_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Before beginning our critical statement let us recall some of the results of our previous analyses which here intrude themselves to use the ambitious language of Kant as the prolegomena to every future solution which claims the title of science 
none	none	In fact we are now no longer at the outset of our investigation 
1779_142733_000011_000002	train-clean-360	We have had to acknowledge the exactness of certain facts and we are bound to admit their consequences 
1779_142733_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Notably the definition of psychical phenomena at which we arrived not without some trouble will henceforth play a rather large part in our discussion 
1779_142733_000011_000004	train-clean-360	It will force us to question a great metaphysical principle which up till now has been almost universally considered as governing the problem of the union of the mind with the body 
none	none	This principle bears the name of the axiom of heterogeneity or the principle of psycho physical dualism 
1779_142733_000012_000001	train-clean-360	No philosopher has more clearly formulated it and more logically deduced its consequences than Flournoy 
none	none	This author has written a little pamphlet called Metaphysique et Psychologie wherein he briefly sets forth all the known systems of metaphysics by reducing them to the so called principle of heterogeneity after this the same principle enables him to execute them He formulates it in the following terms body and mind consciousness and the molecular cerebral movement of the brain the psychical fact and the physical fact although simultaneous are heterogeneous unconnected irreducible and obstinately two forty one The same author adds this is evident of itself and axiomatic Every physical chemical or physiological event in the last resort simply consists according to science in a more or less rapid displacement of a certain number of material elements in a change of their mutual distances or of their modes of grouping Now what can there be in common I ask you what analogy can you see between this drawing together or moving apart of material masses in space and the fact of having a feeling of joy the recollection of an absent friend the perception of a gas jet a desire or of an act of volition of any kind And further on All that we can say to connect two events so absolutely dissimilar is that they take place at the same time This does not mean that we wish to reduce them to unity or to join them together by the link of causality it is impossible to conceive any real connection any internal relation between these two unconnected things 
1779_142733_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Let us not hesitate to denounce as false this proposition which is presented to us as an axiom 
1779_142733_000013_000001	train-clean-360	On looking closely into it we shall perceive that the principle of heterogeneity does not contain the consequences it is sought to ascribe to it 
1779_142733_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It seems to me it should be split up into two propositions of very unequal value one the mind and body are heterogeneous two by virtue of this heterogeneity it is not possible to understand any direct relation between the two 
none	none	Now if the first proposition is absolutely correct in the sense that consciousness and matter are heterogeneous the second proposition seems to us directly contrary to the facts which show us that the phenomena of consciousness are incomplete phenomena 
1779_142733_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The consciousness is not sufficient for itself as we have said it cannot exist by itself 
none	none	This again if you like is an axiom or rather it is a fact shown by observation and confirmed by reflection 
1779_142733_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Mind and matter brought down to the essential to the consciousness and its object form a natural whole and the difficulty does not consist in uniting but in separating them 
1779_142733_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Consider the following fact I experience a sensation and I have consciousness of it 
1779_142733_000014_000005	train-clean-360	This is the coupling of two things a sensation and a cognition 
none	none	The two elements if we insist upon it are heterogeneous and they differ qualitatively but notwithstanding the existing prejudice by reason of which no direct relation no commerce can be admitted between heterogeneous facts the alliance of the consciousness and the sensation is the natural and primitive fact 
1779_142733_000015_000001	train-clean-360	They can only be separated by analysis and a scrupulous mind might even ask whether one has the right to separate them 
1779_142733_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I have a sensation and I have consciousness of it 
1779_142733_000015_000003	train-clean-360	If not two facts they are one and the same 
1779_142733_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Now sensation is matter and my consciousness is mind 
1779_142733_000015_000005	train-clean-360	If I am judging an assortment of stuffs this assortment or the sensation I have of them is a particle of matter a material state and my judgment on this sensation is the psychical phenomenon 
1779_142733_000015_000006	train-clean-360	We can neither believe nor desire nor do any act of our intelligence without realising this welding together of mind and matter 
1779_142733_000015_000007	train-clean-360	They are as inseparable as motion and the object that moves and this comparison though far fetched is really very convenient 
1779_142733_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Motion cannot exist without a mobile object and an object on the other hand can exist without movement 
1779_142733_000015_000009	train-clean-360	In the same way sensation may exist without the consciousness but the converse proposition consciousness without sensation without an object an empty consciousness or a pure thought cannot be understood 
none	none	Let us mark clearly how this union is put forward by us 
1779_142733_000016_000001	train-clean-360	We describe it after nature 
1779_142733_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It is observation which reveals to us the union and the fusion of the two terms into one 
1779_142733_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Or rather we do not even perceive their union until the moment when by a process of analysis we succeed in convincing ourselves that that which we at first considered single is really double or if you like can be made into two by the reason without being so in reality 
1779_142733_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Thus it happens that we bring this big problem in metaphysics on to the field of observation 
none	none	Our solution vaguely resembles that which has sometimes been presented under the ancient name of physical influx or under the more modern name of inter actionism 
1779_142733_000017_000001	train-clean-360	There are many authors who maintain that the soul can act directly on the body and modify it and this is what is called inter actionism 
1779_142733_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Thereby is understood if I mistake not an action from cause to effect produced between two terms which enjoy a certain independence with regard to each other 
1779_142733_000017_000003	train-clean-360	This interpretation is indubitably close to ours though not to be confused with it 
1779_142733_000017_000004	train-clean-360	My personal interpretation sets aside the idea of all independence of the mind since it attributes to the mind an incomplete and as it were a virtual existence 
1779_142733_000018_000000	train-clean-360	If we had to seek paternity for ideas I would much rather turn to Aristotle 
1779_142733_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It was not without some surprise that I was able to convince myself that the above theory of the relations between the soul and the body is to be found almost in its entirety in the great philosopher 
1779_142733_000018_000002	train-clean-360	It is true that it is mixed up with many accessory ideas which are out of date and which we now reject but the essential of the theory is there very clearly formulated and that is the important point 
1779_142733_000018_000003	train-clean-360	A few details on this subject will not be out of place 
1779_142733_000018_000004	train-clean-360	I give them not from the original source which I am not erudite enough to consult direct but from the learned treatise which Bain has published on the psychology of Aristotle as an appendix to his work on the Senses and the Intelligence 
1779_142733_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The whole metaphysics of Aristotle is dominated by the distinction between form and matter 
none	none	This distinction is borrowed from the most familiar fact in the sensible world the form of solid objects 
1779_142733_000019_000002	train-clean-360	We may name a substance without troubling ourselves as to the form it possesses and we may name the form without regard to the substance that it clothes 
none	none	But this distinction is a purely abstract one for there can be no real separation of form from matter no form without matter and no matter without form The two terms are correlative each one implies the other and neither can be realised or actualised without the other Every individual substance can be considered from a triple point of view first form second matter and third the compound or aggregate of form and matter the inseparable Ens which transports us out of the domain of logic and abstraction into that of reality 
1779_142733_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Aristotle recognises between these two logical correlatives a difference in rank 
none	none	Form is superior nobler the higher in dignity nearer to the perfect entity matter is inferior more modest more distant from perfection On account of its hierarchical inferiority matter is often presented as the second or correlatum and form as the first or relatum 
1779_142733_000020_000003	train-clean-360	This difference in rank is so strongly marked that these two correlations are likewise conceived in a different form that of the potential and the actual 
1779_142733_000020_000004	train-clean-360	Matter is the potential imperfect roughly outlined element which is not yet actual and may perhaps never become so 
1779_142733_000020_000005	train-clean-360	Form is the actual the energy the entelechy which actualises the potential and determines the final compound 
1779_142733_000021_000000	train-clean-360	These few definitions will make clear the singularly ingenious idea of Aristotle on the nature of the body the soul and of their union 
none	none	The body is matter which is only intelligible as the correlatum of form it can neither exist by itself nor be known by itself that is to say when considered outside this relation 
1779_142733_000021_000002	train-clean-360	The soul is form the actual By uniting with the body it constitutes the living subject 
none	none	The soul is the relatum and is unintelligible and void of sense without its correlatum The soul says Aristotle is not a variety of body but it could not exist without a body the soul is not a body but something which belongs or is relative to a body The animated subject is a form plunged and engaged in matter and all its actions and passions are so likewise 
1779_142733_000021_000005	train-clean-360	Each has its formal side which concerns the soul and its material side which concerns the body 
none	none	The emotion which belongs to the animated subject or aggregate of soul and body is a complex fact having two aspects logically distinguishable from each other each of which is correlative to the other and implies it It is thus not only with our passions but also with our perceptions our imaginations reminiscences reasonings and efforts of attention to learn Intelligence like emotion is a phenomenon not simply of the corporeal organism nor of the Greek Nous only but of the commonalty or association of which they are members and when the intelligence weakens it is not because the Greek Nous is altered but because the association is destroyed by the ruin of the corporeal organism These few notes which I have taken in their integrity from Bain s text allow us thoroughly to comprehend the thought of Aristotle and it seems to me that the Greek philosopher by making of the soul and body two correlative terms has formed a comparison of great exactness I also much admire his idea according to which it is through the union of the body and soul that the whole which till then was only possible goes forth from the domain of logic and becomes actual 
1779_142733_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The soul actualises the body and becomes as he said its entelechy 
1779_142733_000023_000000	train-clean-360	These views are too close to those I have myself just set forth for it to be necessary to dwell on their resemblance 
1779_142733_000023_000001	train-clean-360	The latter would become still stronger if we separated from the thought of Aristotle a few developments which are not essential though he allowed them great importance I refer to the continual comparison he makes with the form and matter of corporeal objects 
none	none	Happy though it may be this comparison is but a metaphor which perhaps facilitates the understanding of Aristotle s idea but is not essential to his theory For my part I attach far greater importance to the character of relatum and correlatum ascribed to the two terms mind and matter and to the actualisation forty two produced by their union 
1779_142733_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Let me add another point of comparison 
none	none	Aristotle s theory recalls in a striking manner that of Kant on the a priori forms of thought 
1779_142733_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The form of thought or the category is nothing without the matter of cognition and the latter is nothing without the application of form Thoughts without content given by sensation are empty intuitions without concept furnished by the understanding are blind There is nothing astonishing in finding here the same illustration since there is throughout a question of describing the same phenomenon the relation of mind to matter 
1779_142733_000025_000000	train-clean-360	There remains to us to review the principal types of metaphysical systems 
none	none	We shall discuss these by taking as our guide the principle we have just evolved and which may be thus formulated The phenomena of consciousness constitute an incomplete mode of existence FOOTNOTES Footnote forty See Note one on p three Footnote forty one For reference see Note eighteen on p seventy three ED Footnote forty two i e rendering actual ED CHAPTER II SPIRITUALISM forty three AND IDEALISM Flournoy has somewhere written that the chief interest of the systems of metaphysics lies less in the intellectual constructions they raise than in the aspirations of the mind and of the heart to which they correspond Without taking literally this terribly sceptical opinion it would be highly useful to begin the study of any metaphysical system by the psychology of its author The value of each system would be better understood and their reasons would be comprehended This book is too short to permit us to enter into such biographical details I am obliged to take the metaphysical systems en bloc as if they were anonymous works and to efface all the shades occasionally so curious that the thought of each author has introduced into them Yet however brief our statement it seems indispensable to indicate clearly the physical or moral idea concealed within each system SPIRITUALISM It is known that spiritualism is a doctrine which has for its chief aim the raising of the dignity of man by recognising in him faculties superior to the properties of matter We constantly meet in spiritualism with the notion of superior and inferior understood not only in an intellectual sense but also in the sense of moral worth It will also be remarked as a consequence of the above principle that a spiritualist does not confine himself to discussing the ideas of his habitual adversary the materialist he finds them not only false but dangerous and is indignant with them some persons even ingenuously acknowledge that they hold firmly to certain principles because they fear to be converted to materialism I can also discern in this system a very natural horror of death which inspires in so many people of whom I am one both hatred and disgust The spiritualist revolts against the prospect of a definitive annihilation of thought and the system he adopts is largely explained as an effort towards immortality This effort has led to the theory of two substances the soul and the body which are represented as being as thoroughly separated as possible The soul has not its origin in the body and it derives none of its properties from its fellow it is a substance created in complete independence relatively to the body the soul in its essence has nothing in common with matter The essence of the soul said Descartes is thought the essence of the body is extent It follows from this that the soul in its determinations and actions is liberated from the laws and necessities of the corporeal nature it is a free power a power of indetermination capable of choice capable of introducing new unforeseen and unforeseeable actions and on this point opposes itself to corporeal phenomena which are all subject to a determinism so rigorous that any event could be foreseen if its antecedents were known Another consequence of spiritualism is the admission of the immortality of the soul which being widely distinct from the body is not affected by its dissolution it is on the contrary liberated since death cuts the link which binds them together But there is a link and the explanation of this link brings with it the ruin of the whole system One is forced to admit that this principle of the separation of body and soul is liable in fact to many exceptions Even if they are two isolated powers the necessities of life oblige them to enter continually into communication with each other In the case of perceptions it is the body which acts on the soul and imparts sensations to it in movements it is the soul on the contrary which acts on the body to make it execute its desires and its will Spiritualists must acknowledge that they are at some trouble to explain this traffic between the two substances for with their respect for the principle of heterogeneity mentioned above they do not manage to conceive how that contact of the physical and the mental can be made which is constantly necessary in the life of relation By what means have they long asked themselves can that which is only extent act on that which is only thought How can we represent to ourselves this local union of matter with an immaterial principle which by its essence does not exist in space The two substances have been so completely separated to insure the liberty of the soul and its superiority over the body that it has become impossible to bring them together The scission has been too complete They cannot be sewn together again Such are the principal objections raised against spiritualism These objections are derived from points of view which are not ours and we have therefore no need to estimate their value From our point of view the spiritualist conception has chosen an excellent starting point By establishing the consciousness and the object of cognition as two autonomous powers neither of which is the slave of the other spiritualism has arrived at an opinion of irreproachable exactness it is indeed thus that the relations of these two terms must be stated each has the same importance and the right to the same autonomy forty four Yet spiritualism has not rested there and by a lamentable exaggeration it has thought that the consciousness which it calls the soul could exercise its functions in complete independence of the object of cognition which it calls matter There is the error It consists in misunderstanding the incomplete and as it were virtual existence of the consciousness This refutation is enough as regards spiritualism Nothing more need be added IDEALISM Idealism is an exceedingly complex system varying much with varying authors very polymorphous and consequently very difficult to discuss The ancient hylozoism the monadism of Leibnitz and the recent panpsychism of M Strong are only different forms of the same doctrine Like spiritualism with which it is connected by many ties idealism is a philosophy which expresses some disdain for matter but the thoughts which have sought to shelter themselves under this philosophy are so varied that it would be perilous to try to define them briefly There can be discussed in idealism a certain number of affirmations which form the basis of the system None of these affirmations is strictly speaking demonstrated or demonstrable but they offer very different degrees of probability and it is for this reason that we shall notice them Amongst these affirmations there are some that we have already met with in our study of the definition of sensation others will be newer to us one Here is one which seems to arise directly from the facts and appears for a long time to have constituted an impregnable position for idealists It may be expressed in three words esse est percipi Starting with the observation that every time we bear witness to the existence of the external world it is because we perceive it idealists admit that the existence of this external world shares exactly the lot of our perception and that like it it is discontinuous and intermittent When we close our eyes it ceases to exist like a torch which is extinguished and lights up again when we open them We have already discussed this proposition and have shown that it contains nothing imperative and we may very well decline to subscribe to it two There follows a second proposition barely distinct from the previous one There should be nothing else in objects but that which we perceive and that of which we have consciousness should be in the fullest possible acceptation of the words the measure of what is Consequently there should be no need to seek under the object perceived another and larger reality a source from which might flow wider knowledge than that we at present possess This is as disputable as the preceding affirmation and for the same reasons three The third proposition is the heart of the idealist thesis It is sometimes presented as a deduction from the foregoing but it is nevertheless thoroughly distinct from it and the preceding affirmations might legitimately be accepted and this new one rejected This proposition may be expressed thus Everything that is perceived is psychical It is not only idealists who subscribe to this opinion however and we have seen when dealing with the definition of matter that it is widely spread We understand by it that the objects we perceive exist in the consciousness are of the consciousness and are constituted by ideas the whole world is nothing but idea and representation and since our mind is taken to be of a psychical nature the result is that everything absolutely everything the person who knows and the thing known are all psychical This is panpsychism Flournoy on this point says with a charm coloured by irony We henceforth experience a sweet family feeling we find ourselves so to speak at home in the midst of this universe forty five We have demonstrated above that the unity here attained is purely verbal since we cannot succeed in suppressing the essential differences of things four Now comes an affirmation on the genesis of things After having admitted that the object is an idea of the mind one of its manifestations or one of its moods the idealists go so far as to say that the consciousness is the generating power of ideas and consequently the generating cause of the universe It is thought which creates the world That is the final conclusion I indicated beforehand in the chapters on the definition of sensation and on the distinction between the consciousness and the object the reasons which lead me to reject the premises of idealism It will be sufficient to offer here a criticism on its last conclusion It is the mind that creates the world This thesis strikes at the duality consciousness and object it gives the supremacy to the consciousness by making of the object an effect or property of the former We can object that this genesis cannot be clearly represented and that for the very simple reason that it is impossible to clearly accept mind as a separate entity and distinct from matter It is easy to affirm this separation thanks to the psittacism of the words which are here used like counterfeit coin but we cannot represent it to ourselves for it corresponds to nothing The consciousness constitutes all that is mental in the world nothing else can be described as mental Now this consciousness only exists as an act it is in other terms an incomplete form of existence which does not exist apart from its object of which the true name is matter It is therefore very difficult to understand this affirmation It is the mind that creates the world since to be able to do so we should have to imagine a consciousness without an object Moreover should we even succeed in doing so we should be none the more disposed on that account to give assent to this proposition Consciousness and matter represent to us the most different and antithetical terms of the whole of the knowable Were the hypothesis to be advanced that one of these elements is capable of engendering the other we should immediately have to ask ourselves why this generating power and this pre eminence should be attributed to one rather than to the other element Who can claim that one solution is more clear more reasonable or more probable than the other One of the great advantages of the history of philosophy here asserts itself This history shows us that different minds when reflecting on the same problems have come to conceive solutions which have appeared to them clear and consequently were possible now as these solutions are often contradictory nothing shows better than their collation the distance between possibility and fact Thus the materialists who like the idealists have put forward a genetic theory of the mind have conceived mind as produced by matter a conception diametrically opposed to that of the idealists It may be said that these two conceptions opposed in sense annul each other and that each of these two philosophical systems has rendered us service by demonstrating the error of the opposing system FOOTNOTES Footnote forty three It is perhaps needless to point out that by spiritualism M Binet does not mean the doctrine of the spirit rappers whom he like other scientific writers designates as spiritists but the creed of all those who believe in disembodied spirits or existences ED Footnote forty four I do not insist on the difference between my conception and the spiritualistic conception my distinction between consciousness and matter does not correspond it is evident to that of facts of consciousness and physical facts which spiritualism sets up Footnote forty five Archives de Psychologie vol iv No fourteen Nov nineteen oh four p one hundred thirty two article on Panpsychism CHAPTER III MATERIALISM AND PARALLELISM Materialism is a very ancient doctrine It is even the most ancient of all which simply proves that amongst the different explanations given of our double physico mental nature this doctrine is the easiest to understand The origin of materialism is to be found in the beliefs of savage tribes and is again found very clearly defined in the philosophy of those ancient Greeks who philosophized before Plato and Aristotle A still stranger fact is that the thoughts of a great number of the Fathers of the Church inclined towards the philosophy of matter Then in the course of its evolution there occurred a moment of eclipse and materialism ceased to attract attention till the contemporary period in which we assist at its re birth Nowadays it constitutes a powerful doctrine the more so that it has surreptitiously crept into the thoughts of many learned men without their being clearly conscious of it There are many physicists and physiologists who think and speak as materialists though they have made up their minds to remain on the battle ground of observed facts and have a holy horror of metaphysics In a certain sense it may be said that materialism is the metaphysics of those who refuse to be metaphysicians It is very evident that in the course of its long history materialism has often changed its skin Like all knowledge it has been subject to the law of progress and certainly it would not have been of a nature to satisfy the intellectual wants of contemporary scholars had it not stripped itself of the rude form under which it first manifested itself in the mind of primitive man Yet what has enabled the doctrine to keep its unity through all its changes is that it manifests a deeply human tendency to cling by preference to everything visible and tangible Whatever strikes the eyes or can be felt by the hand seems to us in the highest degree endowed with reality or existence It is only much later after an effort of refined thought that we come to recognise an existence in everything that can be perceived in any way whatever even in an idea It is still later that we understand that existence is not only that which is perceived but also that which is linked logically with the rest of our knowledge A good deal of progress has been necessary to reach this point As I have not the slightest intention of giving even an abridged history of materialism let us come at once to the present day and endeavour to say in what consists the scientific form this doctrine has assumed Its fundamental basis has not changed It still rests on our tendency to give chief importance to what can be seen and touched and it is an effect of the hegemony of three of our senses the visual the tactile and the muscular The extraordinary development of the physical sciences has no doubt given an enormous encouragement to materialism and it may be said that in the philosophy of nature it occupies a principal place and that it is there in its own domain and unassailable It has become the expression of the idea that everything that can be explained scientifically everything susceptible of being measured is a material phenomenon It is the representation of the material explanation pushed to its last limits and all experiments all calculations all inductions resting on the grand principle of the conservation of matter and energy plead in its favour We will examine with some precision how far such a doctrine solves the problem of the existence of the intellectual functions The doctrine has understood this connection as being purely material and has sought its image in other phenomena which are entirely so Thus it has borrowed from physiology the principle of its explanation it has transported into the domain of thought the idea of function and it has supposed that the soul is to the body in the relation of function to organ Intelligence would thus be a cerebral function To explain intelligence materialists link it with matter turn it into a property of matter and compare it to a movement of matter and sometimes even to a secretion So Karl Vogt the illustrious Genevan naturalist one day declared to the great scandal of every one that the brain secretes the thought as the kidney does urine This bold comparison seemed shocking puerile and false for a secretion is a material thing while thought is not Karl Vogt also employed another comparison the brain produces the thought as the muscle produces movement and it at once seems less offensive to compare the thought to a movement than to compare it to a liquid secretion At the present day an illustration still more vague would be used such as that of a transformation of energy chemical energy disengaged by the nerve centres would be thus looked upon as transformed into psychical energy However it matters little what metaphors are applied to for help in explaining the passage from the physical to the mental What characterises materialist philosophy is its belief in the possibility of such a passage and its considering it as the genesis of thought One calls materialist says Renouvier with great exactness every philosophy which defines thought as the product of a compound whose elements do not imply thought A sweeping formula which allows us to foresee all the future avatars of the materialist doctrine and to class them beforehand in the same category The criticisms which have been directed against materialism are all or nearly all variations of the principle of heterogeneity We will not dwell long on this but simply recollect that according to this principle it is impossible to attribute to the brain the capacity of generating consciousness Physical force can indeed generate physical force under the same or a different form and it thus produces all the effects which are determined by the laws of nature But it is impossible to comprehend how physical force can enrich itself at a given moment by a conscious force Physical force is reduced to movements of bodies and to displacements of atoms how could a change of position in any inert objects give rise to a judgment a reasoning or any phenomenon of the consciousness It is further said this idea of function which materialists here introduce to render more comprehensible the passage from a material body to a spiritual action contains only an empty explanation for the function is not essentially distinct by its nature from the organ it is simply the organ in activity it adds to the organ taken in a state of repose but one change viz activity that is to say movement and consequently the function of an organ is material by the same right as the organ When a muscle contracts this contraction which is the proper function of the muscular fibre consists in a condensation of the muscular protoplasm and this condensation is a material fact When a gland enters into activity a certain quantity of liquid flows into the channels of the gland and this liquid is caused by a physical and chemical modification of the cellular protoplasm it is a melting or a liquefaction which likewise is material The function of the nerve cell is to produce movement or to preserve it or to direct it ii is material like the cells There is therefore nothing in all those functional phenomena which might lead us to understand how a material cause should be capable of engendering a conscious effect It seems that all materialists have acknowledged that here is the vulnerable point in their theory for it is the principle of heterogeneity which they have especially combated But their defence is wanting in frankness and principally consists in subterfuges In brief it affirms that we are surrounded with mystery that we are not sufficiently learned to have the right to impose limits to the power of matter and to say to it Thou shalt not produce this phenomenon A materialist theologian declares that he sees no impossibility in stones thinking and arguing if God in His infinite power has decided to unite thought with brute matter This argument is not really serious it demands the intervention of so powerful a Deus ex machina that it can be applied equally to all problems to solve all is to solve none Modern materialists rightly do not bring God into the question Their mode of argument takes another form but it remains to be seen if at bottom it is not the same as the other It simply consists in affirming that up till now we know certain properties of matter only but that science every day discovers new ones that matter is a reservoir of unknown forces and that it is not impossible that the origin of psychical forces may yet be discovered in matter This idea is clearly hinted at by Littre The physicist Tyndall gave it a definite formula when he uttered at the Belfast Congress this phrase so often quoted If I look back on the limits of experimental science I can discern in the bosom of that matter which in our ignorance while at the same time professing our respect for its Creator we have till now treated with opprobrium the promise and the power of all forms and qualities of life The opponents of the doctrine have not ceased to answer that the matter of to morrow like the matter of to day can generate none but material effects and that a difficulty is not solved by putting off its solution to some indefinite date in our scientific evolution and it certainly seems that the counter stroke is decisive if we admit the principle of heterogeneity with its natural consequence We will now criticise the above doctrine by making use of the ideas I have above enunciated The criticism we have to apply to materialism is not the same as that just summarised The axis of the discussion changes its position In the first place I reproach materialism with presenting itself as a theory of the generation of the consciousness by the object We have already reproached idealism with putting itself forward as a theory of the generation of the object by the consciousness The error of the two systems is produced in a converse direction but is of the same gravity The consciousness and its object we say yet again constitute the widest division it is possible to effect in the domain of cognition it is quite as illegitimate to reduce the first term to the second as to reduce the second to the first To reduce one to the other by way of affiliation or otherwise there must first be discovered then an identity of nature which does not exist In the second place when one examines closely the explanation materialism has imagined in order to derive thought from an action of matter it is seen that this representation is rendered completely impossible by all we know of the nature of thought For the materialist to suppose for one moment that thought is a cerebral function he must evidently make an illusion for himself as to what thought is and must juggle with concepts Perhaps could we penetrate into his own inmost thought we should discover that at the moment he supposes a mere cell can manufacture the phenomena of consciousness some vague image suggests itself to him whereby he identifies these phenomena with a light and subtle principle escaping from the nerve cell something which resembles an electric effluve or a will of the wisp or the flame from a punch bowl forty six I cannot of course tell whether my supposition is correct But what I assert with the calmness of perfect certitude is that the materialist has not taken the pains to analyse attentively what he calls the phenomenon of consciousness Had he made this analysis and kept the elements in his mind he would have seen that it is almost impossible to hook in any way a phenomenon of consciousness on to a material molecule In fact also to take this into account we will not remain within the vagueness of the concept but will take a particular example to argue upon viz that of an external perception I open my window on a fine day and I see before me a sunny plain with as far as the eye can reach houses amongst the trees and again more houses the most distant of which are outlined against my far off horizon This is my mental phenomenon And while I am at my window my eyes fixed on the view the anatomist declares that starting from my retina molecular vibrations travel along the optic nerve cross each other at the chiasma enter into the fascia pass through the internal capsule and reach the hemispheres or rather the occipital regions of the brain where for the moment we agree to localise the centre of projection of the visual sensations This is my physical phenomenon It now becomes the question of passing from this physical phenomena to the mental one And here we are stopped by a really formidable difficulty My mental phenomenon is not entirely mental as is usually supposed from the deceitful brevity of the phrase It is in great part physical for it can be decomposed into two elements a consciousness and its object and this object of the consciousness this group of little houses I see in the plain belongs to sensation that is to say to something physical or in other words to matter Let us examine in its turn the physical process which is supposed to be discovered in my nervous centres while I am in course of contemplating the landscape This pretended physical process itself quite as much as my conscious perception of the landscape is a physico psychical phenomenon for my cerebral movements are perceived hypothetically at least by an observer This is a perception consequently it can be decomposed into two things a consciousness and its object As a further consequence when we wish by a metaphysical effort to attach the consciousness to a material state of the brain and to establish a link between the two events it will be found that we wrongly hook one physico mental phenomenon on to another But evidently this objection is not a refutation We may if we choose suppose that the so called cerebral process is capable of subsisting at moments when no one perceives it and that it exists of itself is sufficient for itself and is entirely physical But can we subject the mental process of perception to the same purification Can we separate these two elements the consciousness and its object retain the element consciousness and reject the element object which is physical thus constituting a phenomenon entirely mental which might then be possibly placed beside the entirely physical phenomenon so as to study their relation to each other This is quite impossible and the impossibility is double for it exists de facto and de jure De jure because we have already established that a consciousness empty and without object cannot be conceived De facto because the existence of the object that consciousness carries with it is very embarrassing for the materialist for this object is material and as real and material as the fibres and cells of the brain It might indeed be supposed that by transformation or otherwise there goes forth from the cerebral convolution a purely psychical phenomenon resembling a wave But how can we conceive the transformation of this convolution into a semi material phenomenon How can we comprehend that there should issue from this convolution the material object of a perception for example a plain dotted with houses An English histologist remarked one day with some eloquence how little the most minute study of the brain aided us to understand thought He was thus answering Auguste Comte who in a moment of aberration claimed that psychology in order to become a science ought to reject the testimony of the consciousness and to use exclusively as its means of study the histology of the nerve centres and the measurement of the cranium Our histologist who had passed part of his life examining under the microscope fragments of cerebral matter in following the forms of the cells the course of the fibres and the grouping and distribution of the fascia made the following remark It is the fact that the study however patient minute and thorough it might be of this nerve skein can never enable us to know what a state of consciousness is if we do not know it otherwise for never across the field of the microscope is there seen to pass a memory an emotion or an act of volition And he added he who confines himself to peering into these material structures remains as ignorant of the phenomena of the mind as the London cabman who for ever travelling through the streets of the great city is ignorant of what is said and what is going on in the interior of the houses This picturesque comparison the truth of which has never been questioned is based on this supposition that the psychical act is entirely immaterial and invisible and therefore escapes the piercing eye of the microscope But a deeper analysis of the mind shows how little exact is this assertion From the moment each psychical act implies a material object we can ask ourselves two things one Why is it that the anatomist does not discover these material objects in the interior of the brain We ought to see them for they are material and therefore visible We ought to see them with their aspect and colour or be able to explain why they are not seen In general all that is described to us in the brain is the molecular vibrations But we are not conscious of them Where then is that of which we are conscious two It should next be explained to us by what elaboration transmutation or metamorphosis a molecular disturbance which is material can transform itself into the objects which are equally material This is the criticism we have to address to materialism Until proof to the contrary I hold it to be irrefutable PARALLELISM For this exposition to follow the logical order of ideas the discussion on materialism should be immediately succeeded by that on parallelism These two doctrines are near akin they resemble each other as the second edition of a book revised and corrected resembles the first Parallelism is the materialist doctrine of those forewarned folk who have perceived the errors committed and endeavour to avoid them while cherishing all that can be saved of the condemned doctrine That which philosophers criticised in materialism was the misunderstanding of the principle of heterogeneity The parallelists have seen this mistake and have taken steps to respect this principle we shall see in what way They are especially prudent and they excel in avoiding being compromised They put forth their hypothesis as a provisional one and they vaunt its convenience It is say they a practical method of avoiding many difficulties it becomes for philosophers an equivalent of that phrase which so many timorous ministers repeat Above all no scrapes Let us study the exact point on which parallelism has amended materialism We have seen that every materialist doctrine is the expression of this idea that physical phenomena are the only ones that are determined measurable explicable and scientific This idea does wonders in the natural sciences but is at fault when from the physical we pass into the moral world and we have seen how the materialistic doctrine fails when it endeavours to attach the physical to the mental There are then two great difficulties which the materialistic explanation finds before it one is a difficulty of mechanism and the other of genesis By connecting the mind with the brain like a function to its organ this doctrine seeks to solve these two problems and with what little success we have seen Parallelism has tried to avoid these two problems not only does it not solve them but it arranges so as not to propound them The expedient adopted consists in avoiding the meeting of the physical and the mental instead of placing them end to end and welding one to the other they are placed in parallel fashion side by side To explain their correlation which so many observations vaguely demonstrate the following hypothesis is advanced Physical and psychical life form two parallel currents which never mingle their waters to every state of definite consciousness there corresponds the counterpart of an equally definite state of the nerve centres the fact of consciousness has its antecedents and its consequences in the consciousness and the physical fact equally takes its place in a chain of physical facts The two series are thus evolved and correspond strictly to each other according to a necessary law so that the scholar who was perfectly instructed and to whom one of these states was presented could describe its fellow But never does any of the terms of one series influence the terms of the other Observation and the testimony of the consciousness seem to attest this dual progress but they are according to the parallelist hypothesis illusions When I move my arm by a voluntary act it is not my will qua act of consciousness which determines the movement of the arm for this is a material fact The movement is produced by the coming into play of groups of muscles Each muscle composed of a semi fluid substance being excited contracts in the direction of its greatest length The excitant of the muscles is also a material fact a material influx which starts from the motor cells of the encephalon and of which we know the course down through the pyramidal fascium the anterior roots of the spinal cord and the nerves of the periphery to its termination in the motor plates of the muscles It is this excitement which is the physical direct and veritable cause of voluntary movements And it is the same with all acts and signs all expressions of our conscious states the trembling of fear the redness of anger the movements of walking down to the words we utter all these are physical effects produced by physical processes which act physically and of which the mental counterpart has in itself no effective action Let it be understood that I am here pointing out one of the forms and that the most usual of the parallelist theory Each author varies it according to his fancy some widen the correspondence between the physical and the moral others prefer to narrow it At one time a vague relation is supposed which is only true on a large scale and is a union rather than an equivalence At another it is an exact counterpart a complete duplicate in which the smallest physical event corresponds to a mental one In one of the forms of this theory that has been recently invented parallelists have gone so far as to assert that there exists no real cohesion in the mental chain and that no mental phenomenon can have the property of provoking another mental phenomenon by an act of true causality It is within the nervous tissue they say that the nexus of psychic states should be enclosed These should succeed in time without being directly connected with one another they should succeed because the physical basis of them is excited in succession Some of them would be like an air on the piano the notes follow each other and arrange themselves into melodies not by any affinity proper to themselves but because the keys of the instrument are struck in the required order I said a little while ago that parallelism was a perfected materialism The reason of this will be understood It is a doctrine which preserves the determinism of physical facts while avoiding the compromising of itself in the difficult explanation of the connection between the soul and the body It remains scientific without raising a metaphysical heresy Bain is one of those who have most clearly expressed not only the advantages but also the aspirations of this theory Mind and Body p one hundred thirty We have every reason for believing he says that there is in company with all our mental processes an unbroken material succession From the ingress of a sensation to the outgoing responses in action the mental succession is not for an instant dissevered from a physical succession A new prospect bursts upon the view there is mental result of sensation emotion thought terminating in outward displays of speech or gesture Parallel to this mental series is the physical series of facts the successive agitation of the physical organs called the eye the retina the optic nerve optic centres cerebral hemispheres outgoing nerves muscles c While we go the round of the mental circle of sensation emotion and thought there is an unbroken physical circle of effects It would be incompatible with everything we know of the cerebral action to suppose that the physical chain ends abruptly in a physical void occupied by an immaterial substance which immaterial substance after working alone imparts its results to the other edge of the physical break and determines the active response two shores of the material with an intervening ocean of the immaterial There is in fact no rupture of nervous continuity The only tenable supposition is that mental and physical proceed together as undivided twins On reading this passage it is easy to see the idea which forms the basis of the doctrine It is as I have already said the fetichism of mechanics parallelism takes its inspiration from this quite as directly as does materialism but with more skill inasmuch as it avoids the most dangerous question that of the interaction of physics and morals and replaces it by an hypothesis much resembling Leibnitz s hypothesis of the pre established harmony On the other hand a second merit of this prudent doctrine is the avoiding the question of genesis It does not seek for the origin of thought but places this last in a relation of parallelism with the manifestations of matter and in the same way that parallel lines prolonged ad infinitum never meet so the partisans of this doctrine announce their resolution not to inquire how the actual state of things has been formed nor how it will end if for example one of the terms should disappear by the death of the bodily organism Notwithstanding so many precautions criticisms have not been wanting only they would seem not to have touched the weak part of the doctrine and not to be decisive We will only run through them briefly It has been said there is no logical necessity which forces us to refuse to the consciousness the privilege of acting in complete independence of the nervous mechanism It has also been said it is by no means certain that any nervous mechanism can be invented which imitates and if need were could replace an intellectual act For instance what association of nerve cells what molecular action can imitate an act of comparison which enables us to see a resemblance between two objects Let it be supposed for example that the resemblance of two impressions come from a partial identity and that the latter has for material support an identity in the seat or the form of the corresponding nervous influx But what is identity How can it be conceived without supposing resemblance of which it is but a form How then can the one be explained by the other Thus for instance at the bottom of all our intellectual acts there is a certain degree of belief Can any material combination be found which corresponds thereto There is one last objection the most serious of all Parallelism by establishing a fixed and invariable relation between the physical and the moral ends by denying the role of this last since the physical mechanism is sufficient to draw to itself all the effects which general belief attributes to the moral The parallelists on this point go very much further than the materialists the latter at least concede that the consciousness is of some use since they compared it to a function or a secretion and after all a secretion is a useful liquid The parallelists are so strongly convinced that mechanism is alone efficacious that they come to deny any role to thought The consciousness for them has no purpose yet it keeps company with its object The metaphors which serve to define it part of which have been imagined by Huxley are all of a passive nature Such is the light or the whistling noise which accompanies the working of an engine but does not act on its machinery Or the shadow which dogs the steps of the traveller Or a phosphorescence lighting up the traces of the movements of the brain It has also been said that the consciousness is a useless luxury Some have even gone further and the fine and significant name of epiphenomenon that has been given to thought well translates that conception according to which semi realities may exist in nature All these objections certainly carry great weight but they are not capable of killing the doctrine they only scotch it I think there is a radical vice in parallelism which till now has not been sufficiently indicated and I ask what can really remain of the whole edifice when this vice has been once exposed Parallelism implies a false idea which we have already come across when discussing materialism It is the idea that a phenomenon of consciousness constitutes one complete whole The error proceeds from the use of concepts which cause the reality to be lost sight of The reality shows that every phenomenon of consciousness consists in a mode of activity an aggregate of faculties which require an object to fasten on to and so realise themselves and that this object is furnished by matter What we always note in intuition is the union the incarnation of consciousness matter Our thoughts our memories our reasonings have as object sensations images that is to say things which strictly speaking are as material as our own brains It is therefore rather childish to put all these workings of the spirit on another plane and in another world than the workings of the brain since they are in great part of the same nature as the last named and they contain so many material elements Now if we re establish facts as they are if we admit a parallelism between physical phenomena on the one hand and phenomena at once physical and psychical on the other the parallelist hypothesis loses every sort of meaning It ceases to present to us the image of two phenomena of an absolutely different order which are found coupled together like the two faces of a unity the front and back of a page the right and wrong side of a stuff If there is anything material in the psychical part the opposition of nature no longer exists between the two terms they become identical Very often certain parallelists after thinking they have discovered the duality of nature endeavour to bring it back to unity by supposing that the two faces of the reality are as two effects of one unique reality inaccessible to our senses and underlying appearances Why go so far afield to seek unity It is trouble in vain for it is to be found in the phenomenon itself FOOTNOTES Footnote forty six I can quote two observations in support of this M BRIEUX to whom I was relating this part of my argument stopped me saying You have guessed right I represent to myself thought issuing from brain in the form of an electric gleam doctor SIMON also informed me during the reading of my manuscript that he saw thought floating over the brain like an ignis fatuus CHAPTER IV MODERN THEORIES It may be thought that the objection taken above to parallelism and materialism is personal to myself because I have put it forward as the consequence of my analysis of the respective shares of thought and matter in every act of cognition This is not so I am here in harmony with other philosophers who arrived at the same conclusions long before me and it may be useful to quote them We will begin with the prince of idealists Berkeley Everything you know or conceive other than spirits says Philonous to Hylas is but your ideas so then when you say that all ideas are occasioned by impressions made in the brain either you conceive this brain or you do not If you conceive it you are in that case talking of ideas imprinted in an idea which is the cause of this very idea which is absurd If you do not conceive it you are talking unintelligibly you are not forming a reasonable hypothesis How can it be reasonable he goes on to say to think that the brain which is a sensible thing i e which can be apprehended by the senses an idea consequently which only exists in the mind is the cause of our other ideas forty seven Thus in the reasoning of Berkeley the function of the brain cannot explain the production of ideas because the brain itself is an idea and an idea cannot be the cause of all our other ideas M Bergson s argument is quite similar although he takes a very different standpoint from that of idealism He takes the word image in the vaguest conceivable sense To explain the meaning of this word he simply says images which are perceived when I open my senses and unperceived when I close them He also remarks that the external objects are images and that the brain and its molecular disturbances are likewise images And he adds For this image which I call cerebral disturbance to generate the external images it would have to contain them in one way or another and the representation of the whole material universe would have to be implicated in that of this molecular movement Now it is enough to enunciate such a proposition to reveal its absurdity forty eight It will be seen that this reasoning is the same as Berkeley s though the two authors are reasoning on objects that are different according to Berkeley the brain and the states of conscience are psychical states according to Bergson the definition of the nature of these two objects designated by the term image is more comprehensive but the essential of his argument is independent of this definition It is enough that the two terms should be of similar nature for one to be unable to generate the other My own argument in its turn comes rather near the preceding ones For the idea of Berkeley and the image of Bergson I substitute the term matter I say that the brain is matter and that the perception of any object is perception of matter and I think it is not easy to explain how from this brain can issue this perception since that would be to admit that from one matter may come forth another matter There is certainly here a great difficulty M Bergson has thought to overcome it by attacking it in the following way He has the very ingenious idea of changing the position of the representation in relation to the cerebral movement The materialist places the representation after this movement and derives it from the movement the parallelist places it by the side of the movement and in equivalence to it M Bergson places it before the movement and supposes it to play with regard to it the part of exciting cause or simply that of initiator This cerebral movement becomes an effect of the representation and a motor effect Consequently the nervous system passes into the state of motor organ the sensory nerves are not as supposed true sensory nerves but they are the commencements of motor nerves the aim of which is to lead the motor excitements to the centres which play the part of commutators and direct the current sometimes by one set of nerves sometimes by others The nervous system is like a tool held in the hand it is a vehicle for action we are told and not a substratum for cognition I cannot here say with what ingenuity with what powerful logic and with what close continuity of ideas M Bergson develops his system nor with what address he braves its difficulties His mind is remarkable alike for its power of systematisation and its suppleness of adaptation Before commencing to criticise him I am anxious to say how much I admire him how much I agree with him throughout the critical part of his work and how much I owe to the perusal of his book Matiere et Memoire Though I was led into metaphysics by private needs though some of the ideas I have set forth above were conceptions of my own for example the criticism of the mechanical theory of matter and the definition of sensation before I had read M Bergson s book it cannot be denied that its perusal has so strongly modified my ideas that a great part of these are due to him without my feeling capable of exactly discerning which for ideas have a much more impersonal character than observations and experiments It would therefore have been ungrateful to criticise him before having rendered him this tribute There are in M Bergson s theory a few assertions which surprise us a little like everything which runs counter to old habits It has always been supposed that our body is the receptacle of our psychological phenomena We store our reminiscences in our nerve centres we put the state of our emotions in the perturbations of certain apparatus we find the physical basis of our efforts of will and of attention in the sensations of muscular tension born in our limbs or trunk Directly we believe that the nervous system is no longer the depository of these states we must change their domicile and where are they to be placed Here the theory becomes obscure and vague and custom renders it difficult to understand the situation of the mind outside the body M Bergson places memory in planes of consciousness far removed from action and perception he places in the very object we perceive If I look at my bookcase my thought is in my books if I look at the sky my thought is in a star forty nine It is very difficult to criticise ideas such as these because one is never certain that one understands them I will therefore not linger over them notwithstanding the mistrust which they inspire in me But what seems to me to require proof is the function M Bergson is led to attribute to the sensory nerves To his mind it is not exact to say that the excitement of a sensory nerve excites sensation This would be a wrong description for according to him every nerve even a sensory one serves as a motor it conducts the disturbance which passing through the central commutator flows finally into the muscles But then whence comes it that I think I feel a sensation when my sensory nerve is touched Whence comes it that a pressure on the epitrochlear nerve gives me a tingling in the hand Whence comes it that a blow on the eyeball gives me a fleeting impression of light One must read the page where M Bergson struggles against what seems to me the evidence of the facts If for one reason or another he says the excitement no longer passes it would be strange if the corresponding perception took place since this perception would then put our body in relation with points of space which would no longer invite it to make a choice Divide the optic nerve of any animal the disturbance starting from the luminous point is no longer transmitted to the brain and thence to the motor nerves The thread which connected the external object to the motor mechanism of the animal by enveloping the optic nerve is severed the visual perception has therefore become powerless and in this powerlessness consists unconsciousness This argument is more clever than convincing It is not convincing because it consists in exaggerating beyond all reason a very real fact that of the relation which can be discovered between our sensations and our movements We believe with M Bergson that it is absolutely correct to see in action the end and the raison d etre of our intelligence and our sensibility But does it follow that every degree every shade every detail of sensation even the most insignificant has any importance for the action The variations of sensibility are much more numerous than those of movements and of adaptation very probably as is seen in an attentive study of infancy sensibility precedes the power of motion in its differentiations A child shows an extraordinary acuteness of perception at an age when its hand is still very clumsy The correlation then is not absolute And then even if it were so it would not follow that the suppression of any movement would produce by rebound the suppression of the sensation to which this movement habitually corresponds On this hypothesis a sensation which loses its motor effect becomes useless Be it so but this does not prove that the uselessness of a sensation is synonymous with insensibility I can very well imagine the movement being suppressed and the useless sensation continuing to evoke images and to be perceived Does not this occur daily There are patients who after an attack of paralysis remain paralysed in one limb which loses the voluntary movement but does not necessarily lose its sensibility Many clear cases are observed in which this dissociation takes place I therefore own that I cannot follow M Bergson in his deduction As a physiologist I am obliged to believe firmly in the existence of the sensory nerves and therefore I continue to suppose that our conscious sensations are consequent to the excitement of these nerves and subordinate to their integrity Now as therein lies unless I mistake the essential postulate the heart of M Bergson s theory by not admitting it I must regretfully reject the whole FOOTNOTES Footnote forty seven I borrow this quotation from RENOUVIER Le Personnellisme p two hundred sixty three Footnote forty eight Matiere et Memoire p three The author has returned to this point more at length in a communication to the Congres de Philosophie de Geneve in nineteen oh four See Revue de Metaphysique et de Morale Nov nineteen oh four communication from H BERGSON entitled Le Paralogisme psycho physiologique Here is a passage from this article which expresses the same idea To say that the image of the surrounding world issues from this image from the cerebral movement or that it expresses itself by this image or that it arises as soon as this image is suggested or that one gives it to one s self by giving one s self this image would be to contradict one s self since these two images the outer world and the intra cerebral movement have been supposed to be of the same nature and the second image is by the hypothesis an infinitesimal part of the field of representation while the first fills the whole of it Footnote forty nine Matiere et Memoire p thirty one CHAPTER V CONCLUSION A few convinced materialists and parallelists to whom I have read the above criticisms on their systems have found no answer to them my criticisms have appeared to them just but nevertheless they have continued to abide by their own systems probably because they were bound to have one We do not destroy an erroneous idea when we do not replace it by another This has decided me to set forth some personal views which provisionally and for want of better might be substituted for the old doctrines Before doing this I hasten to explain their character and to state openly that they are only hypotheses I know that metaphysicians rarely make avowals of this kind They present their systems as a well connected whole and they set forth its different parts even the boldest of them in the same dogmatic tone and without warning that we ought to attach very unequal degrees of confidence to these various parts This is a deplorable method and to it is perhaps due the kind of disdain that observers and experimentalists feel for metaphysics a disdain often without justification for all is not false and everything is not hypothetical in metaphysics There are in it demonstrations analyses and criticisms especially the last which appear to me as exact and as certain as an observation or experiment The mistake lies in mixing up together in a statement without distinction the certain with the probable and the probable with the possible Metaphysicians are not wholly responsible for this fault of method and I am much inclined to think that it is the natural consequence of the abuse of speculation It is especially by the cultivation of the sciences of observation that we foster in ourselves the precious sense of proof because we can check it any minute by experimental verification When we are working at a distance from the facts this sense of proof gets thinner and there is lost that feeling of responsibility and fear of seeing one s assertions contradicted by a decisive countervailing observation which is felt by every observer One acquires the unbearable pride which I note in Kant and one abandons one s self to the spirit of construction I am speaking from personal experience I have several times detected within me this bad spirit of construction I have been seeking to group several facts of observation under the same idea and then I have discovered that I was belittling and depreciating those facts which did not fit in with the idea The hypothesis I now present on the relations of the mind and the brain has for me the advantage of bringing to light the precise conditions which a solution of this great problem must satisfy for this solution to be worthy of discussion These conditions are very numerous I shall not indicate them all successively but here are two which are particularly important one The manifestations of the consciousness are conditioned by the brain Let us suspend by any means the activity of the encephalic mass by arresting the circulation of the blood for example and the psychic function is at once inhibited Compress the carotid and you obtain the clouding over of the intellect Or instead of a total abolition you can have one in detail sever a sensory nerve with the bistoury and all the sensations which that nerve transmits to the brain are suppressed Consciousness appears only when the molecular disturbance reaches the nerve centres everything takes place in the same way as if this disturbance released the consciousness Consciousness also accompanies or follows certain material states of the nerve centres such as the waves which traverse the sensory nerves which exercise reflex action in the cells and which propagate themselves in the motor nerves It is to the production the distribution and the integrity of this nervous influx that the consciousness is closely linked It there finds one of the conditions of its apparition two On the other hand the consciousness remains in complete ignorance of these intra cerebral phenomena It does not perceive the nerve wave which sets it in motion it knows nothing of its peculiarities of its trajectory or the length of its course In this sense it may be said that it is in no degree an anatomist it has no idea of all the peculiarities of the nerve wave which form part of its cerebral history from the moment when these peculiarities are out of relation with the properties of external objects One sometimes wonders that our consciousness is not aware that the objects we perceive with our two eyes correspond to a double undulation namely that of the right and that of the left and that the image is reversed on the retina so that it is the rods of the right which are impressed by objects on our left and the rods of the upper part by objects below our eyes These are it has been very justly said factitious problems imaginary difficulties which do not exist There is no need to explain for instance direct vision by a reversed image because our consciousness is not aware that the image on the retina is reversed In order to take account of this we should require another eye to see this image This answer appears particularly to the point It will be found that it is absolutely correct if we reflect that this case of the unfelt inversion of the image on the retina is but one example of the anatomical ignorance of the consciousness It might also be declared in the same order of ideas that our consciousness is ignorant that excitements of the eye cross each other at the level of the chiasma and pass through the internal capsule and that the majority of the visual excitements of an eye are received by the opposite hemisphere A rather confused notion of these facts has formed itself in the minds of several critics and I can discern the proof of this in the language they use It will be said for example that the idea exists in the consciousness or in the mind and phrases like the following will be avoided I think with my brain the suggestion consists in introducing an idea in the brain The nerve cell perceives and reasons c Ordinarily these forms of speech are criticised because they appear to have the defect of establishing a confusion between two irreducible elements the physical and the mental I think the error of language proceeds from another cause since I do not admit this distinction between the physical and the mental I think that the error consists in supposing vaguely that the consciousness comprehends intra cerebral phenomena whereas it ignores them Let me repeat that there is no such thing as intra cerebral sensibility The consciousness is absolutely insensitive with regard to the dispositions of the cerebral substance and its mode of work It is not the nervous undulation which our consciousness perceives but the exciting cause of this wave that is the external object The consciousness does not feel that which is quite close to it but is informed of that which passes much further off Nothing that is produced inside the cranium interests it it is solely occupied with objects of which the situation is extra cranial It does not penetrate into the brain we might say but spreads itself like a sheet over the periphery of the body and thence springs into the midst of the external objects There is therefore I do not say a contradiction but a very striking contrast between these two facts The consciousness is conditioned kept up and nourished by the working of the cerebral substance but knows nothing of what passes in the interior of that substance This consciousness might itself be compared to a parasitical organism which plunges its tap roots into the nerve centres and of which the organs of perception borne on long stalks emerge from the cranium and perceive everything outside that cranium But this is of course only a rough image Strictly it is possible to explain this distribution of the conscience singular as it is at first sight by those reasons of practical utility which are so powerful in the history of evolution A living being has to know the world external to himself in order to adapt and preadapt himself to it for it is in this outer world that he finds food shelter beings of his own species and the means of work and it is on this world of objects that he acts in every possible way by the contractions of his muscles But with regard to intracephalic actions they are outside the ordinary sphere of our actions There is no daily need to know them and we can understand that the consciousness has not found very pressing utilitarian motives for development in that direction One must be an histologist or a surgeon to find an appreciable interest in studying the structure of the nerve cell or the topography of the cerebral centres We can therefore explain well enough by the general laws of adaptation the reason of the absence of what might be called cerebral sensibility but here as elsewhere the question of the Why is much easier to solve than that of the How The question of the How consists in explaining that the consciousness directly aroused by a nerve wave does not perceive this undulation but in its stead the external object Let us first note that between the external object and the nervous influx there is the relation of cause to effect It is only the effect which reaches us our nerve cells and our consciousness What must be explained is how a cognition if such a word may be employed here of the effect can excite the consciousness of the cause It is clear that the effect does not resemble the cause as quality the orange I am looking at has no resemblance with the brain wave which at this moment is traversing my optic nerve but this effect contains everything which was in the cause or more exactly all that part of the cause of which we have perception Since it is only by the intermediary of our nervous system that we perceive the object all the properties capable of being perceived are communicated to our nervous system and inscribed in the nerve wave The effect produced therefore is the measure of our perception of the cause This is absolutely certain All bodies possess an infinity of properties which escape our cognitions because as excitants of our organism these properties are wanting in the intensity or the quality necessary to make it vibrate they have not been tuned in unison with our nervous chords And inversely all we perceive of the mechanical physical and chemical properties of a body is contained in the vibration this body succeeds in propagating through our cerebral atmosphere There is in this a phenomenon of transmission analogous to that which is produced when an air of music is sent along a wire the whole concert heard at the other extremity of the wire has travelled in the form of delicate vibrations There must therefore exist though unperceived by our senses a sort of kinship between the qualities of the external objects and the vibrations of our nerves This is sometimes forgotten The theory of the specific energy of the nerves causes it to be overlooked As we see that the quality of the sensation depends on the nerve that is excited one is inclined to minimise the importance of the excitant It is relegated to the position of a proximate cause with regard to the vibration of the nerve as the striking of a key on the piano is the proximate cause of the vibration of a string which always gives the same degree of sound whether struck by the forefinger or third finger or by a pencil or any other body It will be seen at once that this comparison is inexact The specific property of our nerves does not prevent our knowing the form of the excitant and our nerves are only comparable to piano strings if we grant to these the property of vibrating differently according to the nature of the bodies which strike them How is it that the nerve wave if it be the depository of the whole of the physical properties perceived in the object resembles it so little It is because this is my hypothesis these properties if they are in the undulation are not there alone The undulation is the work of two collaborators it expresses both the nature of the object which provokes it and that of the nervous apparatus which is its vehicle It is like the furrow traced in the wax of the phonograph which expresses the collaboration of an aerial vibration with a stylus a cylinder and a clock work movement This engraved line resembles in short neither the phonographic apparatus nor the aerial vibration although it results from the combination of the two Similarly I suppose that if the nervous vibration resembles so little the excitant which gives it birth it is because the factor nervous system adds its effect to the factor external object Each of these factors represents a different property the external object represents a cognition and the nervous system an excitement Let us imagine that we succeed in separating these two effects It will be conceived theoretically that a separation of this kind will lay bare the hidden resemblances giving to each collaborator the part which belongs to it The excitement for instance will be suppressed and the cognition will be retained Is it possible to make or at least to imagine such an analysis Perhaps for of these two competing activities one is variable since it depends on the constantly changing nature of the objects which come into relation with us the other on the contrary is a constant since it expresses the contribution of our nerve substance and though this last is of very unstable composition it necessarily varies much less than the series of excitants We consequently see faintly that these two elements differ sufficiently in character for us to be able to suppose that they are separable by analysis But how could this analysis be made Evidently not by chemical or physical means we have no need here of reagents prisms centrifugal apparatus permeable membranes or anything of that kind It will suffice to suppose that it is the consciousness itself that is the dialyser It acts by virtue of its own laws that is to say by changes in intensity Supposing that sensibility increases for the variable elements of the undulation and becomes insensible for the constant elements The effect will be the same as a material dissociation by chemical analysis there will be an elimination of certain elements and the retention of others Now all we know of the consciousness authorises us to entrust this role to it for it is within the range of its habits We know that change is the law of consciousness that it is effaced when the excitements are uniform and is renewed by their differences or their novelty A continued or too often repeated excitement ceases in time to be perceived It is to condense these facts into a formula that Bain speaks of the law of relativity of cognition and in spite of a few ambiguities on the part of Spencer and of Bain himself in the definition of this law fifty the formula with the sense I have just indicated is worth preserving Let us see what becomes of it when my hypothesis is adopted It explains how certain excitements proceeding from the objects that is to say forming part of the variable element cease to be perceived when they are repeated and tend to become constant A fortiori it seems to me should the same law explain how the constant element par excellence the one which never varies from the first hour is never perceived There is in the concert of the sounds of nature an accompaniment so monotonous that it is no longer perceived and the melody alone continues to be heard It is in this precisely that my hypothesis consists We will suppose a nerve current starting from one of the organs of the senses when it is excited by some object or other and arriving at the centre of the brain This current contains all the properties of the object its colour its form its size its thousand details of structure its weight its sonorous qualities c c properties combined with and connected by the properties of the nerve organ in which the current is propagated The consciousness remains insensible to those nervous properties of the current which are so often repeated that they are annulled it perceives on the contrary its variable and accidental properties which express the nature of the excitant By this partial sensibility the consciousness lays bare that which in the nerve current represents the object that is to say a cognition and this operation is equivalent to a transformation of the current into a perception image or idea There is not strictly speaking a transformation but an analysis only the practical result is the same as that of a transformation and is obtained without its being necessary to suppose the transmutation of a physical into a mental phenomenon Let us place ourselves now at the moment when the analysis I am supposing to be possible has just been effected Our consciousness then assists at the unrolling of representations which correspond to the outer world These representations are not or do not appear to be lodged in the brain and it is not necessary to suppose a special operation which taking them in the brain should project them to the periphery of our nerves This transport would be useless since for the consciousness the brain does not exist the brain with its fibres and cells is not felt it therefore supplies no datum to enable us to judge whether the representation is external or internal with regard to it In other words the representation is only localised in relation to itself there is no determinate position other than that of one representation in relation to another We may therefore reject as inexact the pretended law of eccentricity of the physiologists who suppose that sensation is first perceived as it were centrally and then by an added act is localised at the peripheric extremity of the nerve This argument would only be correct if we admitted that the brain is perceived by the consciousness of the brain I have already said that the consciousness is not an anatomist and that therefore this problem does not present itself Such as it is this hypothesis appears to me to present the advantage of explaining the reason why our consciousness coincides in certain circumstances with the actions of the brain and in others does not come near them In other words it contains an explanation of the unconscious I can show this by quoting certain exact facts of which the explanation has been hitherto thought to present difficulties but which become very easy to understand on the present hypothesis The first of these facts relates to the psychology of the motor current This current has been a great feature in the studies which have been made on the feeling of effort and on the physical basis of the will The motor current is that which starting from the cerebral cells of the motor region travels by way of the fibres of the pyramidal tract into the muscles of the body and it is centrifugal in direction Researches have been made as to whether we are or may be conscious of this current or rather the question has been put in somewhat different terms It has been asked whether a psychological state can be the counterpart of this motor current if for example the feeling of mental effort produced in us at the moment of executing a difficult act or of taking a grave resolution might not have this motor current for a basis The opinion which has prevailed is in the negative We have recognised a good deal on the faith of experiment and a little also for theoretical reasons that no sensation is awakened by the centrifugal current As to the sensation of effort it has been agreed to place it elsewhere We put it among the centripetal sensations which are produced as the movement outlines itself and which proceed from the contracted muscles the stretched ligaments and the frictional movements of the articulations Effort would therefore form part of all the psychical phenomenology which is the duplicate of those sensory currents which are centripetal in direction In the long run I can see no sort of theoretical reason for subordinating the consciousness to the direction of the nerve current and for supposing that the consciousness is aroused when this current is centripetal and that it cannot follow the centrifugal current But this point matters little My hypothesis would fairly well explain why the motor current remains unconscious it explains the affair by taking into consideration the nature of this current and not its direction This current is a motor one because it is born in the central cells because it is a discharge from these cells and is of entirely nervous origin Since it does not correspond with the perception of an object the ever varying object it is always the same by nature It does not carry with it in its monotonous course the debris of an object as does the sensory current Thus it can flow without consciousness This same kind of hypothesis supplies us with the reasons why a given sensory current may be according to circumstances either conscious or unconscious The consciousness resulting from the analysis of the molecular wave is as it were a supplementary work which may be subsequently added to the realised wave The propagation of the wave is the essential fact there is always time to become conscious of it afterwards It is thus that we happen in moments of abstraction to remain insensible to certain even very powerful excitements Our nervous system registers them nevertheless and we can find them again later on within the memory This is the effect of a belated analysis The converse phenomenon occurs much more frequently We remark many actions and perceptions which occur the first time with consciousness emotion and effort Then when they are repeated as coordination becomes stronger and easier the reflex consciousness of the operation becomes feebler This is the law of habit which slowly carries us towards automatism These observations have even been extended and the endeavour made to apply them to the explanation of the origin of reflex actions and of instincts which have all started with consciousness This is a rather bold attempt for it meets with many serious difficulties in execution but the idea seems fairly correct and is acceptable if we may limit it It is certain that the consciousness accompanies the effort towards the untried and perishes as soon as it is realised Whence comes this singular dilemma propounded to it by nature to create something new or perish It really seems that my hypothesis explains this Every new act is produced by nerve currents which contain many of those variable elements which the consciousness perceives but in proportion as the action of the brain repeats itself and becomes more precise and more exact this variable element becomes attenuated falls to its lowest pitch and may even disappear in the fixation of habit and instinct My hypothesis much resembles the system of parallelism It perfects it as it seems to me as much as the latter has perfected materialism We indeed admit a kind of parallelism between the consciousness and the object of cognition but these two series are not independent not simply placed in juxtaposition as is possible in ordinary parallelism they are united and fused together so as to complete each other This new theory appears to me to represent a better form of the series of attempts which have been inspired by the common necessity of making the phenomena of consciousness accord with the determinism of physical facts I hold fast to this physical determinism and accept a strictly mechanical conception of the functions of the nervous system In my idea the currents which pass through the cerebral mass follow each other without interruption from the sensorial periphery to the motor periphery it is they and they alone which excite the movements of the body by acting on the muscles Parallelism recognises all these things and I do likewise Let us now see the advantages of this new system First it contains no paralogism no logical or psychological error since it does not advance the supposition that the mental differs by its nature from the physical phenomenon We have discussed above the consequences of this error They are here avoided In the second place it is explanatory at least in a certain measure since the formula we employ allows us to understand better than by the principle of a simple juxtaposition why certain nerve currents flow in the light of consciousness while others are plunged into the darkness of unconsciousness This law of consciousness which Bain called the law of relativity becomes when embodied with my theory of the relations of the physical to the moral an explanation of the distribution of consciousness through the actions of the brain I ask myself whether the explanation I have devised ought to be literally preserved Perhaps not I have endeavoured less to present a ready made solution than to indicate the direction in which we ought to look for one The law of consciousness which I have used to explain the transformation of a nerve current into perception and images is only an empirical law produced by the generalisation of particular observations Until now there has been so far as I know no attempt to ascertain whether this law of consciousness notwithstanding the general nature which some authors incline to ascribe to it might not explain itself by some more general facts and might not fit as a particular case into a more comprehensive frame To be brief this is very possible I have not troubled myself about it and I have made a transcendental use of this empirical law for I have impliedly supposed it to be a first principle capable of accounting for the development of the consciousness but itself incapable of explanation If other observers discover that that which to me has appeared inexplicable may be explained by quite peculiar causes it is clear that my theory must be abandoned or modified New theories must then be sought for which will probably consist in recognising different properties in the consciousness A little thought will discover several I have no doubt By way of suggestion I will indicate one of these hypothetical possibilities The consciousness has the faculty of reading in the effect that which existed in the cause It is not rash to believe that by working out this idea a certain solution would be discovered Moreover the essential is I repeat less to find a solution than to take account of the point which requires one and metaphysics seem to me especially useful when it shows us where the gap in our knowledge exists and what are the conditions required to fill this gap Above all I adhere to this idea which has been one of the guiding forces of this book there exists at the bottom of all the phenomena of the intelligence a duality To form a true phenomenon there must be at once a consciousness and an object According to passing tendencies either of temperament or of fashion preponderance has been given sometimes to one of the terms of this couple sometimes to the other The idealist declares Thought creates the world The materialist answers The matter of the brain creates thought Between these two extreme opinions the one as unjustifiable as the other in the excesses they commit we take up an intermediate position Looking at the balance we see no argument capable of being placed in the scale of the consciousness which may not be neutralised by an argument placed in the scale of the object and if we had to give our final verdict we should say The consciousness and matter have equal rights thus leaving to every one the power to place in this conception of an equality of rights the hopes of survival of which his heart has need FOOTNOTES Footnote fifty The equivoque perpetrated by BAIN and SPENCER consists in supposing that the consciousness bears solely on differences This is going too far I confine myself to admitting that if sensation is not changed from time to time the consciousness becomes weaker and disappears CHAPTER VI RECAPITULATION I ask permission to reproduce here a communication made by me in December nineteen oh four to the Societe Francaise de Philosophie I there set forth briefly the ideas which I have just developed in this book This succinct expose may be useful as a recapitulation of the argument Description of Matter The physicists who are seeking for a conception of the Inmost structure of matter in order to explain the very numerous phenomena they perceive fancy they can connect them with other phenomena less numerous but of the same order They thus consider matter in itself We psychologists add to matter something more viz the observer We consider matter and define it by its relations to our modes of knowledge that is to say by bearing in mind that it is conditioned by our external perception These are two different points of view In developing our own standpoint we note that of the outer world we are acquainted with nothing but our sensations if we propound this limit it is because many observations and experiments show that between the external object and ourselves there is but one intermediary the nervous system and that we only perceive the modifications which the external object acting as an excitant provokes in this system Let us provisionally apply to these modifications the term sensations without settling the question of their physical or mental nature Other experiments again prove to us that our sensations are not necessarily similar to the objects which excite them for the quality of each sensation depends on what is called the specific energy of the nerve excited Thus whether the optic nerve be appealed to by a ray of light an electric current or a mechanical shock it always gives the same answer and this answer is the sensation of light It follows that our nervous system itself is only known to us as regards its structure by the intermediary of sensations and we are not otherwise more informed upon its nature than upon that of any other object whatever In the second place a much more serious consequence is that all our sensations being equally false so far as they are copies of the excitants which provoke them one has no right to use any of these sensations to represent to ourselves the inmost structure of matter The theories to which many physicists still cling which consist in explaining all the modalities of matter by different combinations of movement start from false premises Their error consists in explaining the whole body of our sensations by certain particular sensations of the eye of the touch and of the muscular sense in which analysis discovers the elements and the source of the representation of motion Now these particular sensations have no more objective value than those of the tongue of the nose and of the ear in so far as they are related to the external excitant of which it is sought to penetrate the inmost nature one of them is as radically false as the other It is true that a certain number of persons will think to escape from our conclusion because they do not accept our starting point There exist in fact several systems which propound that the outer world is known to us directly without the intermediary of a tertium quid that is of sensation In the first place the spiritists are convinced that disembodied souls can remain spectators of terrestrial life and consequently can perceive it without the interposition of organs On the other hand some German authors have recently maintained by rather curious reasoning that the specific energy of our nervous system does not transform the excitants and that our sensations are the faithful copies of that which causes them Finally various philosophers Reid Hamilton and in our own days the deep and subtle mind of M Bergson have proposed to admit that by direct comprehension we have cognisance of the objects without mystery and as they are Let this be admitted It will change nothing in our conclusions and for the following reasons We have said that no kind of our sensations neither the visual the tactile nor the muscular permits us to represent to ourselves the inmost structure of matter because all sensations without exception are false as copies of material objects We are now assured that we are mistaken and that our sensations are all true that is to say are faithful copies of the objects If all are true it comes to the same thing as if all are false If all are true it is impossible to make any choice among them to retain only the sensations of sight and touch and to use them in the construction of a mechanical theory to the exclusion of the others For it is impossible for us to explain some by the others If all are equally true they all have the same right to represent the structure of matter and as they are irreconcilable no theory can be formed from their synthesis Let us consequently conclude this whatever hypothesis may be built up on the relations possibly existing between matter and our sensations we are forbidden to make a theory of matter in the terms of our sensations That is what I think of matter understood as the inmost structure of bodies of unknowable and metaphysical matter I shall not speak of it again and henceforth when I use the word matter it will be in quite a different acceptation it will be empirical and physical matter such as it appears to us in our sensations It must therefore be understood that from this moment we change our ground We leave the world of noumena and enter that of phenomena Definition of Mind Generally to define the mind we oppose the concept of mind to the concept of matter with the result that we get extremely vague images in our thoughts It is preferable to replace the concepts by facts and to proceed to an inventory of all mental phenomena Now in the course of this inventory we perceive that we have continually to do with two orders of elements which are united in reality but which our thought may consider as isolated One of these elements is represented by those states which we designate by the name of sensations images emotions c the other element is the consciousness of these sensations the cognition of these images the fact of experiencing these emotions It is in other words a special activity of which these states are the object and as it were the point of application an activity which consists in perceiving judging comparing understanding and willing To make our inventory orderly let us deal with these two elements separately and begin with the first We will first examine sensation let us put aside that which is the fact of feeling and retain that which is felt Thus defined and slightly condensed what is sensation Until now we have employed the word in the very vague sense of a tertium quid interposed between the object and ourselves Now we have to be more precise and to inquire whether sensation is a physical or a mental thing I need not tell you that on this point every possible opinion has been held My own opinion is that sensation should be considered as a physical phenomenon sensation be it understood in the sense of impression felt and not in that of capacity to feel Here are the arguments I invoke for the support of my thesis in the first place popular opinion which identifies matter with what we see and with what we touch that is to say with sensation This popular opinion represents a primitive attitude a family possession which we have the right to retain so long as it is not proved to us to be false next this remark that by its mode of apparition at once unexpected the revealer of new cognitions and independent of our will as well as by its content sensation sums up for us all we understand by matter physical state outer world Colour form extent position in space are known to us as sensations only Sensation is not a means of knowing these properties of matter it is these properties themselves What objections can be raised against my conclusion One has evidently the right to apply the term psychological to the whole sensation taken en bloc and comprising in itself both impression and consciousness The result of this terminology will be that as we know nothing except sensations the physical will remain unknowable and the distinction between the physical and the mental will vanish But it will eventually be re established under other names by utilising the distinction I have made between objects of cognition and acts of cognition a distinction which is not verbal and results from observation What is not permissible is to declare that sensation is a psychological phenomenon and to oppose this phenomenon to physical reality as if this latter could be known to us by any other method than sensation If the opinion I uphold be accepted if we agree to see in sensation understood in a certain way a physical state it will be easy to extend this interpretation to a whole series of different phenomena To the images first which proceed from sensations since they are recurring sensations to the emotions also which according to recent theories result from the perception of the movements which are produced in the heart the vessels and the muscles and finally to effort whether of will or of attention which is constituted by the muscular sensations perceived and consequently also results from corporeal states The consequences must be clearly remarked To admit that sensation is a physical state is to admit by that very fact that the image idea emotion and effort all those manifestations generally ascribed to the mind alone are also physical states What then is the mind And what share remains to it in all these phenomena from which it seems we are endeavouring to oust it The mind is in that special activity which is engaged in sensation image idea emotion and effort For a sensation to be produced there must be as I said a little time ago two elements the something felt a tree a house an animal a titillation an odour and also the fact of feeling this something the consciousness of it the judgment passed on it the reasoning applied to it in other terms the categories which comprehend it From this point of view the dualism contained in sensation is clearly expressed Sensation as a thing felt that is the physical part or matter sensation as the fact of feeling or of judging that is the mind Mark the language I use We say that matter is the something felt but we do not say for the sake of symmetry that the mind is the something which feels I have used a more cautious and I think a more just formula which places the mind in the fact of feeling Let me repeat again at the risk of appearing too subtle the mind is the act of consciousness it is not a subject which has consciousness For a subject let it be noted a subject which feels is an object of cognition it forms part of the other group of elements the group of sensations In practice we represent by mind a fragment of our own biography and by dint of pains we attribute to this fragment the faculty of having a consciousness we make it the subject of the relation subject object But this fragment being constituted of memories and sensations does not exactly represent the mind and does not correspond to our definition it would rather represent the mind sensationalised or materialised From this follows the curious consequence that the mind is endowed with an incomplete existence it is like form which can only be realised by its application to matter of some kind One may fancy a sensation continuing to exist to live and to provoke movements even after ceasing to be perceived Those who are not uncompromising idealists readily admit this independence of the objects with regard to our consciousness but the converse is not true It is impossible to understand a consciousness existing without an object a perception without a sensation to be perceived an attention without a point of application an empty wish which should have nothing to wish for in a word a spiritual activity acting without matter on which to act or more briefly still mind without matter Mind and matter are correlative terms and on this point I firmly believe that Aristotle was much closer to the truth than many modern thinkers I have convinced myself that the definition of mind at which we have just arrived is in its exactness and soberness the only one which permits psychology to be distinguished from the sciences nearest to it You know that it has been discovered in our days that there exists a great difficulty in effecting this delimitation The definitions of psychology hitherto proposed nearly all have the defect of not agreeing with the one thing defined Time fails us to review them all but I shall point out one at least because our discussion on this particular formula will serve as a preparation for taking in hand the last question that remains to be examined the relation of the mind to the body According to the definition I am aiming at psychology would be the science of internal facts while the other sciences deal with the external Psychology it has also been said has as its instrument introspection while the natural sciences work with the eye the touch the ear that is to say with the senses of extrospection To this distinction I reply that in all sciences there exist but two things sensations and the consciousness which accompanies them A sensation may belong to the inner or the outer world through accidental reasons without any change in its nature the sensation of the outer world is the social sensation which we share with our fellows If the excitant which provokes it is included in our nervous system it is the sensation which becomes individual hidden to all except ourselves and constituting a microcosm by the side of a macrocosm What importance can this have since all the difference depends on the position occupied by the excitant But we are persistently told there are in reality two ways of arriving at the cognition of objects from within and from without These two ways are as opposite as the right and wrong side of a stuff It is in this sense that psychology is the science of the within and looks at the wrong side while the natural sciences reckon weigh and measure the right side And this is so true they add that the same phenomenon absolutely appears under two forms radically different from each other according as they are looked at from one or the other of the two points of view Every one of our thoughts they point out to us is in correlation with a particular state of our cerebral matter our thought is the subjective and mental face the corresponding cerebral process is the objective and material face Though this dualism is frequently presented as an observed truth I think it is possible to show its error Take an example I look at the plain before me and see a flock of sheep pass through it At the same time an observer armed with a microscope a la Jules Verne looks into my brain and observes there a certain molecular dance which accompanies my visual perception Thus on the one hand is my representation on the other a dynamic state of the nerve cells This is what constitutes the right and the wrong sides of the stuff We are told See how little resemblance there is in this a representation is a psychical and a movement of molecules a material thing But I on the contrary think there is a great resemblance When I see the flock passing I have a visual perception The observer who by the hypothesis is at that moment looking into my brain also experiences a visual perception Granted they are not the same perception How could they be the same I am looking at the sheep he is looking at the interior of my brain it is not astonishing that looking at objects so different we should receive images also very different But notwithstanding their difference of object that is of content there are here two visual perceptions composed in the same way and I do not see by what right it can be said that one represents a material the other a physical phenomenon In reality each of these perceptions has a two fold and psycho physical value physical in regard to the object to which it applies and psychical inasmuch as it is an act of perception that is to say of consciousness For one is just as much psychical as the other and as much material for a flock of sheep is as material a thing as is my brain If we keep this conclusion in our minds when we come to make a critical examination of certain philosophical systems we shall easily see the mistake they make Spiritualism fifty one rests on the conception that the mind can subsist and work in total independence of any tie to matter It is true that in details spiritualists make some modification in this absolute principle in order to explain the perceptions of the senses and the execution of the orders of the will but the duality the independence and the autonomy of the soul and the body remain in any case the peculiar dogma of the system This dogma appears to me utterly false the mind cannot exist without matter to which it is applied and to the principle of heterogeneity so often invoked to forbid all commerce between the two substances I reply by appealing to intuition which shows us the consciousness and its different forms comparison judgment and reasoning so closely connected with sensation that they cannot be imagined as existing with an isolated life Materialism we know argues quite differently it imagines that a particular state of the nerve centres has the virtue of generating a psychical phenomenon which represents according to various metaphors property function effect and even secretion Critics have often asked how with matter in motion a phenomenon of thought could be explained or fabricated It is very probable that those who admit this material genesis of thought represent it to themselves under the form of something subtle like an electric spark a puff of wind a will of the wisp or an alcoholic flame Materialists are not alone responsible for these inadequate metaphors which proceed from a metaphysics constructed of concepts Let us recollect exactly what a psychical phenomenon is Let us banish the will o the wisps replace them by a precise instance and return to the visual perception we took as an example a little while back without intending a pun revenons a nos moutons These sheep which I see in the plain are as material as real as the cerebral movement which accompanies my perception How then is it possible that this cerebral movement a primary material fact should engender this secondary material fact this collection of complicated beings which form a flock Before going any further let us invite another philosophical system to take a place within the circle of our discussion for the same answer will suffice for it as well as for the preceding one and it will be as well to deal with both at once This new system parallelism in great favour at the present day appears to me to be a materialism perfected especially in the direction of caution To escape the mystery of the genesis of the mind from matter this new system places them parallel to each other and side by side we might almost say experimentally so much do parallelists try to avoid talking metaphysics But their position is untenable and they likewise are the victims of the mirage of concepts for they consider the mental as capable of being parallel to the physical without mingling with it and of subsisting by itself and with a life of its own Such a hypothesis is only possible by reason of the insufficient definition given to the mind If it be recognised that the mind has an incomplete existence and is only realised by its incarnation in matter the figure which is the basis of parallelism becomes indefensible There is no longer on the one hand the physical and on the other the mental but on one side the physical and the mental combined and on the other the same combination which amounts to saying that the two faces to a reality which it was thought had been made out to be so distinct are identical There are not two faces but one face and the monism which certain metaphysicians struggle to arrive at by a mysterious reconciliation of the phenomenal duality within the unity of the noumenon need not be sought so far afield since we already discover it in the phenomenon itself The criticisms I have just pointed out to you only too briefly are to be found in several philosophers confusedly in Berkeley and with more precision in M Bergson s book on Matiere et Memoire The latter author remarking that our brain and the outer world are to us images of the same order refuses to admit that the brain which is only a very small part of these images can explain and contain the other and much larger part which comprises the vast universe This would amount to saying that the whole is comprised in the part I believe that this objection is analogous to the one just stated with less ingenuity It is interesting to see how M Bergson gets out of the difficulty which he himself raised Being unwilling to bring forth from the molecular movement of the brain the representation of the world or to superpose the representation on this movement as in the parallelist hypothesis he has arrived at a theory very ingenious but rather obscure which consists in placing the image of the world outside the brain this latter being reduced to a motor organ which executes the orders of the mind We thus have four philosophical theories which while trying to reconcile mind with matter give to the representation a different position in regard to cerebral action The spiritualist asserts the complete independence of the representation in relation to cerebral movement the materialist places it after the parallelist by the side of the cerebral movement M Bergson puts it in front I must confess that the last of these systems that of M Bergson presents many difficulties As he does not localise the mind in the body he is obliged to place our perception that is to say a part of ourselves in the objects perceived for example in the stars when we are looking at them The memory is lodged in distant planes of consciousness which are not otherwise defined We understand with difficulty these emigrations these crumblings into morsels of our mind This would not matter if our author did not go so far as to maintain that the sensory nerves of the brain are not sensory nerves and that the severance of them does not suppress sensations but simply the motor efforts of these sensations All the physiologist in me protests against the rashness of these interpretations The principal difficulties of the problem of the union between the mind and the body proceed from the two following facts which seem incompatible On the one hand our thought is conditioned by a certain intra cerebral movement of molecules and atoms and on the other hand this same thought has no consciousness of this molecular movement It does not know the path of the wave in our nerves it does not suspect for example that the image of the objects is reversed in the retina or that the excitements of the right eye for the most part go into the left hemisphere In a word it is no anatomist It is a very curious thing that our consciousness enters into relation only with the extra cerebral the external objects and the superficies of our bodies From this this exact question suggests itself a molecular wave must come as far as our visual cerebral centre for us to have the perception of the object before our eyes how is it that our consciousness is unaware of this physiological event from which it depends and is borne towards the distant object as if it sprang forth outside our nervous system Let us first remark that if we do not perceive this wave yet it must contain all we know of the external object for it is evident that we only know of it that part of its properties which it transmits to our nerves and our nerve centres All the known substance of the external object is then implied in this vibration it is there but it is not there by itself The vibration is the work of two collaborators it expresses at once the nature of the object which provokes it and the nature of the nerve apparatus which transports it as the furrow traced in the wax of the phonograph implies the joint action of an aerial vibration with a stylus a cylinder and a clock work apparatus I therefore suppose and this is I say it plainly but an hypothesis that if the nervous vibration so little resembles the external excitant which generates it it is because the factor nervous system superadds its effect to the factor excitant Let us imagine now that we have managed to separate these two effects and we shall understand that then the nervous event so analysed might resemble only the object or only the nervous system Now of these two effects one is constant that one which represents the action of the nervous system there is another which varies with each new perception and even with every moment of the same perception that is to say the object It is not impossible to understand that the consciousness remains deaf to the constant and sensitive to the variable element There is a law of consciousness which has often been described and fresh applications of which are met with daily this is that the consciousness only maintains itself by change whether this change results from the exterior by impressions received or is produced from the interior by movements of the attention Let us here apply this empirical law and admit that it contains a first principle It will then be possible for us to understand that the consciousness formed into a dialyser of the undulation may reject that constant element which expresses the contribution of the nervous system and may lay bare the variable element which corresponds to the object so that an intestinal movement of the cerebral substance brought to light by this analytical consciousness may become the perception of an object By accepting this hypothesis we restore to the sensory nerves and to the encephalic centres their property of being the substrata of representation and avoid the objection made above against materialism and parallelism that they did not explain how a cerebral movement which is material can engender the perception of an object which differs greatly from it and is yet as material as the movement itself There is not here properly speaking either generation transformation or metamorphosis The object to be perceived is contained in the nerve current It is as it were rolled up in it and it must be made to go forth from the wave to be seen This last is the work of the consciousness FOOTNOTES Footnote
