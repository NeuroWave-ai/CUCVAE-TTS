none	none	 THE PLAY BOX 
1752_16632_000015_000000	train-clean-360	At the sound of footsteps along the hall Miss Terry looked up from the letter which she was reading for the sixth time 
1752_16632_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Of course I would not see him she said pursing her lips into a hard line 
1752_16632_000015_000002	train-clean-360	 Certainly not 
1752_16632_000016_000000	train-clean-360	A bump on the library door as from an opposing knee did duty for a knock 
none	none	Bring the box in here Norah said Miss Terry holding open the door for her servant who was gasping under the weight of a packing case
1752_16632_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Set it down on the rug by the fire place 
1752_16632_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I am going to look it over and burn up the rubbish this evening 
1752_16632_000018_000000	train-clean-360	She glanced once more at the letter in her hand then with a sniff tossed it upon the fire 
1752_16632_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes m said Norah as she set down the box with a thump 
1752_16632_000019_000001	train-clean-360	She stooped once more to pick up something which had fallen out when the cover was jarred open 
none	none	It was a pink papier mache angel such as are often hung from the top of Christmas trees as a crowning symbol 
1752_16632_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Norah stood holding it between thumb and finger staring amazedly 
1752_16632_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Who would think to find such a bit of frivolity in the house of Miss Terry 
1752_16632_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Her mistress looked up from the fire where the bit of writing was writhing painfully and caught the expression of Norah s face 
1752_16632_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 What have you there she asked frowning as she took the object into her own hands 
1752_16632_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 The Christmas Angel she exclaimed under her breath 
1752_16632_000021_000002	train-clean-360	 I had quite forgotten it Then as if it burned her fingers she thrust the little image back into the box and turned to Norah brusquely 
1752_16632_000021_000003	train-clean-360	 There that s all You can go now Norah she said 
1752_16632_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes m answered the maid 
1752_16632_000022_000001	train-clean-360	She hesitated 
1752_16632_000022_000002	train-clean-360	 If you please m it s Christmas Eve 
1752_16632_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I believe so snapped Miss Terry who seemed to be in a particularly bad humor this evening 
1752_16632_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 What do you want 
1752_16632_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Norah flushed but she was hardened to her mistress s manner 
1752_16632_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Only to ask if I may go out for a little while to see the decorations and hear the singing 
1752_16632_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 decorations 
none	none	and hear the 
1752_16632_000025_000001	train-clean-360	singing 
none	none	Decorations Singing 
1752_16632_000088_000003	train-clean-360	Fiddlestick 
1752_16632_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Fiddlestick retorted Miss Terry poker in hand What decorations 
1752_16632_000025_000003	train-clean-360	What singing 
1752_16632_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Why all the windows along the street are full of candles answered Norah rows of candles in every house to light the Christ Child on his way when he comes through the city to night 
1752_16632_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Fiddlestick again snarled her mistress 
1752_16632_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And choir boys are going about the streets they say singing carols in front of the lighted houses continued Norah enthusiastically 
1752_16632_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 It must sound so pretty 
1752_16632_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 They had much better be at home in bed 
1752_16632_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I believe people are losing their minds 
1752_16632_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Please m may I go asked Norah again 
none	none	Norah had no puritanic traditions to her account 
1752_16632_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Moreover she was young and warm and enthusiastic 
none	none	Sometimes the spell of Miss Terry s sombre house threatened her to the point of desperation 
1752_16632_000031_000003	train-clean-360	It was so this Christmas Eve but she made her request with apparent calmness 
1752_16632_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes go along assented her mistress ungraciously 
1752_16632_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you m said the servant demurely but with a brightening of her blue eyes 
1752_16632_000033_000001	train-clean-360	And presently the area door banged behind her quick retreating footsteps 
none	none	H m 
1752_16632_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Didn t take her long to get ready muttered Miss Terry giving the fire a vicious poke 
none	none	She was alone in the house on Christmas Eve and not a man woman or child in the world cared 
1752_16632_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Well it was what she wanted 
1752_16632_000034_000004	train-clean-360	It was of her own doing 
1752_16632_000034_000005	train-clean-360	If she had wished 
none	none	She sat back in her chair with thin long hands lying along the arms of it gazing into the fire 
1752_16632_000035_000001	train-clean-360	A bit of paper there was crumbling into ashes Alone on Christmas Eve 
none	none	Even Norah had some relation with the world outside 
1752_16632_000035_000003	train-clean-360	Was there not a stalwart officer waiting for her on the nearest corner 
1752_16632_000035_000004	train-clean-360	Even Norah could feel a simple childish pleasure in candles and carols and merriment and the old old superstition 
1752_16632_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Stuff and nonsense mused Miss Terry scornfully 
1752_16632_000042_000005	train-clean-360	nonsense 
none	none	mused Miss Terry scornfully
1752_16632_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 What is our Christmas anyway 
1752_16632_000036_000002	train-clean-360	A time for shopkeepers to sell and for foolish folks to kill themselves in buying 
1752_16632_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Christmas spirit 
none	none	No 
1752_16632_000036_000005	train-clean-360	It is all humbug all selfishness and worry an unwholesome season of unnatural activities 
1752_16632_000036_000006	train-clean-360	I am glad I am out of it 
1752_16632_000036_000007	train-clean-360	I am glad no one expects anything of me nor I of any one 
1752_16632_000036_000008	train-clean-360	I am quite independent blessedly independent of the whole foolish business 
1752_16632_000036_000009	train-clean-360	It is a good time to begin clearing up for the new year 
1752_16632_000036_000010	train-clean-360	I m glad I thought of it 
1752_16632_000036_000011	train-clean-360	I ve long threatened to get rid of the stuff that has been accumulating in that corner of the attic 
1752_16632_000036_000012	train-clean-360	Now I will begin 
1752_16632_000037_000000	train-clean-360	She tugged the packing case an inch nearer the fire 
1752_16632_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It was like Miss Terry to insist upon that nearer inch 
1752_16632_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Then she raised the cover 
1752_16632_000037_000003	train-clean-360	It was a box full of children s battered toys old fashioned and quaint the toys in vogue thirty forty fifty years earlier when Miss Terry was a child 
1752_16632_000037_000004	train-clean-360	She gave a reminiscent sniff as she threw up the cover and saw on the under side of it a big label of pasteboard unevenly lettered 
none	none	Illustration PLAY BOX OF TOM TERRY AND ANGELINA TERRY scrawl 
1752_16632_000096_000006	train-clean-360	Humph 
none	none	she snorted 
1752_16632_000039_000001	train-clean-360	There was a great deal in that humph It meant Yes Tom s name had plenty of room while poor little Angelina had to squeeze in as well as she could 
1752_16632_000039_000002	train-clean-360	How like Tom 
1752_16632_000039_000003	train-clean-360	This accounted for everything even to his not being in his sister s house this very night How unreasonable he had been 
1752_16632_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Terry shrugged impatiently 
1752_16632_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Why think of Tom to night 
1752_16632_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Years ago he had deliberately cut himself adrift from her interests 
1752_16632_000040_000003	train-clean-360	No need to think of him now 
1752_16632_000040_000004	train-clean-360	It was too late to appease her 
1752_16632_000040_000005	train-clean-360	But here were all these toys to be got rid of 
1752_16632_000040_000006	train-clean-360	The fire was hungry for them 
1752_16632_000040_000007	train-clean-360	Why not begin 
1752_16632_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Terry stooped to poke over the contents of the box with lean long fingers 
1752_16632_000041_000001	train-clean-360	In one corner thrust up a doll s arm in another an animal s tail pointed heavenward 
1752_16632_000041_000002	train-clean-360	She caught glimpses of glitter and tinsel wheels and fragments of unidentifiable toys 
1752_16632_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 What rubbish she said 
1752_16632_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes I ll burn them all 
1752_16632_000042_000002	train-clean-360	They are good for nothing else 
1752_16632_000042_000003	train-clean-360	I suppose some folks would try to give them away and bore a lot of people to death 
none	none	They seem to think they are saving something that way Nonsense 
1752_16632_000042_000006	train-clean-360	I know better 
1752_16632_000042_000007	train-clean-360	It is all foolishness this craze for giving Most things are better destroyed as soon as you are done with them 
1752_16632_000042_000008	train-clean-360	Why nobody wants such truck as this 
1752_16632_000042_000009	train-clean-360	Now could any child ever have cared for so silly a thing She pulled out a faded jumping jack and regarded it scornfully 
1752_16632_000042_000010	train-clean-360	 Idiotic 
1752_16632_000042_000011	train-clean-360	Such toys are demoralizing for children weaken their minds 
1752_16632_000042_000012	train-clean-360	It is a shame to think how every one seems bound to spoil children especially at Christmas time 
1752_16632_000042_000013	train-clean-360	Well no one can say that I have added to the shameful waste 
1752_16632_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Terry tossed the poor jumping jack on the fire and eyed his last contortions with grim satisfaction 
1752_16632_000044_000000	train-clean-360	But as she watched a quaint idea came to her 
1752_16632_000044_000001	train-clean-360	She was famous for eccentric ideas 
1752_16632_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I will try an experiment she said 
1752_16632_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 I will prove once for all my point about the Christmas spirit I will drop some of these old toys out on the sidewalk and see what happens 
1752_16632_000045_000002	train-clean-360	It may be interesting 
1752_16632_000046_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER II
none	none	 JACK IN THE BOX 
1752_16632_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Terry rose and crossed two rooms to the front window looking out upon the street 
1752_16632_000048_000001	train-clean-360	A flare of light almost blinded her eyes 
1752_16632_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Every window opposite her along the block as far as she could see was illuminated with a row of lighted candles across the sash 
1752_16632_000048_000003	train-clean-360	The soft unusual glow threw into relief the pretty curtains and wreaths of green and gave glimpses of cosy interiors and flitting happy figures 
1752_16632_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 What a waste of candles scolded Miss Terry 
1752_16632_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 Folks are growing terribly extravagant 
1752_16632_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The street was white with snow which had fallen a few hours earlier piled in drifts along the curb of the little traveled terrace 
1752_16632_000050_000001	train-clean-360	But the sidewalks were neatly shoveled and swept clean as became the eminently respectable part of the city where Miss Terry lived 
1752_16632_000050_000002	train-clean-360	A long flight of steps with iron railing at the side led down from the front door upon which a silver plate had for generations in decorous flourishes announced the name of Terry 
1752_16632_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Terry returned to the play box and drew out between thumb and finger the topmost toy 
1752_16632_000051_000001	train-clean-360	It happened to be a wooden box with a wire hasp for fastening the cover 
1752_16632_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Half unconsciously she pressed the spring and a hideous Jack in the box sprang out to confront her with a squeak a leering smile and a red nose 
1752_16632_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Miss Terry eyed him with disfavor 
1752_16632_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I always did hate that thing she said 
1752_16632_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 Tom was continually frightening me with it I remember As if to be rid of unwelcome memories she shut her mouth tight even as she shut Jack back into his box snapping the spring into place 
1752_16632_000052_000002	train-clean-360	 This will do to begin with she thought 
1752_16632_000052_000003	train-clean-360	She crossed to the window which she opened quickly and tossed out the box so that it fell squarely in the middle of the sidewalk 
1752_16632_000052_000004	train-clean-360	Then closing the window and turning down the lights in the room behind her Miss Terry hid in the folds of the curtain and watched to see what would happen to Jack 
1752_16632_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The street was quiet 
1752_16632_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Few persons passed on either side 
1752_16632_000053_000002	train-clean-360	At last she spied two little ragamuffins approaching 
1752_16632_000053_000003	train-clean-360	They seemed to be Jewish lads of the newsboy class and they eyed the display of candles appraisingly 
1752_16632_000053_000004	train-clean-360	The smaller boy first caught sight of the box in the middle of the sidewalk 
1752_16632_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello 
1752_16632_000075_000001	train-clean-360	 Hello 
none	none	Wot s dis he grunted making a dash upon it Gee Wot s up responded the other who was instantly at his elbow Gwan 
1752_16632_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Lemme look at it 
none	none	The smaller boy drew away and pressed the spring of the box eagerly Ping Out popped the Jack into his astonished face whereupon he set up a guffaw
1752_16632_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Give it here 
1752_16632_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Give it here commanded the bigger boy 
none	none	Naw 
1752_16632_000059_000001	train-clean-360	You let it alone 
1752_16632_000059_000002	train-clean-360	It s mine asserted the other edging away along the curbstone 
1752_16632_000059_000003	train-clean-360	 I saw it first 
1752_16632_000059_000004	train-clean-360	You can t have it 
none	none	Give it here 
1752_16632_000060_000001	train-clean-360	I saw it first myself 
1752_16632_000060_000002	train-clean-360	Hand it over or I ll smash you 
1752_16632_000061_000000	train-clean-360	The bigger boy advanced threateningly 
none	none	I won t the other whimpered clasping the box tightly under his jacket 
1752_16632_000063_000000	train-clean-360	He started to run but the bigger fellow was too quick for him 
1752_16632_000063_000001	train-clean-360	He pounced across the sidewalk and soon the twain were struggling in the snowdrift pummeling one another with might and main 
1752_16632_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I told you so commented Miss Terry from behind the curtain 
1752_16632_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 Here s the first show of the beautiful Christmas spirit that is supposed to be abroad Look at the little beasts fighting over something that neither of them really wants 
1752_16632_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Just then Miss Terry spied a blue coated figure leisurely approaching 
1752_16632_000065_000001	train-clean-360	At the same moment an instinct seemed to warn the struggling urchins 
1752_16632_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Cop said a muffled voice from the pile of arms and legs and in an instant two black shadows were flitting down the street but not before the bigger boy had wrenched the box from the pocket of the little chap 
1752_16632_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 So that is the end of experiment number one quoth Miss Terry smiling grimly 
1752_16632_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 It happened just about as I expected 
1752_16632_000067_000002	train-clean-360	They will be fighting again as soon as they are out of sight 
1752_16632_000067_000003	train-clean-360	They are Jews but that doesn t make any difference about the Christmas spirit 
1752_16632_000067_000004	train-clean-360	Now let s see what becomes of the next experiment 
1752_16632_000068_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER III
none	none	 THE FLANTON DOG 
1752_16632_000070_000000	train-clean-360	She returned to the play box by the fire and rummaged for a few minutes among the tangled toys 
1752_16632_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Then with something like a chuckle she drew out a soft pale creature with four wobbly legs 
1752_16632_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 The Flanton Dog she said 
none	none	Well I vow 
1752_16632_000071_000002	train-clean-360	I had forgotten all about him It was Tom who coined the name for him because he was made of Canton flannel 
1752_16632_000072_000000	train-clean-360	She stood the thing up on the table as well as his weak legs would allow and inspected him critically 
none	none	He certainly was a forlorn specimen 
1752_16632_000072_000002	train-clean-360	One of the black beads which had served him for eyes was gone 
1752_16632_000072_000003	train-clean-360	His ears which had originally stood up saucily on his head now drooped in limp dejection 
1752_16632_000072_000004	train-clean-360	One of them was a mere shapeless rag hanging by a thread 
1752_16632_000072_000005	train-clean-360	He was dirty and discolored and his tail was gone 
1752_16632_000072_000006	train-clean-360	But still he smiled with his red thread mouth and seemed trying to make the best of things 
none	none	What a nightmare said Miss Terry contemptuously
1752_16632_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 I know there isn t a child in the city who wants such a looking thing 
none	none	Why even the Animal Rescue folks would give the boys a free shot at that 
1752_16632_000073_000003	train-clean-360	This isn t going to bring out any Christmas spirit she sneered 
1752_16632_000073_000004	train-clean-360	 I will try it and see 
1752_16632_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Once more she lifted the window and tossed the dog to the sidewalk 
1752_16632_000074_000001	train-clean-360	He rolled upon his back and lay pathetically with crooked legs yearning upward still smiling 
1752_16632_000074_000002	train-clean-360	Hardly had Miss Terry time to conceal herself behind the curtain when she saw a figure approaching airily waving a stick 
1752_16632_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 No ragamuffin this time she said 
none	none	Hello 
1752_16632_000075_000002	train-clean-360	It is that good for nothing young Cooper fellow from the next block 
1752_16632_000075_000003	train-clean-360	They say he is a millionaire Well he isn t even going to see the Flanton Dog 
none	none	The young man came swinging along debonairly he was whistling under his breath He was a dapper figure in a long coat and a silk hat under which the candles lighted a rather silly face 
1752_16632_000076_000002	train-clean-360	When he reached the spot in the sidewalk where the Flanton Dog lay he paused a moment looking down 
1752_16632_000076_000003	train-clean-360	Then he poked the object with his stick 
1752_16632_000076_000004	train-clean-360	On the other side of the street a mother and her little boy were passing at the time 
1752_16632_000076_000005	train-clean-360	The child s eyes caught sight of the dog on the sidewalk and he hung back watching to see what the young man would do to it 
1752_16632_000076_000006	train-clean-360	But his mother drew him after her 
1752_16632_000076_000007	train-clean-360	Just then an automobile came panting through the snow 
1752_16632_000076_000008	train-clean-360	With a quick movement Cooper picked up the dog on the end of his stick and tossed it into the street under the wheels of the machine 
1752_16632_000076_000009	train-clean-360	The baby across the street uttered a howl of anguish at the sight 
1752_16632_000076_000010	train-clean-360	Miss Terry herself was surprised to feel a pang shoot through her as the car passed over the queer old toy 
1752_16632_000076_000011	train-clean-360	She retreated from the window quickly 
none	none	Well that s the end of Flanton she said with half a sigh
1752_16632_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 I knew that fellow was a brute 
1752_16632_000077_000002	train-clean-360	I might have expected something like that 
1752_16632_000077_000003	train-clean-360	But it looked so so She hesitated for a word and did not finish her sentence but bit her lip and sniffed cynically 
1752_16632_000078_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER IV
1752_16632_000079_000000	train-clean-360	THE NOAH S ARK
1752_16632_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Now what comes next Miss Terry rummaged in the box until her fingers met something odd shaped long and smooth sided 
1752_16632_000080_000001	train-clean-360	With some difficulty she drew out the object for it was of good size 
none	none	H m 
1752_16632_000081_000001	train-clean-360	The old Noah s ark she said 
1752_16632_000081_000002	train-clean-360	 I wonder if all the animals are in there 
1752_16632_000082_000000	train-clean-360	She lifted the cover and turned out into her lap the long imprisoned animals and their round bodied chief 
1752_16632_000082_000001	train-clean-360	missus Noah and her sons had long since disappeared 
1752_16632_000082_000002	train-clean-360	But the ark builder hatless and one armed still presided over a menagerie of sorry beasts 
none	none	Scarcely one could boast of being a quadruped 
1752_16632_000082_000004	train-clean-360	To few of them the years had spared a tail 
1752_16632_000082_000005	train-clean-360	From their close resemblance in their misery it was not hard to believe in the kinship of all animal life 
1752_16632_000082_000006	train-clean-360	She took them up and examined them curiously one by one Finally she selected a shapeless slate colored block from the mass 
1752_16632_000082_000007	train-clean-360	 This was the elephant she mused 
1752_16632_000082_000008	train-clean-360	 I remember when Tom stepped on him and smashed his trunk 
1752_16632_000082_000009	train-clean-360	 I guess I m going to be an expressman when I grow up he said looking sorry 
1752_16632_000082_000010	train-clean-360	Tom was always full of his jokes 
1752_16632_000082_000011	train-clean-360	Now I ll try this and see what happens to the ark on its last voyage 
1752_16632_000083_000000	train-clean-360	Just then there was a noise outside 
1752_16632_000083_000001	train-clean-360	An automobile honked past and Miss Terry shuddered recalling the pathetic end of the Flanton Dog which had given her quite a turn 
1752_16632_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate those horrid machines she exclaimed 
1752_16632_000084_000001	train-clean-360	 They seem like Juggernaut I d like to forbid their going through this street 
1752_16632_000085_000000	train-clean-360	She crowded the elephant with Noah and the rest of his charge back into the ark and closed the lid 
1752_16632_000085_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t throw this out of the window she reflected 
1752_16632_000085_000002	train-clean-360	 They would spill 
1752_16632_000085_000003	train-clean-360	I must take it out on the sidewalk 
1752_16632_000085_000004	train-clean-360	Land 
1752_16632_000085_000005	train-clean-360	The fire s going out 
1752_16632_000085_000006	train-clean-360	That girl doesn t know how to build fires so they will keep 
1752_16632_000086_000000	train-clean-360	She laid the Noah s ark on the table and going to the closet tugged out several big logs which she arranged geometrically 
1752_16632_000086_000001	train-clean-360	About laying fires as about most other things Miss Terry had her own positive theories 
1752_16632_000086_000002	train-clean-360	Taking the bellows in hand she blew furiously and was presently rewarded with a brisk blaze 
1752_16632_000086_000003	train-clean-360	She smiled with satisfaction and trotted upstairs to find her red knit shawl 
1752_16632_000086_000004	train-clean-360	With this about her shoulders she was prepared to brave the December frost 
1752_16632_000086_000005	train-clean-360	Down the steps she went and deposited the ark discreetly at their foot then returned to take up her position behind the curtains 
1752_16632_000087_000000	train-clean-360	There were a good many people passing but they seemed too preoccupied to glance down at the sidewalk 
1752_16632_000087_000001	train-clean-360	They were nearly all hurrying in one direction 
1752_16632_000087_000002	train-clean-360	Some were running in the middle of the street 
1752_16632_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 They are in a great hurry sniffed Miss Terry disdainfully 
1752_16632_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 One would think they had something really important on hand 
1752_16632_000088_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose they are going to hear the singing 
none	none	Fiddlestick 
1752_16632_000089_000000	train-clean-360	A man hastened by under the window a woman two children a boy and a girl running and gesticulating eagerly 
1752_16632_000089_000001	train-clean-360	None of them noticed the Noah s ark lying at the foot of the steps 
1752_16632_000090_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Terry began to grow impatient 
1752_16632_000090_000001	train-clean-360	 Are they all blind she fretted What is the matter with them 
1752_16632_000090_000002	train-clean-360	I wish somebody would find the thing 
1752_16632_000090_000003	train-clean-360	I am tired of seeing it lying there 
1752_16632_000091_000000	train-clean-360	She tapped the floor impatiently with her slipper 
1752_16632_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Just then a woman approached 
1752_16632_000091_000002	train-clean-360	She was dressed in the most uncompromising of mourning and she walked slowly with bent head never glancing at the lighted windows on either side 
none	none	She will see it commented Miss Terry 
1752_16632_000092_000001	train-clean-360	And sure enough she did 
1752_16632_000092_000002	train-clean-360	She stopped at the doorstep drew her skirts aside and bent over to look at the strange shaped box at her feet 
1752_16632_000092_000003	train-clean-360	Finally she lifted it But immediately she shivered and acted so strangely that Miss Terry thought she was about to break the toy in pieces on the steps or throw it into the street Evidently she detested the sight of it 
1752_16632_000093_000000	train-clean-360	Just then up came a second woman with two small boys hanging at her skirts They were ragged and sick looking 
1752_16632_000093_000001	train-clean-360	There was something about the expression of even the tiny knot of hair at the back of the woman s head which told of anxious poverty 
1752_16632_000093_000002	train-clean-360	With envious curiosity she hurried up to see what a luckier mortal had found crowding to look over her shoulder 
1752_16632_000093_000003	train-clean-360	The woman in black drew haughtily away and clutched the Noah s ark with a gesture of proprietorship 
1752_16632_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Go away 
1752_16632_000094_000001	train-clean-360	This is my affair Miss Terry read her expression and sniffed There is the Christmas spirit coming out again she said to herself Look at her face 
none	none	The black gowned woman prepared to move on with the toy under her arm 
1752_16632_000095_000001	train-clean-360	But the second woman caught hold of her skirt and began to speak earnestly 
1752_16632_000095_000002	train-clean-360	She pointed to the Noah s ark then to her two children 
1752_16632_000095_000003	train-clean-360	Her eyes were beseeching 
1752_16632_000095_000004	train-clean-360	The little boys crowded forward eagerly 
1752_16632_000095_000005	train-clean-360	But some wicked spirit seemed to have seized the finder of the ark 
1752_16632_000095_000006	train-clean-360	Angrily she shook off the hand of the other woman and clutching the box yet more firmly under her arm she hurried away 
1752_16632_000095_000007	train-clean-360	Once twice she turned and shook her head at the ragged woman who followed her 
1752_16632_000095_000008	train-clean-360	Then with a savage gesture at the two children she disappeared beyond Miss Terry s straining eyes 
1752_16632_000095_000009	train-clean-360	The poor woman and her boys followed forlornly at a distance 
1752_16632_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 They really wanted it that old Noah s ark exclaimed Miss Terry in amazement 
1752_16632_000096_000001	train-clean-360	 I can scarcely believe it 
1752_16632_000096_000002	train-clean-360	But why did that other creature keep the thing 
1752_16632_000096_000003	train-clean-360	I see 
1752_16632_000096_000004	train-clean-360	Only because she found they cared for it 
1752_16632_000096_000005	train-clean-360	Well that is a happy spirit for Christmas time I should say 
none	none	Humph I did not expect to find anything quite so mean as that CHAPTER V MIRANDA Miss Terry returned to the fireside fumbled in the box and drew out a doll She was an ugly old fashioned doll with bruised waxen face of no particular color Her mop of flaxen hair was straggling and uneven much the worse for the attention of generations of moths She wore a faded green silk dress in the style of Lincoln s day and a primitive bonnet evidently made by childish hands She was a strange dead looking figure with pale eyelids closed as Miss Terry dragged her from the box But when she was set upright the lids snapped open and a pair of bright blue eyes looked straight into those of Miss Terry It was so sudden that the lady nearly gasped Miranda she exclaimed It is old Miranda I have not thought of her for years She held the doll at arm s length gazing fixedly at her for some minutes I cannot burn her she muttered at last It would seem almost like murder I don t like to throw her away but I have vowed to get rid of these things to night And I ll do it anyway Yes I ll make an experiment of her I wonder what sort of trouble she will cause Not even Miss Terry could think of seeing old Miranda lying exposed to the winter night She found a piece of paper rolled up the doll in a neat package and tied it with red string It was to look upon entirely a tempting package Once more she stole down the steps and hesitated where to leave Miranda not on the sidewalk for some reason that seemed impossible But near the foot of the flight of steps leading to the front door she deposited the doll The white package shone out plainly in the illuminated street There was no doubt that it would be readily seen With a quite unexplainable interest Miss Terry watched to see what would happen to Miranda She waited for some time The street seemed deserted Miss Terry caught the faint sound of singing The choristers were passing through a neighboring street and doubtless all wayfarers within hearing of their voices were following in their wake She was thoroughly interested in her grim joke but she was becoming impatient Were there to be no more passers Must the doll stay there unreclaimed until morning Presently she became aware of a child s figure drawing near It was a little girl of about ten very shabbily dressed with tangled yellow curls hanging over her shoulders There was something familiar about her appearance Miss Terry could not say what it was She came hurrying along the sidewalk with a preoccupied air and seemed about to pass the steps without seeing the package lying there But just as she was opposite the window her eye caught the gleam of the white paper She paused She looked at it eagerly it was such a tempting package both as to its size and shape She went closer and bent down to examine it She took it into her bare little hands and seemed to squeeze it gently There is no mistaking the contours of a doll however well it may be enveloped in paper wrappings The child s eyes grew more and more eager She glanced behind her furtively she looked up and down the street Then with a sudden intuition she looked straight ahead up the flight of steps Illustration SHE LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET Miss Terry read her mind accurately She was thinking that probably the doll belonged in that house some one must have dropped the package while going out or in Would she ring the bell and return it Miss Terry had not thought of that possibility But she shook her head and her lip curled Return it Of course not Ragged children do not usually return promising packages which they have found even on Christmas Eve Look now Once more the child glanced stealthily behind her up and down the street Once more she looked up at the dark house before her the only black spot in a wreath of brilliancy She did not see the face peering at her through the curtains a face which scanned her own half wistfully What was to become of Miranda The little girl thrust the package under her ragged coat and ran away down the street as fast as her legs could take her A thief cried Miss Terry That is the climax I have detected a child taking what she knew did not belong to her on Christmas Eve Where are all their Sunday School lessons and their social improvement classes I knew it This Christmas spirit that one hears so much about is nothing but an empty sham I have proved it to my satisfaction to night I will burn the rest of these toys every one of them and then go to bed It is too disgusting She was a nice looking child too Poor old Miranda With something like a sigh Miss Terry strode back to the fire where the play box stood gaping She had made but a small inroad upon its heaped up treasures She threw herself listlessly into the chair and began to pull over the things Broken games and animals dolls dresses painfully tailored by unskilled fingers disjointed members sorry relics of past pleasures one by one Miss Terry seized them between disdainful thumb and finger and tossed them into the fire Her face showed not a qualm at parting with these childhood treasures only the stern sense of a good housekeeper s duty fulfilled With queer contortions the bits writhed on the coals and finally flared into dissolution vanishing up chimney in a shower of sparks to the heaven of spent toys CHAPTER VI THE CHRISTMAS ANGEL Almost at the bottom of the box Miss Terry s fingers closed about a small object Once more she drew out the papier mache Angel which had so excited the wonder of Norah when once before that evening it had come to light Miss Terry held it up and looked at it with the same expression on her face half tender half contemptuous The Christmas Angel she murmured involuntarily as she had done before And again there flashed through her mind a vivid picture It was the day before Christmas fifty years earlier She and her brother Tom were trimming the Christmas tree in this very library She saw Tom in a white pique suit with short socks that were always slipping down his fat legs She saw herself in a white dress and blue ribbons pouting in a corner They had been quarreling about the Christmas tree disputing as to which of them should light the first candle when the time arrived Then their mother came to them smiling a sweet faced lady who seemed not to notice the red faces and the tears She put something into Tom s hand saying This is the Christmas Angel of peace and good will Hang it on the tree children so that it may shed a blessing on all who come here to give and to receive How lovely and pink it looked in Tom s hand Little Angelina had thought it the most beautiful thing she had ever seen and holy too as if it had some blessed charm Fiddlestick What queer fancies children have Miss Terry remembered how a strange thrill had crept through Angelina as she gazed at it Then she and Tom looked at each other and were ashamed of their quarrel Suddenly Tom held out the Angel to his sister You hang it on the tree Angelina he said magnanimously I know you want to But she little fool she too had a fit of generosity No you hang it Tom You re taller she said I ll hang it at the very top of the tree he replied nothing loath Eagerly he mounted the step ladder while Angelina watched him enviously thinking how clumsy he was and how much better she could do it How funny and fat Tom had looked on top of the ladder reaching as high as he dared The ladder began to wobble and he balanced precariously while Angelina clutched at his fat ankles with a scream of fright But Tom said Ow Angelina let go my ankles You hurt Now don t scream I shan t fall Don t you know that this is the Christmas Angel and he will never let me get hurt on Christmas Eve Swaying wildly on one toe Tom had clutched at the air at the tree itself anywhere for support Yet almost as if by a miracle he did not fall And the Christmas Angel was looking down from the very top of the tree Miss Terry laid the little pink figure in her lap and mused Mother was wise she sighed She knew how to settle our quarrels in those days Perhaps if she had still been here things would have gone differently Tom might not have left me for good For good She emphasized the words with a nod as if arguing against something Again she took up the Christmas Angel and looked earnestly at it Could it be that tears were glistening in her eyes Certainly not With a sudden sniff and jerk of the shoulders she leaned forward holding the Angel towards the fire This should follow the other useless toys But something seemed to stay her hand She drew back hesitated then rose to her feet I can t burn it she said It s no use I can t burn it But I don t want to see the thing around I will put this out on the sidewalk too Possibly this may be different and do some good to somebody She wrapped the shawl about her shoulders and once more ran down the steps She left the Angel face upward in the middle of the sidewalk and retreated quickly to the house As she opened the door to enter she caught the distant chorus of fresh young voices singing in a neighboring square Angels from the realms of glory Wing your flight o er all the earth When she took her place behind the curtain she was trembling a little she could not guess why But now she watched with renewed eagerness What was to be the fate of the Christmas Angel Would he fall into the right hands and be hung upon some Christmas tree ere morning Would he Miss Terry held her breath A man was staggering along the street toward her He whistled noisily a vulgar song as he reeled from curb to railing threatening to fall at every step A drunken man on Christmas Eve Miss Terry felt a great loathing for him He was at the foot of the steps now He was close upon the Angel Would he see it or would he tread upon it in his disgusting blindness Yes no He saw the little pink image lying on the bricks and with a lurch forward bent to examine it Miss Terry flattened her nose against the pane eagerly She expected to see him fall upon the Angel bodily But no he righted himself with a whoop of drunken mirth Angel she heard him croak with maudlin accent Pink Angel begorrah What doin ere eh Whoop Go back to sky Angel and lifting a brutal foot he kicked the image into the street Then with a shriek of laughter he staggered away out of sight Miss Terry found herself trembling with indignation The idea He had kicked the Christmas Angel the very Angel that Tom had hung on their tree It was sacrilege or at least Fiddlestick Miss Terry s mind was growing confused She had a sudden impulse to rescue the toy from being trampled into filthiness The fire was better than that She hurried down the steps into the street forgetting her shawl She sought in the snow and snatched the pink morsel to safety Straight to the fire she carried it and once more held it to the flames But again she found it impossible to burn the thing Once twice she tried But each time something seemed to clutch back her wrist At last she shrugged impatiently and laid the Angel on the mantelpiece beside the square old marble clock which marked the hour of half past eight Well I won t burn it to night she reflected Somehow I can t do it just now I don t see what has got into me But to morrow I will Yes to morrow I will She sat down in the armchair and fumbled in the old play box for the remaining scraps There were but a few meaningless bits of ribbon and gauze with the end of a Christmas candle the survivor of some past festival burned on some tree in the past All these but the last she tossed into the fire where they made a final protesting blaze The candle end fell to the floor unnoticed There That is the last of the stuff she exclaimed with grim satisfaction shaking the dust from her black silk skirt It is all gone now thank Heaven and I can go to bed in peace No I forgot Norah I suppose I must sit up and wait for her Bother the girl She ought to be in by now What can she find to amuse her all this time Christmas Eve Fiddlestick But I have got rid of a lot of rubbish to night and that is worth something She sank back in her chair and clasped her hands over her breast with a sigh She felt strangely weary Her eyes sought the clock once more and doing so rested upon the Christmas Angel lying beside it She frowned and closed her eyes to shut out the sight with its haunting memories and suggestions CHAPTER VII BEFORE THE FIRE Suddenly there was a volume of sound outside and a great brightness filled the room Miss Terry opened her eyes The fire was burning red but a yellow light as from thousands of candles shone in at the window and there was the sound of singing the sweetest singing that Miss Terry had ever heard An Angel of the Lord came down And glory shone around The words seemed chanted by the voices of young angels Miss Terry passed her hands over her eyes and glanced at the clock But what the hour was she never noticed for her gaze was filled with something else Beside the clock in the spot where she had laid it a few minutes before was the Christmas Angel But now instead of lying helplessly on its back it was standing on rosy feet with arms outstretched toward her Over its head fluttered gauzy wings From under the yellow hair which rippled over the shoulders two blue eyes beamed kindly upon her and the mouth widened into the sweetest smile Peace on earth to men of good will cried the Angel and the tone of his speech was music yet quite natural and thrilling Miss Terry stared hard at the Angel and rubbed her eyes saying to herself Fiddlestick I am dreaming But she could not rub away the vision When she opened her eyes the Angel still stood tiptoe on the mantel shelf smiling at her and shaking his golden head Angelina said the Angel softly and Miss Terry trembled to hear her name thus spoken for the first time in years Angelina you do not want to believe your own eyes do you But I am real more real than the things you see every day You must believe in me I am the Christmas Angel I know it Miss Terry s voice was hoarse and unmanageable as of one in a nightmare I remember You remember repeated the Angel Yes you remember the day when you and Tom hung me on the Christmas tree You were a sweet little girl then with blue eyes and yellow curls You believed the Christmas story and loved Santa Claus Then you were simple and affectionate and generous and happy Fiddlestick Miss Terry tried to say But the word would not come Now you have lost the old belief and the old love went on the Angel Now you have studied books and read wise men s sayings You understand the higher criticism and the higher charity and the higher egoism You don t believe in mere giving You don t believe in the Christmas economics you know better But are you happy dear Angelina Again Miss Terry thrilled at the sound of her name so sweetly spoken but she answered nothing The Angel replied for her No you are not happy because you have cut yourself off from the things that bring folk together in peace and good will at this holy time Where are your friends Where is your brother to night You are still hard and unforgiving to Tom You refused to see him to day though he wrote so boyishly so humbly and affectionately You have not tried to make any soul happy You don t believe in me the Christmas Spirit There is such a word as Fiddlestick whatever it may mean But Miss Terry s mind and tongue were unable to form it The Christmas spirit continued the Angel What is life worth if one cannot believe in the Christmas spirit With a powerful effort Miss Terry shook off her nightmare sufficiently to say The Christmas spirit is no real thing I have proved it to night It is not real It is a humbug Not real A humbug repeated the Angel softly And you have proved it Angelina this very night Miss Terry nodded I know what you have done said the Angel I know very well How keen you were How clever You made a test of Chance to prove your point Again Miss Terry nodded with complacency What knowledge of the world What grasp of human nature commented the Angel smiling It is like you mere mortals to say I will make my test in my own way If certain things happen I shall foresee what the result must be If certain other things happen I shall know that I am right Events fall out as you expect and you smile with satisfaction feeling your wisdom justified It ought to make you happy But does it Miss Terry regarded the Angel doubtfully Look now he went on holding up a rosy finger You are so near sighted You are so unimaginative You do not dream beyond the thing you see You judge the tale finished while the best has yet to be told And you stake your faith your hope your charity upon this blind human judgment which is mere Chance Miss Terry opened her lips to say I saw but the Angel interrupted her You saw but the beginning he said You saw but the first page of each history Shall I turn over the leaves and let you read what really happened Shall I help you to see the whole truth instead of a part On this night holy Truth which is of Heaven comes for all men to see and to believe Look CHAPTER VIII JACK AGAIN The Christmas Angel gently waved his hand to and fro Gradually as Miss Terry sat back in her chair the library grew dark or rather things faded into an indistinguishable blur Then it seemed as if she were sitting at a theatre gazing at a great stage But at this theatre there was nothing about her nothing between her and the place where things were happening First she saw two little ragamuffins quarreling over something in the snow She recognized them They were the two Jewish boys who had picked up the Jack in the box An officer appeared and they ran away the bigger boy having possession of the toy the smaller one with fists in his eyes bawling with disappointment Miss Terry s lips curled with the cynical disgust which she had felt when first witnessing this scene But a sweet voice and she knew it was the Angel s whispered in her ear Wait and see She watched the two boys run through the streets until they came to a dark corner There the little fellow caught up with the other and once more the struggle began It was a hard and bloody fight But this time the victory was with the smaller lad who used his fists and feet like an enraged animal until the other howled for mercy and handed over the disputed toy Whatcher want it fer Sam he blubbered as he saw it go into the little fellow s pocket Mind yer own business I just want it answered Sam surlily Betcher I know taunted the bigger boy Betcher yer don t Do Don t Another fight seemed imminent But wisdom prevailed with Sammy He would not challenge fate a third time Come on then and see he grunted And Ike followed Off the two trudged through the brilliantly lighted streets until they came to a part of the city where the ways were narrower and dark Huh Knowed you was comin here commented Ike as they turned into a grim dirty alley Little Sam growled Didn t apparently as a matter of habit Did reasserted Ike Just where I was comin myself Sam turned to him with a grin Was yer now By Ain t that funny I thought of it right off Sure Same here They both burst into a guffaw and executed an impromptu double shuffle of delight They were at the door of a tenement house with steep stairs leading into darkness Up three flights pounded the two pairs of heavy boots till they reached a half open door whence issued the clatter of a sewing machine and the voices of children Sam stood on the threshold grinning debonairly with hands thrust into his pockets Ike peered over his shoulder also grinning It was a meagre room into which they gazed a room the chief furniture of which seemed to be babies Two little ones sprawled on the floor A third tiny tot lay in a broken down carriage beside the door A pale ill looking woman was running the machine On the cot bed was crumpled a fragile little fellow of about five and a small pair of crutches lay across the foot of the bed When the two boys appeared in the doorway the woman stopped her machine and the children set up a howl of pleasure Sammy Ikey cried the woman smiling a wan welcome as the babies crept and toddled toward the newcomers Where ye come from Been to see the shops and the lights in the swell houses answered Sammy with a grimace Gee Ain t they wastin candles to beat the cars Enough to last a family a whole year muttered Ike with disgust The woman sighed Maybe they ain t wasted exactly she said How I d like to see em But I got to finish this job I told the chil ren they mustn t expect anything this Christmas But they are too little to know the difference anyway all but Joe I wish I had something for Joe I got something for Joe said Sammy unexpectedly The face of the pale little cripple lighted What is it he asked eagerly Oh what is it A real Christmas present for me Naw It ain t a Christmas present said Sam We don t care anything about Christmas volunteered Ikey with a grin Sam looked at him with a frown of rebuke It s just a present he said And it didn t cost a cent I didn t buy it I we found it Found it in the street Joe s eyes shone Yah the boys nodded Oh it is a Christmas present cried Joe Santa Claus must have dropped it there for me because he knew we hadn t any chimney in this house and he sent you kind kind boys to bring it to me The two urchins looked sideways at each other but said nothing Presently Sam drew out the box from his pocket and tried to thrust it into Ike s hand You give it to um he said You re the biggest Naw You give it You found it protested Ike Ah g wan Big fool There was a tussle and it almost seemed as if the past unpleasantness was to be repeated from an opposite cause But Joe s voice settled the dispute Oh Sammy please he cried I can t wait another minute Do please give it to me now At these words Sam stepped forward without further argument and laid the box on the bed in front of the little cripple The babies crowded about The mother left her machine and stood smiling faintly at the foot of the bed Joe pressed the spring Ping Out sprang the Jack in the box with the same red nose the same leer the same roguish eyes which had surprised the children of fifty years ago Illustration PING OUT SPRANG THE JACK IN THE BOX Jack was always sure of his audience My How they screamed and begged Joe to do it again And as for Joe he lay back on his pillow and laughed and laughed as though he would never stop It was the first Jack any of them had seen Tears stood in the mother s eyes Well she said it s as good as a play to see him Joe hasn t laughed like that for months You boys have done him lots of good I wouldn t wonder if it helped him get well If you was Christians I d say you showed the real Christmas spirit But Lord perhaps ye do all the same I dunno Sam and Ike were so busy playing with the children that they did not hear Gradually the tenement house faded and became a blur before Miss Terry s eyes Once more she saw the mantel shelf before her and the Christmas Angel with outstretched arms waving to and fro You see he said You did not guess all the pleasure that was shut up in that box with old Jack did you Miss Terry shook her head And you see how different it all was from what you thought Now let us see what became of the Canton flannel dog The Flanton Dog Miss Terry amended the phrase under her breath It seemed so natural to use Tom s word Yes the Flanton Dog the Angel smiled What do you think became of him I saw what became of him said Miss Terry Bob Cooper threw him under an automobile and he was crushed flatter than a pancake Then you left the window said the Angel In your human way you assumed that this was the end But wait and see Once more the room darkened and blurred and Miss Terry looked out upon past events as upon a busy ever shifting stage CHAPTER IX THE DOG AGAIN She saw the snowy street into which from the tip of his stick Bob Cooper had just tossed the Flanton Dog She saw what she had not seen before the woman and child on the opposite side of the street She saw the baby stretch out wistful hands after the dog lying in the snow Then an automobile honked past and she felt again the thrill of horror as it ran over the poor old toy At the same moment the child screamed and she saw it point tearfully at the Flanton tragedy The mother who had seen nothing of all this stooped and spoke to him reprovingly What s the matter Johnnie she said Sh Don t make such a noise Here we are at missus Wales s gate and you mustn t make a fuss Now be a good boy and wait here till Mother comes out She rang the area bell and stood basket in hand waiting to be admitted But Johnnie gazed at one spot in the street with eyes full of tears and with now and then a sob gurgling from his throat He could not forget what he had seen The door opened for the mother who disappeared inside the house with one last command to the child Now be a good boy Johnnie I ll be back in half a minute Hardly was she out of sight when Johnnie started through the snowdrift toward the middle of the street With difficulty he lifted his little legs out of the deep snow now and then he stumbled and fell into the soft mass But he rose only the more determined upon his errand and kept his eyes fixed on the wreck of the Flanton Dog Bob Cooper who was idly strolling up and down the block smoking a cigarette as he watched the flitting girlish shadows in a certain window opposite saw the child s frantic struggles in the snow and was intensely amused Bah Jove he chuckled I believe he s after the wretched dawg that I tossed over there with my stick Fahncy it And carelessly he puffed a whiff of smoke At last the baby reached the middle of the street and stooped to pick up the battered toy It was flattened and shapeless but the child clasped it tenderly and began to coo softly to it Bah Jove repeated Cooper Fahncy caring so much about anything Poor kid Perhaps that is all the Christmas he will have He blew a thoughtful puff through his nose Christmas Eve The thought flashed through his mind with a new appeal Just then came a sudden Honk honk An automobile had turned the corner and was coming up at full speed It was the same machine which had passed a few minutes earlier in the opposite direction Hi there Cooper yelled to the child But the latter was sitting in the snow in the middle of the street rocking back and forth with the Flanton Dog in his arms There was scarcely time for action Bob dropped his cigarette and his cane made one leap into the street and another to the child and by the impact of his body threw the baby into the drift at the curb With a horrified honk the automobile passed over the young man who lay senseless in the snow Illustration BOB COOPER SAVES THE BABY He was not killed Miss Terry saw him taken to his home close by where his broken leg was set and his bruises attended to She saw him lying bandaged and white on his bed when the woman and her child were brought to see him Johnnie was still clasping closely the unlucky Flanton Dog Well Kid said the young man feebly so you saved the dog after all O sir cried the poor woman weeping Only to think that he would not be here now but for you What a Christmas that would have been for me You were so good so brave Oh rot protested Bob faintly Had to do it my fault anyway Christmas Eve couldn t see a kid hurt on Christmas Eve He called the attendant and asked for the pocket book which had been in his coat at the time of the accident Putting it into the woman s hand he said Good by Get Johnnie something really jolly for Christmas I m afraid the dog is about all in Get him a new one But Johnnie refused to have a new dog It was the poor shapeless Flanton animal which remained the darling of his heart for many a moon All this of past and future Miss Terry knew through the Angel s power When once more the library lightened and she saw the pink figure smiling at her from the mantel she spoke of her own accord It was my fault because I put the dog in the way I caused all that trouble Trouble said the Angel puzzled Do you call it trouble Do you not see what it has done for that heartless youth It brought his good moment Perhaps he will be a different man after this And as for the child he was made happy by something that would otherwise have been wasted and he has gained a friend who will not forget him Trouble And do you think you did it He laughed knowingly I certainly did said Miss Terry firmly But it was I yes I the Christmas Spirit who put it into your head to do what you did You may not believe it but so it was You too even you Angelina could not quite escape the influence of the Christmas Spirit and so these things have happened But now let us see what became of the third experiment CHAPTER X NOAH AGAIN In the street of candles a woman dressed all in black had picked up the poor old Noah s ark and was looking at it wildly She was a widow who had just lost her only child a little son and she was in a state of morbid bitterness bordering on distraction When the second woman with the two little ones came up and begged for the toy something hard and sullen and cruel rose in the widow s heart and she refused angrily to give up the thing She hated those two boys who had been spared when her own was taken She would not make them happy No you shall not have it she cried clutching the Noah s ark fiercely I will destroy it The poor woman and the children followed her wistfully The little boys were crying They were cold and hungry and disappointed They had come so near to something pleasant They had almost been lucky but the luck had passed over their heads to another The woman in mourning strode on rapidly the thoughts within her no less black than the garments which she wore She hated the world she hated the people who lived in it She hated Christmas time when every one seemed merry except herself And yes yes Most of all she hated children She clenched her teeth wickedly her mind reeled Suddenly somewhere a chorus of happy voices began to sing the words of an old carol Holy night Peaceful night All is dark save the light Yonder where they sweet vigil keep O er the Babe who in silent sleep Rests in heavenly peace Softly and sweetly the childish voices ascended from the street The woman in black stopped short breathing hard She saw the band of choristers standing in a group on the sidewalk and in the snow their hats pulled down over their eyes their collars turned up around their ears their hands deep in pockets In their midst rose the tall wooden cross carried by a little fellow with yellow hair They sang as simply and as heartily as a flock of birds out in the snow The woman gave a great sob Her little lad had been a choir boy perhaps these were his one time comrades The second verse of the carol rang out sweetly Holy night Peaceful night Only for shepherds sight Came blest visions of angel throngs With their loud Hallelujah songs Saying Jesus is come Suddenly it seemed to the distracted mother that her own boy s voice blended with those others He too was singing in honor of that Child Happy and ever young he was bidding her rejoice in the day which made all childhood sacred And for his sake she had been hating children With a sudden revulsion of feeling she turned to see what had become of the poor mother and her boys They were not far behind huddling in the shadow The black woman strode quickly up to them They shrank pitifully at her approach and she felt the shame of it They were afraid of her Here she said thrusting the Noah s ark into the hands of the larger boy Take it It belongs to you The child took it timidly The mother began to protest thanks Trying to control the shake in her voice the dark lady spoke again Have you prepared a Christmas for your children The woman shook her head I have nothing she sighed A roof over our heads that s all Your husband My man died a month ago So other folk had raw sorrows too The mourner had forgotten that There is no one expecting you at home Again the woman shook her head dolefully Come with me said the dark lady impulsively You shall be my guests to night And to morrow I will make a Christmas for the children The house shall put off its shadow I too will light candles I have toys her voice broke and clothing many things which are being wasted That is not right Something led you to me or me to you something perhaps it was an Angel whoever dropped that Noah s ark in the street An Angel might do that I believe Come with me The woman and her sons followed her rejoicing greatly in the midst of their wonder There were tears in the eyes through which Miss Terry saw once more the Christmas Angel She wiped them hastily But still the Angel seemed to shine with a fairer radiance You see was all he said And Miss Terry bowed her head She began to understand CHAPTER XI MIRANDA AGAIN Once more on the wings of vision Miss Terry was out in the snowy street She was following the fleet steps of a little girl who carried a white paper package under her arm Miss Terry knew that she was learning the fate of her old doll Miranda whom her own hands had thrust out into a cold world Poor Miranda After all these years to become the property of a thief Mary was the little thief s name Hugging the tempting package close Mary ran and ran until she was out of breath Her one thought was to get as far as possible from the place where the bundle had lain For she suspected that the steps where she had found it led up to the doll s home That was why in her own eyes also she was a little thief But now she had run so far and had turned so many corners that she could not find her way back if she would There was triumph in the thought Mary chuckled to herself as she stopped running and began to walk leisurely in the neighborhood with which she was more familiar She pinched the package gently Yes there could be no doubt about it It was a doll not a very large doll but Mary reflected that she had never thought she should care for a large doll Undoubtedly it was a very nice one Had she not found it in a swell part of the city on the steps of a swell looking house Mary gloated over the doll as she fancied it with real hair and eyes that opened and shut with four little white teeth and hands with dimples in the knuckles She had seen such dolls in the windows of the big shops But she had never hoped to have one for her very own Maybe it will have on a blue silk dress and white kid shoes like that one I saw this morning she mused rapturously She pinched the spot where she fancied the doll s feet ought to be Yes she s got shoes sure enough I bet they re white too They feel white Oh what fun I shall have with her she hugged the doll fondly if Uncle and Aunt don t take her away The sudden thought made her stand still in horror They sold Mother s little clock for rum she said bitterly They sold the ring with the red stone that Father gave me on my birthday when I was seven They sold the presents that I got at Sunday School last year Oh wouldn t it be dreadful if they should sell my new doll And I know they will want to if they see her She squeezed the bundle closer with the prescient pang of parting Maybe they ll be out somewhere With this faint hope she reached the tenement and crept up the dingy stairs She peeped in at the door Alas Her uncle and aunt were in the kitchen through which she had to pass They had company some dirty looking men and women and there were a jug and glasses on the table before them Mary s heart sank but she nodded bravely to the company and tried to slip through the crowd to the other room But her aunt was quick to see that she carried something under her coat What you got there A Christmas present she sneered Mary flushed No she said slowly just something I found Found Hello what is it A package Her uncle advanced and snatched it from her Please pleaded Mary please I found it It is mine I think it is only a doll A doll Huh Who needs a doll hiccoughed her uncle We want something more to drink We ll sell it A bellow of laughter resounded through the room The paper being torn roughly away poor Miranda stood revealed in all her faded beauty The pallid waxen face straggling hair and old fashioned dress presented a sorry sight to the greedy eyes which had expected to find something exchangeable for drink A sorry sight she was to Mary who had hoped for something so much lovelier A flush of disappointment came into her cheek and tears to her eyes Here take your old doll said her uncle roughly thrusting it into her arms Take your old doll and get away with her If that s the best you can find you d better steal something next time Steal something Had she not in fact stolen it Mary knew very well that she had and she flushed pinker yet to think what a fool she had made of herself for nothing She took the despised doll and retreated into the other room followed by a chorus of jeers and comments She banged the door behind her and sat down with poor Miranda on her knees crying as if her heart would break She had so longed for a beautiful doll It did seem too cruel that when she found one it should turn out to be so ugly She seized poor Miranda and shook her fiercely You horrid old thing she said Ain t you ashamed to fool me so Ain t you ashamed to make me think you was a lovely doll with pretty clo es and white kid shoes Ain t you She shook Miranda again until her eyeballs rattled in her head The doll fell to the floor and lay there with closed eyes Her face was pallid and ghastly Her bonnet had fallen off and her hair stuck out wildly in every direction Her legs were doubled under her in the most helpless fashion She was the forlornest figure of a doll imaginable Presently Mary drew her hands away from her eyes and looked down at Miranda There was something in the doll s attitude as she lay there which touched the little girl s heart Once she had seen a woman who had been injured in the street she would never forget it The poor creature s eyes had been closed and her face under the fallen bonnet was of this same pasty color Mary shuddered Suddenly she felt a warm rush of pity for the doll You poor old thing she exclaimed looking at Miranda almost tenderly I m sorry I shook you You look so tired and sad and homesick I wonder if somebody is worrying about you this minute It was very wicked of me to take you away on Christmas Eve too I wish I had left you where I found you Maybe some little girl is crying now because you are lost Mary stooped and lifted the doll gently upon her knees As she took Miranda up the blue eyes opened and seemed to look full at her Miranda s one beauty was her eyes Mary felt her heart grow warmer and warmer toward the quaint stranger You have lovely eyes she murmured I think after all you are almost pretty Perhaps I should grow to like you awfully You are not a bit like the doll I hoped to have but that is not your fault A thought made her face brighten Why if you had been a beautiful doll they would have taken you away and sold you for rum Her face expressed utter disgust She hugged Miranda close with a sudden outburst of affection Oh you dear old thing she cried I am so glad you are just like this I am so glad for now I can keep you always and always and no one will want to take you away from me She rocked to and fro holding the doll tightly to her heart Mary was not one to feel a half passion about anything I will make you some new dresses she said fingering the old fashioned silk with a puzzled air I wonder why your mother dressed you so queerly She was not much of a sewer if she made this bonnet Scornfully she took off the primitive bonnet and smoothed out the tangled hair I wonder what you have on underneath she said With gentle fingers she began to undress Miranda Off came the green silk dress with its tight basque and overskirt Off came the ruffled petticoat and little chemise edged with fine lace And Miranda stood in shapeless kid bodied ugliness which stage of evolution the doll of her day had reached But there was something more Around her neck she wore a ribbon on the ribbon was a cardboard medal and on the medal a childish hand had scratched the legend Miranda Terry If lost please return her to her mother Angelina Terry eighty seven Overlook Terrace It was such a card as Miss Terry herself had worn in the days when her mother had first let her and Tom go out on the street without a nurse Mary stared hard at the bit of cardboard eighty seven Overlook Terrace Yes that was where she had found the doll She remembered now seeing the name on a street corner Miranda what a pretty name for a doll Angelina Terry so that was the name of the little girl who had lost Miranda Angelina must be feeling very sorry now Perhaps she was crying herself to sleep for it was growing late Her two girl cousins came romping into the bedroom They had been having a hilarious evening Hello Mary they cried We heard about your great find Playing with your old doll are you Goin to hang up her stockin and see if Santa Claus will fill it Huh Santa Claus won t come to this house I guess Mary had almost forgotten that it was Christmas Eve There had been nothing in the house to remind her Perhaps Angelina Terry had hung up a stocking for Miranda at eighty seven Overlook Terrace But there would be no Miranda to see it the next morning Her cousins teased her for some time while they undressed and Mary grew sulky She sat in her corner and answered them shortly But presently the room was quiet for the girls slept easily Then Mary crept into her little cot with the doll in her arms She loved Miranda so much that she would never part with her no indeed not even though she now knew where Miranda belonged eighty seven Overlook Terrace The figures danced before her eyes maliciously She wished she could forget them And the thought of Angelina Terry kept coming to her Poor Angelina She ain t poor Angelina argued Mary to herself She s rich Angelina Doesn t she live in a big house in the swell part of the city I s pose she has hundreds of dolls much handsomer than Miranda and lots of other toys I guess she won t miss this one queer old doll I guess she d let me keep it if she knew I hadn t any of my own I guess it ought to be my doll Anyway I m going to keep her I don t believe Angelina loves Miranda so much as I do She laid her cheek against the doll s cold waxen one and presently fell asleep But she slept uneasily In the middle of the night she awoke and lay for hours tossing and unhappy in the stuffy little room The clock struck one two three At last she gave a great sigh and cuddling Miranda in her arms turned over with peace in her heart I will play you are mine my very own dollie for just this one night she whispered in Miranda s ear To morrow will be Christmas Day and I will take you back to your little mother Angelina Terry I can t do a mean thing at Christmas time not even for you dear Miranda Thereupon she fell into a peaceful sleep CHAPTER XII THE ANGEL AGAIN Will she bring it back asked Miss Terry eagerly when once more she found herself under the gaze of the Christmas Angel He nodded brightly To morrow morning you will see he said It will prove that all I have shown you is really true A pretty child said Miss Terry musingly A very nice child indeed I believe she looks very much as I used to be myself You see she is not a thief after all not yet said the Angel What a pity that she must live in that sad home with such terrible people A sensitive child like her craving sympathy and affection what chance has she for happiness What would you yourself have been in surroundings like hers Yes she is very like what I was Of course I shall let her keep the doll Miss Terry hesitated The Angel looked at her steadily and his glance seemed to read her half formed thoughts Surely he said It seems to belong to her does it not But is this all I wonder if something more does not belong to her What more asked Miss Terry shortly A home cried the Angel Miss Terry groped in her memory for a scornful ejaculation which she had once been fond of using but there was no such word to be found Instead there came to her lips the name Mary The Angel repeated it softly Mary It is a blessed name he said Blessed the roof that shelters a Mary in her need There was a long silence in which Miss Terry felt new impulses stirring within her impulses drawing her to the child whose looks recalled her own childhood The Angel regarded her with beaming eyes After some time he said quietly Now let us see what became of your last experiment Miss Terry started It seemed as if she had been interrupted in pleasant dreaming You were the last experiment she said I know what became of you Here you are Yet more may have happened than you guessed replied the Angel meaningly I have tried to show you how often that is the case Look again Without moving from her chair Miss Terry seemed to be looking out on her sidewalk where so it seemed she had just laid the pink figure of the Angel She saw the drunken man approach She heard his coarse laugh saw his brutal movement as he kicked the Christmas token into the street In sick disgust she saw him reel away out of sight She saw herself run down the steps rescue the image and bring it into the house Surely the story was finished What more could there be But something bade her vision follow the steps of the wretched man Down the street he reeled singing a blasphemous song With a whoop he rounded a corner and ran into a happy party which filled sidewalk and street as it hurried in the direction from which he came Good naturedly they jostled him against the wall and he grasped a railing to steady himself as they swept by It was the choir on their way to carol in the next street Before them went the cross bearer lifting high his simple wooden emblem Illustration HE GRASPED A RAILING TO STEADY HIMSELF The eyes of the drunken man caught sight of this and wavered The presence of the crowd conveyed no meaning to his dazed brains But there was something in the familiar symbol which held his vision He looked and crossed himself remembering the traditions of his childhood Some of the boys were humming as they went the stirring strains of an ancient Christmas march known to all nations a carol which began some say as a rousing drinking chorus The familiar strain touched some chord in the sodden brain The man gave a feeble whinny trying to follow the melody He pulled himself together and lurched forward in a sudden impulse to join the band of pilgrims But by the time he had taken three steps they had vanished miraculously as it seemed to him Begorra they re gone he cried Who were they Were they rale folks What was it they was singin He sank back helplessly on a flight of steps Ve ni te a do re mus he croaked in a quavering basso And his tangled mind went through strange processes Suddenly there came to him in a flash of exaggerated memory the figure of the Christmas Angel which not ten minutes earlier he had kicked into the street A pious horror fell upon him Mither o mercy he cried again crossing himself What have I been an done It was a howly image an what did I do to ut Lemme go back an find ut an take ut up out av the street Greatly sobered by his fear he staggered down the block and around the corner to the steps of Miss Terry s house This is the place he mused I know ut here s where the frindly lam post hild me in its arrums I rimimber there was a dark house forninst me Here s where ut lay on the sidewalk all pink an pretty An I kicked ut into the street Where is ut now Where gone Howly Mither Here s the spot where ut fell look now The shape of uts little body and the wings of ut in the snow But tis gone intirely He rubbed his eyes and crossed himself again Tis flown away he muttered Tis gone back to Hiven to tell Mary Mither o the wicked thing I done this night Oh tis a miracle that s happened An oh The wicked man I am drunk and disorderly on the Howly Eve O come all ye faithful Joyful and triumphant Once more he heard the familiar strain taken up lustily by many voices Hear all the world singin on the way to Bethlehem he said and the stupor seemed to leave his brain He no longer staggered I ll run an join em an I won t drink another drop this night He looked up at the starry sky Maybe the Angel hears me Maybe he ll help me to keep straight to morrow It might be my Guardian Angel himsilf that I treated so Saints forgive me With head bowed humbly but no longer reeling he moved away towards the sound of music You were his Guardian Angel said Miss Terry when once more she saw the figure on the mantel shelf And she spoke with reverent gentleness The Angel smiled brightly The Christmas Spirit is a guardian angel to many he said Never again despise me Angelina Never again make light of my influence Never again murmured Miss Terry half unconsciously I wish it were not too late It is never too late said the Christmas Angel eagerly as if he read her unspoken thought Oh never too late Angelina CHAPTER XIII THE CHRISTMAS CANDLE Suddenly there was a sound a dull reverberating sound It seemed to Miss Terry to come from neither north south east nor west but from a different world Ah She recognized it now It was somebody knocking on the library door Miss Terry gave a long sigh and drew herself up in her chair It must be Norah just come back she said to herself I had forgotten Norah completely It must be shockingly late Come in she called as she glanced at the clock She rubbed her eyes and looked again A few minutes after nine She had thought it must be midnight Norah entered to find her mistress staring at the mantel where the clock stood She saw lying beside the clock the pink Angel which had fallen from the box as she brought it in the box now empty by the fire Law Miss she said have you burned them all up but him I m glad you saved him he s so pretty Norah said Miss Terry with an effort is that clock right Yes m said Norah I set it this morning I came back as soon as I could Miss she added apologetically It isn t that answered Miss Terry drawing her hand across her forehead dazedly I did not mind your absence But I thought it must be later Oh no I wouldn t stay out any later when you was alone here Miss said Norah penitently I felt ashamed after I had gone I ought not to have left you so on Christmas Eve But oh Miss The singing was so beautiful and the houses looked so grand with the candles in the windows It is like a holy night indeed Miss Terry stooped and picked up something from the floor It was the bit of candle end which had escaped the holocaust Are the candles still lighted Norah she asked eyeing the bit of wax in her hand Yes m some of them answered the maid It is getting late and a good many have burned out But some houses are still as bright as ever Perhaps it is not too late then murmured Miss Terry as if yielding a disputed point Let us hurry Norah She rose and going to the mantel shelf gently took up the figure of the Angel while Norah looked on in amazement Norah said Miss Terry with an eagerness which made her voice tremble I want you to hang the Christmas Angel in the window there I too have a fancy to burn a candle to night If it is not too late I d like to have a little share in the Christmas spirit Norah s eyes lighted Oh yes m she said I ll hang it right away And I ll find an empty spool to hold the candle She bustled briskly about and presently in the window appeared a little device unlike any other in the block Against the darkness within the figure of the Angel with arms outstretched towards the street shone in a soft light from the flame of a single tiny candle such as blossom on Christmas trees It caught the attention of many home goers who said smiling How simple How pretty How quaint It is a type of the Christmas spirit which is abroad to night You can feel it everywhere blessing the city For some minutes before the candle was lighted a man muffled in a heavy overcoat had been standing in a doorway opposite Miss Terry s house He was tall and grizzled and his face was sad He stared up at the gloomy windows the only oblongs of blackness in the illuminated block and he shivered shrugging his shoulders The same as ever he said to himself I might have known she would never change Any one else on Christmas Eve after the letter I wrote her would have softened a little But I might have known She is hard as nails Of course it was my fault in the first place to leave her as I did But when I acknowledged it and when I wrote that letter on Christmas Eve I thought Angelina might feel differently He looked at his watch Nearly half past nine he muttered I may as well go home She said she wanted to be let alone that Christmas meant nothing to her I don t dare to call on my only sister I suppose she is there all alone and here I am all alone too What a pity If I saw the least sign Just then there was the spark of a match against the darkness framed in by the window opposite A hand and arm shone in the flicker of light across the upper sash A tiny spark tremulous at first like a bird alighting on a frail branch paused steadied and became fixed In the light of a small taper the man caught a glimpse of a pale long face in a frame of silver hair It faded into the background But above the candle he now saw with arms outstretched as it seemed toward himself a pink little angel with gauzy wings The man s heart gave a leap Sudden memories thronged his brain making him almost dizzy At last they formulated into one smothered cry The Christmas Angel It is the very same pink Angel that Angelina and I used to hang on our Christmas tree In three great leaps like a schoolboy he crossed the street and ran up the steps of Number eighty seven The Christmas Angel seemed to smile with ineffable sweetness as he gave the bell a vigorous pull CHAPTER XIV TOM Miss Terry was leaning on the mantel shelf looking into the fire when the bell pealed furiously She started and turned pale Lord a mercy ejaculated Norah who was still admiring the effect of the window decoration What s that Who can be calling here to night making such a noise Go to the door Norah said Miss Terry with a strange note in her voice It may be some one to see me It is not too late Yes m said Norah obedient but bewildered Presently the library door opened and a figure strode in a tall broad shouldered man in a fur overcoat For a moment he stood just inside the door hesitating Miss Terry took two steps forward from the fire place Tom she said faintly You came after all After all Angelina he said Yes because I saw that he waved his hand toward the window That gave me courage to come in It is our Christmas Angel I remember all about it Does it mean anything Angelina Miss Terry held out a moment longer Then she faltered forward O Tom she sobbed as she felt his brotherly strong arms about her O Tom And so he has brought you back to me and me to you He Angelina girl who He smoothed her silver hair with rough kind fingers Why the Christmas Angel our Guardian Angel Tom All these years I kept him in the play box and I was going to burn him up But I couldn t do it Tom How wonderful it is They sat down before the fire and she began to tell him the whole story But she interrupted herself to send for Norah who came to her mystified and half scandalized by the greeting which she had seen those two oldsters exchange This is my brother Tom Norah who has come back she said I believe it is not too late to make some preparation for Christmas Day The stores will still be open Run out and order things for a grand occasion Norah And O Norah a sudden remembrance came to her If you have time will you please get some toys and pretty things such as a little girl would like a little girl of about ten with my complexion I mean with yellow hair and blue eyes We may have a little guest to morrow Yes m said Norah moving like one in a dream A guest exclaimed Tom And Miss Terry told him about Mary I love little girls said Tom especially little girls with yellow hair and blue eyes such as you used to have Angelina You will like Mary then said Miss Terry with a pretty pink flush of pleasure in her cheeks I shall like her if she comes amended Tom who man like received with reservations the account of a vision vouchsafed not unto him She will come said Miss Terry with her old positiveness glancing towards the window where the Christmas Angel hung Then arose the sound of singing outside the house The passing choristers had spied the quaint window now the only one in the street which remained lighted When Christ was born of Mary free In Bethlehem in that fair citye Angels sang with mirth and glee In Excelsis Gloria CHAPTER XV CHRISTMAS DAY And Mary came The brother and sister were at breakfast the happiest which either of them had known for years when there came a timid pull at the front door bell Miss Angelina laid down her knife and fork and looked across the table at Tom She has come Mary has come she said Norah if it is a little girl with a package under her arm bring her in here Yes m gasped Norah who believed she was living in a dream where everything was topsy turvy When had a child entered Miss Terry s dining room Norah disappeared and presently returned ushering in a little girl of ten with blue eyes and yellow hair Under her arm she carried a white paper package very badly wrapped Miss Terry exchanged with her brother a glance which said I told you so The child seemed bashful and afraid to speak no wonder Tom s kind heart yearned to her Good morning Wish you a merry Christmas Mary he said smiling The child gave a start Why how did you know my name she cried Tom looked confused How indeed did he know But Miss Angelina with a readiness that surprised herself came to his rescue We were talking of a little girl named Mary she said And you look just like her What did you come for dear The little girl hung her head and turned crimson I I came to see Angelina Terry she whispered I I ve got a doll that belongs to her There was a pause then Miss Terry said Well go on I I found her on the steps of this house last night and I ought to have brought her right here then But I didn t I took her home I hope Angelina was not very unhappy last night Miss Terry smiled upon Tom who gave a kind low laugh No said Miss Terry Angelina did not worry about her lost doll She was thinking about something else the nicest Christmas present that ever anybody had But you were a good girl to bring back the doll No I m not a good girl said Mary and her voice trembled I was a wicked girl I meant to keep Miranda for myself because I thought she would be a lovely big doll And when I found she was old and homely somehow I still wanted to keep her But it was stealing and I couldn t Please will you give her to Angelina and tell her I am so sorry She took Miranda out of the wrapping and held her toward Miss Terry without looking at the doll It was as if she were afraid of being tempted once more Illustration MARY RETURNS THE DOLL Miss Terry did not take the doll I am Angelina she said The doll was mine You Angelina the child s face was full of bewilderment Mechanically she drew Miranda to her and clasped her close Yes I am Angelina and that was my doll Miranda said Miss Terry gently Thank you for returning her But Mary your name is Mary The child nodded Suppose I wanted you to keep her for me what would you say Mary s eyes still dwelt upon Miss Terry with a puzzled look This gray haired Angelina was so different from the one she had pictured She did not answer the question Miss Terry drew the child to a chair beside her Tell me all about yourself Mary she said After some coaxing and prompting from what they already guessed Mary told the story of her sad little life She was an orphan recently left to the care of her uncle and aunt who had received her grudgingly They were her sole relatives and the shame of their degraded lives was plain through the outlines of the vague picture which Mary sketched of them You do not love them Mary asked Miss Terry kindly No answered the child They always speak crossly to me When they have been drinking they beat me Tom rose from the table with a muttered word and began to pace the floor His blue eyes were full of tears Mary said Miss Terry will the people at home be worried if you do not come back to dinner Mary shook her head wonderingly No she said They will not care I am often away on holidays I go to the Museums Then I want you to stay with us to day said Miss Terry We are going to have a Christmas celebration and we need you for a guest Will you stay you and Miranda Mary looked down at the doll in her arms and up at the two kind faces bent toward her Yes she said impulsively I will stay How good you are I don t want to go home Don t go home burst out Tom Stay with us always and be our little girl Mary looked from one to the other half frightened at the new idea Miss Terry bent and pecked at her cheek with a thrill at the new sensation Yes we mean it she said and her voice was almost sweet We believe that the Christmas Angel has brought you to us Mary You have the Christmas name But you seem to us like the little girl we both knew best little Angelina with blue eyes and yellow hair who was Miranda s mother Will you stay with us Mary Angelina Would you like to stay Mary looked up with a wistful smile You are so good she said again I wish I could stay But Uncle and Aunt are so I am afraid of what they might do to us all If they thought you wanted me they would not let me go I will fix Uncle and Aunt said Tom going for his coat Leave them to me I know an argument that settles uncles and aunts of that sort You need not go back to their house I promise you Mary my dear Mary gave a great sigh of relief Oh I am so glad she said It was such a wicked house And here it is so good Good Miss Terry echoed the word with a sigh Come with me Mary she said She led her little guest through the hall to the library where a great fire was blazing with sundry mysterious packages in white paper piled on the table beside it But Miss Terry did not stop at the fire place She drew Mary to the window which looked out on the sidewalk Above the lower sash Mary saw the remains of a burned out Christmas candle and over it hung a pink papier mache Angel stretching out open arms towards her This is the Christmas Angel Mary said Miss Terry He is as old as Miranda He is as old as Christmas interrupted Tom looking in from the hall When we were children Tom and I we hung him on our Christmas tree went on Miss Terry We think he brought you to us We believe he has changed the world for us has brought us peace good will and happiness He is going to be the guardian angel of our house You must love him Mary How beautiful he is said Mary reverently His face shines like the Baby s that I saw once in the Church Oh Miss Angelina He is like the Christ Child himself Call me Aunt Angelina said Miss Terry with a quick breath Aunt Angelina cried the child throwing her arms about Miss Terry s neck Tom came and put his great furry coat sleeves about them both And Uncle Tom he said Dear Uncle Tom whispered the child shyly There were tears in the eyes of all three Now we shall live happy ever after said Tom And the Christmas Angel beamed upon them End of Project Gutenberg s The Christmas Angel by Abbie Farwell Brown END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CHRISTMAS
