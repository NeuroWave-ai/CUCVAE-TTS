happened The carriage has returned without the Duchess and the men say that they thought her Grace was in it What do you mean I hardly understand myself your Grace Perhaps you would like to see Barnes Barnes was the coachman Send him up When Knowles had gone and he was alone his Grace showed signs of being slightly annoyed He looked at his watch I told her she d better be in by four She says that she s not feeling well and yet one would think that she was not aware of the fatigue entailed in having the Prince to dinner and a mob of people to follow I particularly wished her to lie down for a couple of hours Knowles ushered in not only Barnes the coachman but Moysey the footman too Both these persons seemed to be ill at ease The Duke glanced at them sharply In his voice there was a suggestion of impatience What is the matter Barnes explained as best he could If you please your Grace we waited for the Duchess outside Cane and Wilson s the drapers The Duchess came out got into the carriage and Moysey shut the door and her Grace said Home and yet when we got home she wasn t there She wasn t where Her Grace wasn t in the carriage your Grace What on earth do you mean Her Grace did get into the carriage you shut the door didn t you Barnes turned to Moysey Moysey brought his hand up to his brow in a sort of military salute he had been a soldier in the regiment in which once upon a time the Duke had been a subaltern She did The Duchess came out of the shop She seemed rather in a hurry I thought She got into the carriage and she said Home Moysey I shut the door and Barnes drove straight home We never stopped anywhere and we never noticed nothing happen on the way and yet when we got home the carriage was empty The Duke stared Do you mean to tell me that the Duchess got out of the carriage while you were driving full pelt through the streets without saying anything to you and without you noticing it The carriage was empty when we got home your Grace Was either of the doors open No your Grace You fellows have been up to some infernal mischief You have made a mess of it You never picked up the Duchess and you re trying to palm this tale off on to me to save yourselves Barnes was moved to adjuration I ll take my Bible oath your Grace that the Duchess got into the carriage outside Cane and Wilson s Moysey seconded his colleague I will swear to that your Grace She got into the carriage and I shut the door and she said Home Moysey The Duke looked as if he did not know what to make of the story and its tellers What carriage did you have Her Grace s brougham your Grace Knowles interposed The brougham was ordered because I understood that the Duchess was not feeling very well and there s rather a high wind your Grace The Duke snapped at him What has that to do with it Are you suggesting that the Duchess was more likely to jump out of a brougham while it was dashing through the streets than out of any other kind of vehicle The Duke s glance fell on the letter which Knowles had brought him when he first had entered He had placed it on his writing table Now he took it up It was addressed To His Grace The Duke of Datchet Private Very Pressing The name was written in a fine clear almost feminine hand The words in the left hand corner of the envelope were written in a different hand They were large and bold almost as though they had been painted with the end of the penholder instead of being written with the pen The envelope itself was of an unusual size and bulged out as though it contained something else besides a letter The Duke tore the envelope open As he did so something fell out of it on to the writing table It looked as though it was a lock of a woman s hair As he glanced at it the Duke seemed to be a trifle startled The Duke read the letter Your Grace will be so good as to bring five hundred pounds Lfive hundred in gold to the Piccadilly end of the Burlington Arcade within an hour of the receipt of this The Duchess of Datchet has been kidnapped An imitation duchess got into the carriage which was waiting outside Cane and Wilson s and she alighted on the road Unless your Grace does as you are requested the Duchess of Datchet s left hand little finger will be at once cut off and sent home in time to receive the Prince to dinner Other portions of her Grace will follow A lock of her Grace s hair is enclosed with this as an earnest of our good intentions Before five point thirty p m your Grace is requested to be at the Piccadilly end of the Burlington Arcade with five hundred pounds Lfive hundred in gold You will there be accosted by an individual in a white top hat and with a gardenia in his button hole You will be entirely at liberty to give him into custody or to have him followed by the police In which case the Duchess s left arm cut off at the shoulder will be sent home for dinner not to mention other extremely possible contingencies But you are advised to give the individual in question the five hundred pounds in gold because in that case the Duchess herself will be home in time to receive the Prince to dinner and with one of the best stories with which to entertain your distinguished guests they ever heard Remember not later than five point thirty unless you wish to receive her Grace s little finger The Duke stared at this amazing epistle when he had read it as though he had found it difficult to believe the evidence of his eyes He was not a demonstrative person as a rule but this little communication astonished even him He read it again Then his hands dropped to his sides and he swore He took up the lock of hair which had fallen out of the envelope Was it possible that it could be his wife s the Duchess Was it possible that a Duchess of Datchet could be kidnapped in broad daylight in the heart of London and be sent home as it were in pieces Had sacrilegious hands already been playing pranks with that great lady s hair Certainly that hair was so like her hair that the mere resemblance made his Grace s blood run cold He turned on Messrs Barnes and Moysey as though he would have liked to rend them You scoundrels He moved forward as though the intention had entered his ducal heart to knock his servants down But if that were so he did not act quite up to his intention Instead he stretched out his arm pointing at them as if he were an accusing spirit Will you swear that it was the Duchess who got into the carriage outside Cane and Wilson s Barnes began to stammer I I ll swear your Grace that I I thought The Duke stormed an interruption I don t ask what you thought I ask you will you swear it was The Duke s anger was more than Barnes could face He was silent Moysey showed a larger courage Could have sworn that it was at the time your Grace But now it seems to me that it s a rummy go A rummy go The peculiarity of the phrase did not seem to strike the Duke just then at least he echoed it as if it didn t You call it a rummy go Do you know that I am told in this letter that the woman who had entered the carriage was not the Duchess What you were thinking about or what case you will be able to make out for yourselves you know better than I but I can tell you this that in an hour you will leave my service and you may esteem yourselves fortunate if to night you are not both of you sleeping in gaol Knowles take these men to a room and lock them in it and set some one to see that they don t get out of it and come back at once You understand at once to me Knowles did not give Messrs Barnes and Moysey a chance to offer a remonstrance even if they had been disposed to do so He escorted them out of the room with a dexterity and a celerity which did him credit and in a remarkably short space of time he returned to the ducal presence He was the Duke s own servant his own particular man He was a little older than the Duke and he had been his servant almost ever since the Duke had been old enough to have a servant of his very own Probably James Knowles knew more than any living creature of the Duke s secret history as they call it in the chroniques scandaleuses of his little peculiarities of his strong points and his weak ones And in the possession of this knowledge he had borne himself in a manner which had caused the Duke to come to look upon him as a man in whom he might have confidence that confidence which a penitent has in a confessor to look upon him as a trusted and a trustworthy friend When Knowles reappeared the Duke handed him the curious epistle with which he had been favoured Read that and tell me what you think of it Knowles read it His countenance was even more of a mask than the Duke s He evinced no sign of astonishment I am inclined your Grace to think that it s a hoax A hoax I don t know what you call a hoax That is not a hoax The Duke held out the lock of hair which had fallen from the envelope I have compared it with the hair in my locket and it is the Duchess s hair May I look at it The Duke handed it to Knowles Knowles examined it closely It resembles her Grace s hair Resembles It is her hair Knowles still continued to reflect He offered a suggestion Shall I send for the police The police What s the good of sending for the police If what that letter says is true by the time I have succeeded in making a thick skulled constable understand what has happened the Duchess will be will be mutilated The Duke turned away as if the thought were frightful as indeed it was Is that all you can suggest Unless your Grace proposes taking the five hundred pounds One might almost have suspected that the words were spoken in irony But before he could answer another servant entered who also brought a letter for the Duke When his Grace s glance fell on it he uttered an exclamation The writing on the envelope was the same writing that had been on the envelope which had contained the very singular communication like it in all respects down to the broomstick end thickness of the Private and Very pressing in the corner Who brought this stormed the Duke The servant appeared to be a little startled by the violence of his Grace s manner A lady or at least your Grace she seemed to be a lady Where is she She came in a hansom your Grace She gave me that letter and said Give that to the Duke of Datchet at once without a moment s delay Then she got into the hansom again and drove away Why didn t you stop her Your Grace The man seemed surprised as though the idea of stopping chance visitors to the ducal mansion vi et armis had not until that moment entered into his philosophy The Duke continued to regard the man as if he could say a good deal if he chose Then he pointed to the door His lips said nothing but his gesture much The servant vanished Another hoax the Duke said grimly as he tore the envelope open This time the envelope contained a sheet of paper and in the sheet of paper another envelope The Duke unfolded the sheet of paper On it some words were written These The Duchess appears so particularly anxious to drop you a line that one really hasn t the heart to refuse her Her Grace s communication written amidst blinding tears you will find enclosed with this Knowles said the Duke in a voice which actually trembled Knowles hoax or no hoax I will be even with the gentleman who wrote that Handing the sheet of paper to mister Knowles his Grace turned his attention to the envelope which had been enclosed It was a small square envelope of the finest quality and it reeked with perfume The Duke s countenance assumed an added frown he had no fondness for envelopes which were scented In the centre of the envelope were the words To the Duke of Datchet written in the big bold sprawling hand which he knew so well Mabel s writing he said to himself as with shaking fingers he tore the envelope open The sheet of paper which he took out was almost as stiff as cardboard It too emitted what his Grace deemed the nauseous odours of the perfumer s shop On it was written this letter My dear Hereward For Heaven s sake do what these people require I don t know what has happened or where I am but I am nearly distracted They have already cut off some of my hair and they tell me that if you don t let them have five hundred pounds in gold by half past five they will cut off my little finger too I would sooner die than lose my little finger and I don t know what else besides By the token which I send you and which has never until now been off my breast I conjure you to help me MABEL Hereward help me When he read that letter the Duke turned white very white as white as the paper on which it was written He passed the epistle on to Knowles I suppose that also is a hoax He spoke in a tone of voice which was unpleasantly cold a coldness which mister Knowles was aware from not inconsiderable experience betokened that the Duke was white hot within mister Knowles s demeanour however betrayed no sign that he was aware of anything of the kind he being conscious that there is a certain sort of knowledge which is apt at times to be dangerous to its possessor He read the letter from beginning to end This certainly does resemble her Grace s writing You think it does resemble it do you You think that there is a certain faint and distant similarity The Duke asked these questions quietly too quietly Then all at once he thundered which mister Knowles was quite prepared for Why you idiot don t you know it is her writing mister Knowles gave way another point He was constitutionally too much of a diplomatist to concede more than a point at a time So far as appearances go I am bound to admit that I think it possible that it is her Grace s writing Then the Duke let fly at him at this perfectly innocent man But of course mister Knowles was long since inured Perhaps you would like me to send for an expert in writing Or perhaps you would prefer that I should send for half a dozen And by the time that they had sent in their reports and you had reported on their reports and they had reported on your report of their reports and some one or other of you had made up his mind the Duchess would be dead Yes sir and you d have murdered her His Grace hurled this frightful accusation at mister Knowles as if mister Knowles had been a criminal standing in the dock While the Duke had been collecting and discharging his nice derangement of epithets his fingers had been examining the interior of the envelope which had held the letter which purported to be written by his wife When his fingers reappeared he was holding something between his first finger and his thumb He glanced at this himself Then he held it out towards mister Knowles Again his voice was trembling If this letter is not from the Duchess how came that to be in the envelope mister Knowles endeavoured to see what the Duke was holding It was so minute an object that it was a little difficult to make out exactly what it was and the Duke appeared to be unwilling to let it go So his Grace explained That is the half of a sixpence which I gave to the Duchess when I asked her to be my wife You see it is pierced I pierced that hole in it myself As the Duchess says in this letter and as I have reason to know she has worn this broken sixpence from that hour to this If this letter is not hers how came this token in the envelope How came any one to know even that she carried it mister Knowles was silent He still yielded to his constitutional disrelish to commit himself At last he asked What is it that your Grace proposes to do The Duke spoke with a bitterness which almost suggested a personal animosity towards the inoffensive mister Knowles I propose with your permission to release the Duchess from the custody of my estimable correspondent I propose always with your permission to comply with his modest request and to take him his five hundred pounds in gold He paused then continued in a tone which coming from him meant volumes Afterwards I propose to cry quits with the concoctor of this pretty little hoax even if it costs me every penny I possess He shall pay more for that five hundred pounds than he supposes CHAPTER II SOUGHT The Duke of Datchet coming out of the bank lingered for a moment on the steps In one hand he carried a canvas bag which seemed well weighted On his countenance there was an expression which to a casual observer might have suggested that his Grace was not completely at his ease That casual observer happened to come strolling by It took the form of Ivor Dacre mister Dacre looked the Duke of Datchet up and down in that languid way he has He perceived the canvas bag Then he remarked possibly intending to be facetious Been robbing the bank Shall I call a cart Nobody minds what Ivor Dacre says Besides he is the Duke s own cousin Perhaps a little removed still there it is So the Duke smiled a sickly smile as if mister Dacre s delicate wit had given him a passing touch of indigestion mister Dacre noticed that the Duke looked sallow so he gave his pretty sense of humour another airing Kitchen boiler burst When I saw the Duchess just now I wondered if it had His Grace distinctly started He almost dropped the canvas bag You saw the Duchess just now Ivor When The Duke was evidently moved mister Dacre was stirred to languid curiosity I can t say I clocked it Perhaps half an hour ago perhaps a little more Half an hour ago Are you sure Where did you see her mister Dacre wondered The Duchess of Datchet could scarcely have been eloping in broad daylight Moreover she had not yet been married a year Every one knew that she and the Duke were still as fond of each other as if they were not man and wife So although the Duke for some cause or other was evidently in an odd state of agitation mister Dacre saw no reason why he should not make a clean breast of all he knew She was going like blazes in a hansom cab In a hansom cab Where Down Waterloo Place Was she alone mister Dacre reflected He glanced at the Duke out of the corners of his eyes His languid utterance became a positive drawl I rather fancy she wasn t Who was with her My dear fellow if you were to offer me the bank I couldn t tell you Was it a man mister Dacre s drawl became still more pronounced I rather fancy that it was mister Dacre expected something The Duke was so excited But he by no means expected what actually came Ivor she s been kidnapped mister Dacre did what he had never been known to do before within the memory of man he dropped his eye glass Datchet She has Some scoundrel has decoyed her away and trapped her He s already sent me a lock of her hair and he tells me that if I don t let him have five hundred pounds in gold by half past five he ll let me have her little finger mister Dacre did not know what to make of his Grace at all He was a sober man it couldn t be that mister Dacre felt really concerned I ll call a cab old man and you d better let me see you home mister Dacre half raised his stick to hail a passing hansom The Duke caught him by the arm You ass What do you mean I am telling you the simple truth My wife s been kidnapped mister Dacre s countenance was a thing to be seen and remembered Oh I hadn t heard that there was much of that sort of thing about just now They talk of poodles being kidnapped but as for duchesses You d really better let me call that cab Ivor do you want me to kick you Don t you see that to me it s a question of life and death I ve been in there to get the money His Grace motioned towards the bank I m going to take it to the scoundrel who has my darling at his mercy Let me but have her hand in mine again and he shall continue to pay for every sovereign with tears of blood until he dies Look here Datchet I don t know if you re having a joke with me or if you re not well The Duke stepped impatiently into the roadway Ivor you re a fool Can t you tell jest from earnest health from disease I m off Are you coming with me It would be as well that I should have a witness Where are you off to To the other end of the Arcade Who is the gentleman you expect to have the pleasure of meeting there How should I know The Duke took a letter from his pocket it was the letter which had just arrived The fellow is to wear a white top hat and a gardenia in his button hole What is it you have there It s the letter which brought the news look for yourself and see but for God s sake make haste His Grace glanced at his watch It s already twenty after five And do you mean to say that on the strength of a letter such as this you are going to hand over five hundred pounds to The Duke cut mister Dacre short What are five hundred pounds to me Besides you don t know all There is another letter And I have heard from Mabel But I will tell you all about it later If you are coming come Folding up the letter mister Dacre returned it to the Duke As you say what are five hundred pounds to you It s as well they are not as much to you as they are to me or I m afraid Hang it Ivor do prose afterwards The Duke hurried across the road mister Dacre hastened after him As they entered the Arcade they passed a constable mister Dacre touched his companion s arm Don t you think we d better ask our friend in blue to walk behind us His neighbourhood might be handy Nonsense The Duke stopped short Ivor this is my affair not yours If you are not content to play the part of silent witness be so good as to leave me My dear Datchet I m entirely at your service I can be every whit as insane as you I do assure you Side by side they moved rapidly down the Burlington Arcade The Duke was obviously in a state of the extremest nervous tension mister Dacre was equally obviously in a state of the most supreme enjoyment People stared as they rushed past The Duke saw nothing mister Dacre saw everything and smiled When they reached the Piccadilly end of the Arcade the Duke pulled up He looked about him mister Dacre also looked about him I see nothing of your white hatted and gardenia button holed friend said Ivor The Duke referred to his watch It s not yet half past five I m up to time mister Dacre held his stick in front of him and leaned on it He indulged himself with a beatific smile It strikes me my dear Datchet that you ve been the victim of one of the finest things in hoaxes I hope I haven t kept you waiting The voice which interrupted mister Dacre came from the rear While they were looking in front of them some one approached from behind apparently coming out of the shop which was at their backs The speaker looked a gentleman He sounded like one too Costume appearance manner were beyond reproach even beyond the criticism of two such keen critics as were these The glorious attire of a London dandy was surmounted with a beautiful white top hat In his button hole was a magnificent gardenia In age the stranger was scarcely more than a boy and a sunny faced handsome boy at that His cheeks were hairless his eyes were blue His smile was not only innocent it was bland Never was there a more conspicuous illustration of that repose which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere The Duke looked at him and glowered mister Dacre looked at him and smiled Who are you asked the Duke Ah that is the question The newcomer s refined and musical voice breathed the very soul of affability I am an individual who is so unfortunate as to be in want of five hundred pounds Are you the scoundrel who sent me that infamous letter That charming stranger never turned a hair I am the scoundrel mentioned in that infamous letter who wants to accost you at the Piccadilly end of the Burlington Arcade before half past five as witness my white hat and my gardenia Where s my wife The stranger gently swung his stick in front of him with his two hands He regarded the Duke as a merry hearted son might regard his father The thing was beautiful Her Grace will be home almost as soon as you are when you have given me the money which I perceive you have all ready for me in that scarcely elegant looking canvas bag He shrugged his shoulders quite gracefully Unfortunately in these matters one has no choice one is forced to ask for gold And suppose instead of giving you what is in this canvas bag I take you by the throat and choke the life right out of you Or suppose amended mister Dacre that you do better and commend this gentleman to the tender mercies of the first policeman we encounter The stranger turned to mister Dacre He condescended to become conscious of his presence Is this gentleman your Grace s friend Ah mister Dacre I perceive I have the honour of knowing mister Dacre although possibly I am unknown to him You were until this moment With an airy little laugh the stranger returned to the Duke He brushed an invisible speck of dust off the sleeve of his coat As has been intimated in that infamous letter his Grace is at perfect liberty to give me into custody why not Only he said it with his boyish smile if a particular communication is not received from me in certain quarters within a certain time the Duchess of Datchet s beautiful white arm will be hacked off at the shoulder You hound The Duke would have taken the stranger by the throat and have done his best to choke the life right out of him then and there if mister Dacre had not intervened Steady old man mister Dacre turned to the stranger You appear to be a pretty sort of a scoundrel The stranger gave his shoulders that almost imperceptible shrug Oh my dear Dacre I am in want of money I believe that you sometimes are in want of money too Everybody knows that nobody knows where Ivor Dacre gets his money from so the illusion must have tickled him immensely You re a cool hand he said Some men are born that way So I should imagine Men like you must be born not made Precisely as you say The stranger turned with his graceful smile to the Duke But are we not wasting precious time I can assure your Grace that in this particular matter moments are of value mister Dacre interposed before the Duke could answer If you take my strongly urged advice Datchet you will summon this constable who is now coming down the Arcade and hand over this gentleman to his keeping I do not think that you need fear that the Duchess will lose her arm or even her little finger Scoundrels of this one s kidney are most amenable to reason when they have handcuffs on their wrists The Duke plainly hesitated He would and he would not The stranger as he eyed him seemed much amused My dear Duke by all means act on mister Dacre s valuable suggestion As I said before why not It would at least be interesting to see if the Duchess does or does not lose her arm almost as interesting to you as to mister Dacre Those blackmailing kidnapping scoundrels do use such empty menaces Besides you would have the pleasure of seeing me locked up My imprisonment for life would recompense you even for the loss of her Grace s arm And five hundred pounds is such a sum to have to pay merely for a wife Why not therefore act on mister Dacre s suggestion Here comes the constable The constable referred to was advancing towards them he was not a dozen yards away Let me beckon to him I will with pleasure He took out his watch a gold chronograph repeater There are scarcely ten minutes left during which it will be possible for me to send the communication which I spoke of so that it may arrive in time As it will then be too late and the instruments are already prepared for the little operation which her Grace is eagerly anticipating it would perhaps be as well after all that you should give me into charge You would have saved your five hundred pounds and you would at any rate have something in exchange for her Grace s mutilated limb Ah here is the constable Officer The stranger spoke with such a pleasant little air of easy geniality that it was impossible to tell if he were in jest or earnest This fact impressed the Duke much more than if he had gone in for a liberal indulgence of the under the circumstances orthodox melodramatic scowling And indeed in the face of his own common sense it impressed mister Ivor Dacre too This well bred well groomed youth was just the being to realise aux bouts des ongles a modern type of the devil the type which depicts him as a perfect gentleman who keeps smiling all the time The constable whom this audacious rogue had signalled approached the little group He addressed the stranger Do you want me sir No I do not want you I think it is the Duke of Datchet The constable who knew the Duke very well by sight saluted him as he turned to receive instructions The Duke looked white even savage There was not a pleasant look in his eyes and about his lips He appeared to be endeavouring to put a great restraint upon himself There was a momentary silence mister Dacre made a movement as if to interpose The Duke caught him by the arm He spoke No constable I do not want you This person is mistaken The constable looked as if he could not quite make out how such a mistake could have arisen hesitated then with another salute he moved away The stranger was still holding his watch in his hand Only eight minutes he said The Duke seemed to experience some difficulty in giving utterance to what he had to say If I give you this five hundred pounds you you As the Duke paused as if at a loss for language which was strong enough to convey his meaning the stranger laughed Let us take the adjectives for granted Besides it is only boys who call each other names men do things If you give me the five hundred sovereigns which you have in that bag at once in five minutes it will be too late I will promise I will not swear if you do not credit my simple promise you will not believe my solemn affirmation I will promise that possibly within an hour certainly within an hour and a half the Duchess of Datchet shall return to you absolutely uninjured except of course as you are already aware with regard to a few of the hairs of her head I will promise this on the understanding that you do not yourself attempt to see where I go and that you will allow no one else to do so This with a glance at Ivor Dacre I shall know at once if I am followed If you entertain any such intentions you had better on all accounts remain in possession of your five hundred pounds The Duke eyed him very grimly I entertain no such intentions until the Duchess returns Again the stranger indulged in that musical little laugh of his Ah until the Duchess returns Of course then the bargain s at an end When you are once more in the enjoyment of her Grace s society you will be at liberty to set all the dogs in Europe at my heels I assure you I fully expect that you will do so why not The Duke raised the canvas bag My dear Duke ten thousand thanks You shall see her Grace at Datchet House pon my honour Probably within the hour Well commented Ivor Dacre when the stranger had vanished with the bag into Piccadilly and as the Duke and himself moved towards Burlington Gardens if a gentleman is to be robbed it is as well that he should have another gentleman to rob him

none	none	AND FOUND mister Dacre eyed his companion covertly as they progressed His Grace of Datchet appeared to have some fresh cause for uneasiness All at once he gave it utterance in a tone of voice which was extremely sombre Ivor do you think that scoundrel will dare to play me false I think murmured mister Dacre that he has dared to play you pretty false already I don t mean that But I mean how am I to know now that he has his money that he will still not keep Mabel in his clutches There came an echo from mister Dacre Just so how are you to know I believe that something of this sort has been done in the United States I thought that there they were content to kidnap them after they were dead I was not aware that they had as yet got quite so far as the living I believe that I have heard of something just like this Possibly they are giants over there And in that case the scoundrels when their demands were met refused to keep to the letter of their bargain and asked for more The Duke stood still He clenched his fists and swore Ivor if that villain doesn t keep his word and Mabel isn t home within the hour by I shall go mad My dear Datchet mister Dacre loved strong language as little as he loved a scene let us trust to time and a little to your white hatted and gardenia button holed friend s word of honour You should have thought of possible eventualities before you showed your confidence really Suppose instead of going mad we first of all go home A hansom stood waiting for a fare at the end of the Arcade mister Dacre had handed the Duke into it before his Grace had quite realised that the vehicle was there Tell the fellow to drive faster That was what the Duke said when the cab had started My dear Datchet the man s already driving his geegee off its legs If a bobby catches sight of him he ll take his number A moment later a murmur from the Duke I don t know if you re aware that the Prince is coming to dinner I am perfectly aware of it You take it uncommonly coolly How easy it is to bear our brother s burdens Ivor if Mabel doesn t turn up I shall feel like murder I sympathise with you Datchet with all my heart though I may observe parenthetically that I very far from realise the situation even yet Take my advice If the Duchess does not show quite so soon as we both of us desire don t make a scene just let me see what I can do Judging from the expression of his countenance the Duke was conscious of no overwhelming desire to witness an exhibition of mister Dacre s prowess When the cab reached Datchet House his Grace dashed up the steps three at a time The door flew open Has the Duchess returned Hereward A voice floated downwards from above Some one came running down the stairs It was her Grace of Datchet Mabel She actually rushed into the Duke s extended arms And he kissed her and she kissed him before the servants So you re not quite dead she cried I am almost he said She drew herself a little away from him Hereward were you seriously hurt Do you suppose that I could have been otherwise than seriously hurt My darling Was it a Pickford s van The Duke stared A Pickford s van I don t understand But come in here Come along Ivor Mabel you don t see Ivor How do you do mister Dacre Then the trio withdrew into a little ante room it was really time Even then the pair conducted themselves as if mister Dacre had been nothing and no one The Duke took the lady s two hands in his He eyed her fondly So you are uninjured with the exception of that lock of hair Where did the villain take it from The lady looked a little puzzled What lock of hair From an envelope which he took from his pocket the Duke produced a shining tress It was the lock of hair which had arrived in the first communication I will have it framed You will have what framed The Duchess glanced at what the Duke was so tenderly caressing almost as it seemed a little dubiously Whatever is it you have there It is the lock of hair which that scoundrel sent me Something in the lady s face caused him to ask a question Didn t he tell you he had sent it me Hereward Did the brute tell you that he meant to cut off your little finger A very curious look came into the lady s face She glanced at the Duke as if she all at once were half afraid of him She cast at mister Dacre what really seemed to be a look of enquiry Her voice was tremulously anxious Hereward did did the accident affect you mentally How could it not have affected me mentally Do you think that my mental organization is of steel But you look so well Of course I look well now that I have you back again Tell me darling did that hound actually threaten you with cutting off your arm If he did I shall feel half inclined to kill him yet The Duchess seemed positively to shrink from her better half s near neighbourhood Hereward was it a Pickford s van The Duke seemed puzzled Well he might be Was what a Pickford s van The lady turned to mister Dacre In her voice there was a ring of anguish mister Dacre tell me was it a Pickford s van Ivor could only imitate his relative s repetition of her inquiry I don t quite catch you was what a Pickford s van The Duchess clasped her hands in front of her What is it you are keeping from me What is it you are trying to hide I implore you to tell me the worst whatever it may be Do not keep me any longer in suspense you do not know what I already have endured mister Dacre is my husband mad One need scarcely observe that the lady s amazing appeal to mister Dacre as to her husband s sanity was received with something like surprise As the Duke continued to stare at her a dreadful fear began to loom upon his brain My darling your brain is unhinged He advanced to take her two hands again in his but to his unmistakable distress she shrank away from him Hereward don t touch me How is it that I missed you Why did you not wait until I came Wait until you came The Duke s bewilderment increased Surely if your injuries turned out after all to be slight that was all the more reason why you should have waited after sending for me like that I sent for you I The Duke s tone was grave My darling perhaps you had better come upstairs Not until we have had an explanation You must have known that I should come Why did you not wait for me after you had sent me that The Duchess held out something to the Duke He took it It was a card his own visiting card Something was written on the back of it He read aloud what was written Mabel come to me at once with bearer They tell me that they cannot take me home It looks like my own writing Looks like it It is your writing It looks like it and written with a shaky pen My dear child one s hand would shake at such a moment as that Mabel where did you get this It was brought to me in Cane and Wilson s Who brought it Who brought it Why the man you sent The man I sent A light burst upon the Duke s brain He fell back a pace It s the decoy Her Grace echoed the words The decoy The scoundrel To set a trap with such a bait My poor innocent darling did you think it came from me Tell me Mabel where did he cut off your hair Cut off my hair Her Grace put her hand up to her head as if to make sure that her hair was there Where did he take you to He took me to Draper s Buildings Draper s Buildings I have never been in the City before but he told me it was Draper s Buildings Isn t that near the Stock Exchange Near the Stock Exchange It seemed rather a curious place to which to take a kidnapped victim The man s audacity He told me that you were coming out of the Stock Exchange when a van knocked you over He said that he thought it was a Pickford s van was it a Pickford s van No it was not a Pickford s van Mabel were you in Draper s Buildings when you wrote that letter Wrote what letter Have you forgotten it already I do not believe that there is a word in it which will not be branded on my brain until I die Hereward What do you mean Surely you cannot have written me such a letter as that and then have forgotten it already He handed her the letter which had arrived in the second communication She glanced at it askance Then she took it with a little gasp Hereward if you don t mind I think I ll take a chair She took a chair Whatever whatever s this As she read the letter the varying expressions which passed across her face were in themselves a study in psychology Is it possible that you can imagine that under any conceivable circumstances I could have written such a letter as this Mabel She rose to her feet with emphasis Hereward don t say that you thought this came from me Not come from you He remembered Knowles s diplomatic reception of the epistle on its first appearance I suppose that you will say next that this is not a lock of your hair My dear child what bee have you got in your bonnet This a lock of my hair Why it s not in the least like my hair Which was certainly inaccurate As far as color was concerned it was an almost perfect match The Duke turned to mister Dacre Ivor I ve had to go through a good deal this afternoon If I have to go through much more something will crack He touched his forehead I think it s my turn to take a chair He also took a chair Not the one which the Duchess had vacated but one which faced it He stretched out his legs in front of him he thrust his hands into his trousers pockets he said in a tone which was not only gloomy but absolutely gruesome Might I ask Mabel if you have been kidnapped Kidnapped The word I used was kidnapped But I will spell it if you like Or I will get a dictionary that you may see its meaning The Duchess looked as if she was beginning to be not quite sure if she was awake or sleeping She turned to Ivor mister Dacre has the accident affected Hereward s brain The Duke took the words out of his cousin s mouth On that point my dear let me ease your mind I don t know if you are under the impression that I should be the same shape after a Pickford s van had run over me as I was before but in any case I have not been run over by a Pickford s van So far as I am concerned there has been no accident Dismiss that delusion from your mind Oh You appear surprised One might even think that you were sorry But may I now ask what you did when you arrived at Draper s Buildings Did I looked for you Indeed And when you had looked in vain what was the next item in your programme The lady shrank still further from him Hereward have you been having a jest at my expense Can you have been so cruel Tears stood in her eyes Rising the Duke laid his hand upon her arm Mabel tell me what did you do when you had looked for me in vain I looked for you upstairs and downstairs and everywhere It was quite a large place it took me ever such a time I thought that I should go distracted Nobody seemed to know anything about you or even that there had been an accident at all it was all offices I couldn t make it out in the least and the people didn t seem to be able to make me out either So when I couldn t find you anywhere I came straight home again The Duke was silent for a moment Then with funereal gravity he turned to mister Dacre He put to him this question Ivor what are you laughing at mister Dacre drew his hand across his mouth with rather a suspicious gesture My dear fellow only a smile The Duchess looked from one to the other What have you two been doing What is the joke With an air of preternatural solemnity the Duke took two letters from the breast pocket of his coat Mabel you have already seen your letter You have already seen the lock of your hair Just look at this and that He gave her the two very singular communications which had arrived in such a mysterious manner and so quickly one after the other She read them with wide open eyes Hereward Wherever did these come from The Duke was standing with his legs apart and his hands in his trousers pockets I would give I would give another five hundred pounds to know Shall I tell you madam what I have been doing I have been presenting five hundred golden sovereigns to a perfect stranger with a top hat and a gardenia in his button hole Whatever for If you have perused those documents which you have in your hand you will have some faint idea Ivor when its your funeral I ll smile Mabel Duchess of Dachet it is beginning to dawn upon the vacuum which represents my brain that I ve been the victim of one of the prettiest things in practical jokes that ever yet was planned When that fellow brought you that card at Cane and Wilson s which I need scarcely tell you never came from me some one walked out of the front entrance who was so exactly like you that both Barnes and Moysey took her for you Moysey showed her into the carriage and Barnes drove her home But when the carriage reached home it was empty Your double had got out upon the road The Duchess uttered a sound which was half a gasp half sigh Hereward Barnes and Moysey with beautiful and childlike innocence when they found that they had brought the thing home empty came straightway and told me that you had jumped out of the brougham while it had been driving full pelt through the streets While I was digesting that piece of information there came the first epistle with the lock of your hair Before I had time to digest that there came the second epistle with yours inside and as a guarantee of the authenticity of your appeal the same envelope held this The Duke handed the Duchess the half of the broken sixpence She stared at it with the most unequivocal astonishment Why it looks just like my sixpence She put her hand to her breast feeling something that was there But it isn t What wickedness It is wickedness isn t it Anyhow that seemed good enough for me so I posted off the five hundred pounds to save your arm not to dwell upon your little finger It seems incredible Its sounds incredible but unfathomable is the folly of man especially of a man who loves his wife The Duke crossed to mister Dacre I don t want Ivor to suggest anything in the way of bribery and corruption but if you could keep this matter to yourself and not mention it to your friends our white hatted and gardenia button holed acquaintance is welcome to his five hundred pounds and Mabel what on earth are you laughing at The Duchess appeared all at once to be seized with inextinguishable laughter Hereward she cried just think how that man must be laughing at you And the Duke of Datchet thought of it THE STRANGE OCCURRENCES IN CANTERSTONE JAIL CHAPTER I mister MANKELL DECLARES HIS INTENTION OF ACTING ON MAGISTERIAL ADVICE Oliver Mankell was sentenced to three months hard labour The charge was that he had obtained money by means of false pretences Not large sums but shillings half crowns and so on He had given out that he was a wizard and that he was able and willing for a consideration to predict the events of the future tell fortunes in fact The case created a large amount of local interest for some curious stories were told about the man in the town Mankell was a tall slight wiry looking fellow in the prime of life with coal black hair and olive complexion apparently of Romany extraction His bearing was self possessed courteous even yet with something in his air which might have led one to suppose that he saw what others did not the humour of the thing At one point his grave almost saturnine visage distinctly relaxed into a smile It was when Colonel Gregory the chairman of the day was passing sentence After committing him for three months hard labour the Colonel added During your sojourn within the walls of a prison you will have an opportunity of retrieving your reputation You say you are a magician During your stay in jail I would strongly advise you to prove it You lay claim to magic powers Exercise them I need scarcely point out to you how excellent a chance you will have of creating a sensation The people laughed When the great Panjandrum is even dimly suspected of an intention to be funny the people always do But on this occasion even the prisoner smiled rather an exceptional thing for as a rule it is the prisoner who sees the joke the least of all Later in the day the prisoner was conveyed to the county jail This necessitated a journey by rail with a change upon the way At the station where they changed there was a delay of twenty minutes This the prisoner and the constable in charge of him improved by adjourning to a public house hard by Here they had a glass indeed they had two and when they reached Canterstone the town on whose outskirts stood the jail they had one or perhaps it was two more It must have been two for when they reached the jail instead of the constable conveying the prisoner it was the prisoner who conveyed the constable upon his shoulder The warder who answered the knock seemed surprised at what he saw What do you want Three months hard labour The warder stared The shades of night had fallen and the lamp above the prison door did not seem to cast sufficient light upon the subject to satisfy the janitor Come inside he said Mankell entered the constable upon his shoulder Having entered he carefully placed the constable in a sitting posture on the stones with his back against the wall The policeman s helmet had tipped over his eyes he scarcely presented an imposing picture of the majesty and might of the law The warder shook him by the shoulder Here come wake up You re a pretty sort he said The constable s reply although slightly inarticulate was yet sufficiently distinct Not another drop he murmured No I shouldn t think so said the warder You ve had a pailful it seems to me already The man seemed a little puzzled He turned and looked at Mankell What do you want here Three months hard labour The man looked down and saw that the new comer had gyves upon his wrists He went to a door at one side and summoned another warder The two returned together This second official took in the situation at a glance Have you come from naming the town from which they in fact had come Mankell inclined his head This second official turned his attention to the prostrate constable Look in his pockets The janitor acted on the suggestion The order for committal was produced Are you Oliver Mankell Again Mankell inclined his head With the order in his hand the official marched him through the side door by which he had himself appeared Soon Oliver Mankell was the inmate of a cell He spent that night in the reception cells at the gate In the morning he had a bath was inducted into prison clothing and examined by the doctor He was then taken up to the main building of the prison and introduced to the governor The governor was a quiet gentlemanly man with a straggling black beard and spectacles the official to the tips of his fingers As Mankell happened to be the only fresh arrival the governor favoured him with a little speech You ve placed yourself in an uncomfortable position Mankell I hope you ll obey the rules while you re here I intend to act upon the advice tendered me by the magistrate who passed sentence The governor looked up Not only was the voice a musical voice but the words were not the sort of words generally chosen by the average prisoner What advice was that He said that I claimed to be a magician He strongly advised me to prove it during my stay in jail I intend to act upon the advice he tendered The governor looked Mankell steadily in the face The speaker s bearing conveyed no suggestion of insolent intention The governor looked down again I advise you to be careful what you do You may make your position more uncomfortable than it is already Take the man away They took the man away They introduced him to the wheel On the treadmill he passed the remainder of the morning At noon morning tasks were over and the prisoners were marched into their day cells to enjoy the meal which in prison parlance was called dinner In accordance with the ordinary routine the chaplain made his appearance in the round house to interview those prisoners who had just come in and those whose sentences would be completed on the morrow When Mankell had been asked at the gate what his religion was he had made no answer so the warder quite used to ignorance on the part of new arrivals as to all religions had entered him as a member of the Church of England As a member of the Church of England he was taken out to interview the chaplain The chaplain was a little fussy gentleman considerably past middle age Long experience of prisons and prisoners had bred in him a perhaps unconscious habit of regarding criminals as naughty boys urchins who required a judicious combination of cakes and castigation Well my lad I m sorry to see a man of your appearance here This was a remark the chaplain made to a good many of his new friends It was intended to give them the impression that at least the chaplain perceived that they were something out of the ordinary run Then he dropped his voice to a judicious whisper What s it for For telling the truth This reply seemed a little to surprise the chaplain He settled his spectacles upon his nose For telling the truth An idea seemed all at once to strike the chaplain Do you mean that you pleaded guilty The man was silent The chaplain referred to a paper he held in his hand Eh I see that here it is written false pretences Was it a stumer We have seen it mentioned somewhere that stumer is slang for a worthless cheque It was a way with the chaplain to let his charges see that he was at least acquainted with their phraseology But on this occasion there was no response The officer in charge of Mankell who possibly wanted his dinner put in his oar Telling fortunes sir Telling fortunes 
7000_83696_000024_000006	train-clean-360	Oh Dear 
7000_83696_000024_000007	train-clean-360	Oh Dear 
none	none	me How sad You see what telling fortunes brings you to There will be no difficulty in telling your fortune if you don t take care I will see you to morrow morning after chapel The chaplain turned away But his prediction proved to be as false as Mankell s were stated to have been He did not see him the next morning after chapel and that for the sufficient reason that on the following morning there was no chapel And the reasons why there was no chapel were very curious indeed unprecedented in fact Canterstone Jail was an old fashioned prison In it each prisoner had two cells one for the day and one for the night The day cells were on the ground floor those for the night were overhead At six a m a bell was rung and the warders unlocked the night cells for the occupants to go down to those beneath That was the rule That particular morning was an exception to the rule The bell was rung as usual and the warders started to unlock but there the adherence to custom ceased for the doors of the cells refused to be unlocked The night cells were hermetically sealed by oaken doors of massive thickness bolted and barred in accordance with the former idea that the security of prisoners should depend rather upon bolts and bars than upon the vigilance of the officers in charge Each door was let into a twenty four inch brick wall and secured by two ponderous bolts and an enormous lock of the most complicated workmanship These locks were kept constantly oiled When the gigantic key was inserted it turned as easily as the key of a watch that was the rule When therefore on inserting his key into the lock of the first cell Warder Slater found that it wouldn t turn at all he was rather taken aback Who s been having a game with this lock he asked Warder Puffin who was stationed at the head of the stairs to see that the prisoners passed down in order at the proper distance from each other replied to him Anything the matter with the lock Try the next Warder Slater did try the next but he found that as refractory as the first had been Perhaps you ve got the wrong key suggested Warder Puffin Got the wrong key cried Warder Slater Do you think I don t know my own keys when I see them The oddest part of it was that all the locks were the same Not only in Ward A but in Wards B C D E and F in all the wards in fact When this became known a certain sensation was created and that on both sides of the unlocked doors The prisoners were soon conscious that their guardians were unable to release them and they made a noise Nothing is so precious to the average prisoner as a grievance here was a grievance with a vengeance The chief warder was a man named Murray He was short and stout with a red face and short stubbly white hair his very appearance suggested apoplexy That suggestion was emphasised when he lost his temper capable officer though he was that was more than once in a while He was in the wheel shed awaiting the arrival of the prisoners preparatory to being told off to their various tasks when instead of the prisoners Warder Slater appeared If Murray was stout Slater was stouter He was about five feet eight and weighed at least two hundred fifty pounds He was wont to amaze those who saw him for the first time and wondered by assuring them that he had a brother who was still stouter compared to whom he was a skeleton in fact But he was stout enough He and the chief warder made a striking pair There s something the matter with the locks of the night cells sir We can t undo the doors Can t undo the doors mister Murray turned the colour of a boiled beetroot What do you mean It s very queer sir but all over the place it s the same We can t get none of the doors unlocked mister Murray started off at a good round pace Slater following hard at his heels The chief warder tried his hand himself He tried every lock in the prison not one of them vouchsafed to budge Not one that is with a single exception The exception was in Ward B No twenty seven mister Murray had tried all the other doors in the ward beginning with No one tried them all in vain But when he came to No twenty seven the lock turned with the customary ease and the door was open Within it was Oliver Mankell standing decorously at attention waiting to be let out mister Murray stared at him Hum there s nothing the matter with this lock at any rate You d better go down Oliver Mankell went downstairs he was the only man in Canterstone jail who did Well this is a pretty go exclaimed mister Murray when he had completed his round Two or three other warders had accompanied him He turned on these Someone will smart for this you see if they don t Keep those men still The din was deafening The prisoners secure of a grievance were practising step dances in their heavy shoes on the stone floors they made the narrow vaulted corridors ring Silence those men shouted mister Jarvis the second warder who was tall and thin as the chief was short and stout He might as well have shouted to the wind Those in the cells just close at hand observed the better part of valour but those a little distance off paid not the slightest heed If they were locked in the officers were locked out I must go and see the governor mister Murray pursed up his lips Keep those men still or I ll know the reason why He strode off leaving his subordinates to obey his orders if they could or if they couldn t mister Paley s house was in the centre of the jail Paley by the way was the governor s name The governor when mister Murray arrived was still in bed He came down to the chief warder in rather primitive disarray Anything the matter Murray Yes sir there s something very much the matter indeed What is it We can t get any of the doors of the night cells open You can t get what There seems to be something the matter with the locks The locks All of them Absurd Well there they are and there s the men inside of them and we can t get em out at least I ve tried my hand and I know I can t I ll come with you at once and see what you mean mister Paley was as good as his word He started off just as he was As they were going the chief warder made another remark By the way there is one cell we managed to get open I opened it myself I thought you said there was none There s that one it s that man Mankell Mankell Who is he He came in yesterday It s that magician When they reached the cells it was easy to perceive that something was wrong The warders hung about in twos and threes the noise was deafening the prisoners were keeping holiday Get me the keys and let me see what I can do It is impossible that all the locks can have been tampered with They presented mister Paley with the keys In his turn he tried every lock in the jail This was not a work of a minute or two The prison contained some three hundred night cells To visit them all necessitated not only a good deal of running up and down stairs but a good deal of actual walking for they were not only in different floors and in different blocks but the prison itself was divided into two entirely separate divisions north and south and to pass from one division to the other entailed a walk of at least a hundred yards By the time he had completed the round of the locks mister Paley had had about enough of it It was not surprising that he felt a little bewildered not one of the locks had shown any more readiness to yield to him than to the others In passing from one ward to the other he had passed the row of day cells in which was situated B twenty seven Here they found Oliver Mankell sitting in silent state awaiting the call to work The governor pulled up at the sight of him Well Mankell so there was nothing the matter with the lock of your door Mankell simply inclined his head I suppose you know nothing about the locks of the other doors Again the inclination of the head The man seemed to be habitually chary of speech What s the matter with you Are you dumb Can t you speak when you re spoken to This time Mankell extended the palms of his hands with a gesture which might mean anything or nothing The governor passed on The round finished he held a consultation with the chief warder Have you any suspicions It s queer mister Murray stroked his bristly chin It s very queer that that man Mankell s should be the only cell in the prison left untampered with Very queer indeed What are we to do We can t leave the men locked up all day It s breakfast time already I suppose the cooks haven t gone down to the cookhouse They re locked up with the rest Barnes has been up to know what he s to do Barnes was the prison cook The cooks referred to were six good behaviour men who were told off to assist him in his duties If the food were cooked I don t see how we should give it to the men That s the question mister Murray pondered We might pass it through the gas holes We should have to break the glass to do it You wouldn t find it easy It s plate glass an inch in thickness and built into the solid wall There was a pause for consideration Well this is a pretty start I ve never come across anything like it in all my days before mister Paley passed his hand through his hair He had never come across anything like it either I shall have to telegraph to the commissioners I can t do anything without their sanction The following telegram was sent Cannot get prisoners out of night cells Something the matter with locks Cannot give them any food The matter is very urgent What shall I do The following answer was received Inspector coming down The inspector came down Major William Hardinge A tall portly gentleman with a very decided manner When he saw the governor he came to the point at once What s all this stuff We can t get the prisoners out of the night cells Why There s something the matter with the locks Have you given them any food We have not been able to When were they locked up Yesterday evening at six o clock This is a very extraordinary state of things It is or I shouldn t have asked for instructions It s now three o clock in the afternoon They ve been without food for twenty one hours You ve no right to keep them without food all that time We are helpless The construction of the night cells does not permit of our introducing food into the interior when the doors are closed Have they been quiet They ve been as quiet as under the circumstance was to be expected As they were crossing towards the north division the governor spoke again We ve been able to get one man out One out of the lot How did you get him Oddly enough the lock of his cell was the only one in the prison which had not been tampered with Hum I should like to see that man His name s Mankell He only came in yesterday He s been pretending to magic powers telling fortunes and that kind of thing Only came in yesterday He s begun early Perhaps we shall have to tell him what his fortune s likely to be When they reached the wards the keys were handed to the inspector who in his turn tried his hand A couple of locksmiths had been fetched up from the town When the Major had tried two or three of the locks it was enough for him He turned to the makers of locks What s the matter with these locks Well that s exactly what we can t make out The keys go in all right but they won t turn Seems as though somebody had been having a lark with them Can t you pick them They re not easy locks to pick but we ll have a try Have a try They had a try but they tried in vain As it happened the cell on which they commenced operations was occupied by a gentleman who had had a considerable experience in picking locks experience which had ended in placing him on the other side that door He derided the locksmiths through the door Well you are a couple of keen ones What can t pick the lock Why there ain t a lock in England I couldn t pick with a bent airpin I only wish you was this side starving like I am and I was where you are it wouldn t be a lock that would keep me from giving you food This was not the sort of language Major Hardinge was accustomed to hear from the average prisoner but the Major probably felt that on this occasion the candid proficient in the art of picking locks had a certain excuse He addressed the baffled workmen If you can t pick the lock what can you do The question is what is the shortest way of getting inside that cell Get a watch saw cried the gentleman on the other side the door And when you ve got your watch saw inquired the Major Saw the whole lock right clean away Lor bless me I only wish I was where you are I d show you a thing or two It s as easy as winking Here s all us chaps a starving all for want of a little hexperience A saw ll be no good declared one of the locksmiths Neither a watch saw nor any other kind of saw How are you going to saw through those iron stanchions You ll have to burst the door in that s what it ll have to be You won t find it an easy thing to do This was from the governor Why don t you take and blow the whole place up shouted a gentleman also on the other side of the door two or three cells off Long before this all the occupants of the corridor had been lending a very attentive ear to what was going on The suggestion was received with roars of laughter The Major however preferred to act upon the workmen s advice A sledge hammer was sent for While they were awaiting its arrival something rather curious happened curious that is viewed in the light of what had gone before Warder Slater formed one of the party More for the sake of something to do than anything else he put his key into the lock of the cell which was just in front of him Giving it a gentle twist to his amazement it turned with the greatest ease and the door was open Here s a go he exclaimed Blest if this door ain t come open There was a yell of jubilation all along the corridor The prisoners seemed to be amused The official party kept silence Possibly their feelings were too deep for words Since we ve got this one open said Warder Slater suppose we try another He tried another the next the same result followed the door was opened with the greatest of ease What s the meaning of this spluttered the Major Who s been playing this tomfoolery I don t believe there s anything the matter with a lock in the place There did not seem to be just then For when the officers tried again they found no difficulty in unlocking the doors and setting the prisoners free CHAPTER II THE CHAPLAIN AS AN AUTHORITY ON WITCHCRAFT Major Hardinge remained in the jail that night He stayed in the governor s house as mister Paley s guest He expressed himself very strongly about the events of the day I ll see the thing through if it takes me a week The whole affair is incredible to me It strikes me Paley that they ve been making a fool of you The governor combed his hair with his fingers His official manner had temporarily gone He seemed depressed I assure you the doors were locked Of course the doors were locked and they used the wrong keys to open them It was a got up thing Not by the officers By whom then I don t see how the prisoners could have lent a hand I know the officers and I will answer for them every man As for the wrong keys being used I know the keys as well as any one I tried them and not a lock would yield to me But they did yield What explanation have you to give of that I wish I could explain And again the governor combed his hair I ll have an explanation to morrow you see if I don t But the Major never did On the morrow punctually at six a m an imposing procession started to unlock There were the inspector governor chief warder second warder and the warder who carried the keys I don t think we shall have much difficulty in getting the men out of their cells this time remarked the Major They did not Good good God he spluttered when they reached the corridor what what on earth s the meaning of this He had predicted rightly They would have no difficulty in getting the men out of their cells they were out already men and bedding and planks and all There was a man fast asleep in bed in front of each cell door I thought I had given instructions that a special watch was to be kept all night the Major roared So there has been answered the chief warder whose head and face and neck were purple Warder Slater here has only just gone off duty Now then Slater what s the meaning of this I don t know protested Slater whose mountain of flesh seemed quivering like jelly It s not a minute ago since I went to get my keys and they was all inside their cells when I went down Who let them out then The Major glared at him incredulity in every line of his countenance I don t know I ll swear it wasn t me I suppose they let themselves out then You men Although this short dialogue had been conducted by no means sotto voce the noise did not seem to have had the slightest effect in rousing the prisoners out of slumber Even when the Major called to them they gave no sign You men he shouted again it s no good shamming Abraham with me He stooped to shake the man who was lying on the plank at his feet Good good God The the man s not dead Dead cried the governor kneeling by the Major s side upon the stones The sleeper was very still He was a man of some forty years of age with nut brown tangled hair and beard If not a short sentence man he was still in the early stages of his term for he lay on the bare boards of the plank with the rug blanket and sheet wrapped closely round him so that they might take as far as possible the place of the coir mattress which was not there The bed was not a bed of comfort yet his sleep was sound strangely sound If he breathed at all it was so lightly as to be inaudible On his face was that dazed strained expression which we sometimes see on the faces of those who without a moment s warning have been suddenly visited by death I don t think he s dead the governor said He seems to be in some sort of trance What s the man s name Itchcock He s one of the oppickers He s got a month It was Warder Slater who gave the information The governor took the man by the shoulder and tried to rouse him out of sleep Hitchcock Hitchcock Come wake up my man It s all right he s coming to he s waking up He did wake up and that so suddenly as to take the party by surprise He sprang upright on the plank nothing on but an attenuated prison shirt and glared at the officials with looks of unmistakable surprise Holloa What s up What s the meaning of this Major Hardinge replied suspicion peeping from his eyes That is what we want to know and what we intend to know what does it mean Why aren t you in your cell The man seemed for the first time to perceive where he was Strike me lucky if I ain t outside Somebody must have took me out when I was asleep Then realising in whose presence he was I beg your pardon sir but someone s took me out The one who took you out took all the others too The Major gave a side glance at Warder Slater That intelligent officer seemed to be suffering agonies The prisoner glanced along the corridor If all the blessed lot of em ain t out too They were not only all out but they were all in the same curiously trance like sleep Each man had to be separately roused and each woke with the same startling sudden bound No one seemed more surprised to find themselves where they were than the men themselves And this was not the case in one ward only but in all the wards in the prison No wonder the officials felt bewildered by the time they had gone the round There s one thing certain remarked Warder Slater to Warder Puffin wiping the perspiration from his Warder Slater s brow if I let them out in one ward I couldn t ardly let them out in all Not to mention that I don t see how a man of my build s going to carry eight and forty men bed bedding and all out bodily and that without disturbing one of them from sleep As the official party was returning through B ward inspecting the men who were standing at attention in their day cells the officer in charge advanced to the governor One man missing sir No twenty seven sir Mankell sir The chief warder started If possible he turned a shade more purple even than before Fetch me the key of the night cells he said It was brought They went upstairs the Major the governor the chief and second warders Sure enough they found the missing man standing at attention in his night cell waiting to be let out the only man in the prison whom they had found in his place The chief warder unlocked him In silence they followed him as he went downstairs When the Major and mister Paley found themselves alone both of them seemed a little bewildered Well Major what do you think of it now It s a got up thing I ll stake my life it s a got up thing What do you mean a got up thing Some of the officers know more about it than they have chosen to say that man Slater for instance But I ll have the thing sifted to the bottom before I go I never heard of anything more audacious in the whole of my career The governor smiled but he made no comment on the Major s observation It was arranged that an inquiry should be held after chapel During chapel a fresh subject was added to the list of those which already called for prompt inquiry Probably there is no more delicate and difficult position than that of a prison chaplain If any man doubt this let him step into a prison chaplain s shoes and see He must have two faces and each face must look in an exactly opposite way The one towards authority he is an official an upholder of the law the other towards the defiers of authority he is the criminal s best friend It requires the wisest of men to do his duty so as to please both sides and he must please both sides or fail As has already been hinted mister Hewett the Chaplain of Canterstone Jail was not the wisest of men He was in the uncomfortable but not uncommon position of being disliked by both the rival houses He meant well but he was not an apt interpreter of his own meaning He blundered sometimes on the prisoners toes and sometimes on the toes of the officials Before the service began the governor thought of giving him a hint not in the course of it to touch on the events of the last two days But previous hints of the same kind had not by any means been well received and he refrained Exactly what he feared would happen happened Both the inspector and the governor were present at the service Possibly the chaplain supposed this to be an excellent opportunity of showing the sort of man he was one full of zeal At any rate before the service was over before pronouncing the benediction he came down to the altar rail in the way they knew so well The governor outwardly unruffled inwardly groaned I have something to say to you When he said this those who knew him knew exactly what was coming or they thought they did for for once in a way they were grievously wrong When the chaplain had got so far he paused It was his habit to indulge in these eloquent pauses but it was not his habit to behave as he immediately did While they were waiting for him to go on almost forecasting the words he would use a spasm seemed to go all over him and he clutched the rail and spoke And what he said was this Bust the screws and blast em The words were shouted rather than spoken In the very act of utterance he clung on to the rail as though he needed its support to enable him to stand The chapel was intensely still The men stared at him as though unable to believe their eyes and ears The chaplain was noted for his little eccentricities but it was the first time they had taken such a shape as this That s not what I meant to say The words came out with a gasp mister Hewett put his hand up to his brow That s not what I meant to say He gave a frightened glance around Suddenly his gaze became fixed and he looked intently at some object right in front of him His eyes assumed a dull and fish like stare He hung on to the rail his surpliced figure trembling as with palsy Words fell from his lips with feverish volubility What s the good of a screw I d like to know Did you ever know one what was worth his salt I never did Look at that beast Slater great fat brute what d get a man three days bread and water as soon as look at him A little bread and water d do him good Look at old Murray call a man like that chief warder I wonder what a chief fat head s like As for the governor as for the governor as for the governor The chapel was in confusion The officers rose in their seats mister Paley stood up in his pew looking whiter than he was wont to do It seemed as though the chaplain was struggling with an unseen antagonist He writhed and twisted contending as it were with something or some one which appeared to be in front of him His sentence remained unfinished All at once he collapsed and sinking into a heap lay upon the steps of the altar still Take the men out said the governor s quiet voice The men were taken out The schoolmaster was already at the chaplain s side With him were two or three of the prisoners who sang in the choir The governor and the inspector came and looked down at the senseless man Seems to be in a sort of fit the schoolmaster said Let some one go and see if the doctor has arrived Ask him to come up here at once With that the governor left the chapel the inspector going with him It s no good our staying He ll be all right I I don t feel quite well Major Hardinge looked at him shrewdly out of the corner of his eyes Does he drink Not that I am aware of I have never heard of it before I should say certainly not Is he mad No o he has his peculiarities but he certainly is not mad Is he subject to fits I have not known of his having one before When they reached the office the Major began to pace about That chaplain of yours must be stark mad If so it is a very sudden attack Did you hear what he said Very well indeed Never heard such a thing in my life Is he in the habit of using such language Hardly Perhaps we had better leave it till we hear what the doctor says Possibly there is some simple explanation I am afraid the chaplain is unwell If he isn t unwell I don t know what he is Upon my word Paley I can t congratulate you upon the figure Canterstone Jail has cut during the last few days I don t know what sort of report I shall have to make The governor winced When a few minutes afterwards the doctor entered he began upon the subject at once How is the chaplain doctor doctor Livermore gave a curious glance about him Then he shook hands with the inspector Then he sat down Taking off his hat he wiped his brow Well Anything wrong The chaplain says he is bewitched The governor looked at the inspector and the inspector looked at him Bewitched said mister Paley I told you the man was mad the inspector muttered Hush the doctor whispered Here he comes Even as he spoke the chaplain entered leaning on the chief warder s arm He advanced to the table at which the governor sat looking mister Paley steadily in the face mister Paley I have to report to you that I have been bewitched I am sorry to hear that mister Hewett He could not resist a smile Though I am afraid I do not understand exactly what you mean It is no laughing matter The chaplain s tone was cool and collected more impressive than it was used to be The man whose name I believe is Oliver Mankell has bewitched me He was the second man in the third row on my right hand side in chapel I could make out that his number was B twenty seven He cast on me a spell There was silence Even the inspector felt that it was a delicate matter to accuse the chaplain outright of lunacy An interruption came from an unexpected quarter from the chief warder It s my belief that man Mankell s been up to his games about those cells The interruption was the more remarkable because there was generally war not always passive between the chief warder and the chaplain Every one looked at mister Murray What is this I hear about the cells asked doctor Livermore The governor answered Yesterday the men were all locked in their night cells This morning they were all locked out that is we found them all seemingly fast asleep each man in front of his cell door They were all locked in except one man and that man was Mankell and he was the only man who was not locked out Thus the chief warder And do you suggest said the doctor that he had a finger in the pie It s my belief he did it all Directly I set eyes upon the man I knew there was something about him I couldn t quite make out He did it all Have you heard sir how he came to the gate mister Murray was in general a reticent man It was not his way to express decided opinions in the presence of authorities or indeed of any one else mister Paley who knew his man eyed him with curiosity What was there odd about that Why instead of the constable bringing him it was him who brought the constable When they opened the gate there was him with the policeman over his shoulder In spite of mister Murray s evident earnestness there were some of his hearers who were unable to repress a smile Do you mean that the constable was drunk That s the queer part of it It was John Mitchell I ve known him for two and twenty years I never knew him have a glass too much before I saw him soon afterwards he was all right then He said he had only had three half pints He was quite himself till he got near the gate when all of a sudden he went queer all over Possibly the ale was drugged suggested the doctor I don t know nothing about that but I do know that the same hand that played that trick was the same hand that played the tricks with the cells Consider a moment what you are saying Murray How are three hundred locks to be tampered with in the middle of the night by a man who is himself a prisoner One moment But even that is nothing compared to the feat of carrying three hundred men fast asleep in bed bed and all through three hundred closed doors under the very noses of the officers on guard think of doing all that singlehanded It was witchcraft When the chief warder said this Major Hardinge exploded Witchcraft The idea of the chief warder of an English prison talking about witchcraft at this time of day It s quite time you were superannuated sir The man Mankell certainly bewitched me Bewitched you As the Major faced the chaplain he seemed to find it difficult to restrain his feelings May I ask what sort of idea you mean to convey by saying he bewitched you I will explain so far as I am able The chaplain paused to collect his thoughts All eyes were fixed upon him I intended to say something to the men touching the events of yesterday and this morning As I came down to the altar rail I was conscious of a curious sensation as though I was being fascinated by a terrible gaze which was burning into my brain I managed to pronounce the first few words Involuntarily looking round I met the eyes of the man Mankell The instant I did so I was conscious that something had passed from him to me something that made my tongue utter the words you heard Struggling with all my might I momentarily regained the exercise of my own will It was only for a moment for in an instant he had mastered me again Although I continued to struggle my tongue uttered the words he bade it utter until I suppose my efforts to repel his dominion brought on a kind of fit That he laid on me a spell I am assured There was a pause when the chaplain ceased That he had made what he supposed to be a plain and simple statement of facts was evident But then the facts were remarkable ones It was the doctor who broke the silence Suppose we have the man in here so that we can put him through his facings The governor stroked his beard What are you going to say to him You can hardly charge him with witchcraft He is here because he has been pretending to magic powers The doctor started No Is that so Then I fancy we have the case in a nutshell The man is what old fashioned people used to call a mesmerist hypnotism they call it nowadays and all sorts of things But mesmerism won t explain the cells I m not so sure of that at any rate it would explain the policeman who was suddenly taken queer Let s have the man in here The whole thing is balderdash said the Major with solemnity I am surprised as a man of sane and healthy mind to hear such stuff talked in an English prison of to day At least there will be no harm in our interviewing mister Mankell Murray see that they send him here The chief warder departed to do the governor s bidding mister Paley turned to the chaplain According to you mister Hewett we are subjecting ourselves to some personal risk by bringing him here Is that so You may smile mister Paley but you may find it no laughing matter after all There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in man s philosophy You don t mean to say burst out the Major that you a man of education a clergyman chaplain of an English prison believe in witchcraft It is not a question of belief it is a question of fact That the man cast on me a spell I am well assured Take care that he does not do the same to you The governor smiled The doctor laughed The enormity of the suggestion kept the Major tongue tied till Mankell appeared CHAPTER III THE SINGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF THE PRISON OFFICIALS Although Mankell was ushered in by the chief warder he was in actual charge of Warder Slater The apartment into which he was shown was not that in which prisoners ordinarily interviewed the governor There a cord stretched from wall to wall divided the room nearly in half On one side stood the prisoner with the officer in charge of him on the other sat the governor Here there was no cord The room which was a small one contained a single table At one end sat mister Paley on his right sat Major Hardinge the chaplain stood at his left and just behind the Major sat doctor Livermore Mankell was told to stand at the end which faced the governor A momentary pause followed his entrance all four pairs of eyes were examining his countenance He for his part bore himself quite easily his eyes being fixed upon the governor and about the corners of his lips hovered what was certainly more than the suspicion of a smile I have sent for you mister Paley began because I wish to ask you a question You understand that I make no charge against you but do you know who has been tampering with the locks of the cells The smile was unmistakable now It lighted up his saturnine visage suggesting that here was a man who had an eye possibly almost too keen an eye for the ridiculous But he gave no answer Do you hear my question Mankell Do you know who has been tampering with the locks of the cells Mankell extended his hands with a little graceful gesture which smacked of more southern climes How shall I tell you Tell the truth sir and don t treat us to any of your high faluting This remark came from the Major not in too amiable a tone of voice But in this land it would seem that truth is a thing that wise men shun It is for telling the truth that I am here We don t want any of your insolence my man Answer the governor s question if you don t want to be severely punished Do you know who has been playing hanky panky with the cells Spirits of the air As he said this Mankell inclined his head and looked at the Major with laughter in his eyes Spirits of the air What the devil do you mean by spirits of the air Ah what do I mean To tell you that laying a stress upon the pronoun would take a year The fellow s an insolent scoundrel spluttered the Major Come Mankell that won t do struck in mister Paley Do I understand you to say that you do know something about the matter Know The man drew himself up laying the index finger of his right hand upon the table with a curiously impressive air What is there that I do not know I see You still pretend then to the possession of magic powers Pretend Mankell laughed He stretched out his hands in front of him with what seemed to be his favourite gesture and laughed in the face of the authorities Suppose you give us an example of your powers The suggestion came from the doctor The Major exploded Don t talk stuff and nonsense Give the man three days bread and water That is what he wants You do not believe in magic then Mankell turned to the Major with his laughing eyes What s it matter to you what I believe You may take my word for it that I don t believe in impudent mountebanks like you The only reply Mankell gave was to raise his hand if that might be called a reply in the way we sometimes do when we call for silence and there was silence in the room All eyes were fixed upon the prisoner He looked each in turn steadily in the face Then still serenely smiling he gently murmured If you please There still was silence but only for a moment It was broken by Warder Slater That usually decorous officer tilted his cap to the back of his head and thrust his hands into his breeches pockets hardly the regulation attitude in the presence of superiors I should blooming well like to know what this means Ere have I been in this ere jail eleven years and I ve never been accused before of letting men out of their night cells let alone their beds and bedding and I don t like it so I tell you straight The chief warder turned with automatic suddenness towards the unexpectedly and unusually plain spoken officer Slater you re a fool I m not the only one in the place There s more fools here besides me and some of them bigger ones as well While these compliments were being exchanged the higher officials sat mutely looking on When the chief warder seemed at a loss for an answer the chaplain volunteered a remark He addressed himself to Warder Slater It s my opinion that the governor s a bigger fool than you are and that the inspector s a still bigger fool than he is And it s my belief mister Hewett observed the doctor that you re the biggest fool of all It would serve him right remarked the governor quietly if somebody were to knock him down Knock him down I should think it would and kick him too As he said this the Major glared at the chaplain with threatening eyes There was silence again broken by Warder Slater taking off his cap and then his tunic which he folded up carefully and placed upon the floor and turning his shirt sleeves up above his elbows revealing as he did so a pair of really gigantic arms If any man says I let them men out of the cells I m ready to fight that man either for a gallon of beer or nothing I don t care if it s the inspector or who it is I suspect declared the chaplain that the inspector s too great a coward to take you on but if he does I m willing to back Slater for half a crown I am even prepared to second him Putting his hands under his coat tails the chaplain looked up at the ceiling with a resolute air If you do fight Slater Hardinge I should certainly commence by giving the chaplain a punch in the eye So saying the governor leaned back in his chair and began drumming on the table with the tips of his fingers The doctor rose from his seat He gave the inspector a hearty slap on the back Give him beans he cried You ought to be able to knock an over fed animal like Slater into the middle of next week before he s counted five I ve no quarrel with Slater the inspector growled and I ve no intention of fighting him but as the chaplain seems to be so anxious for a row I ll fight him with the greatest pleasure If there s goin to be any fighting interposed the chief warder don t you think I d better get a couple of sponges and a pail of water I don t know about the sponges said the governor I don t fancy you will find any just at hand But you might get a pail of water I think The chief warder left the room I m not a fighting man the chaplain announced and in any case I should decline to soil my hands by touching such an ill mannered ruffian as Major Hardinge I say exclaimed the doctor Hardinge you re not going to stand that The Major sprang from his seat tore off his coat and flung it on to the ground with considerably less care than Warder Slater had done He strode up to the chaplain Beg my pardon or take a licking The Major clenched his fists He assumed an attitude which if not exactly reminiscent of the pets of the fancy was at least intended to be pugilistic The chaplain did not flinch You dare to lay a finger on me you bullying blackguard The Major did dare He struck out if not with considerable science at any rate with considerable execution The chaplain went down like a log At that moment the chief warder entered the room He had a pail of water in his hand For some reason which was not altogether plain he threw its contents upon the chaplain as he lay upon the floor While these considering the persons engaged somewhat irregular proceedings had been taking place Mankell remained motionless his hand upraised still with that smile upon his face Now he lowered his hand Thank you very much he said There was silence again a tolerably prolonged silence While it lasted a change seemed to be passing over the chief actors in the scene They seemed to be awaking with more or less rapidity to the fact that a certain incongruity characterised their actions and their language There stood Warder Slater apparently surprised and overwhelmed at the discovery that his hat and coat were off and his shirtsleeves tucked up above his elbows The chief warder with the empty pail in his hand presented a really ludicrous picture of amazement He seemed quite unable to realise the fact that he had thrown the contents over the chaplain The inspector s surprise appeared to be no less on finding that in his pugilistic ardour he had torn off his coat and knocked the chaplain down The doctor supporting him in the rear seemed to be taken a little aback The governor smoothing his hair with his hand seemed to be in a hopeless mist It was the chaplain who rose from the floor with his handkerchief to his nose who brought it home to them that the scene which had just transpired had not been the grotesque imaginings of some waking dream I call you to witness that Major Hardinge has struck me to the ground and the chief warder has thrown on me a pail of water What conduct may be expected from ignorant criminals when such is the behaviour of those who are in charge of them must be left for others to judge They looked at one another Their feelings were momentarily too deep for words I think suggested the governor with quavering intonation I think that this man had better be taken away Warder Slater picked up his hat and coat and left the room Mankell walking quietly beside him mister Murray followed after seeming particularly anxious to conceal the presence of the pail mister Hewett still stanching the blood which flowed from his nose fixed his eyes on the inspector Major Hardinge if twenty four hours after this you are still an Inspector of Prisons all England shall ring with your shame Behind bureaucracy above it is the English press The chaplain moved towards the door On the threshold he paused As for the chief warder I shall commence by indicting him for assault He took another step and paused again Nor shall I forget that the governor aided and abetted the inspector and that the doctor egged him on Then the chaplain disappeared His disappearance was followed by what might be described as an abject silence The governor eyed his colleagues furtively At last he stammered out a question Well Major what do you think of this The Major sank into a chair expressing his thoughts by a gasp mister Paley turned his attention to the doctor What do you say doctor I say I say nothing I suppose murmured the Major in what seemed to be the ghost of his natural voice that I did knock him down The doctor seemed to have something to say on that point at any rate Knock him down I should think you did Like a log of wood The Major glanced at the governor mister Paley shook his head The Major groaned The governor began to be a little agitated Something must be done It is out of the question that such a scandal should be allowed to go out into the world I do not hesitate to say that if the chaplain sends in to the commissioners the report which he threatens to send the situation will be to the last degree unpleasant for all of us The point is observed the doctor are we collectively and individually subject to periodical attacks of temporary insanity Speaking for myself I should say certainly not doctor Livermore turned on the governor Then perhaps you will suggest a hypothesis which will reasonably account for what has just occurred The governor was silent Unless you are prepared to seek for a cause in the regions of phenomena Supposing murmured the Major there is such a thing as witchcraft after all We should have the Psychical Research Society down on us if we had nobody else if we appended our names to a confession of faith The doctor thrust his thumbs into his waistcoat arm holes And I should lose every patient I have There was a tapping at the door In response to the governor s invitation the chief warder entered In general there was in mister Murray s bearing a not distant suggestion of an inflated bantam cock or pouter pigeon It was curious to observe how anything in the shape of inflation was absent now He touched his hat to the governor his honest rubicund somewhat pugnacious face eloquent of the weight that was on his mind Excuse me sir I said he was a witch Your saying that he was a witch or wizard remarked the governor dryly will not I fear be sufficient excuse in the eyes of the commissioners for your throwing a pail of water over the chaplain But a man s not answerable for what he does when he s bewitched persisted the chief warder with characteristic sturdiness It is exactly that reflection which has constrained me to return They looked up There was the chaplain standing in the doorway still with his handkerchief to his nose mister Murray you threw a pail of water over me If you assert that you did it under the influence of witchcraft I who have myself been under a spell am willing to excuse you mister Hewett sir you yourself know I was bewitched I do as I believe it of myself Murray give me your hand The chaplain and the chief warder solemnly shook hands There is an end of the matter as it concerns us two Major Hardinge do I understand you to assert that you too were under the influence of witchcraft This was rather a delicate inquiry to address to the Major Apparently the Major seemed to find it so I don t know about witchcraft he growled but I am prepared to take my oath in any court in England that I had no more intention of striking you than I had of striking the moon That is sufficient Major Hardinge I forgive you from my heart Perhaps you too will take my hand The Major took it rather awkwardly much more awkwardly than the chief warder had done When the chaplain relinquished it he turned aside and picking up his coat began to put it on scarcely with that air of dignity which is proper to a prison inspector I presume continued mister Hewett that we all allow that what has occurred has been owing to the malign influence of the man Oliver Mankell There was silence Apparently they did not all allow it even yet it was a pill to swallow Hypnotism muttered the doctor half aside Hypnotism I believe that the word simply expresses some sort of mesmeric power hardly a sufficient explanation in the present case I would suggest Major Hardinge interposed the governor all theorising aside that the man be transferred to another prison at the earliest possible moment He shall be transferred to morrow affirmed the Major If there is anything in mister Hewett s suggestion the fellow shall have a chance to prove it in some other jail Oh good Lord Don t He s killing me Help p Hardinge exclaimed the doctor what s the matter now There seemed to be something the matter The Major had been delivering himself in his most pompously official manner Suddenly he put his hands to the pit of his stomach and began to cry out as if in an ecstacy of pain his official manner altogether gone He ll murder me I know he will Murder you Who Mankell Oddly enough I too was conscious of a very curious sensation As he said this the governor wiped the cold dew of perspiration from his brow He seemed unnaturally white As he adjusted his spectacles there was an odd tremulous appearance about his eyes It was because you spoke of transferring him to some other jail The chaplain s tone was solemn He dislikes the idea of being trifled with The Major resented the suggestion Trifled with He seems uncommonly fond of trifling with other people Confound the man Oh h The Major sprang from the floor with an exclamation which amounted to a positive yell They looked each other in the face Each man seemed a little paler than his wont Something must be done the governor gasped The chaplain made a proposition I propose that we summon him into our presence and inquire of him what he wishes us to do The proposition was not received with acclamation They probably felt that a certain amount of complication might be expected to ensue if such inquiries began to be addressed to prisoners I think I ll go my rounds observed the doctor This matter scarcely concerns me I wish you gentlemen well out of it He reached out his hand to take his hat which he had placed upon a chair As he did so the hat disappeared and a small brown terrier dog appeared in its place The dog barked viciously at the outstretched hand The doctor started back just in time to escape its teeth The dog disappeared there was the hat again The appearance was but momentary but it was none the less suggestive on that account The doctor seemed particularly affected We must have all been drinking if we are taking to seeing things he cried I think suggested the chaplain almost in a whisper that we had better inquire what it is he wishes us to do There was silence We we have all clear consciences There there is no reason why we should be afraid We re we re not afraid gasped the governor I I don t think you are entitled to infer such a thing The Major stammeringly supported him Of of course we we re not afraid The the idea is preposterously absurd Still said the doctor a man doesn t care to have hanky panky tricks played with his top hat There was a pause of considerable duration It was again broken by the chaplain Don t you think mister Paley that we had better send for this man Apparently mister Paley did Murray he said go and see that he is sent here mister Murray went not too willingly still he went CHAPTER IV THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE OFFICIALS OF CANTERSTONE JAIL PRESENTED mister MANKELL 
7009-83683-0000	train-other-500	WITH A TESTIMONIAL Oliver Mankell was again in the charge of Warder Slater Warder Slater looked very queer indeed he actually seemed to have lost in bulk
7009-83683-0001	train-other-500	The same phenomenon was observable in the chief warder who followed close upon the prisoner s heels Mankell seemed as ever completely at his ease
7009-83683-0002	train-other-500	There was again a suspicion of a smile in his eyes and about the corners of his lips His bearing was in striking contrast to that of the officials His self possession in the presence of their evident uneasiness
7009-83683-0003	train-other-500	gave him the appearance in a sense of being a giant among pigmies yet the Major at least was in every way a bigger man than he was There was silence as he entered
7009-83683-0004	train-other-500	a continuation of that silence which had prevailed until he came The governor fumbled with a paper knife which was in front of him The inspector leaning forward in his chair
7009-83683-0005	train-other-500	seemed engrossed by his boots The doctor kept glancing perhaps unconsciously at his hat The chaplain though conspicuously uneasy
none	none	 seemed to have his wits about him most 
7009-83683-0006	train-other-500	It was he who temporarily usurping the governor s functions addressed the prisoner Your name is Oliver Mankell The prisoner merely smiled
none	none	 You are sentenced to 
7009-83683-0007	train-other-500	three months hard labour The prisoner smiled again For for pretending to tell fortunes The smile became more pronounced The chaplain cleared his throat Oliver Mankell I am a clergyman
7009-83683-0008	train-other-500	I know that there are such things as good and evil I know that for causes which are hidden from me the Almighty may permit evil to take visible shape and walk abroad upon the earth
7009-83683-0009	train-other-500	but I also know that though evil may destroy my body
none	none	 it cannot destroy my soul 
7009-83683-0010	train-other-500	The chaplain pulled up His words and manner though evidently sincere were not particularly impressive While they evidently had the effect of increasing his colleagues uneasiness they only had the effect of enlarging the prisoner s smile
7009-83683-0011	train-other-500	When he was about to continue the governor interposed I think mister Hewett if you will permit me Mankell I am not a clergyman The prisoner s smile almost degenerated into a grin
7009-83683-0012	train-other-500	I have sent for you for the second time this morning to ask you frankly if you have any reason to complain of your treatment here The prisoner stretched out his hands with his familiar gesture Have you any
7009-83683-0013	train-other-500	complaint to make Is there anything within the range of the prison rules you would wish me to do for you Again the hands went out Then tell me quite candidly what is the cause of your behaviour
7009-83683-0014	train-other-500	When the governor ceased the prisoner seemed to be considering what answer he should make Then inclining his head with that almost saturnine grace if one may coin a phrase
none	none	 which seemed to accompany every movement he made Sir what have I done he asked Eh eh we we won t dwell upon that The question is What did you do it for It is perhaps within your recollection sir that I have my reputation to redeem my character to reinstate 
7009-83683-0015	train-other-500	Your character What do you mean In the first interview with which you favoured me I ventured to observe that it would be my endeavour during my sojourn within these walls to act upon the advice
7009-83683-0016	train-other-500	the magistrate tendered me What
none	none	 the governor rather faltered 
7009-83683-0017	train-other-500	what advice was that He said I claimed to be a magician He advised me for my character s sake to prove it during my sojourn here I see And
none	none	 and you re trying to prove it for your character s sake 
7009-83683-0018	train-other-500	For my character s sake I am but beginning you perceive Oh you re but beginning You call this but beginning do you May I ask if you have any intention of going on
7009-83683-0019	train-other-500	Oh sir I have still nearly the whole three months in front of me Until my term expires I shall go on with gathering strength unto the end
7009-83683-0020	train-other-500	As he said this Mankell drew himself up in such a way that it almost seemed as though some inches were added to his stature You will will you Well you seem to be a pleasant kind of man
7009-83683-0021	train-other-500	The criticism seemed to have been extracted from the governor almost against his will He looked round upon his colleagues with what could only be described as a ghastly grin
none	none	 Have you any objection Mankell 
7009-83683-0022	train-other-500	to being transferred to another prison Sir the prisoner s voice rang out and his hearers started perceptibly Perhaps that was because their nerves were already so disorganised
none	none	 It is here I was sent it is here I must remain until the end 
7009-83683-0023	train-other-500	The governor took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow I am bound to tell you Mankell judging from the experiences of the last two days if this sort of thing is to continue with gathering strength
7009-83683-0024	train-other-500	the end will not be long The prisoner seemed lost in reflection The officials seemed lost in reflection too but their reflections were probably of a different kind
7009-83683-0025	train-other-500	There is one suggestion I might offer Let s have it by all means We have reached a point at which we shall be glad to receive any suggestion from you You might give me a testimonial
7009-83683-0026	train-other-500	Give you what You might give me a testimonial The governor looked at the prisoner then at his friends A testimonial Might we indeed What sort of testimonial do you allude to
7009-83683-0027	train-other-500	You might testify that I had regained my reputation redeemed my character that I had proved to your entire satisfaction that I was the magician I claimed to be
7009-83683-0028	train-other-500	The governor leaned back in his seat Your suggestion has at least the force of novelty I should like to search the registers of remarkable cases
7009-83683-0029	train-other-500	to know if such an application has ever been made to the governor of an English jail before What do you say Hardinge The Major shuffled in his chair I I think I must return to town The prisoner smiled The Major winced
7009-83683-0030	train-other-500	That that fellow s pinned me to my chair he gasped He appeared to be making futile efforts to rise from his seat You cannot return to town Dismiss the idea from your mind
7009-83683-0031	train-other-500	The Major only groaned He took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow The governor looked up from the paper knife with which he was again trifling
none	none	 Am I to understand that the testimonial is to take the shape of a voluntary offering 
7009-83683-0032	train-other-500	Oh sir Of what value is a testimonial which is not voluntary Quite so
none	none	 How do you suggest it should be worded 
7009-83683-0033	train-other-500	May I ask you for paper pens and ink The prisoner bent over the table and wrote on the paper which was handed him What he had written he passed to the governor mister Paley found inscribed
7009-83683-0034	train-other-500	in a beautifully fair round hand as clear as copperplate the following testimonial The undersigned persons present their compliments to Colonel Gregory
7009-83683-0035	train-other-500	Oliver Mankell sentenced by Colonel Gregory to three months hard labour has been in Canterstone Jail two days That short space of time has however convinced them that Colonel Gregory acted wrongly
7009-83683-0036	train-other-500	in distrusting his magic powers and so casting a stain upon his character This is to testify that he has proved to the entire satisfaction of the undersigned inspector of prisons
7009-83683-0037	train-other-500	and officials of Canterstone Jail that he is a magician of quite the highest class The signatures of all those present should be placed at the bottom observed the prisoner as the governor was reading the testimonial
7009-83683-0038	train-other-500	Apparently at a loss for words with which to comment upon the paper he had read the governor handed it to the inspector The Major shrank from taking it I I d rather not he mumbled I think you had better read it
7009-83683-0039	train-other-500	said the governor Thus urged the Major did read it Good Lord he gasped and passed it to the doctor The doctor silently having read it passed it to the chaplain I will read it aloud
7009-83683-0040	train-other-500	said mister Hewett He did so for the benefit probably of Slater and mister Murray Supposing we were to sign that document what would you propose to do with it inquired the governor
7009-83683-0041	train-other-500	I should convey it to Colonel Gregory Indeed In that case he would have as high an opinion of our characters as of yours And yourself what sort of action might we expect from you
7009-83683-0042	train-other-500	I should go The governor s jaw dropped Go Oh would you My character regained for what have I to stop Exactly What have you
none	none	 There s that point of view no doubt Well Mankell 
7009-83683-0043	train-other-500	we will think the matter over The prisoner dropped his hands to his sides looking the governor steadily in the face Sir I conceive that answer to convey a negative
7009-83683-0044	train-other-500	The proposition thus refused will not be made again It only remains for me to continue earnestly my endeavours to retrieve my character until the three months are at an end
7009-83683-0045	train-other-500	The chaplain was holding the testimonial loosely between his finger and thumb Stretching out his arm Mankell pointed at it with his hand It was immediately in flames The chaplain releasing it
7009-83683-0046	train-other-500	it was consumed to ashes before it reached the floor Returning to face the governor gain the prisoner laid his right hand palm downwards on the table
7009-83683-0047	train-other-500	Spirits of the air in whose presence I now stand I ask you if I am not justified in whatever I may do His voice was very musical
7009-83683-0048	train-other-500	His upturned eyes seemed to pierce through the ceiling to what there was beyond The room grew darker There was a rumbling in the air The ground began to shake
7009-83683-0049	train-other-500	The chaplain who was caressing the hand which had been scorched by the flames burst out with what was for him a passionate appeal
none	none	 mister Mankell you are over hasty I was about to explain that I should esteem it quite an honour to sign your testimonial So should I upon my soul I should 
7009-83683-0050	train-other-500	declared the Major There s nothing I wouldn t do to oblige you mister Mankell stammered the chief warder Same ere cried Warder Slater
none	none	 You really are too rapid in arriving at conclusions mister Mankell remarked the governor I do beg you will not suppose there was any negative intention 
7009-83683-0051	train-other-500	The darkness the rumbling and the shaking ceased as suddenly as they began The prisoner smiled Perhaps I was too hasty he confessed
7009-83683-0052	train-other-500	It is an error which can easily be rectified He raised his hand A piece of paper fluttered from the ceiling It fell upon the table It was the testimonial Your signature Major Hardinge
7009-83683-0053	train-other-500	should head the list I I I d rather somebody else signed first That would never do it is for you to lead the van You are free to leave your seat The Major left his seat
7009-83683-0054	train-other-500	apparently not rejoicing in his freedom He wrote William Hardinge in great sprawling characters Add Inspector of Prisons
7009-83683-0055	train-other-500	The Major added Inspector of Prisons with a very rueful countenance mister Paley it is your turn mister Paley took his turn with a really tolerable imitation of being both ready and willing
none	none	 Acting on the hint 
7009-83683-0056	train-other-500	which had been given the Major he added Governor of his own accord Now doctor it is you The doctor thrust his hands into his trousers pockets I ll sign if you ll tell me how it is done
7009-83683-0057	train-other-500	Tell you how it is done How what is done How you do that hanky panky of course Hanky panky The prisoner drew himself straight up
7009-83683-0058	train-other-500	Is it possible that you suspect me of hanky panky Yes sir I will show you how it s done If you wish it you shall be torn asunder where you stand
none	none	 Thank you you needn t trouble I ll sign He signed The chaplain shook his head and sighed 
7009-83683-0059	train-other-500	I always placed a literal interpretation on the twenty eighth chapter of the first book of Samuel It is singular how my faith is justified
7009-83683-0060	train-other-500	The chief warder placed his spectacles upon his nose where they seemed uneasy and made quite a business of signing And such was Warder Slater s agitation that he could scarcely sign at all
7009-83683-0061	train-other-500	But at last the testimonial was complete The prisoner smiled as he carefully folded it in two I will convey it to Colonel Gregory he said It is a gratification to me
7009-83683-0062	train-other-500	to have been able to retrieve my character in so short a space of time They watched him a little spellbound perhaps and as they watched him
none	none	 even before their eyes behold he was gone TWINS CHAPTER I THE FIRST LADY missus And Miss Danvers mister Herbert Buxton standing at the office window of the hotel glancing at the visitors book on the desk at his right saw the names among the latest arrivals They caught his eye Pontresina was stated to be the place from which they had lately come It is the Danvers for a fiver Cecil s Danvers Strolling from the office window he took a letter a frayed letter from his pocket book It was post marked Pontresina The signature was Cecil Buxton it was from his brother Dear Hubert it ran you really must get something to do Your request for what you call an advance is absurd So far from advancing you anything I shall have to cut short the allowance I have been making you I have met here a missus and Miss Danvers I have asked Miss Danvers to do me the honour to marry me She has consented When that event comes to pass which will be very shortly your allowance will recede to a vanishing point That you will get something to do is therefore the advice of your affectionate brother Cecil Buxton It would be an odd coincidence reflected Hubert if that Miss Danvers is this Miss Danvers An idea occurred to his fertile too fertile brain As the first glimmerings of the idea burst on him Hubert smiled In giving birth to Cecil and Hubert Buxton Nature had been indulging in one of her freaks They were twins born within a few seconds of each other Cecil came first Hubert came with all possible expedition immediately after Babies are proverbially alike These babies were so much alike that when they were undressed no one ever pretended to be able to tell one from the other The resemblance outlived babyhood As the years went on Cecil was always being taken for Hubert Hubert for Cecil The unfortunate part of the business was that the resemblance was merely superficial Inside they were altogether different Cecil was solid and steady while Hubert well at that particular moment he was quartered at that fashionable Bournemouth hotel without money in his pocket with which to pay his hotel bill and with nobody within reach from whom he could borrow a five pound note If he told himself this Danvers is that Danvers I might make something out of that fatal likeness after all It would not be by any means the first time he had made something out of the fatal likeness but on that in this place we need not dwell He strolled along the corridor the open letter in his hand biting his nails and thinking over things as he went As he approached the glass door which led into the grounds it opened to admit a lady At sight of him she stopped Cecil she exclaimed Hubert looked at her She was a magnificent woman planned altogether on a magnificent scale with a profusion of red gold hair and a pair of the biggest and brightest eyes Hubert with all his wide experience ever remembered to have seen It is the Danvers he inwardly decided What a oner But he was equal to the occasion He generally was more than equal He held out his hand to her with a little sudden burst You he cried The lady however did not immediately respond to his advances On the contrary she put her hands behind her back This is an unexpected pleasure I didn t expect to see you here I thought you were in Paris As a matter of fact according to the most recent advices Cecil was in Paris But of course Hubert had nothing to do with that I only arrived last night You you don t seem glad to see me It is rather I who should ask the question Are you glad to see me There was a dryness in her tone which grated on Hubert s ears This is a case in which diplomacy is required I wonder what there s been between them Aloud he remarked Can you not forget and forgive Cecil do you mean it She glanced behind her as if in sudden agitation I cannot stop now Meet me in the garden after dinner She was gone before he even had a ghost of a chance of feeling his way CHAPTER II THE SECOND LADY Cecil Where are you Here Hubert who had been leaning against the wall came out into the moonlight The lady stood on the top of the steps The moon shone full upon her It lit up the glory of her red gold hair She was clad in full evening dress Her little opera cloak which had slipped off her shoulders revealed rather than concealed her magnificent proportions Hubert eying her critically from below told himself that she was certainly a oner I am afraid I am late I hope you haven t been waiting long Nothing to speak of Just time enough to enjoy a cigar and to dream of you Cecil For shame Is it damp I have only my thin shoes on She held one out in evidence Hubert liked the look of it It is as dry as tinder just the night for lovers I really think it is She came down the steps How glorious Laying her hand upon his arm she looked into his eyes with her big ones As you say it is just the night for lovers They began to stroll She spoke It seems strange after all that has passed between us that you and I should be walking here together It does seem strange It certainly did After all the hard things you have thought and said of me There was a pause She looked down speaking softly Call me by my pet name He slightly started But he was not the sort of man to remain long at a loss As he turned to her and answered in his voice there was a ring of passionate intensity Tell me by what name to call you Call me Angel Angel My angel of love My angel of all good things Cecil Their lips met in a kiss As they did so he told himself that if she was Cecil s idea of an angel she wasn t his But she was certainly a oner He wondered if she had been christened Angel Danvers What a weapon with which to chastise a wife Cecil let us understand each other You are not trifling with me again Need you ask This time he was fairly startled I am afraid that after all which has passed between us I need You do mean to make me your wife Make you my wife Good heavens What do you suppose I mean Then you do not believe I cheated Cheated Then you do not believe that man You don t believe the lies they said of me Never for one single instant His outspoken denial seemed to take her aback Then if you didn t believe it why but never mind Cecil it would be useless to pretend to you that I have been the best of women but I swear that I will be a good wife to you until I die My own he murmured To himself he said There seems to have been a good deal more romance about this little affair of Cecil s than I supposed Her manner changed Let us talk of something else Let us talk of you Tell me of yourself my love Well said Hubert the ever ready for the moment I am in rather an awkward predicament What is it The fact is he looked her straight in the face and never turned a hair my remittances seem to have all gone wrong I am landed here with empty pockets She laughed Let me be your banker will you With pleasure I m quite rich for me I ve got a heap of money in my purse if I can only find it She found it after long seeking How much would you like twenty pounds Thank you Should I make it thirty If you could make it thirty Some bank notes changed hands He thrust them into his waistcoat pocket telling himself that that was something on account at any rate Now your remittances must make haste and come Thirty pounds is nothing to you it is a deal to me Now I am destitute She held out her purse for him to see It still contained a couple of bank notes and some gold I suppose you couldn t manage to spare the rest he said You greedy thing I can scarcely believe you are the Cecil Buxton I used to know he would never have condescended to borrow thirty pounds from me Do you know it isn t only that you are nicer but somehow even your manner and your voice seem different Do you think so They were standing under the shadow of a tree He leaned back against the tree By the way I have been remiss I ought to have inquired after your mother My mother She started I see your names are bracketed in the visitors book together Our names bracketed in the visitors book together You are dreaming I saw them there missus and Miss Danvers missus and Miss Danvers Cecil what do you mean It was his turn to stare Her manner had all at once become quite singular What do you mean Isn t your mother with you Cecil are you making fun of me Hubert felt that in some way he was putting his foot in it though he did not quite see how Nothing is further from my thoughts than to make fun of you But when I saw missus Danvers name in the visitors book Whose name When I saw missus and Miss Danvers there as large as life The lady moved a step away from him All at once she became as it were a different woman entirely I see that you are the same man after all The same mister Cecil Buxton The same cold calculating sneering cynic Only you happen to have broken out in another place I presume you have been having a little amusement at my expense on a novel plan of your own But this time my friend you have gone too far You have asked me in so many words to be your wife I dare you to deny it You have borrowed money I dare you to deny that too I am not so unprotected as you may possibly imagine I took the precaution to wire this morning for a friend You will marry me or we shall see The lady swept him a splendid curtsey and walked off He was so taken aback by the sudden change in her deportment that he made not the slightest attempt to arrest her progress He stared after her in the moonlight open eyed and open mouthed Well I ve done something though I don t know what And I ve done it somehow though I don t know how Cecil ought to be grateful to me for ridding him of her They d never have been happy together I ll stake my life on it Hallo Who s this More adventures There was a rustling behind him He turned Someone came out of the shadow of the tree It was a young girl She was clad in a plain black silk dinner dress A shawl was thrown over her shoulders He could see that she had brown hair and pleasant features She addressed to him a question which surprised him Who is that woman she asked She pointed after the rapidly retreating Angel with a gesture which was almost tragic He raised his hat I beg your pardon I don t think I have the pleasure She paid no attention to his words Who is that woman she repeated Which woman That woman Really I I think there s some mistake To his amazement she burst into a passion of tears Cecil don t speak to me like that don t don t don t Hubert stared The young lady dropped her hands from before her face She looked at him with streaming eyes Who is that woman Tell me I ve been longing for your coming thinking of all that I should say to you wishing that the minutes were but seconds and you ve been here all the time You must have come hours before you told me that your train was due What is the meaning of it all That is precisely what I should like to know I came out here that I might be alone before our meeting I heard the sound of voices and I thought that one of them was yours I could not believe it I listened I heard you talking to that woman I saw her kiss you Oh Cecil Cecil my heart is broken She tottered forward all but falling into Hubert s arms He tried to soothe her Sotto voce he told himself that Cecil had more romance in his nature than he had given him credit for His complications in the feminine line appeared to be worthy of the farces at the Palais Royal In the midst of her emotion the young lady in his arms continued to address him Why did you tell me you were coming by one train when all the time you must have meant to come by another I have your letter here From the bosom of her dress she drew an envelope Hubert made a dash at it My letter Permit me for an instant With scant ceremony he took it from her hand He glanced at the address recognising Cecil s well known writing Miss Miss Danvers Are you are you Miss Danvers The girl shrank from him Her tears were dried Her face grew white Cecil she exclaimed Forgive me if my question seems a curious one but are you Miss Danvers The girl shrank away still more Her face grew whiter She spoke so faintly her words were scarcely audible Cecil Give me back my letter if you please He handed her back her envelope Miss Danvers I entreat you But the look of scorn which was on her face brought even Hubert to a standstill As he hesitated she fixed him with her eyes He had seldom felt so uncomfortable as he did just then He seemed to feel himself growing smaller simply because of the scorn which was in her glance Good evening Mister Buxton She slightly inclined her head and was gone Hubert stared after her dumfounded When he did recover the faculty of speech he hardly knew what use to make of it Well I ve done it If she s Miss Danvers who is Angel Cecil will thank me for the treat which I m preparing for him I knew this fatal likeness would dog me to the grave Why was I born a twin He strolled slowly toward the building As he entered the hall a lady was coming along the corridor At sight of him she quickened her pace She advanced to him with outstretched hands She was a lady of perhaps forty years of age Cecil she cried But Hubert was not to be caught with salt He had had enough for the present of Cecil and of Cecil s feminine friends Ignoring her outstretched hands he slightly raised his hat Pardon me you have the advantage of me Madame The lady seemed bewildered She stared at him as if she could not believe her eyes and ears The door through which Hubert had just entered from the grounds was re opened at his back A figure glided past him It was the young girl from whom he had just parted in not too cordial a manner She went straight to the lady slipping her arm through hers Mamma mister Buxton has declined to acknowledge my acquaintance as he declined to acknowledge yours I think I can give you a sufficient reason for his doing so if you will come with me dear mother Hetty murmured the elder woman still plainly at a loss Come said the girl They went leaving Hubert to stare Well I ve gone one better That s missus Danvers I presume So I ve contrived to insult the mother and the daughter too Cecil will shower blessings on my head Who can that Angel be As he was about to follow the ladies along the corridor someone touched him on the arm Turning he saw that a stranger in a black frock coat stood at his side What were you saying to those ladies this person asked What the deuce is that to do with you And who the devil are you It has this to do with me that I am the manager of this hotel and that it is sufficiently obvious that your presence is objectionable to those ladies Moreover under existing circumstances it is objectionable to me It is a rule of this hotel that accounts are paid weekly You have been here more than three weeks and your first week s bill is yet unpaid You have made sundry promises but you have not kept them I don t wish to have any unpleasantness with you sir but I regret that I am unable to accommodate you with a bed in this hotel to night Hubert felt a trifle wild He was capable of that feeling now and then As they were advancing in one direction two gentlemen a tall and a short one were advancing towards them in the other They were coming to close quarters Hubert was conscious that the manager s outspoken observations could not be altogether inaudible to the approaching strangers So he rode as high a horse as he conveniently could As for your bill I will see it hanged first As for your insolence I will report it to your employers As for myself I shall only be too glad to go at once One of the approaching strangers the tall one suddenly standing still placed himself in front of Hubert in such a way as to bar his progress With the finger tips of his right hand he tapped him lightly on the chest Not just at once dear Buxton not just at once Not before you have said a few words to me And to me said the short man who stood beside his taller companion Hubert looked from one to the other And pray who may you be he inquired You do not know me asked the big stranger Nor me echoed the little one But it does not matter Perhaps you have a bad memory my dear Buxton The big man s manner was affable He turned to the manager You must excuse us for one moment we have just a word to say to our friend Buxton Here is our little private sitting room most convenient just a word Before Hubert had altogether realised the situation the big man had thrust his arm through his and drawn him into a sitting room which opened off the corridor from the left When they were in the big man locked the door he not only locked the door but in an ostentatious manner he pocketed the key CHAPTER III THE UNFORTUNATE RESULT OF BEING A TWIN So mister Buxton you don t know me Nor me The larger stranger stood against the door The lesser one who appeared to be acting as echo leaned against a table He began with a slightly overacted air of carelessness to roll a cigarette There was something about this little man which Hubert did not like at all He was a short wiry individual with long straight black hair hollow sallow shaven cheeks high projecting cheek bones and a pair of small black eyes which he had a trick of screwing up until only the pupils could be seen His personal attractions were not enhanced by a huge mole which occupied a conspicuous place in the middle of his left cheek But if he liked the appearance of the small man little it was not because he liked the appearance of the tall man more This was a great hulking fellow with sandy whiskers and moustache and a manner which in spite of its greasy insinuation Hubert felt was distinctly threatening Is it really possible mister Buxton that I have had the misfortune to escape your memory And me Hubert glanced from one to the other That the little man was a foreigner probably an Italian he made up his mind at once As to the nationality of the big man he was not so sure He had had dealings with some strange people in his time both at home and abroad But he could not recollect encountering either of these gentlemen before I do not remember having ever seen either of you Oh you do not remember The big man came a step nearer You do not remember that pleasant evening in that little room at Nice You do not remember slapping my face quickly exclaimed the little man suddenly slapping his own right cheek with startling vigour You do not remember accusing me of cheating you at cards You do not remember placing an insult on me on me on me All at once abandoning the process of manufacturing his cigarette the little man came and placed himself in even uncomfortable proximity to Hubert s person My friend my cheek is burning to this very hour Hubert did not like the look of things at all He was sure he had never seen these men before I understand the position exactly You are doing what people constantly are doing you are mistaking me for my brother Mistaking you for your brother I am mistaking you for your brother And me cried the little man again saluting his own cheek smartly You liar The big man s manner was insulting Hubert felt he must resent it How dare you But the sentiment died down into his boots as the big man came at him with a sudden ferocity which seemed to cause the beating of his heart to cease How dare I You dare to speak a word to me Liar I will kill you where you stand As for me remarked the short man affably I have this and this From one recess in his clothing he took a revolver From another a long glittering and business like if elegant knife All these years I have not been able to make up my mind if I will shoot you like a dog or stick you like a pig which you are Gentlemen explained Hubert with surprising mildness I assure you you are under a misapprehension The likeness between my brother and myself is so striking that our most intimate friends mistake one for the other For whom then did my sister mistake you this morning and to night A light flashed upon Hubert s brain You mean Angel You call her Angel He calls her Angel I hear observed the little man If you will allow me to explain The big man made a gesture of refusal But the little man caught him by the arm Let the liar speak he said The big man acting on his friend s advice let the that is he let Hubert speak Availing himself of the courteously offered permission Hubert did his best to make things clear I am not as I would have told you before if you would have let me I am not Cecil but Hubert Buxton The big man made another gesture Again the little man restrained him We are twins All our lives it has been difficult to tell one from the other Of recent years I understand the resemblance between us has grown even greater But the likeness is only skin deep Cecil is the elder by I believe about thirty seconds He is a rich man and I am a poor man bitterly poor The big man spoke And you dare to tell me that you have been making love to my sister under a false name Very good I have killed a man for less But I will not kill you not yet Is your handwriting as much like your brother s as you are My fist is like Cecil s So Sit down Hubert sat down Take that pen He took the pen He dipped it in the ink Write I promise to marry What s the good of my promising to marry anyone Don t I tell you that I m without a sou with which to bless myself Write my friend what I dictate I promise to marry Hubert wrote it Marian Philipson Peters And who the something is Marian Philipson Peters Marian Philipson Peters missus Philipson Peters is my sister It seemed to be a tolerably prosaic paraphrase of Angel Hubert if the expression of his features could be trusted appeared to think so And what possible advantage does your sister propose to derive from my promising either in black and white or in any other way to marry her Does the lady propose to pay my debts or to provide me with an income Attend to me my friend write what I dictate The big man laid his hand on Hubert s shoulder with an amount of pressure which might mean much or more Hubert looked up The pressure increased Write it The little man was standing on the other side of the unwilling scribe He had his revolver in one hand his knife in the other Write it he said Up went Hubert s shoulders he wrote it The big man continued his dictation Within three months after date What on earth Write Within three months after date Oh I ll write anything I ll promise to marry her within three minutes to oblige you The big man examined what Hubert had written Very like very like indeed So like Cecil Buxton s handwriting that I plainly perceive my friend that you are the prince of all the liars Now sign it He arrested Hubert s hand Sign it Cecil Buxton Hubert glanced up He dropped his pen Now I see Pick up that pen With pleasure He picked it up Sign it Cecil Buxton The big man spoke in a tone of voice which could not truthfully be described as friendly In other words commit forgery The tall man turned to the short one Eugene who is to use your revolver Is it you or I I swear to you that if this scoundrel this contemptible villain does not make all the reparation to my sister that is in his miserable power I will blow his brains out as he is sitting here The short man smiled not pleasantly Leave to me my friend that sacred duty the sacred duty of being executioner I have long had a little grudge of my own against mister Cecil Buxton I have one of those little insults to wipe out which can only be wiped out by blood I have not doubted all the time that this is mister Cecil Buxton I doubt it still less now that I have seen him write I swear to you The big man cut Hubert uncivilly short He repeated his command Sign it Cecil Buxton Hubert looked from one face to the other He was conscious painfully conscious that his was not a pleasant situation He saw murder on the short man s face He did not like the look of his revolver He held it far too carelessly That he was the sort of man who would entertain no kind of conscientious scruple against shooting him to use his own words like a dog he felt quite certain Let me say one word he pleaded The big man refused him even that grace Not one While Hubert hesitated the pen between his fingers there came a rapping at the door CHAPTER IV THE ARRIVAL OF THE OTHER TWIN The cause of that rapping at the door was this Cecil Buxton arrived by the train by which he had informed Miss Danvers by letter that he would arrive Hastily seeing his luggage on to a cab he drove off to the hotel In the hall he encountered a porter The porter greeted him in rather a singular manner scarcely as hotel porters are wont to greet arriving guests What Back again Cecil stared as under the circumstances any man would stare This won t do you know I know all about it you ve been chucked My orders is not let you into the place again My good man said Cecil fully believing that what he said was true you re drunk Just then a lady came down the staircase He recognised her recognised her well He rushed towards her Hetty he cried The lady gave a start but not the sort of start he had reason and good reason to expect She turned she looked at him with scornful eyes She drew back seeming to remove her very gown from any risk of personal contact I half expected to see you at the station Hetty what what s the matter The lady said nothing but she looked at him and she walked away her head held very high in the air Now you ve got to come out of this The porter who had followed him across the hall laid his hand upon his shoulder Cecil swung round And he not only swung round but he swung the porter off and that with a degree of vigour which possibly took that official by surprise Remove your hand he cried There was a moment s pause and during that moment s pause another lady came down the stairs The bewildered Cecil rushed to her missus Danvers has everybody gone mad What is the matter with Hetty There was no mistake about it this time The lady was so desirous that none of her garments should come into contact with Cecil that the better to draw them away from him she clutched her skirts with both her hands She spoke How dare you sir address yourself to me She turned to the porter with an air of command Desire this person to stand out of my way And she swept off Cecil staring at her like a man in a dream Well sir Cecil turned A decently attired and even gentlemanly individual was standing at his side Have you returned to pay your bill Cecil looked him up and down In his appearance he noted no signs of insanity nor of intoxication either Are you the manager of this establishment You know very well that I am Pray don t let s have any nonsense Allow me to give you my card Cecil handed him his pasteboard I left Paris last night I have been travelling all day I arrived five minutes ago in your hotel What is the meaning of the treatment which has been accorded me The manager regarded him with a smile which scarcely came within the definition of a courteous smile You are certainly a character Explain yourself Surely not much explanation is required It is only a few minutes ago since I informed you that your presence in this establishment could no longer be permitted and now you favour me with this amazing story Cecil started forward A new light came into his eyes Has anyone been staying here resembling me So much resembling you that we shall be obliged if you will pay his bill which lies unpaid on the cashier s desk Cecil gave an exclamation not of pleasure By Jove It s Hubert I see it all He has been up to some of his infernal tricks with Hetty and her mother If he has He turned upon the manager Where is he The manager hesitated Where is who You are standing here When I last saw you you were entering a private sitting room with two gentlemen who happened to have a particular desire for your society Where is this sitting room I will show you if you really don t know The manager led the way still smiling Cecil went after him As they moved along a corridor into which the manager turned they came upon a lady who was standing outside one of the sitting rooms and who not to put too fine a point on it seemed listening at the door Her back was turned towards them as they advanced It was only when they were quite close to her that she seemed to become conscious of their approach When she arrived at such a state of consciousness she sprang up she had been stooping a good deal forward before and sprang round She was in evening dress A fine tall generously proportioned woman with big bright eyes and red gold hair she was Hubert s oner Angel As her glance fell upon Cecil she gave a start a most melodramatic start so melodramatic a start that she bumped herself quite unintentionally but with considerable force against the wall You she exclaimed Cecil on his part appeared to recognise the lady You he said without any appearance of undue deference in his manner His arrival on the scene seemed to have thrown the lady into a state of really curious agitation She stood with her back against the wall staring at him as if he were a ghost She positively trembled How how did you get out she asked speaking in a sort of gasp I was never in Cecil turned to the manager It s a little complicated but I think that I begin to understand the situation He turned to the lady He pointed to the sitting room outside which she was standing Who is in there Angel did not answer Leaning forward she rapped with her knuckles against the panel of the door CHAPTER V THE TWINS CONFRONT EACH OTHER When there came that rapping at the door Hubert started back Who s that he cried The big man still retained his grasp on Hubert s shoulder He tightened it Never mind who it is Sign that paper There was a voice without Open the door Hubert slipped from the man s grasp He sprang to his feet He threw the pen from him on to the floor It s Cecil The two men looked at him He looked at them Again there was the voice without Open the door It s Cecil It s my brother Now you will see if I lied In Hubert s manner there was positively something approaching an air of triumph The associates exchanged glances The big man addressed himself again to Hubert Look here my friend you will sign that paper He moved a step forward Hubert grasped the back of a chair You touch me By George I ll smash you The big man hesitated Hubert seemed to have gained a sudden access of energy He continued to address his companions in a strain which was distinctly not pacific You couple of cowardly curs You get me into a room you lock the door you come at me the pair of you with a revolver and a knife when you know that I haven t got so much as a toothpick in my pocket Why you miserable brutes I ll smash you both Hubert brandished the chair about his head The big man still hesitated The shorter gentleman addressed this inquiry to his friend Shall I shoot him Shall I put six shots into his carcass shall I Hubert did not wait to hear the other s answer He turned to the door Cecil Cecil break down the door The brutes will murder me Break down the door These words uttered with the full force of Hubert s lungs seemed to create as was not unnatural some sensation without Several voices were heard speaking together There was a loud knocking at the door Someone said evidently not Cecil Open the door immediately I am the manager of the hotel Open at once The associates looked at each other The clamour without seemed to mean business Hubert had slipped from their control If they were not careful their friendly little interview might be disagreeably interrupted The shorter man shrugged his shoulders right up to his ears What is the use You had better open the door What is the use of playing a losing game too far Then to Hubert With you my friend I will settle some other time And I chimed in the big man playing the part of echo for once I don t care that Hubert snapped his fingers in the air for either or both of you you curs The comrades still hesitated they probably resented the alteration in the young gentleman s demeanour But the clamour at the door continued The big man doubtless perceiving that the position was becoming desperate took the key out of his pocket He unlocked the door As he did so his companion s weapons disappeared into the hidden recess of his apparel The moment the door was opened Hubert advanced Cecil so it is you Now gentlemen you will be able to see if I lied These gentlemen Cecil are friends of yours not of mine I have never seen them before to night You appear to have offended them They have been endeavouring to visit your offence on me I cannot congratulate you on your acquaintance That little scoundrel there who appears to be an Italian bravo has a knife in one pocket and a revolver in the other He would have murdered me if you had delayed your appearance on the scene Bah Again the little man s shoulders went up to his ears It was but a little game And was this a little game Hubert snatched up the paper the unsigned promise of marriage from the table on which it was lying he held it out in front of him The big man in his turn snatched it from his grasp He tore it into minute shreds While Hubert still was staring a lady advanced It was Angel So all the time you were amusing yourself at my expense You are a charming person Where are my thirty pounds Hubert was not at all embarrassed He twirled his moustache Cecil this lady appears to be a friend of yours Where are her thirty pounds Cecil stepped up to him What confounded tricks have you been up to Hubert s air of injured innocence was in its way superb Cecil this is too much too much In mistake for you I have been insulted all but murdered and all he turned to the assembled company and all upon my word of honour because I was so unfortunate as to have been born a twin A VISION OF THE NIGHT CHAPTER I ASLEEP Charlie do you believe in dreams It was in the great hall of the Pouhon spring at Spa The band was playing The motley crowd which gathers in the season at Spa to drink or not to drink the waters were talking smoking drinking coffee something stronger looking at the papers or listening to the music Among the crowd were Gerald Lovell and his friend Charles Warren At the particular moment in which mister Lovell put his question mister Warren was puffing rings of cigarette smoke into the air Ask me he said with distinct irreverence another A queer thing happened to me last night If you have any malicious intention of inflicting on me a dream young man there ll be a row I have an aunt who dreams She s a dreaming sort She s always dreaming And she tells her dreams such dreams Ye Goths At the mere mention of the word dreams the nightmare figure of my aunt rises to my mind s eye So beware But I m not sure that this was a dream Anyhow just listen If I must said mister Warren And he sighed I dreamt that a woman kissed me If I could only dream such a thing Some men have all the luck The queer thing was that it was so real I dreamt that a woman came into my room She came to my bedside She stood looking down upon me as I slept Suddenly she stooped and kissed me That same instant I awoke I felt her kiss still tingling on my lips I could have sworn that someone had just kissed me I sat up in bed and called out to know if anyone was there I got up and lit the gas and searched the room There was nothing and no one It was a dream If it was it was the most vivid dream I remember to have heard of certainly the most vivid dream I ever dreamt I saw the woman so distinctly and her face as she stooped over me with laughter in her eyes To begin with it was the most beautiful face I ever saw and hers were the most beautiful eyes The whole thing had impressed me so intensely that I took my sketch book and made a drawing of her then and there I have my sketch book in my pocket here is the drawing mister Lovell handed his open sketch book to his friend It was open at a page on which was a drawing of a woman s face When mister Warren s eyes fell on this drawing he sat up in his chair with a show of sudden interest Gerald I say You ll excuse my saying so but I didn t think you were capable of anything so good as this Do you know that this is the best drawing of yours I have ever seen young man I believe it is It looks to me I don t want to flatter you goodness knows you ve conceit enough already but it looks to me as though it were a genuine bit of inspiration Joking apart it seems to me almost as if it were an inspiration I wish an inspiration of the same kind would come to me I d be considerably grateful even for a nightmare Do you know what I should do with this I should use it for a picture I thought of doing something of the kind myself Just a study of a woman s face And you might call it the title would be apposite A Vision of the Night A good idea I will And mister Lovell did When he returned to his Chelsea studio he chose a moderate sized canvas and he began to paint on it a woman s face just a woman s face and nothing more She was looking a little downwards as a woman might look who was about to stoop to kiss someone lying asleep in bed say a sleeping child and she glanced from the canvas with laughing eyes mister Warren came in to look at it several times while it was progressing When it was finished he regarded it for some moments in silent contemplation I call that he declared sententiously with what he supposed perhaps erroneously to be a Yankee twang a general u ine work of art I do The thing Young man if you forward that with your compliments or without em to the President Fellows and Associates of the Royal Academy I ll bet you five to one it s hung His prediction was verified it was hung It was the first of mister Lovell s pictures which ever had been hung which made the fact none the less gratifying to mister Lovell It was hung very well too considering And it attracted quite a considerable amount of attention in its way It was sold on the opening day That fact was not displeasing to mister Lovell One morning about the middle of June a card was brought in to mister Lovell while he was working in his studio On it was inscribed a name Vicomte d Humieres The card was immediately followed by its owner a tall slightly built gentleman unmistakably a foreigner He saluted mister Lovell with a bow which was undoubtedly Parisian mister Gerald Lovell The accent was French but for a Frenchman the English was fair I am Gerald Lovell Ah That is good You are a gentleman mister Lovell whom I particularly wish to see The stranger had been carrying his stick in one hand and his hat in the other These he now deposited upon one chair himself he placed upon a second uninvited He crossed his legs He folded his black gloved hands in front of him I believe mister Lovell that we are not strangers you and I mister Lovell glanced at the card which he still was holding You are the Vicomte d Humieres I am I am afraid it is unpardonable remissness on my part but I am afraid that if I have ever had the pleasure of meeting you before it is a pleasure which has escaped my memory It is not that we have ever met before no it is not that It is my name to which you are not a stranger mister Lovell glanced again at the card Your name I am afraid Vicomte that I do not remember having ever heard your name before Ah Is that so The stranger regarded his polished boots He spoke as if he were addressing himself to them Is it possible that she can have given another name No it is not possible She is capable of many things I do not believe she is capable of that He looked up again at mister Lovell My business with you mister Lovell is of rather a peculiar kind You will think perhaps that mine is rather a singular errand I have come to ask you to acquaint me with the residence of my wife With the did you say with the residence of your wife That is what I said I have come to ask you to acquaint me with the residence of my wife The artist stared But so far as I am aware I do not know your wife That is absurd I do not say mister Lovell that you are conscious of the absurdity But still it is absurd I was not aware that you were acquainted with my wife until I learned the fact this morning at your Academy At our Academy Precisely Upon the walls of your Academy of Painting mister Lovell mister Lovell began to wonder if his visitor was not an amiable French lunatic Is that not rather a singular place in which to learn such a fact It is a singular place It is a very singular place indeed But that has nothing to do with the matter It is as I say You have a picture mister Lovell at the Academy I have It is a portrait Pardon me it is not a portrait Pardon me mister Lovell in my turn it is a portrait As a portrait it is a perfect portrait It is a portrait of my wife Of your wife You are dreaming You flatter me mister Lovell Is it that you suppose I am an imbecile Are not the features of a wife familiar to a husband Very good I am the husband of my wife Your picture mister Lovell is a portrait of my wife I cannot but think you have mistaken some other picture for mine Mine is a simple study of a woman s face It is called A Vision of the Night Precisely And A Vision of the Night is my wife It is impossible Do I understand you to say mister Lovell of a thing which I say is so that it is impossible The Vicomte rose His voice had a very significant intonation mister Lovell resented it I do not know Vicomte that I am called upon to explain to you But in face of your remarkable statement I will volunteer an explanation I saw the face which I have painted in a dream Indeed is that so What sort of dream was it in which you saw my wife s face mister Lovell The young man flushed The stranger s tone was distinctly offensive It was in a dream which I dreamt last August at Spa Ah This is curious At what hotel were you stopping last August at Spa At the Hotel de Flandre though I don t know why you ask So We approach a point at last Last August my wife and I we were at Spa We stayed my wife and I at the Hotel de Flandre It was at the Hotel de Flandre my wife left me I have never seen her since Perhaps mister Gerald Lovell you will be so good as to inform me what sort of dream it was in which you saw my wife s face at the Hotel de Flandre last August at Spa mister Lovell hesitated He perceived that caution was advisable He felt that if he entered into minute particulars of his dream there might be a misunderstanding with the Vicomte So he temporized or he endeavoured to I have already told you that I saw the face in my picture in a dream It is the simple fact that I have no other explanation to offer Is that so That is so Very good so far mister Gerald Lovell I thought it possible that you might have some explanation of this kind to offer I was at the Academy with a friend When I perceived my wife s portrait on the walls and that it was painted by a mister Gerald Lovell I said to my friend I will go to this mister Lovell and I will ask him among other things who authorized him to exhibit my wife s portrait in the absence of her husband in a place of public resort as if it were an advertisement My friend proposed to accompany me But I said No I will go first of all alone I will see what sort of explanation mister Gerald Lovell has to offer If it is not a satisfactory explanation then we will go together you and I I go to seek my friend mister Lovell He is not very far away Shortly we will return Then I will request of your courtesy an explanation of that very curious dream in which you saw my wife s face at the Hotel de Flandre mister Lovell I wish you until then good day The Vicomte withdrew with the same extremely courteous salutation with which he had entered The artist left alone looked at his visitor s card which he still retained in his hand with a very puzzled expression of countenance If the Vicomte d Humieres returns it strikes me there ll be a little interesting conversation He laid down the card He resumed the work which had been interrupted But the work hung fire A painter paints not only with his hand but with his brain mister Lovell s brain was just then preoccupied It was a dream And yet as I told Warren at the time it certainly was the most vivid dream I ever dreamt Deserting his canvas he began to move about the room Supposing it wasn t a dream and the woman was a creature of flesh and blood Then she must have come into my room and kissed me while I slept I ll swear that someone kissed me By Jove the Vicomte won t like to be told a tale like that As he says a man ought to know his own wife s face when he sees it even in a portrait And if the picture is a portrait of his wife then it was his wife who came into my room and kissed me But whatever made her do a thing like that There s no knowing what things some women will do I rather fancy that I ought to have made a few inquiries before I took it for granted that it was nothing but a dream They would have been able to tell me at the hotel if the original of my dream had been staying there As it is unless I mind my P s and Q s I rather fancy there ll be a row Pardon may I enter mister Lovell was standing with his back to the door The inquiry therefore was addressed to him from behind The voice in which it was uttered was feminine and the accent foreign The artist turned and stared For there peeping through the partly open door was the woman of his dream There could not be the slightest doubt about it Although the head was covered with the latest thing in Parisian hats there was no mistaking when one once had seen it as he had seen it that lovely face those laughing eyes He stared and gaped The lady seemed to take his silence to imply consent She advanced into the room You are mister Gerald Lovell As she came into the room he perceived that she was not only most divinely fair but most divinely tall Her figure clad in the most recent coquetries of Paris was the most exquisite thing in figures he had lately seen So completely had she taken his faculties of astonishment by storm that he could only stammer a response You are the painter of my portrait For the life of him he knew not what to say But if you are mister Gerald Lovell it is certain that you are Besides I see it in your face There is genius in your eyes mister Lovell how am I to thank you for the honour you have done me Moving to him she held out to him her hand He gave her his She retained it or rather part of it in her small palm If I am ever destined to attain to immortality it is to your brush it will be owing Monsieur permit me to salute the master Before he had an inkling of her intention she raised his hand and touched it with her lips He withdrew it quickly Madame She exhibited no signs of discomposure I was at your Academy with a friend not half an hour ago I beheld miles of mediocrity Suddenly I saw my face my own face glancing at me from the walls Ah quel plaisir But my face how many times more lovely How many times more beautiful My face depicted by the hand of a great artist by the brush of a poet and a genius Monsieur you have placed on me ten thousand obligations She gave him the most sweeping curtsey with which he ever had been favoured and in her eyes was laughter all the time He was recovering his presence of mind He felt that it was time to put a stop to the lady s flow of flowery language He was about to do so when a question she put to him again sent half his senses flying There is one thing which I wished to ask you Monsieur When and where did I sit to you for my portrait I do not remember to have had the pleasure and the honour of meeting you before The lady s laughing eyes were fixed intently on his face And yet as I look at you a sort of shadowy recollection comes to me of a previous encounter it is very strange Monsieur where was it we encountered you and I Madame Seeing how evidently he was at a loss for words she put out her hand to him as if to give him courage Do not be afraid Tell me where was it that you saw me I saw you in a dream A dream Monsieur To hear you speak it is like a poem Monsieur where did you dream this dream in which you dreamt of me It was last year at Spa At Spa that horrible place I did not find it a horrible place No Was it that dream which you dreamt of me which robbed it of its horror He did not speak He allowed her to infer a compliment but he did not proffer one But Monsieur I was only at Spa one afternoon and a single night It was that night I dreamed of you You dreamed How Tell me about this dream I dreamed that you came into my room while I was asleep in bed and kissed me She continued to look at him intently a moment longer as if she did not realize the full meaning of his words Then let us do her justice the blood rushed to her face her cheeks flamed fiery red With her hands she veiled her eyes She gave a little cry Ah mon Dieu It was you I remember Quelle horreur There was silence Before she removed her hands from her eyes she turned away She stood with her back towards him trifling with a brush which he had placed upon the table She spoke scarcely above a whisper Monsieur I thought you were asleep I was asleep I saw you in a dream Then did did I wake you You must have done I woke you must forgive my saying so with a kiss tingling on my lips The lady put her hands up to her eyes again The dream had been so vivid I could not understand it I got up to see if anyone was in the room If you had caught me There was no one But so acutely had your face impressed itself on my imagination that I took my sketch book and made a drawing of it then and there In the morning I showed this drawing to a friend He advised me to use it for a picture I did That picture is A Vision of the Night It is the most extraordinary thing Monsieur you will suppose I am a very peculiar person It is but a lame explanation I have to offer Of that I am but too conscious But such as it is I entreat that you will suffer me to give it you Monsieur I am married mister Lovell bowed He did not mention that he was aware of that already to the most capricious husband in the world to a husband whom I love but whom I cannot respect mister Lovell thought that that was good from her He is a man who is extremely difficile Monsieur I do not think you have a word which expresses what I would say in English He is extremely jealous he is enraged that his wife should use the eyes which are in her head The very day on which we arrived at Spa we had a dreadful quarrel I will not speak of the treatment to which I was subjected it is enough to say that he locked the door so that I should not leave the room he wished to make of me a prisoner Monsieur directly he was gone I perceived that there were two doors to the room the one which he had locked and another which I tried I found that it was open Monsieur when a prisoner desires to escape he escapes by any road which offers I was a prisoner I desired to escape I made use of the only road which I could find I entered the door I found myself in a room in which there was how shall I say it in which there was a man asleep Monsieur it was you It must be owned that at this point the lady certainly did look down I was that night in a wicked mood I glanced at you I perceived that you were but a boy mister Lovell flushed he did not consider himself a boy but a handsome boy She peeped at him with malicious laughter in her eyes I regarded myself as your mother or your sister or your guardian angel Monsieur will perceive how much I am the elder Again a glance of laughing malice from those bewitching eyes I am afraid it is too true that I approached the sleeping lips There was silence Then so softly that her listener was only able to catch the words I pray that Monsieur will forgive me There is nothing for which Madame needs forgiveness Monsieur but says so to give me pleasure But one thing Monsieur must permit me to observe If every woman were to be rewarded as I have been for what I did half the women in France would commit a similar little indiscretion mister Lovell was silent he did not know exactly what to say Monsieur will permit me to regard him from this day forward as my friend mister Gerald Lovell permit me to introduce to you the Vicomtesse d Humieres The lady favoured him with another sweeping curtsey I have already the pleasure of being acquainted with Madame s name From whom did you learn it From the people at the hotel I but learned it a few minutes before Madame herself came here So From whom I learnt it from the Vicomte d Humieres The Vicomte d Humieres My husband Are you acquainted with him then I can scarcely claim to be acquainted with the Vicomte It seems Madame that this has been a morning of coincidences It would appear that just before Madame perceived my little picture at the Academy the Vicomte d Humieres perceived it too Truly But how magnificent The lady clasped her hands in a little ecstacy The Vicomte d Humieres did not seem to consider it magnificent He took a distinctly contrary view But that is certain He requested me to furnish him with your address When I informed him that I was not acquainted with Madame he desired to know who had authorized me to send your portrait to a public exhibition I observed that I was not aware that it was the portrait of Madame since the face in the picture was but the study of a face which I had seen in a dream In a dream You did not tell him the little history I entered into no particulars I entreat you Monsieur not to tell him the little history There will be a scandal he is so quick to misconceive I will endeavour to observe Madame s wishes It is like a little romance is it not Monsieur Perhaps I should explain myself a little further That night she emphasized the that I left my husband In effect he had become unbearable I have seen and heard nothing of him since But I am beginning to become conscious of a desire to meet with him again I know not why I suppose when one loves one s husband truly one wishes to meet him once a year I do not wish our reconciliation to be inaugurated by a quarrel no I entreat you Monsieur not recount to him that little history I should inform Madame that I expect the Vicomte d Humieres to return Return Where Here When Very shortly with a friend In fact unless I am mistaken he comes already The lady listened It is Philippe s voice Mon Dieu He must not find me here But Madame Ah the screen It is like a farce at the Palais Royal is it not a fact I will be your model Monsieur behind the screen Madame Before he could interpose to prevent her the lady vanished behind the screen The door of the studio opened and the Vicomte d Humieres entered accompanied by his friend CHAPTER II AND AWAKE The Vicomte s friend was a gentleman of a figure which is not uncommon in France even to day His attitude suggested a ramrod he breathed powder and shot and he bristled what shall we say with bayonets The last person in the world with whom a modern Briton should have a serious difference of opinion The ideas of that sort of person upon matters which involve a difference of opinion are in such contrast to ours The Vicomte performed the ceremony of introduction mister Gerald Lovell permit me to introduce to your courteous consideration my friend M Victor Berigny M Berigny bowed ceremoniously mister Lovell only nodded his thoughts were behind the screen The Vicomte turned to his friend Victor I have explained to you that I have already had the pleasure of an interview with mister Gerald Lovell M Berigny bowed I have also explained to you that I have desired him to inform me by whose authority he exhibits a portrait of my wife in a public exhibition To that he has replied that his picture A Vision of the Night is not a portrait of my wife I request you Victor to state in mister Gerald Lovell s presence whether that picture in your opinion is or is not a portrait of my wife Certainly it is a portrait M Berigny s accent was more marked than the Vicomte s but still he did speak English
7000_83696_000020_000004	train-clean-360	 I thank you 
none	none	Victor It remains for me to once more request in your presence mister Gerald Lovell to explain how it was that he happened to dream of the face of my wife last August in the Hotel de Flandre at Spa mister Gerald Lovell I have the honour to await your explanation The Vicomte his arms crossed upon his chest his left foot a little protruding his head thrown back awaited the explanation mister Lovell s thoughts ran screenwards What the deuce shall I do if he discovers her behind the screen Monsieur I am waiting If he does discover her there ll be a row I still am waiting mister Gerald Lovell With each repetition of the statement the Vicomte s tone became more acidulated The artist arrived at a sudden resolution Then I am afraid Vicomte that you will have to wait The Vicomte looked at the artist with an evident inclination to add a cubit to his own stature Is it possible that I understand your meaning mister Gerald Lovell My language is sufficiently simple In France mister Gerald Lovell an artist is supposed to be a gentleman And so in England Vicomte And therefore when an artist is interrupted at his work by another gentleman he feels himself at liberty to beg that other gentleman to excuse him mister Lovell waved his hand affably in the direction of the door The Vicomte s countenance assumed a peculiar pallor You are a curious person mister Gerald Lovell His friend interposed Philippe you had better leave the matter to me M Berigny approached the painter with a ramrod down his back I have the honour Monsieur to request from you the name of a friend Of a friend What for Ah Monsieur to arrange the preliminaries What preliminaries Is it that Monsieur amuses himself Is it possible that you suppose that I am going to fight a duel Monsieur intends then to offer an explanation to my friend M Berigny I do not wish to say to you anything uncourteous or anything unworthy an English gentleman but I do beg you to believe that because you choose to be an idiot and your friend chooses to be an idiot it does not follow that I choose to be an idiot too Monsieur One other observation I have not seen much of you M Beringy but that little has not disposed me to see more May I therefore ask you to leave my studio Monsieur Or must I turn you out Turn me out The Vicomte had been listening to this little dialogue He now turned towards his friend Ah my friend it is as he says He will turn you out neck and crop as the English say He will throw you down the stairs he will heave half a brick at your head to help you on your way Then when you require satisfaction he will refer you to a magistrate You will summon him it will be in the papers he will be fined half a crown That is how they manage these affairs in England It is true But among gentlemen Ah mon ami voila In England nowadays there are no gentlemen mister Lovell moved a step towards M Berigny I have asked you as a gentleman to leave my studio Monsieur you are a coward The painter s eyes gleamed But he kept his temper pretty well considering You appear to have been taught singularly ill manners in your native country sir I will endeavour to teach you better manners here Are you going Or must I eject you Polison That was M Berigny s answer There was just a momentary hesitation Then grasping M Berigny firmly by the shoulders mister Lovell began to move him more rapidly than gently in the direction of the door The Vicomte came forward with the evident intention of interposing There would probably have been a slightly undignified scramble had not a diversion been created by the opening of the door and the entrance of mister Warren That gentleman glanced from one person to another I beg your pardon he observed I hope I don t intrude mister Lovell laughed a little forcedly His complexion was distinctly ruddy Not at all I wish you had come in sooner The most ridiculous thing has happened Indeed I have an eye for the ridiculous You know that picture of mine A Vision of the Night I ve heard of it This gentleman says that it s a portrait of his wife mister Lovell pointed to the Vicomte d Humieres No Then in that case this gentleman s wife came into your bedroom in the middle of the night and kissed you wasn t it mister Warren spoke in the innocence of his heart but at that moment mister Lovell could have struck his boyhood s friend There was a listener behind the screen The young gentleman s cheeks grew crimson as the lady s had done a few minutes before He was conscious too that the Vicomte s unfriendly eyes were fixed upon his face So That is it You you The Vicomte moved a step forward then checked himself Tell me where is my wife at this instant mister Lovell could have told him but he refrained I decline to give you any information of any kind whatever You decline The Vicomte raised his hand He would have struck the artist mister Warren interposed to avert the blow He declines for the very simple reason that he has never seen your wife isn t that so Gerald mister Lovell hesitated He scarcely saw his way to a denial while the lady was behind the screen You see He does not even dare to lie Don t talk nonsense sir Gerald why don t you tell the man that you have never seen the woman in your life I repeat that I decline to give this person any information of any kind whatever You decline The Vicomte uttered the words in a kind of strangled screech His patience was exhausted He seemed to think that he was being subjected to treatment which was more than flesh and blood could bear He rushed at mister Lovell mister Lovell probably forgetting himself on the impulse of the moment or he would have been more careful swung the Vicomte round against the screen It tottered reeled and raising a cloud of dust it fell with a bang to the floor It was a leaf out of Sheridan For an instant the several members of that little party did not distinctly realize what it was that had happened Then they saw There was a pause a curious pause Their attitudes betrayed a charming diversity of emotions The Vicomte his coat a little disarranged owing to the somewhat rough handling which he had just received stood and glared M Berigny more ramroddy than ever stared mister Warren gasped mister Lovell s quickened breathing crimsoned cheeks and flashing eyes seemed to suggest that his breast was a tumult of conflicting feelings The lady whose presence had been so unexpectedly revealed stood behind the fallen screen with the most charming air of innocence in the world and she smiled It was she who broke the silence She held out her hand to the Vicomte Bon jour Philippe Ah h h The Vicomte drew himself away with a sort of shuddering exclamation Antoinette It is you It cannot be My dear Philippe why not Why not Why not She asks why not The Vicomte held out his hands as though he appealed to the eternal verities Traitresse Once more is woman false and man betrayed The Vicomte s gesture was worthy of the tragic stage in France The lady still held out her hand and still she smiled My dear Philippe try comedy Comedy Ah yes I will try comedy the comedy of r r revenge The Vicomte distinctly rolled his r s He turned to mister Lovell I will kill you even though for killing you by the law of England I am hanged Victor where is my hat The Vicomte put this question to his friend with a peculiar coldness M Berigny shrugged his shoulders How should I know It is not a question of a hat As you say it is not a question of a hat It is a question the Vicomte moved towards mister Lovell of that He raised his hand with the intention of striking the artist on the cheek mister Lovell never flinched but the lady rushing forward caught her husband by the wrist She looked at him still with laughter in her eyes Try not to be insane The Vicomte glared at her with a glare which at least was characteristic Why do I not kill her why The lady only smiled They say that a woman is devoid of humour How is it then sometimes with a man You Philippe are always thinking of the Porte saint Martin I of the Bouffes Parisiens The Vicomte turned to his friend Victor why do I not kill this woman M Berigny only shrugged his shoulders Possibly because he was not ready with a more adequate reply The lady turned to the artist Monsieur I offer you ten thousand apologies which my husband will one day offer you himself as becomes a gentleman of France The Vicomte repeated his inquiry Victor why do I not kill this woman Only a shrug in reply The lady went on You have immortalized my poor face Monsieur my husband insults you in return The Vicomte folded his arms across his chest It is certain Victor that she still lives One night Monsieur my husband locked me in my room He designed to make of me a prisoner Why Ah do not ask me why When he had left me I escaped not by the door which he had locked but by a door he had not noticed This door led into an apartment in which there was a stranger sleeping I was but an instant in that apartment but the instant in which it was necessary to pass through The sleeper never spoke to me he never saw me with his waking eyes But even in his sleep my poor frightened face so flashed upon his brain that even in his waking hours it haunted him so that he made of it a picture a picture of that Vision of the Night The Vicomte approached closer to his friend He addressed him in a sort of confidential but still distinctly audible aside Victor is it possible that this is true I beg my friend that of me you will ask nothing Monsieur this morning I was at your Academy I saw my own countenance looking at me from the walls For the first time I learned that my poor frightened woman s face had appeared to a sleeping stranger in a Vision of the Night Oh Monsieur Monsieur The lady covered her face with her hands It would perhaps be rash to say that she cried but at least she seemed to cry and if it was only seeming she did it very well Victor again inquired the Vicomte of his friend is it possible that this is true M Berigny wagged his finger in the Vicomte s face D Humieres it now becomes a question of hats The Vicomte laid his hand on his companion s arm One instant Victor still one instant more The lady uncovering her eyes which actually were sparkling with tears continued to address the artist Monsieur I will not speak to you of my love for my husband my Philippe I will not speak to you of how we have been parted for a year a whole long year mon Dieu Monsieur mon Dieu I will not speak to you of how every instant of that long long year I have thought of him of how I have yearned for him of how I have longed for one touch of his hand one word from his lips one glance from his eyes No Monsieur I will not speak to you of all these things And for this reason That with me all things are finished I go never to return again My face you have made immortal the rest of me will perish For the woman whose heart is broken there remains but one place the grave It is to that place I go The lady had become as tragic as her husband even more so in her way She moved across the room with the air of a tragedy queen Parisian The Vicomte was visibly affected He fastened a convulsive clutch upon M Berigny s arm Victor tell me what shall I do Advise me oh my friend This is a critical moment in my life It is impossible that I should let her go Antoinette The Vicomte advanced just in time between the lady and the door Monsieur I entreat of you this last boon to let me go You have insulted me in the presence of a stranger for me therefore nothing else remains You have inquired if you should kill me No Philippe you need not kill me it is myself I will kill Antoinette I am no longer Antoinette I am the woman whose happiness you have destroyed It is only when I am dead that you will learn what is written on my heart for you Antoinette the strong man s voice faltered Antoinette am I never then to be forgiven There was a momentary pause Then the lady held out both her hands Philippe My heart my soul thou treasure of my life thou star of my existence Is it possible that a cloud should have interposed itself between thy path and mine He took her in his arms He pressed her to his breast M Berigny turned away From his attitude it almost seemed as if the soldier the man of ramrods and of bayonets wiped away a tear Philippe Take care or you will derange my hat Antoinette My beautiful my own Philippe do you not think you should apologize take care my friend or you certainly will derange my hat to the stranger who has made immortal the face of the woman who loved you better than her life my friend take care who has made her appear on canvas so much more beautiful than she is in life No Antoinette that I will not have It is impossible Beauty such as yours in not to be rendered by a painter s brush If that be so all the more reason why we should be grateful to mister Lovell for endeavouring the impossible The lady peeped at mister Lovell with the quaintest malice in her eyes Certainly Antoinette there is something in what you say And after all it is a charming painting I said Victor when I saw it there can be no doubt as a painting it is charming did I not say so M Berigny inclined his head With his handkerchief the Vicomte smoothed his moustache He advanced towards mister Lovell Monsieur a Frenchman a true Frenchman seldom errs On those rare occasions on which he errs he is always willing under proper conditions to confess his error Monsieur I perceive that I have done you an injustice For the injustice which I have done you I desire to apologize mister Lovell smiled He held out his hand My dear fellow There s nothing for which you need apologize The Vicomte grasped the artist s hand in both of his My dear friend he cried Philippe whispered the lady into her husband s ear do you not think that you would like mister Lovell and his friend to favour us with their company at luncheon The Vicomte seemed to think he would They lunched together all the five Why not THE WAY OF A MAID WITH A MAN Miss Whitby writes to her Mother MY DEAREST MAMMA You will be surprised and I hope you will be pleased to hear that I am engaged to be married You are not to smile it would be cruel this really is serious Charlie is all that a husband should be you are not to laugh at that you know exactly what I mean I am nearly twenty and this time I feel that my happiness really is at stake I may not be able to keep my looks for long some girls lose them when they are quite young and something seems to tell me that I ought to begin to look life seriously in the face and become responsible I almost wish that I had taken to district visiting like Emma Mortimer it might have balanced me Poor Emma what a pity she is so plain Will you mind hinting to Tom Wilson that I think he might be happy with Nora Cathcart It is true that I made him promise that he would never speak to her again but all that is over I hope you will not think me fickle dear mamma I enclose the ring Tom gave me Will you please give it to him And point out to him that I am now persuaded that boy and girl attachments never come to anything serious By the way do not forget to tell them to send two pairs of evening shoes Those which I have are quite worn out Let both pairs be perfectly plain bronze Charlie thinks that they make my feet look almost ethereal Is he not absurd But I hope that you will not think so when you come to know him for he loves your child You might also ask them to send me a dozen pairs of stockings nice ones All mine seem to be in holes You know I like them as long as you can get them I have been here nearly a month and I have been almost engaged to three different men How time does seem to fly Lily says I am a heartless little flirt I think that perhaps I was until he came He has been here just a week and I seem to have known him years Lily seems to be under the impression that I was engaged to Captain Pentland She is wrong Captain Pentland has some very noble qualities He is destined to make some true woman profoundly happy Of that I have no doubt whatever But I am not that woman No dear mamma I feel that now Besides he wears an eyeglass As you are aware I have always had an insuperable objection to an eyeglass It seems to savour of affectation And affectation I cannot stand And then he lisps As I told you when I wrote you last when I sprained my ankle on Highdown Hill he carried me in his arms for over a mile Of course I was grateful And between you and me dear mamma he held me so very closely to him that afterwards I felt as if I ought to marry him I have explained everything to Charlie He quite agrees with me that it is absurd for Captain Pentland to think himself ill used While I think of it when you are in town will you tell them to send me a box of assorted chocolates You know the kind I like There is nothing of that sort to be had here and I do so long for some Charlie is Lily s cousin Do you think that cousins ought to kiss each other I wish I could get the opinion of someone on whose judgment I could implicitly rely At any rate even supposing that they ought I am quite sure that there should be limits Before long I am afraid that I shall have to give Charlie a hint that I do not think under the circumstances that he ought to kiss Lily quite as much as he does me She may be his cousin but she is young and she is pretty And cousins are not sisters It is nonsense for people to pretend they are The odd part of it is that if Charlie had not been so fond of kissing Lily I might not be going to marry him now I knew that he was coming And I was sitting alone in the drawing room in a half light with my back to the door when suddenly someone putting his arm round my waist lifting me off my feet twisted me right round and began kissing me on my eyes and lips and everywhere I thought it was Captain Pentland Though I was astonished at such behaviour even from him because it was only that morning we quarrelled You may judge of my astonishment when I was again able to look out of my own eyes to find myself being held as if I were a baby or a doll in the arms of a perfect giant of a man whom I had never seen before You may imagine how shocked I felt because as you know well my views on such subjects which I owe to your dear teaching are if anything too severe I will do him the justice to admit that he seemed to be almost as much shocked as I was I beg your pardon he said ten thousand times I thought that you were Lily He put me down very much as you handle your Chelsea cups mamma softly and delicately as if he had been afraid of chipping pieces off me I suppose you re Charlie I spoke more lightly and more cheerfully than I felt He seemed so ashamed of himself and so confused that I pitied him You know dear mamma that when people know and feel that they have done wrong I always pity them I cannot help it It is my nature All flesh is weak I myself am prone to err When Lily did appear we were talking quite as if we knew each other And that is how it began It is odd how these sort of things sometimes do begin As you are aware I speak as one who has had experience I shall always believe that it was only the breaking of a shoelace which first brought Norman Eliot and me together But those chapters in my life are closed In the days which are past I may have seemed to hesitate to occasionally have changed my mind But now my life is linked to Charlie s by bonds which never shall be broken I feel as if I were already married The gravity of existence is commencing to weigh upon my mind A woman when she is nearly twenty is no longer young While I remember it when you send the chocolates don t send any walnuts I am sick of them Variously flavoured creams are what I really like And let two pairs of the stockings be light blue with bronze stripes high up the leg I cannot truly say that Lily is behaving to me quite nicely in my relations with Charlie I do not wish to wrong her even in my thoughts she is the very dearest friend I have but sometimes I cannot help thinking that she had an eye on Charlie for herself Because when the other morning I was telling her how strongly I disapproved of cousins marrying if she had not been Lily whose single hearted affection I have every faith in I should have said that she was positively rude Charlie only proposed to me last night yet although she must have seen what was coming in the afternoon she was actually talking to me of Norman Eliot as if I had been to blame mister Eliot and I never really were engaged some people jump to conclusions without proper justification And am I compelled to answer a person s letters if for reasons of my own quite private reasons I do not choose to She came to my bedroom last night just as I was going to bed I told her what Charlie had said and what I had said Of course I expected her to congratulate me as in circumstances such as mine a girl s best friend ought to do She heard me to an end and she looked at me and said So you ve done it again I don t know about again dear Lily I replied But it would seem as if I had done it at last I am feeling so happy that it almost makes me afraid Some girls would feel afraid if they had reason to be conscious of the fact that they had engaged themselves to marry three men at once I could not help but notice that a jarring something was in her tone But I paid no heed to it My thoughts were elsewhere How wrong it is I murmured for people to scoff at love They cannot know what love is as I do Perhaps not I should think that what you don t know about love May isn t worth knowing I sighed I fancy Lily dear that I have heard stories about you I daresay but I never snapped up your favourite cousin from under your nose Possibly you will not mind telling me if you do mean to marry one of them and if so which Lily How can you ask me such a question Have I not just been telling you that there is only one man in the world for me henceforth and for ever and that his name is Charlie Exactly Only last week you told me precisely the same story and his name was Jim while about a fortnight ago it was Norman My dearest mamma you see I am making a clean breast of everything to you I own quite candidly that since I have been here I have not behaved precisely as I might have done and indeed ought to have done I do not know how it is I meant to be good I am sure that nothing could have been better than my resolutions I had no idea that they could have been so easily broken It only shows after all how fragile we are I felt that strange and sad though it seems Lily was not wholly unjust I got up from my chair and I knelt at her feet and I pillowed my head in her lap and I cried Oh Lily I ve been so wicked You can t think how sorry I am now that it s too late I wish you d help me and tell me what I ought to do I m a bit of a dab at a cry myself she said So if you take my advice to begin with you ll literally dry up Was it not unkind And was it not vulgar But I sometimes think that Lily s heart is like the nether millstone so hard you know She went on If you do mean business with Charlie and you do want my advice you ll just tell him everything you have been doing and leave the solution of the situation to him I made up my mind there and then that that was exactly what I would do I resolved that I would have no secrets from my husband particularly as he would be sure to be told them by unfriendly lips if he did not learn them from mine Besides in such matters a man is so much more generous and so much more sympathetic than a woman especially the man Nor does he value you any the less because he finds that someone else happens to value you a little too So directly Lily had gone I let my hair down and I put on my light blue dressing jacket and a touch of powder and I waited Presently I heard steps coming along the passage I opened the door Sure enough it was Charlie just going to bed At sight of me he started I was conscious that I was perhaps acting with some imprudence But I could not help it My entire happiness was at stake You know dear mamma that I do look nice in that pretty dressing jacket with my hair not at all untidy but simply let down You yourself have told me that in every sense of the word I look so young He held out his hands to me under a misapprehension I shrank back mister Mason I began very softly with in my voice a sort of sob I could not rest until I had told you all that has passed between us to night must be considered as unsaid He started as if I had struck him I could see that his face went white Miss Whitby May What do you mean He seemed to gasp for breath After all it is only natural that you should not love a great hulking idiot such as I am You are mistaken You are not a great hulking idiot And I do love you I shall never love anyone but you It is you who will not love me when you have heard all I have to say What nonsense are you talking Again he held out his arms to me And again I shrank away It is not nonsense I wish it were So far is it from being nonsense that I felt that I could not be at peace until my conscience was unburdened I paused I felt the crucial moment was arriving My voice sank lower Someone else was staying here before you came Yes I know Lily told me a man named Pentland Oh Lily told you so much did she Did Lily also tell you that the man named Pentland had bad taste enough to fancy that he had fallen in love with me Bad taste you call it I know nothing about the man but there evidently can be no sort of doubt about his perfect taste But Charlie I mean mister Mason You don t you mean Charlie Dear mamma once more I sighed I perceived that it would have to be Some men are so dictatorial The worst of it is that he worried and worried me so I was staying in the same house and couldn t get away from him you see that he made me almost think I cared for him But now you have come and made me see what a mistake it was My little love For the third time he held out his arms to me And this time he took me in them I could not find it in my heart to resist him any longer it might be the last time he would ever hold me there I continued my remarks with my head not very far away from his waistcoat He smoothed my hair very softly with his great right hand Unfortunately I am not at all sure that Captain Pentland does not think that in a sort of way I am engaged to him Oh Charlie whatever shall I do Tell him the truth Say that you re sorry for him poor chap but even the best regulated girls will make mistakes I m the mistake you ve made I was silent Then I whispered Will you forgive me It strikes me that it is I who ought to ask you to forgive me for not having been the first to come upon the scene This was throwing a new light upon the subject It had not occurred to me to look at it from that point of view before But I had not come to the end of my confessions Dear mamma how careful we women ought to be It is these crises in our lives which make us feel what short sighted mortals we actually are Before Captain Pentland came I was pulling at one of the buttons on his waistcoat as I spoke and I realised what a big heart Charlie s must be if it was at all in proportion to his chest another friend of Lily s was stopping in the house Ye es I could not help but be conscious of a certain hesitation in his pronunciation of the word His name was Eliot Well There had been a moment s silence before he spoke And when he had spoken there ensued a portentous pause I hid my face still more from his examining gaze My voice seemed almost to die away He also professed to bestow on me the gift of his affection The devil he did Yes mamma that was precisely what he said It made me shiver But he was sorry as soon as the words had passed his lips Forgive me I didn t mean it After all it is only to be expected that every man who sees you will fall in love with you at sight I wondered if he would talk to me like that in years to come Do husbands of ten years standing say such things unto their wives Oh how ashamed of myself I felt as I thought of what I still had to admit Dear mamma I will try hard never again to do what my conscience tells me is not right If only we would always listen to the still small voice which seeks to guide us Charlie you have no notion how foolish I have been Until you came I had no proper conception of the actualities of existence mister Eliot caused me to confuse the issues just as Captain Pentland did He held me out a little way in front of him trying to look into my face I was careful not to let him see too much of it I hung down my head with what I do hope mamma was proper penitence Let me know clearly where we are little girl Am I to understand you to say that both these men asked you to marry them I am afraid Charlie that you are to understand something of the kind And that you gave both of them encouragement I looked up at him such a look mamma My eyes were swimming in tears I knew he would not tell me to dry up My heart seemed to be rising to my lips Not real encouragement I never gave anyone real encouragement Charlie till I knew you Even in your case I fear I ought to have been more reticent But you cannot have the least idea of what a wide world of love you seem to have opened out to me Won t you forgive me for encouraging you Dear mamma he collapsed Of what took place during the moments which immediately followed I can give you no definite description I know I began to think that the end of the world had come When he had quite finished he said Look here young lady what is past is past We will make no further allusions to what took place before the war But in the future perhaps you will kindly manage not as you put it to confuse the issues but will continue to confine yourself to encouraging me Was it not noble of him And so sweet I am persuaded that his character is one of singular beauty Dear mamma the passages which ensued were too sacred even for your dear eyes When he left me I felt certain it was to dream of him I know that all night long I dreamt of him And on my knees beside my bed I registered a vow that in the time to come I will be as good as I possibly can Do not forget the shoes and the stockings and the chocolates And do give Tom his ring I am registering this letter so you are sure to get it safe I will bring or send Charlie to you on approval whenever you please I am my dearest mamma Your ever loving daughter MAY AUNT JANE S JALAP CHAPTER I BEFORE TAKING There s a fortune in it For the bottlemakers 
7073-83692-0001	train-other-500	If for them then what for us We shan t want more bottles than we can sell Besides we can make our own bottles if it comes to that Cost of bottle contents cork label and all one penny Selling price eightpence
7073-83692-0002	train-other-500	Sale at a moderate estimate one million bottles a year
none	none	 How does that figure for a profit 
7073-83692-0003	train-other-500	It figures nicely But give me facts How long do you suppose it will take us to reach that sale No time The name will sell it Aunt Jane s Jalap There isn t an old woman in England who seeing those words staring her in the face
7073-83692-0004	train-other-500	won t press a longing hand to her inside Outside I presume you mean But no matter Hughes placed the bottle on the table He looked at it with loving eyes Then he shook his head There s only one thing we want Customers
7073-83692-0005	train-other-500	Testimonials There s something in it I know there is Not much perhaps but still something That bottle sir contains a remedy for all known diseases and all unknown ones for all that I can tell In fact
none	none	 I have a suspicion that it is to the unknown diseases that it will come as the greatest blessing 
7073-83692-0006	train-other-500	Patent medicines generally do
none	none	 Those mysterious maladies which 
7073-83692-0007	train-other-500	up to the advent of Aunt Jane s Jalap have baffled all the resources of medical science Give me a day or two and I will prove it I will bring you testimonials which will make your hair stand up on end and
7073-83692-0008	train-other-500	He paused looking me fixedly in the face all genuine That evening I had a small dinner party It was rather an occasion The suggestion I am bound to admit had come from Margaret
7073-83692-0009	train-other-500	My dear George it s the easiest thing in the world and you could do it nicely Why don t you ask us to dinner
none	none	 Aunt and I and old Pybus to round it off 
7073-83692-0010	train-other-500	Square it off I suspect she meant
none	none	 because of course 
7073-83692-0011	train-other-500	that would make four with me But I didn t correct her And then you and I could look over the house together after dinner So I asked them And they came
none	none	 Old Pybus said he would be delighted I don t care for Pybus myself 
7073-83692-0012	train-other-500	but missus Chalmers does and this was an occasion on which her taste had to be consulted rather than mine And during dinner I began on Aunt Jane s Jalap Well it s all settled with Hughes I addressed myself to Margaret What about
7073-83692-0013	train-other-500	Aunt Jane s Jalap missus Chalmers put down her spoon This was while the soup was on Aunt Jane s Jalap Whatever s that The new patent medicine the coming boom
7073-83692-0014	train-other-500	You must know that my friend Francis Hughes has a wonderful old nurse and this wonderful old nurse has the most wonderful medicine which she used to administer to all her charges
none	none	 Hughes has obtained the receipt from her 
7073-83692-0015	train-other-500	How much did he give her for it Half a crown
none	none	 I crushed Pybus That is a private matter but rather more than half a crown As a plain statement of fact he hadn t given her anything as yet 
7073-83692-0016	train-other-500	But of course we should both of us see that she made a good thing of it when the sale got up I need scarcely observe what fortunes have been made in patent medicines And lost in them my boy
none	none	 This was just like Pybus 
7073-83692-0017	train-other-500	but I let it pass Millions literally millions have been made
none	none	 and I may safely say that none of them can compare with Aunt Jane s Jalap 
7073-83692-0018	train-other-500	Have you tried the stuff upon yourself
none	none	 No Pybus I have not I am ready at any time to try it upon you 
7073-83692-0019	train-other-500	Well Hughes has supplied the medicine and I am going to supply part of the capital What part
none	none	 That is another private matter Pybus 
7073-83692-0020	train-other-500	Sufficient I trust to bring the matter before the public eye
none	none	 Don t you think the name is rather a funny one Aunt Jane s Jalap 
7073-83692-0021	train-other-500	This was hard coming from Margaret My dear Margaret the name is half the battle Hughes thinks it s a splendid one But don t you think it makes one think of indigestion That s exactly what it s meant to do Before or afterwards
none	none	 This of course was Pybus 
7073-83692-0022	train-other-500	Let those laugh who win Wait till you see the name blazoned on every dead wall Then you ll welcome Aunt Jane s Jalap as a friend That dinner I confess was a little patent mediciney
none	none	 More than once I rather wished that I had kept the subject out of it 
7073-83692-0023	train-other-500	Pybus told some pleasant and characteristic anecdotes about injurious effects of patent medicines How he had known whole families killed by taking them How more than half the infant mortality of Great Britain was owing to their unrestricted sale
7073-83692-0024	train-other-500	How the habit of taking patent medicines was worse than the habit of dram drinking
none	none	 and the why and the wherefore and so on 
7073-83692-0025	train-other-500	I could not at my own table take the man by the scruff of the neck and drop him from the first floor window But I know that Margaret didn t like it and I didn t either missus Chalmers seemed undecided
7073-83692-0026	train-other-500	She herself swears by some noxious compound which is absurdly named Daddy s Delight and which I know by the mere smell of it is nothing else but poison Have you any of the stuff in the house she asked
7073-83692-0027	train-other-500	I have a bottle of Aunt Jane s Jalap which is not stuff my dear missus Chalmers but a most invaluable medicine Hughes brought it this afternoon as a sample
none	none	 Trot it out said Pybus Pybus is fifty five if he is a day but he uses the slang of a schoolboy 
7073-83692-0028	train-other-500	I was not going to act on such a hint as that but when missus Chalmers expressed a wish to look at it I fetched the bottle It was a small black bottle such as is used for samples of wines about quarter bottle size I held it in my hand
7073-83692-0029	train-other-500	This ladies and gentlemen is Aunt Jane s Jalap It is a name which I trust will soon be familiar in your mouths as household words This however is its first appearance on the scene and I propose to mark the importance of the occasion
7073-83692-0030	train-other-500	that we drink to its success I propose ladies and gentlemen that we drink to Aunt Jane s Jalap in Aunt Jane s Jalap Brooks bring four claret glasses I drew the cork
7073-83692-0031	train-other-500	George you don t mean that we re to drink the stuff I do my dear Margaret why not The dose is a wine glassful to be taken immediately after meals missus Chalmers allow me to offer you a glass of Aunt Jane s Jalap
7073-83692-0032	train-other-500	She sniffed at it It has a very disagreeable smell That was good I protest that I have smelt Daddy s Delight when I was passing the house and took it till I knew better for drains
7073-83692-0033	train-other-500	Margaret a glass of Aunt Jane s Jalap But George I assure you that I never do take medicine Some people s wine is no better than medicine We drink that and pretend we like it Why not jalap
none	none	 This was Pybus 
7073-83692-0034	train-other-500	As he had just before been making insinuations about my wine the allusion was pointed But the man s proverbial No heeltraps
none	none	 Aunt Jane s Jalap with the honours 
7073-83692-0035	train-other-500	We all stood up I drained my glass I immediately wished I hadn t The others drained their glasses I saw they wished they hadn t too I do not think I ever tasted anything quite so nasty
7073-83692-0036	train-other-500	I wished I had sampled it before As it was it took me by surprise
none	none	 so much by surprise that my first impulse was to fly for shelter It was like well the taste was really so exceedingly disagreeable that comparison fails me It is a case of kill or cure observed Pybus with the most extraordinary expression of countenance I ever saw 
7073-83692-0037	train-other-500	The man who takes much of that stuff will be killed if he isn t cured Death for me rather than Aunt Jane s Jalap if it is jalap It is rather pungent I owned
none	none	 I don t know about pungent continued Pybus who certainly seemed to be suffering 
7073-83692-0038	train-other-500	but with ice pudding it s a failure Never declared missus Chalmers who was leaning back in her chair and had her handkerchief in her hand never did I taste anything like it Never and after dinner too
7073-83692-0039	train-other-500	Margaret s feelings seemed for the moment to be too strong for speech I perceived the thing had been a failure Still I endeavoured to pass it off which was difficult for I myself felt really ill
7073-83692-0040	train-other-500	Ah it is to the after effects we must look forward It is the after effects I m thinking of said Pybus That was almost more than I could bear it was the after effects I was thinking of as well Come let s adjourn and have a little music
7073-83692-0041	train-other-500	Have we finished the bottle of jalap
none	none	 inquired Pybus 
7073-83692-0042	train-other-500	I really must apologise I confess I had no idea what a peculiar taste it had it certainly is peculiar missus Chalmers put her handkerchief up to her eyes And after dinner too We accompanied the ladies to the drawing room as well as we could
none	none	 Pybus went with missus Chalmers I took Margaret 
7073-83692-0043	train-other-500	As we went I whispered in her ear Now you and I can look over the house together I am afraid George you must excuse me I I couldn t walk about just yet Do take me to a chair
7073-83692-0044	train-other-500	We had planned that we would examine the house together from attic to basement indeed the whole affair had been got up for that express purpose Everything was in apple pie order and ready for inspection The servants were on the tiptoe of expectation
7073-83692-0045	train-other-500	As we went Margaret was to make suggestions for alterations which would fit the house for its mistress And opportunities might arise for a little confidential intercourse But of course I could not drag the girl about the place against her will
none	none	 Love works wonders But there are circumstances which prove too strong 
7073-83692-0046	train-other-500	The atmosphere of the drawing room was depressing
none	none	 It was no use my talking to Margaret because she wouldn t talk to me 
7073-83692-0047	train-other-500	And general conversation seemed out of the question So I tried another line
none	none	 Pybus give us a song 
7073-83692-0048	train-other-500	Pybus thinks he can sing He may have been able to once Here s Drink to me only That s a favourite of yours You should hear him sing it Margaret will play the accompaniment Lucas he said
none	none	 Do you think by any chance that dose of jalap was too strong I ask the question because I remember when I was a boy 
7073-83692-0049	train-other-500	hearing of a family being poisoned by an overdose of jalap In their case they took it by mistake Though judging from the taste of your jalap I can t see how that could be
none	none	 Still if there is likely to be any danger it is as well that we should be prepared for it 
7073-83692-0050	train-other-500	Margaret murmured missus Chalmers let s go home Why aunt It will pass off in time In time At that moment I heartily wished that Hughes had been at Jericho before he induced me to dabble in his patent medicines
7073-83692-0051	train-other-500	I always did hate them even as a child
none	none	 It is quite impossible continued Pybus that the sensations which I am now experiencing 
7073-83692-0052	train-other-500	are the ordinary and natural outcome of a dose of jalap Margaret groaned missus Chalmers I insist upon your coming home Aunt what is the use of going home You haven t got a book in the house Lucas treating of poisons
none	none	 I wish you wouldn t talk like that Pybus It really is unfair 
7073-83692-0053	train-other-500	I quite perceive that I made a mistake in administering the dose after dinner in fact I am myself inclined to believe that I misunderstood Hughes
none	none	 and that the dose ought to be administered before a meal 
7073-83692-0054	train-other-500	Good God Pybus I can t help it I really cannot help it sir The idea of a reasonable person voluntarily swallowing such a concoction as that before his dinner is enough to make any man profane
7073-83692-0055	train-other-500	I don t think mister Lucas murmured missus Chalmers that you have the least idea how ill I feel My dear missus Chalmers if if there is anything I can do for you
none	none	 Yes said Pybus another bottle CHAPTER II AFTER TAKING Just then Brooks came in mister Hughes sir wishes to speak to you Excuse me one moment I ll be back directly I found Hughes waiting for me in my snuggery Sorry to interrupt you old man but I just called in to prevent accidents What do you mean You know that bottle I brought you this afternoon I thought it was Aunt Jane s Jalap but it isn t I found it out directly I got home You see I keep all sorts of bottles in my cupboard regular chemist s shop and I caught hold of the wrong one by mistake Not Aunt Jane s Jalap No it s laudanum Laudanum Hughes The fact is Lucas What s the matter You don t mean to say you have been drinking some Is is it poison Poison Why it s pure laudanum Would would a wineglassful do any harm A wineglassful Lucas old man don t say you ve drank a wineglassful We all have All have Margaret and missus Chalmers and Pybus Great powers We we thought it was Aunt Jane s Jalap and we drank to its success Are they dead Dead Hughes How long ago is it since they took it Not long After dinner But a wineglassful Are they conscious They were when I just now left them But they weren t feeling well I I m not either We couldn t understand it This this explains it Hughes you you ve murdered us Never mind old man Keep your head I ll pull you through Trust all to me The great thing in a case like this is to keep your head Don t sit down keep yourself in constant circulation Just one second Brooks Brooks Run Brooks to the nearest doctor and then to half a dozen others and tell them there s a case of laudanum poisoning and they re to come at once Laudanum poisoning sir What in the house Yes in the house Don t stand there like a pig in a fit It s a question of life or death One moment sir while I get my hat Go without your hat Here take mine Now run for your life Remember if anything happens through you you will be held responsible in the eyes of the law Come along Lucas let s go in to them Keep yourself awake old man jump about Don t say a word to them about what has happened Don t let them even suspect from your manner that anything is wrong The great thing is to keep them in entire ignorance And keep cool keep cool He gave a jerk at my arm which almost pulled me forward on my face I say Hughes don t But I must old man I must I must keep you alive at any cost Oh Lucas old man if anything should happen But I won t talk like that or I shall make a fool of myself Come along old man and mind what I say Keep cool We went along that is to say he took me by the arm and dragged me towards the drawing room My emotions I am unable to describe I always think that when a man is able to describe his emotions he hasn t had any worth describing But through it all I had a dim perception that in spite of his repeated adjurations Hughes himself kept anything but cool Outside the drawing room door I brought the procession to a standstill I gripped his arm Hughes do you think that she will die Who Margaret Nonsense Don t I tell you no one s going to die For goodness sake don t talk like that Don t I keep telling you to keep cool He did But it was scarcely with an air of coolness that he threw the door wide open and with so much force that it seemed as if he were trying to wrench it from its hinges I fancy our entry made a slight sensation It was strange if it didn t They were certainly not unconscious yet Even amidst my own agitation it was with quite a sensation of relief that I perceived so much missus Chalmers was reclining on the couch with her head thrown back and a look about her which I did not like Margaret was on a settee seeming as though the proceedings had lost all interest for her Pybus sat in an arm chair his hands crossed upon his stomach Good evening said Hughes I could see he did not like the look of things I I ve just dropped in Pybus rose I m just dropping out Good evening Lucas I have to thank you for a very pleasant evening I ll send you the doctor s bill when I get it Hughes looked at me then at Pybus You re not going mister Pybus Do you wish me to be ill here But I was looking forward to a song or a dance or something Dance I feel like dancing and singing too I ve been the victim of an outrage mister Hughes I ve been introduced to Aunt Jane s Jalap I ve heard of it Lucas ought not to have given it you And after dinner This was a murmur from the couch That was wrong quite wrong The dose should have been administered before the meal In that case I observed a little nettled we should all of us been dead by now Pybus glanced at me sharply Dead What do you mean Hughes turned on me in a rage Yes What do you mean I felt I had made a mistake I I mean nothing Only only I think Hughes was as much to blame as I was Hughes took Pybus away They went to missus Chalmers So far as I could judge the lady was rapidly sinking into a lethargic condition I remained standing where I was I began gradually to realise my situation the approaching tragedy in which by fate or circumstance I was cast as an actor A strange leaden feeling seemed to be stealing over me but in spite of it I began to understand that at any moment the drawing room this drawing room my drawing room might be strewed with corpses I knew nothing of the effects of laudanum poisoning but Hughes seemed to be surprised that we were not all of us dead already Here was Margaret the woman I loved best in all the world upon my right There was her aunt for whom I own my love was less upon the couch There was old Pybus That old man s blood was also on my hands What would they call me A suicide The irony In the full flush of health and strength with fortune all the world before me and a wife A wife whom I loved with a great fulness of love which was quite old fashioned I had wrought this hecatomb I felt impelled to scream aloud To warn my victims of the frightful fate which was stealing fast upon them and of which they were still unconscious Someone touched me on the arm I turned It was Margaret George what is the matter Margaret My voice trembled There was a choking in my throat I wished to take her in my arms before them all It might be a last embrace George tell me what is wrong I made an effort to pull myself together Oh there s nothing wrong I I m only a bit upset She put her arm through mine She led me across the room I required leading She drew me into an alcove which was formed by a window bay Now George tell me what is wrong I know there is something wrong Tell me what it is I was at a loss for words I trifled with her Margaret What do you mean George was her voice sank to a whisper was there anything wrong about that stuff you gave us What could I say to her It it was a mistake drinking it after dinner Is that all Was it the right stuff George It it was the stuff Hughes gave me You are trifling with me I know that there is something wrong I can see it in your manner and in mister Hughes s See how strangely mister Hughes is behaving now I peeped round the corner Hughes was behaving strangely He was frantically urging missus Chalmers to stand up and dance though anyone looking less like dancing than she did I never saw He was evidently forgetting his own axiom keep cool A curious qualm came over me Almost without knowing it I leaned for support against the wall George What is the matter You are ill Margaret s eager face looked into mine It will be all right in a minute It won t I know it won t Tell me what it is There was something the matter with that stuff you gave us I knew it directly I had swallowed it Do you think I am a coward Do you think I am afraid But it is only fair that you should tell me If you won t tell me George I will go to mister Hughes and insist upon his telling me Don t Margaret The doctor will be here directly The doctor She drew herself straight up A strange look came into her eyes She spoke almost in a whisper What is the doctor coming for Hughes thought that he had better come Is it so bad as that George what was that stuff you gave us I have not said that it was anything The the dose was too strong Was it poison Margaret I took her two hands in mine She came into my arms I held her to my breast Was it poison If you love me half as much as I love you you will tell me George Margaret What poison was it Laudanum She drew herself away from me She looked at me with her great wide open eyes Then her eyes were closed Before I had the least suspicion of what was going to happen she had fallen to the ground I knelt beside her Margaret I cried I cried to her in vain I was seized with a great horror She is dead I exclaimed Hughes came running forward I almost sprang at him You have killed her Don t be an idiot Lucas She can t be dead She is dead And it is your work For the matter of that all our blood is upon your head But we shall not die alone You shall come too my friend If you don t take your hands away Lucas I shall have to do you a mischief mister Lucas mister Hughes Have you both of you gone mad Are you aware that there are ladies present The interference came from Pybus He dragged us asunder He showed more presence of mind and more coolness too than I had credited him with He was a great deal calmer than either Lucas or I What is the meaning of this extraordinary behaviour And what is the matter with Miss Hammond He has killed her Who has killed her That scamp with his infernal negligence I don t in the least understand you And I think that instead of wrangling here your attentions were better bestowed upon Miss Hammond I threw myself at her side I was like a man distraught in the whirlwind of conflicting emotions which came sweeping over me My darling Oh my darling I shall soon be with you Already the poison is stealing through my veins May my end be as rapid as was yours Why doesn t the doctor come I don t believe that you have sent for him Go and fetch him Again I sprang at Hughes And again Pybus interposed mister Lucas may I ask for an explanation of your singular conduct Has Miss Hammond fainted Fainted He has poisoned her Poisoned her Yes and you and me and all of us We all like her are doomed to die mister Lucas Lucas you re you re mad you know This was Hughes But a piercing scream came from the couch I knew that I was poisoned missus Chalmers might know that she was poisoned but that was no reason why on the strength of her knowledge she should develope violent hysterics which she immediately did I had never seen so much of the man in Pybus as he showed just then He gave one look at missus Chalmers and then he turned to Hughes mister Hughes will you be so good as to tell me if there is any meaning in mister Lucas s words Hughes was ghastly white The great point is to bring Miss Hammond back to life again While we are talking here she may be dying at our feet I appeal to your manhood mister Pybus to help me bring her back to consciousness Hughes knelt down by Margaret Pybus turned to me What does he mean he said I did not answer I knelt down by Hughes He had my darling s hand in his I saw that he was putting great restraint upon himself Beads of perspiration were on his brow She is not dead he stammered She is in a faint or something At any cost we must bring her back to consciousness Be a man Lucas and help me Her life should be even more precious to you than to me Don t talk like that Hughes Don t you see that I am nearly mad already What can I do Help me to raise her Between us we raised her to a perpendicular position mister Pybus can I trouble you to order some brandy Stay she is coming back to life again She was She sighed She opened her eyes as if she were waking out of sleep She turned to me George My darling I caught her in my arms I held her to my breast What mattered it if there were others there We were standing by an open grave I do so love you George She was dreaming She thought we were alone Margaret I kissed her Something caused her to look round There was old Pybus standing at her side She drew herself away from me She blushed a rosy red then her glance travelled round the room She pressed her hands against her bosom A startled look came into her eyes Then it wasn t all a dream Hughes slipped his arm through hers Miss Hammond I must insist upon your taking exercise Take a sharp turn or two round the room with me Lucas I wish you d sit down and play us a dance Or better still let me sit down and play and you and Miss Hammond take a few turns together mister Pybus you must dance with missus Chalmers A flyaway gallop or a rattling polka They re better than valses There was a remarkable expression upon old Pybus s enamelled countenance So far as that goes I expect there was on mine but as to that no matter Might I ask once more for an explanation of these very singular proceedings I warn you mister Pybus that if you do not dance with missus Chalmers you must be responsible for the consequences both as they regard yourself and the lady Pybus s eyes wandered from Hughes to missus Chalmers The lady was making noise enough for ten She did not strike the imagination as being a promising partner for a dance So Pybus seemed to think Hughes struck up You should see me dance the polka playing it at the rate of about sixty miles an hour Margaret looked at me Are you and I to dance Why dance I shook my head Hughes I said I can t You must man you must Are you mad I can t I couldn t A numbness seemed to be settling on my brain My legs refused to support me I sank into a chair Margaret hesitated for just one second I could see her trembling Then she sat on the ground close to my feet She leaned her arm upon my knee Her face was turned towards mine Nor can I If we must die George let us die together but not dancing What on earth inquired Pybus is all this talk of dying mister Hughes I insist upon an answer sir In a sort of fury Hughes leaped from the music stool And I insist mister Pybus upon your dancing with missus Chalmers I warn you that if you don t you will be morally guilty not only of murder but of suicide He turned to me As for you are you a man Do you think that it is your life only which is hanging in the balance I tell you that the only hope for Miss Hammond is to keep her circulating Do that and I will answer for it with my own life that all will yet be well Come while I can let me keep you circulating Maggie It was not often that I called my rare pale Margaret Maggie But at that master moment of our lives I felt that the endearing name was best She rose my darling I put my arm about her waist George whatever you think it best That s better said Hughes Now let me see you go it Give her fits my boy Again he dashed into mister Grossmith s popular air I never heard it played at such a rate before Possibly with a view of raising our spirits he shouted out the chorus in a tone of voice which must have been audible quite two streets away It was deafening You should see me dance the polka You should see me cover the ground You should see my coat tails flying My coat tails were anything but flying We made no attempt at keeping time with Hughes Under the most favourable circumstances the thing would have been impossible We moved Margaret and I as if we were treading a funeral measure My legs were going at the knees I felt her frail frame quivering in my arms Now then Pybus shouted Hughes off you go with missus Chalmers Don t ask her make her Pull her off the couch and jump her about Pybus appeared to be endeavouring to persuade missus Chalmers to join him in the mazy dance The lady had suddenly become still which for some reasons the chief one being the noise which Hughes was making was perhaps as well How can I pull her off the couch answered Pybus when she s in a fit or dead or something Up jumped Hughes Keep going you two Don t stop for a single instant Lucas everything depends upon your keeping Miss Hammond circulating I can t I said Nor can I said Margaret The utterances were almost simultaneous Simultaneously we sank into an ottoman missus Chalmers missus Chalmers shouted Hughes Pybus help me to lift her off the couch Now then you two what have you stopped for He turned to Margaret and me Something in our faces or in our attitudes appeared to frighten him He ran to the door yelling in a manner which absolutely frightened me Brooks Brooks Oh my God why doesn t the doctor come CHAPTER III DOCTORS TO THE RESCUE Just as he reached the door it was opened A very tall and very stout old gentleman entered He had a black bag in his hand But he did not seem to be the least in a hurry Good evening I trust there is nothing serious the matter I suppose that in the agitated state of his nervous system the stranger s sudden appearance took Hughes by surprise He stared at him as though he were a ghost Are are you the doctor I am the doctor doctor Goldsmith I had already recognised him as the doctor who lived at the corner of the square Although I had not the pleasure of his personal acquaintance I had more than once wondered why he did not try Banting Leaving off sugar and butter and milk and trying a piece of lemon in your tea is an excellent method of reducing the flesh He looked round the room and bowed a little vaguely Then he said addressing Hughes whom he apparently took to be the master of the house Where is the patient They re they re all patients This answer seemed to cause the doctor to experience a slight sense of mystification He placed a pair of gold glasses upon the bridge of his nose He cast another glance around the room All patients Pybus came forward Pybus knows everyone How are you doctor Goldsmith How are you mister Pybus Charmed to see you Whether I am charmed to see you remains to be seen May I ask and don t think it s an impertinent question what you have come for Come for I The doctor threw a glance of interrogation towards Hughes I someone came to my house and said that I was wanted for a case of Old Pybus laid his hand upon the doctor s arm Case of what A case of laudanum poisoning Laudanum poisoning I understood that it was a The doctor ceased Pybus s face had assumed a very singular hue I I hope that I have said nothing No you have said nothing Laudanum poisoning He turned to Hughes So that is it And then to me So that was Aunt Jane s Jalap It s it s rather hard that a man of my years should die of jalap Pybus took a seat The doctor stared at him mister Pybus I hope that nothing is the matter Nothing only I m the man that s poisoned You Me Sam Pybus I ve been dining with a man who asked me to meet his girl and smooth the tabby and he gives me jalap which is another name for laudanum The doctor seemed bewildered I am afraid I don t understand Hughes endeavoured to explain He was suffering as much as either of us The words fell from his stammering lips What mister Pybus says is correct There s been a mistake Yes said Pybus there s been a mistake My friend Lucas thought he was giving his guests Aunt Jane s Jalap and instead of that he was giving them I am afraid through my carelessness pure laudanum Oh it was through your carelessness was it Pybus assumed towards Hughes a little air of ferocity But it soon disappeared But what does it matter if I must die Pure laudanum said the doctor Of what strength The highest possible In what quantity Enough to kill a dozen men A bottleful A bottleful of laudanum The words were uttered by a newcomer a little man who came running in as if he ran a race It was Dunn another doctor who had recently started practice round the corner In appearance he was a complete contrast to Goldsmith He was a little wiry hungry looking man who seemed as though he never could keep still He hurried past Pybus patting him on the shoulder as he went Had Pybus been more himself he would have resented the insult to the death Come my dear sir keep yourself alive That s the great secret let us keep our spirits up he paused in front of Margaret Now my dear young lady don t we feel quite well Just a little out of sorts Come wake up He actually caught Margaret by the shoulder and shook her I don t know what Margaret s feelings were but if I myself had not been quite so prostrate I fancy that I should have let him know that he presumed Then he turned and shook me Come my dear sir wake up wake up wake up We must keep ourselves awake He wheeled round he marched to the couch When he saw missus Chalmers lying on it still in a dead faint so far as I know no one had moved a finger to bring her round he shook his head Serious I am afraid it s very very serious But we will do our best always do our best Let all the servants in the house be summoned and let assistance be given to carry the poor dear sufferers up to their beds The little man took command of everything The servants were summoned and they came trooping in Several other doctors came in also There is no necessity to specify their number Brooks liberally carried out the instructions Hughes had given him He fetched as many as he could There were not one or two but several I have their bills CHAPTER IV THE MISTAKE EXPLAINED I will not dwell upon the dreadful details of that night There are scenes not necessarily pathetic scenes on which a curtain should be drawn Through it all I never once lost consciousness I wish I had One need but allude to the stomach pump to draw up visions from the vasty deep Over such agonies let a veil be drawn This is not an episode of vivisection And afterwards when when a too eager medical man thinking the process had not gone far enough he meant well it was his zeal may he be forgiven tried emetics mustard and water and other preparations from the medical pharmacop oe ia do not let us touch upon these subjects Never when the sea was at its wildest among passengers entirely unused to the mysteries of navigation was ever seen the like I still live and I was through it all It is wonderful what a vigorous constitution will endure missus Chalmers was put into my bedroom There was nothing particular of mine lying about but I would rather they had put her somewhere else Margaret had the best guest room Pybus the second best and I was put into an apartment which had not been occupied for years It was done in the confusion I suppose Looking back I am surprised they did not overlook me altogether I wish they had And all through the night the issue was hanging in the balance Hamlet s question was waiting for an answer To be or not to be What their sufferings were Margaret s her aunt s and Pybus s I can imagine when I let memory hark back to my own But none of them succumbed And in the morning I for one was able to leave my room in fact I insisted on doing so Had I remained any longer in that dreadful chamber I should certainly have died Pale and ghastly with my dressing gown wrapped round my trembling limbs I descended to my snuggery I felt that I was but the wreck of what once I was Hughes was there the sight of me seemed to give him pain well it might and doctor Dunn and doctor Goldsmith and a doctor Casey He was a tall thin man with a serious manner I always think of doctor Casey when I think of mister Stiggins Dunn seemed in quite a cheerful frame of mind Well that s over With a little care mister Lucas you ll forget all about it in a week Never But I did not tell him so And he went on And this all comes of what I venture to call a trifling indiscretion You think it s jalap and it s laudanum Laudanum is not a thing to trifle with said doctor Casey It certainly isn t a thing to drink in pailfuls As he said this doctor Goldsmith rattled his keys and coppers Nor is it to be recommended as a liqueur with dessert eh mister Lucas Dunn rubbed his hands and grinned at me The poor lady said doctor Casey whom I treated found it a very serious matter This was missus Chalmers The sweet young thing said Goldsmith for whom I did my best did not seem to think that the occasion was altogether a festive one and this was how he spoke of her I dare say mister Lucas sniggered Dunn that you have spent far more agreeable nights Dunn was the fiend who had pushed his zeal too far And now he laughed at me doctor Lambert observed doctor Casey who treated the other gentleman assured me that his patient asked him to put him out of his misery rather than push his treatment further That was Pybus I could easily believe it Death was preferable to Dunn s emetics Now where is the bottle which contained the cause of all the mischief The fatal bottle had been brought into my snuggery for safety It was handed to Dunn He sniffed at it Hum He sniffed again Hum He seemed surprised Rather rather an odd smell for laudanum Smell that He handed it to Goldsmith Very sniff odd sniff indeed sniff You are sure it is the bottle There was not the slightest doubt about its being the bottle It was passed to Casey He had a smell This isn t laudanum he declared Not laudanum Back it went to Dunn It doesn t smell like laudanum It isn t laudanum said Goldsmith Not a trace of it said Casey NOT laudanum I looked at Hughes He looked at me Then he staggered towards that fatal bottle Let me let me smell it They let him An extraordinary change came over his countenance as he applied it to his nose He staggered against the wall Good good heavens What was it Had he mistaken the poison Was it strychnine arsenic prussic acid Would the treatment have to be gone through all over again For me death rather than that I see it all cried Hughes I see the mistake I made After all it was not the bottle I supposed I remember now that I placed that upon the shelf above What is it I screamed It s it s what I thought it was What you thought it was It s Aunt Jane s Jalap Aunt Jane s Jalap The words came from the three medical gentlemen in a sort of chorus As for me in spite of my piteous condition I felt inclined to tear my hair and Hughes s I see quite clearly how the mistake arose It was in this way There were two sample bottles of the mixture only in one of them the quantities were wrong I placed it where I generally keep my laudanum so that I shouldn t mistake it And when I found it missing of course I thought it was the laudanum which had gone Was it was it poison Not a bit of it dear boy The finest medicine in the world Only in that particular bottle there was a little too much jalap and taking it on the top of such a dinner as you d been eating it a little upset you that was all That was all I thought of how those doctors had spent the night in practising on us their dreadful arts of their bills and that was all WILLYUM 
7000_83696_000001_000000	train-clean-360	I had been seated in the next chair to hers for at least two minutes I felt that it was time to introduce myself 
7000_83696_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a fine evening 
7000_83696_000003_000000	train-clean-360	She turned she looked me up and down then she looked straight in front of her again 
none	none	I don t know you 
7000_83696_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But I was not to be crushed there was something about the shape of her that which suggested sociability 
7000_83696_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 That is my misfortune rather than my fault 
7000_83696_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know nothing at all about that 
7000_83696_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I do not speak to strangers as a rule 
7000_83696_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Sometimes there s never no knowing who they are 
7000_83696_000008_000000	train-clean-360	I felt that I was getting on so I went on 
7000_83696_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think of the band 
7000_83696_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 It s not loud enough for me 
7000_83696_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I like a band as I can hear 
none	none	One suspected there might be occasions on which one could almost like a band which one could not hear but I did not say so That broke the ice and the conversation drifting on to personal topics she explained to me that she had a young man who so to speak was resting owing to what she called a difference which she had had with him 
7000_83696_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It struck me that the tale as she told it contained elements of tragedy 
7000_83696_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Bakers she observed is what I like 
7000_83696_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I have a sister who likes butchers 
7000_83696_000012_000002	train-clean-360	To me there s always the smell of the meat about a butcher But it s as you re made 
7000_83696_000012_000003	train-clean-360	The worst of bakers is they re such a thirsty lot 
7000_83696_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Possibly I suggested that is in a measure owing to the nature of their occupation 
7000_83696_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That may be but still there is a limit and when a man is always drinking I think it s time for him to stop 
7000_83696_000015_000000	train-clean-360	I thought so too but she went on 
7000_83696_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 My young man his name is Willyum Evans is a baker and him and me have been walking out together four years come next month 
7000_83696_000016_000001	train-clean-360	So I said to him Willyum it s my day out Tuesday 
none	none	I shall expect you to take me somewhere So he said I will So I said Hyde Park Corner half past ten I was there as the clock was striking and a fine scuffle I had to get there too and if you ll believe me he kept me waiting two hours and three quarters by the clock what s over the gatekeeper s lodge which is longer than any gentleman ought to keep a lady waiting I don t care who he is 
7000_83696_000016_000003	train-clean-360	So when he did come I was a bit huffy 
none	none	So I said Well Willyum I hope I ve put you to no hurry and it s a pity you should have troubled yourself to come at this time of day seeing as how I m just off home So he said and he wiped his lips and I could see he had had a moistener if not more It s like this I accidentally had an appointment which was of the nature of business and which I couldn t help and that s how it is I m a little behind I see I said and it had something to do with pint pots I have no doubt So he sat down on a seat which was wet owing to there being a drizzle on and as it seemed silly for me to stand whilst he was sitting I sat down likewise
7000_83696_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 So there we sat neither of us saying nothing till I began to feel a little damp because I had my thin things on and it was beginning to come down heavy 
7000_83696_000018_000001	train-clean-360	So I said Well Willyum have you forgotten it s my day out 
7000_83696_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I thought you was going to take me somewhere He said So I am So I said Where are you going to take me to 
7000_83696_000018_000003	train-clean-360	It s getting on and I m likewise getting wet which I was 
7000_83696_000018_000004	train-clean-360	So he said What do you say to Battersea Park So I said I say nothing 
none	none	And the idea Willyum of your talking about taking me to Battersea Park when as you very well know it is raining cats and dogs is not what I expected because as he could very well see I only had a parasol which was red and the rain was coming through and the colour coming out But he didn t care for the rain no more than nothing because as I tell you he being a baker to him it was a kind of a change
7000_83696_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 You must know that Willyum is that near about money that I never saw nothing like him not that it s a bad thing in a man though it may be carried too far and I must say I do think Willyum do carry it too far He has never given me nothing which he didn t want me to pay for not even half a pint of beer 
none	none	So I was not surprised when he said The fact is Matilda which is me I haven t got no money Well I said that s a nice thing to promise to take me out and then to have no money So he said If you was to pay the expenses for both the two of us it might make things more pleasant So I said No I thank you because I had been had that way before and more than once So I got up and I said Well Willyum I will now wish you a good day because I have been here since half past ten and it is now past two and my clothes is sticking to me and I don t care to stop no longer So he said Now Matilda don t you get disagreeable which I was beginning to feel it and so I own
7000_83696_000019_000003	train-clean-360	 We are both of us having a day out he said and don t let no bad tempers spoil our pleasure 
7000_83696_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I may have some money somewhere unbeknown to myself so I will look and see though I must say I do think it hard that all the expenses should be borne by me 
none	none	So he begins feeling in his pockets and presently he gives a kind of a start and he brings out half a crown There he said is half a crown and if you put five shillings to it it will make it seven and six
7000_83696_000020_000003	train-clean-360	 No I said 
none	none	I shall put no five shillings of mine to no half crown of yours and so the least said the soonest mended And if you don t mind I will go and get myself something to eat being hungry and having I am thankful to say money of my own with which to pay for it Then he gives another kind of start and he says There If I didn t make a pasty for you last night with my own hands and I ve been sitting on it all the time which he had and anything like the mess he d made of it you never saw 
7000_83696_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He held it out to me 
none	none	No I said I thank you 
7000_83696_000020_000005	train-clean-360	I am particular about my vittles and I never eat no scraps and still less things what have been sat down upon Well he said it s a pity it should be wasted I ll eat it myself Which he did and me standing in the rain there looking on 
7000_83696_000020_000006	train-clean-360	That did put my back up 
7000_83696_000020_000007	train-clean-360	 mister Evans I said short and sharp I wish you a good day 
7000_83696_000020_000008	train-clean-360	I am going So I goes 
none	none	And he comes running after me picking at the bits of pasty what was stuck to the paper I must say this for Willyum that it takes a deal to get his temper up 
7000_83696_000020_000010	train-clean-360	So I pulls up 
none	none	Now let us understand each other Willyum if you please are you going to pay for something for me to eat or are you not He gives himself a kind of a shake so as to get his courage up and he says You shall have anything you like to eat at my expense Matilda so long as the cost does not exceed then he hesitated ninepence Then he gave himself another kind of shake which I took as a sign that his courage was running down for both the two of us
7000_83696_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 That made me fairly wild it really did 
none	none	To think that he had promised to take me somewhere and that I had been more than three hours there in the rain and got wet through and my things all spoiled which it was a new dress I had on what I had got special for the occasion and it had only come home from the dressmaker s the day before and the colour was coming out of my parasol which was likewise new and my hair all coming out of curl and me feeling as limp as a rag and starving hungry and that he should want to put me off with fourpence halfpenny worth of food drawn from him as if it were his eye tooth it did make me feel really wild
7000_83696_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I never said a word to him but I walks right out of the park 
none	none	He comes running after me and he catches hold of my arm and he says Now Matilda what did I say just now about letting no bad tempers spoil our pleasure I said I don t know what your idea of pleasure is but it isn t mine and as I don t want to have no more to do with you mister Evans perhaps you will be so kind as to let me go But he holds on to me all the tighter and he says I tell you what Matilda a idea has just come into my head My brother as you have heard me talk about lives close by here we will go and dine with him 
7000_83696_000022_000002	train-clean-360	He being a married man and with a comfortable home he will be glad to see us 
7000_83696_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I didn t know what to do not liking to have no quarrel with him in the street so off we starts for his brother s 
none	none	He took me to a mews what led out of Park Lane and as we was turning the corner he said There s only this one thing about my brother him and me has had a little difference of opinion and he is not of a forgiving disposition So I said Now Willyum what do you mean by that So he said No thirty two on the other side is where he lives and if you was to go on and knock at the door and ask for missus Henry Evans what is my brother s wife so to speak it might smooth the way So I said I do not understand you 
7000_83696_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Just now you was saying as how your brother would be glad to see us 
none	none	Are you now insinuating otherwise He catches a glimpse of my eye and he sees the kind of mood I was in and he plucks up and he walks on and he says We will hope for the best 
7000_83696_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Do not let us spoil our day s pleasure by no disagreeable observations 
none	none	There is never no knowing what might happen All of a sudden he cries out There is my brother 
7000_83696_000023_000006	train-clean-360	Now Matilda don t you let him start hitting me And he jumps behind me so as to get into the shadow as it were 
7000_83696_000023_000007	train-clean-360	So I says Willyum whatever is the matter now Your conduct do seem to me to be of the most extraordinary character 
none	none	And there was a great big giant of a man on the other side of the road washing a carriage with a bucket of water and I don t know what and as I moves on one side he catches sight of Willyum and anything like the way in which he started swearing you never heard Hollo he says there s that putty faced brother of mine 
7000_83696_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I ve been looking for you for some time 
none	none	Here s something for you Willyum And before I had no idea of what he was going to do he catches up the bucket of water and he throws it over Willyum and some of it went over me 
7000_83696_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Oh dear me you never saw nothing like the mess that I was in 
7000_83696_000024_000004	train-clean-360	And he grabs hold of Willyum by the collar and he says Hang me if I don t wipe down the street with you And he shouts out Enrietta here s Brother Willyum 
none	none	Haven t you got anything for him You bet your life he s come for something And a window opens over the way and a woman puts her head out and she empties something out of a pail over Willyum and again some of it went over me Oh dear oh dear And that giant of a man he set about Willyum something cruel and all the mews was in a uproar and I hurried away as hard as ever I could I was that frightened and I got into a cab just as I was and you should have seen how the cabman stared and drove right away to a sister of mine what lives at Camberwell and I nearly cried my eyes out and I ve never spoken to Willyum nor set eyes on him since then which it s a fortnight the day after to morrow and if you had been in my place and had been treated as I was would you have let things go on as usual just as if there hadn t been no difference 
7000_83696_000025_000000	train-clean-360	No I said I should not 
none	none	I should have insisted on their going on in quite a different kind of way And so I told her HIS FIRST EXPERIMENT CHAPTER I THE LADY Last winter George Pownceby spent some weeks at the Empire Hotel One morning he was coming along the corridor leading from the smoking room when he met missus Pratt The lady stopped What is that you have in your hand she asked mister Pownceby had in his hand a slim pamphlet in a green paper cover He held it up I ve got it No Yes Oh I say These remarks are not given here as examples of English conversation but with a view of presenting the reader with an accurate report of what was spoken There was a pause Then the lady said with great solemnity You don t mean to say that it has actually come I do mister Pownceby held out the slim pamphlet at arm s length in front of him He pointed at it with the index finger of his other hand How to Hypnotise A Practical Treatise Hints to Amateurs With full instructions for marvellous experiments Price sevend post free eight stamps Oh mister Pownceby I am so sorry Sorry missus Pratt Why it was at your instigation I plunged to the extent of those eight stamps But you don t understand my husband s coming I have to meet him at the station at twelve point thirty two mister Pownceby stroked his moustache there was not much but he was fond of stroking what there was of it missus Pratt s husband had been rather a joke People who winter in hotels are as a rule quite prepared to be epigrammatic at the expense of a pretty married woman whose husband is not in evidence And missus Pratt s husband had not been in evidence as yet I don t quite follow you mister Pownceby spoke with a little malice Whence your sorrow Because your husband is coming by the twelve point thirty two Don t you see I want to be the first to be experimented on I ve been waiting for that book two days and now it just comes when I can t stay Don t you think there s time Come into my sitting room They went into her sitting room When they were there the lady again assailed the gentleman with the inquiry Don t you think there s time It depends I think you re going too fast To commence with I ve been looking through the thing in the smoking room and I believe it s a swindle A swindle Oh don t say that It s nothing but a hash of old mesmeric tricks I ve seen performed at country fairs But doesn t it tell you how to do them It pretends to It gives some ridiculous directions but I don t believe they can be done that way Try do on me mister Pownceby laughed missus Pratt amused him and not for the first time either To begin with we have to sit face to face and stare at each other for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Come along Let s begin The lady brought forward a couple of chairs and they sat down on them face to face and very close together Opening the pamphlet mister Pownceby searched for further instructions You re not staring at me remarked the lady Half a minute I m looking for what comes next What does it say Read it aloud After I ve stared at you long enough It doesn t sound civil does it Never mind the civility go on After I ve stared at you long enough you begin to feel queer Then mister Pownceby read from the pamphlet Place the thumb of your left hand on the subject s forehead you re the subject just above the nose and level with the eyebrows missus Pratt placed her pretty little hand above her pretty little nose to point out the exact spot denoted mister Pownceby read on This is the locality of the Phrenological Organ of Individuality Is it said missus Pratt in an awe struck whisper The reader continued Rest the ends of your fingers on the top of the subject s head At the same time take hold of the left hand with your right hand applying the inside part of your thumb to the middle of the palm of the hand I m punctuating this interpolated mister Pownceby as I go on The man who printed it seems to have had a fount of type containing no other stops but commas The object of this is for the operator to get in contact with two very important nerves that pass in the palm of the hand which are called Ulnar and Median nerves I don t know if that s true or what it means but it says so here with your left hand still keeping the thumb on the forehead between the eyes and the fingers resting on the subject s head which must be inclined slightly back Say Look into my eyes After gazing in his eyes intently for a few seconds say in a loud clear firm tone of voice Close your eyes quite tight Let him remain a few seconds like this and the trick is done There s a lot more nonsense to follow but when you ve remained for a few seconds like that you re supposed to be mesmerised or hypnotised or whatever they call the thing Really It sounds quite simple It does simple folly Hush You shouldn t speak like that Perhaps if you don t believe you mayn t succeed It says something to that effect in these precious pages Then try to believe Let us begin They began The lady was preternaturally solemn but the gentleman was tortured by a desire to smile He felt that the lady might resent his laughter Under these circumstances the ten minutes stare was trying missus Pratt had sweet blue eyes which were large and round the sort of eyes which the average man would not object to stare at for ten minutes or even longer As the appointed space of time drew to a conclusion even mister Pownceby became reconciled to his lot He placed his left thumb on the lady s forehead above her nose Is that level with my eyebrows she inquired He reproved her I don t think you ought to speak You destroy the connection missus Pratt was dumb mister Pownceby proceeded in accordance with the directions contained in the pamphlet He rested the tips of his fingers on the top of the lady s head He took hold of her left hand with his right He applied the inside part of his thumb to the centre of her palm He said to her Look into my eyes She looked into his eyes her head inclined a little backwards This part of the proceedings was so far as the gentleman was concerned on the whole agreeable He gazed fixedly into her pretty eyes Then he added in a loud clear firm tone of voice Close your eyes quite tight She closed her eyes There was a pause for a few seconds Remembering the instructions contained in the pamphlet he proceeded another step You cannot open your eyes he said Your eyes are fast quite fast The pamphlet had it Should the subject be very sensitive he will be unable to open them Apparently the subject though in this case feminine was very sensitive At least missus Pratt kept her eyes shut fast mister Pownceby was a little startled He removed his touch from her brow and released her hand missus Pratt are you hypnotised already missus Pratt was silent missus Pratt you don t mean you re really hypnotised Still silence He leant forward and stared at the lady not in the same way he had done before but quite as fixedly By Jove I believe she is He got up from the chair He glanced at the pamphlet He wanted to know how to reverse the process how to bring the lady to again This is a pretty state of things The thing is not such a swindle as I thought it was But it s all nonsense She can t be magnetised or mesmerised or hypnotised or whatever it is If she is the thing s as easy as winking If I d only known it I d have been mesmerising people since the days of childhood missus Pratt But missus Pratt was silent If she was not hypnotised then she was in some condition which was equally curious She sat back in her chair with her face turned up to the ceiling in a state of the most complete quiescence Something in her appearance struck mister Pownceby as even unpleasantly odd He recommenced searching down the page of the green covered pamphlet for the reversal process It was beautifully simple In order to release him the pamphlet said throughout the writer had taken it for granted that the subject would be masculine blow a sharp cold wind from your mouth on his eyes and say with authority Now you can open them Repeat if necessary It is important to recollect that a cold wind blown from the operator destroys the effect and demagnetises One could not but suspect that some subjects might not like this But its simplicity was charming If that was all that was necessary then so far as mister Pownceby was concerned the whole science of hypnotism was already mastered He approached missus Pratt He bent over her devoutly hoping that no one might enter the room as he was engaged in doing so Quite a shock went through him as he advanced his face towards hers the expression of her countenance was so very much like death He blew a cold wind on her eyes those pretty blue eyes whose cerulean hue he had veiled Now you can open them The words were spoken with as much authority as he could muster in the then agitated state of his mind but missus Pratt did not open them The pamphlet said Repeat if necessary mister Pownceby repeated He blew and he blew He blew the cold wind all out of him so that the beads of perspiration stood upon his brow but still the subject gave no signs missus Pratt missus Pratt I say missus Pratt for heaven s sake do look at me All signs of authority had gone from him now But wind and voice alike were ineffectual Apparently it was easier to hypnotise than to do the other thing In his trouble mister Pownceby told himself that the writer of that pamphlet was well untrustworthy Or else something had gone wrong in the working But what could it be He looked at his watch Half past twelve I shall have her husband here directly I imagine that he will make some observations if he finds his wife like this Such a contingency was only to be expected When a man after long absence from his wife returns to find a stranger experimenting on her and she in a hypnotic condition from which the stranger cannot release her his first feelings towards that stranger are not in civilised countries invariably friendly mister Pownceby when he had blown the cold wind all out of him arrived at a resolution I will tell Doris I must get her to help me It is quite certain that whatever happens I mustn t let that man come and find me alone with his wife It was only the dread of such a catastrophe that brought him to the sticking point of his resolution Miss Haseltine christened Doris was mister Pownceby s betrothed She also was wintering in the hotel with her mamma mister Pownceby was aware even painfully aware that the young lady s feelings towards missus Pratt were not of the warmest possible kind He was equally conscious that her impression was that his feelings were if anything too warm He would rather anything had happened almost than that he should have been reduced to the necessity of acquainting Miss Haseltine with the situation he was in But it was certainly impossible for him to allow the returning husband to come in and find him there alone with his wife and she apparently in a chronic hypnotic condition So he went in search of the young lady Of course he found her where he would have least wished to find her in the drawing room with the ladies He had to call her out and at first she wouldn t come But as it would have been impossible for him to tell his tale in the presence of a dozen sharp eared and sharp tongued women he protested that there was something of the utmost importance which he must say to her alone Well what is it she asked directly he had got her outside the door He perceived that she was not in one of her sentimental moods Perhaps something in his manner had roused her suspicions missus Pratt has fainted Indeed What has that to do with me Let her faint She looks to me as though she were the sort of person who could faint at pleasure Doris for goodness sake hear me out I want your help It s through me she s fainted Pray what do you mean It s it s this confounded thing mister Pownceby held out the slim green covered pamphlet You know I told you I d written for that pamphlet How to Hypnotise Well the thing came this morning here it is I ve been experimenting on her and I ve not only hypnotised her but by George I can t get her round again A pretty state of things upon my word Don t pitch into me now Doris don t There she is in her sitting room in a fit or something I don t know what s the matter with her and her husband s coming this morning He is coming at last is he I expect him every moment he s due at twelve point thirty two She seems to have told you all about it She told me so much at any rate I know I ve been an ass I can see that now but lend me a hand first and let me have it afterwards I was obliged to come to you I couldn t let him find me alone with her in such a state as that Come and see what you can do for her there s a darling do After all it s for me you know not her Miss Haseltine yielded so far as to advance with him along the corridor There was a fresh arrival when they reached the hall a gentleman He was speaking to the young lady who acted as book keeper through the office window My name is Pratt Gilead J Pratt I believe my wife is staying here mister Pownceby clutched Miss Haseltine s arm It s he he whispered There is a missus Pratt staying here replied the book keeper Her sitting room is No thirteen The new arrival was about to be ushered into No thirteen when mister Pownceby interposed He hurried across the hall and touched him on the shoulder Excuse me may I speak to you My name is Pownceby The new arrival turned and faced him As he did so mister Pownceby perceived a little dimly perhaps what sort of a man he was He was of medium height slightly built about forty years of age very dark with a clean shaven face and a pair of keen black eyes which looked at mister Pownceby as though they meant to pierce him Delighted to hear you speak or any man even if his name s not Pownceby Directly the words were spoken mister Pownceby became conscious that the new arrival was an American I believe you are mister Pratt missus Pratt s husband I am worse luck Eh she intended to meet you at twelve point thirty two She did did she That s her all through As she used to be She never did get farther than intentions It is about two years since I saw her and I don t see her now Have you a message to deliver Does she desire that I should go away for another two years If so I m willing As this was said out loud without the slightest attempt at concealment so that every word was audible not only to mister Pownceby to whom the remarks were addressed but also to Miss Haseltine and the book keeper and the porter and the boots and the waiter and the chambermaid and any other straggler who might happen to be within fifty yards or so it would seem that in her husband missus Pratt possessed a man of character But mister Pownceby was not fond of such publicity Can I say a word to you alone No sir you cannot If you have a message from my wife say it If not lead on to No thirteen The fact is mister Pratt eh missus Pratt is not eh quite well Is that so I m glad to hear it It s a comfort to know that only sickness would keep her from her husband though it wouldn t need much of that to keep her from a chance of seeing me The fact is I wish mister Pratt you would let me speak to you alone No sir I will not If she s dead don t spare my feelings If she has left me for a better man don t spare my feelings either The fact is she s in a hypnotic state In a what state A hypnotic state What state s that Hypnotic s a new word it s been brought in lately it means mesmeric mister Pratt paused before replying He looked mister Pownceby up and down Look here mister I think you mentioned Pownceby I don t know who you are but you seem a friendly kind of man Take my advice and get something off your chest I see you ve got it on mister Pownceby smiled rather faintly He did not lack presence of mind as a rule though just then the situation was as much as he could manage He made a dash at it I wish you would give me half a minute alone but since you will not I must try to tell my story where we are You see this book mister Pownceby held up the fatal treatise It contains instructions for the performance of mesmeric experiments missus Pratt insisted on my performing one of them on her I succeeded in producing the mesmeric state but I I couldn t get her out of it There was a curious twinkle in mister Pratt s eyes I don t catch on he said I say that I hypnotised her that is produced the mesmeric state but that I I couldn t get her out of it Well She s in it now In what The mesmeric state Does she seem to like it That is more than I can say I had just induced Miss Haseltine to come to my assistance when we were so fortunate as to encounter you Then I am to understand that when she ought to have been at the depot looking out for me she was engaged in looking out for the mesmeric state along with you is that so I m afraid it is Where is she In her sitting room No thirteen Lead on to No thirteen The procession started The waiter went first mister Pratt next and after him Miss Haseltine and mister Pownceby Miss Haseltine s demeanour was severe Either her severity or something else seemed to weigh upon her lover who did not appear to be altogether at his ease They reached No thirteen The waiter knocked There was no reply He knocked again still no reply mister Pratt turned towards mister Pownceby I guess she s still in that state of yours I think we ll all go in He turned the handle of the door and entered I guess she s quitted The room was empty CHAPTER II AND THE GENTLEMAN It was undoubtedly the case unless they were to suppose that she had hidden under the sofa or behind the curtains mister Pownceby looked about him conscious of a slight feeling of bewilderment There were the two chairs exactly as he left them but the one which missus Pratt had occupied was vacant It s very odd he murmured How She was certainly unconscious when I left her Perhaps the knowledge that she was failing in her duty as a wife came to her in that mesmeric state came to her so strongly that she started off to the depot just then and there to look for me If she s at the depot now in the state you say she was I guess she ll soon be popular Don t you think I d better go and look for her I do not If she s gone she s gone and if she comes back again she comes but I m not the man to put my friends out for a trifle My friend if you will allow me to call you so give me your hand Before mister Pownceby was quite aware of it mister Pratt had possession of his hand I thank you You have placed me under an obligation to you this day But it may be that I shall cry you evens yet Let s liquor Perhaps the young lady will pool in Miss Haseltine however making some inaudible remark having reference to her mamma vanished out of sight mister Pratt was not at all abashed He addressed the waiters Champagne a large bottle and a bucket of ice mister Pownceby protested You are very kind but I don t drink at this hour of the day and only so mister Pratt cut him short Fetch the drink The waiter fled If after performing those pleasing experiments on the wife you refuse to drink with the husband I shall take it quite unkindly But don t you think some inquiries ought to be made for missus Pratt I do not What I do think is that I ought to cultivate your friendship now that I have the chance A man who knows the wife so well should know something of the husband too The drink came mister Pratt saw two bumpers filled mister Pownceby who was an abstemious man had a difficulty in escaping being compelled to drain his draught Bring another bottle when I ring said mister Pratt as the waiter left the room The two gentlemen were left alone mister Pownceby still did not feel quite easy in his mind Champagne generally disagreed with him at any time always in the morning He had some glimmerings of an idea that if he refused to drink mister Pratt would seek in his refusal an occasion to quarrel He had heard and read of some curious customs in the States how for instance to refuse under certain circumstances to drink with a citizen of the Great Republic was to place on him an insult which could only be wiped out by blood blood in which six shooters played a part He half suspected that mister Pratt was a citizen like that Certainly he was unlike any American he had seen His indifference to his wife s fate was almost brutal mister Pownceby felt this but he also felt that it was impossible for him to insist on making inquiries if the husband declined to sanction them Nor was his uneasiness lessened by mister Pratt s appearance of entire ease That gentleman leaned back in his chair the one his wife had occupied his summer coat unbuttoned his hat tilted on to the back of his head So you hypnotised my wife mister Pownceby smiled faintly the subject was beginning to be unpleasant Hypnotise me mister Pownceby started I suppose you re joking Why My wife had an inquiring mind why shouldn t I have too Perhaps you prefer trying those sort of experiments on wives rather than on their husbands mister Pownceby was not quite sure if this remark was intended disagreeably It made him wince Perhaps you think I have been trying these experiments all my life Until this pamphlet was brought by this morning s post I knew no more about hypnotism than you do My first experiment was tried at her own urgent request upon your wife I take after her I m fond of experiments too That book must be a treasure Oblige me with a glance at it mister Pownceby handed it to him mister Pratt began reading at the end There s a nice little bit as a finish mister Pratt read it aloud In conclusion I would earnestly ask all my readers to remember that this valuable science should not be abused especially in the case of females and that in all cases when making experiments they should have friends or other persons present That s sound advice Did you notice it I I think it caught my eye mister Pownceby seemed a little fidgety mister Pratt turned to the beginning I see it mentions that the subject is to stare at the operator and the operator is to stare at the subject for about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Did you work the thing like that I followed to the best of my ability the instructions contained in the pamphlet Did you stare at my wife It sounds uncivil but I m afraid I did For ten minutes or a quarter of an hour About that And did my wife stare at you mister Pownceby laughed He was conscious that mister Pratt s line of examination was tending to place him in a false position I perceive you ve marked this work with your pencil where it says Place the thumb of your left hand on the subject s forehead just above the nose and level with the eyebrows Did you place the thumb of your left hand on my wife s forehead just above the nose level with the eyebrows Really mister Pratt I can only say that with the view of making a little experiment I followed to the best of my ability the instructions generally You seem to have seen the thing well through It says that you ve next to rest the ends of your fingers on the top of the subject s head Did you rest the ends of your fingers on the top of my wife s head You may take it for granted that I did whatever the book directs May I That s kind You increase my sense of obligation Then you re to say to the subject Look into my eyes Did you ask my wife to look into your eyes I did certainly Certainly Of course You re thorough like the book The man who put this book together had seen it done before Then you re to say Close your eyes quite tight Did you tell my wife to close her eyes quite tight I did It was at that point that she went off into the hypnotic state Was it now This is really interesting And what did you do next I tried to bring her to Now hark at that And after all the trouble you had taken to send her off And did she come I am sorry to say as I have already explained to you that my efforts were not attended with success That was mean of her real mean And I suppose that when you were performing these little experiments of yours upon my wife this room was filled with a large assemblage We were alone together I wish now it had been otherwise Why After the questions you have already put to me that needs no answer Think not Well let me fill up your glass for you mister Pownceby I am obliged to you but must beg you to excuse me Is that so You don t show yourself so friendly towards me as towards my wife Perhaps mister Pownceby you re not aware that for the last two years I ve been trotting round the world picking up the pieces to throw into her lap She s English and I m American She s not at all times fond of me and we sometimes differ but I love her in my way So you may think that when the first thing I hear when I come to catch a sight of her after a two years parting is this little tale of yours I find it a pleasing tale entirely I find it that I do assure you Now the only thing I should like you to do would be to play those little tricks on me which you played upon my wife I should like to be hypnotised uncommonly If I were to attempt to do so I don t think that I should succeed But in any case after my experience of this morning it will be a long time before I make any more experiments on any one Is that so Think it over mister Pownceby while I lock this door and slip the key into my pocket mister Pratt locked the door and slipped as he called it the key into his pocket mister Pratt I insist upon your unlocking that door mister Pownceby I was raised out West and I was raised fighting and I learnt to smell a fight when it was coming and there s as big a fight now coming as ever I yet smelt Why do you use this language sir to me It s my ignorance may be But in those parts where I was raised when one man played upon another man s wife the tricks you ve played on mine it generally ended up in fighting You bet it s going to end in fighting now mister Pownceby made a movement towards the bell mister Pratt sprang in front of him You can ring the bell sir afterwards but first you ll listen to me They ll have to break the door down to get into this room and that ll be a scandal and while they re breaking it down I ll be whipping you You d better take it fighting I ve got a shooter Putting his hand to his pistol pocket mister Pratt flashed the barrel of a revolver in mister Pownceby s face But I know your English notions and I don t want to use it in a little affair like this Let s strip to the waist and clear the furniture out of the middle of the room and have a little prize fight all to ourselves Do you take me for a madman mister Pratt If you don t immediately unlock the door I shall summon assistance and if you use any violence towards me I shall give you into the charge of the police Is that your line That s mine Dropping the hand which held the revolver mister Pratt delivered with his left Delivered so neatly in the centre of mister Pownceby s forehead that that gentleman was hurled backwards on to the floor If you like you can take it lying down and you can summon assistance while you are taking it but you ll take it somehow that you bet mister Pownceby lying on the floor looked up at mister Pratt standing over him Let me get up He got up The blow had cut the skin and the blood was trickling through With his handkerchief he staunched the flow In America mister Pratt they may think the sort of thing that you propose heroic In England they consider a row of any sort ridiculous Consider It isn t what they consider I m thinking of it s how you re going to take it mister Pownceby fixed his glance on mister Pratt s keen black eyes He smiled Take it I ll take it fighting like the converter of Colonel Quagg I thought you would I smelt it coming on As he spoke mister Pratt placed his revolver on the mantelshelf mister Pownceby was still smiling Do you propose to settle it now I do I propose to settle it before you leave this room In that case don t you think we d better pull the blind down or people walking on the terrace will be able to see the fun If we are going to make asses of ourselves we may as well do it as far as possible in private mister Pratt pulled the blind down The sun was shining outside The room was still quite light I guess said mister Pratt we had better clear the furniture out of the middle of the room mister Pownceby assisted him in doing so what little there was to clear The bottle of champagne and the two glasses they placed with the revolver on the mantelshelf They then proceeded to strip As they were doing so mister Pownceby asked a question How shall we manage about time We will call time when we feel we want it You understand this is not only a fight it s a whipping I m whipping you mister Pownceby smiled as he answered I understand exactly When they were in position there was not much so far as appearance went for a lover of the fancy to choose between the two Now that they were peeled both seemed thoroughly fit as fit almost as though they had been trained mister Pownceby was fair mister Pratt was dark that was about the only difference Both would have turned the scale at something near eleven stone and both measured something under five foot eight Nor did it take long to show that both could use their hands There was none of that waiting for each other which so often tries the patience of the spectators round a ring mister Pratt came at once to business with perhaps rather too much self confidence He was apparently under the impression that it was going to be a case of whipping his opponent from the first which was the reason doubtless that mister Pownceby succeeded in returning the compliment which had been paid himself and landing mister Pratt upon his back That gentleman seemed surprised I say he asked lying where he had fallen what s this mister Pownceby replied politely I hope I haven t hurt you You haven t hurt me much You ve surprised me more I reckon we ll continue The proceedings recommenced But this time mister Pratt had changed his tactics Instead of coming up with the apparent intention of wiping his opponent off the face of the earth with a single blow he played his game more cautiously He fenced but becoming tired of this and feeling possibly that the whipping was not proceeding fast enough he led off with his right and followed on with his left and mister Pownceby countered and returned returned with such effect that for half a minute mister Pratt was dancing about while mister Pownceby was performing on him much in the fashion which the regimental drummer beats to quarters on his drum Time he cried The round was over A pause ensued during which his feelings were plainly too deep for words Have you ever had a whipping before he asked mister Pownceby smiled it was evident that his smile was a smile of enjoyment at last One or two he said Like this Not exactly In England we don t as a rule indulge in this form of amusement in the private sitting room of an hotel Don t you Well it s as well I smelt that a big fight was coming and it s come I m going to enjoy myself entirely You ve closed up one of my eyes I should say from the feel of it for ever You ve broken the bridge of my nose what there ll be to pay for the blood upon the carpet there s a quart gone from me already is more than I quite care to think Before I ve finished whipping you I reckon I ll be slain Come mister Pratt don t you think this foolish business had better cease If you require an apology I am willing to tender one in any form you like What passed between your wife and myself was simply in the nature of a little scientific experiment It ll be in the nature of a little scientific experiment what s going to pass between us too I m fond of experiments as well as you Time mister Pratt fell into position He struck at mister Pownceby mister Pownceby laughed as he warded off the blow Come mister Pratt why will you persist in this absurdity I m going to whip you sir In that case you really must excuse me for putting on the steam If a waiter or someone were to come and find me engaged like this I should never hear the last of it as long as I lived Here goes It went He had been warding off mister Pratt s blows while he was speaking When he ceased the battle really joined mister Pratt s guards were nowhere In spite of all that he could do to save himself his antagonist proceeded to administer severe punishment in thoroughly workmanlike style The blows rang out upon his head and body mister Pownceby wound up with one under the chin which lifted him off his feet and laid him on his back He lay where he fell The blow had knocked him senseless mister Pownceby proceeded to revive him with the remains of the champagne This he murmured opening his eyes and looking up is nice mister Pownceby propped him up upon a chair You compelled me to rush the thing but I hope I haven t hurt you much Well said mister Pratt you haven t killed me quite I never enjoyed whipping a man so much before Say stranger is this the first little fight you ve had I ve sparred for the amateur championship and won it twice I m going in for it again next week You might have mentioned that before the game began If the inherent absurdity of your proposal could not deter you I doubt if any information I might have imparted would have been of much avail There s something in that Time mister Pratt rose from his chair He stood on his feet rather doubtfully What do you mean asked mister Pownceby I m going on whipping you Look here mister Pratt each time you stand up I shall simply knock you down again Of course you can go on with that sort of thing as long as you like That is so I can And that s a sort of thing of which one doesn t care to get more than enough mister Pratt rested his hand on the back of a chair It seemed as though without some support of that kind he could not stand mister Pownceby advanced to him mister Pratt give me your hand mister Pratt gave it to him it would seem mechanically The two men stood looking at each other in silence the one almost without a scratch the other a battered ruin While they were so engaged the latch of the French window was opened from without the blind was thrust aside and a lady entered It was missus Pratt When she saw what met her eyes she stared which as a breach of good manners was under the circumstances excusable mister Pownceby Gilead What have you been doing I ve been whipping him said mister Pratt I must be off my ordinary for I never whipped a man that way before mister Pownceby slipped on his jacket He helped mister Pratt to put on his It s my fault missus Pratt When I told your husband of our little experiment and that I found myself unable to release you from the hypnotic state which I had induced he thought I must have done you a serious injury and that he naturally resented missus Pratt looked at mister Pownceby There was a twinkle of intelligence in her sweet blue eyes I see Miss Haseltine is looking for you You ll find her in the drawing room Thank you said mister Pownceby I I ll go and look for her As he sneaked out of the room with his shirt and waistcoat under his arm devoutly hoping that no one might encounter him on his journey to his own apartment he heard missus Pratt make this remark to her husband the first after two years absence So Gilead you ve been at it again He heard mister Pratt reply I have I was raised fighting and I reckon that fighting I shall die If I have to whip that Pownceby again it is a certainty I shall AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS CHAPTER I THE PROMISE An old fashioned Christmas A lively family will accept a gentleman as paying guest to join them in spending an old fashioned Christmas in the heart of the country That was the advertisement It had its points I was not sure what in this case an old fashioned Christmas might happen to mean I imagine there were several kinds of old fashioned Christmases but it could hardly be worse than a chop in my chambers or horror of horrors at the club or my cousin Lucy s notion of what she calls the festive season Festive Yes She and her husband who suffers from melancholia and all the other complaints which flesh is heir to and I dragging through what I call a patent medicine dinner and talking of everybody who is dead and gone or else going and of nothing else So I wrote to the advertiser The reply was written in a sprawling feminine hand It was a little vague It appeared that the terms would be five guineas but there was no mention of the length of time which that fee would cover I might arrive it seemed on Christmas Eve but there was no hint as to when I was to go if ever The whole thing was a trifle odd There was nothing said about the sort of accommodation which would be provided nothing about the kind of establishment which was maintained or the table which was kept No references were offered or asked for It was merely stated that we re a very lively family and that if you re lively yourself you ll get on uncommonly well The letter was signed Madge Wilson Now it is a remarkable thing that I have always had an extraordinary predilection for the name Madge I do not know why I have never known a Madge And yet from my boyhood upward I have desired to meet one Here was an opportunity offered She was apparently the careworn mother of a lively family Under such circumstances she was hardly likely to be lively herself but her name was Madge and it was the accident of her Christian name which decided me to go I had no illusions No doubt the five guineas were badly wanted even a lively family would be hardly likely to advertise for a perfect stranger to spend Christmas with them if they were not I did not expect a princely entertainment Still I felt that it could hardly be worse than a chop or cousin Lucy the subjects of her conversation I never cared about when they were alive and I certainly do not want to talk about them now they are dead As for the pills and drops with which her husband doses himself between the courses it makes me ill even to think of them On Christmas Eve the weather was abominable All night it had been blowing and raining In the morning it began to freeze By the time the streets were like so many skating rinks it commenced to snow And it kept on snowing that turned out to be quite a record in the way of snow storms Hardly the sort of weather to start for an unknown destination in the heart of the country But at the last moment I did not like to back out I said I would go and I meant to go I had been idiot enough to load myself with a lot of Christmas presents without the faintest notion why I had not given a Christmas present for years there had been no one to give them to Lucy cannot bear such trifling and her husband s only notion of a present at any time was a gallon jar of somebody s Stomach Stirrer I am no dealer in poisons I knew nothing of the people I was going to The youngest member of the family might be twenty or the oldest ten No doubt the things I had bought would be laughed at probably I should never venture to offer them Still if you have not tried your hand at that kind of thing for ever so long the mere act of purchasing is a pleasure That is a fact I had never enjoyed shopping so much since I was a boy I felt quite lively myself as I mingled with the Christmas crowd looking for things which might not turn out to be absolutely preposterous I even bought something for Madge I mean missus Wilson Of course I knew that I had no right to do anything of the kind and was aware that the chances were a hundred to one against my ever presuming to hint at its existence I was actually ass enough to buy something for her husband two things indeed alternatives as it were a box of cigars if he turned out to be a smoker and a case of whiskey if he didn t I hoped to goodness that he would not prove to be a hypochondriac like Lucy s husband I would not give him pills What the lively family would think of a perfect stranger arriving burdened with rubbish as if he had known them all their lives I did not dare to think No doubt they would set him down as a lunatic right away It was a horrible journey The trains were late and of course overcrowded there was enough luggage in our compartment to have filled it and still there was one more passenger than there ought to have been an ill conditioned old fellow who wanted my hat box put into the van because it happened to tumble off the rack on to his head I pointed out to him that the rack was specially constructed for light luggage that a hat box was light luggage and that if the train jolted he ought to blame the company not me He was impervious to reason His wrangling and jangling so upset me that I went past the station at which I ought to have changed Then I had to wait three quarters of an hour for a train to take me back again only to find that I had missed the one I intended to catch So I had to cool my heels for two hours and a half in a wretched cowshed amidst a bitter whirling snowstorm It is some satisfaction for me to be able to reflect that I made it warm for the officials however cold I might have been myself When the train did start some forty minutes after scheduled time it jolted along in a laborious fashion at the rate of about six miles an hour stopping at every roadside hovel I counted seven in a distance I am convinced of less than twenty miles When at last I reached Crofton my journey s end it turned out that the station staff consisted of a half witted individual who was stationmaster porter and clerk combined and a hulking lad who did whatever else there was to do No one had come to meet me the village was about half a mile and Hangar Dene the house for which my steps were bent about four miles by the road how far it was across ploughed fields my informant did not mention There was a trap at the Boy and Blunderbuss but that required fetching Finally the hulking lad was dispatched It took him some time considering the distance was only about half a mile When the trap did appear it looked to me uncommonly like an open spring cart In it I was deposited with my luggage The snow was still descending in whirling clouds Never shall I forget the drive in that miserable cart through the storm and those pitch black country lanes We had been jogging along some time before the driver opened his mouth Be you going to stop with they Wilsons I am Ah There was something in the tone of his Ah which whetted my curiosity near the end of my tether though I was Why do you ask It be about time as someone were to stay with them as were a bit capable like I did not know what he meant I did not ask I was beyond it I was chilled to the bone wet tired hungry I had long been wishing that an old fashioned Christmas had been completely extinct before I had thought of adventuring in quest of one Better cousin Lucy s notion of the festive season We passed through a gate which I had to get down to open along some sort of avenue Suddenly the cart pulled up Here we be That might be so It was a pity he did not add where here was There was a great shadow which possibly did duty for a house but if so there was not a light in any of the windows and there was nothing visible in the shape of a door The whereabouts of this however the driver presently made clear There be the door in front of you you go up three steps if you can find em There s a knocker if none of em haven t twisted it off If they have there s a bell on your right if it isn t broken There appeared to be no knocker though whether it had been twisted off was more than I could say But there was a bell which creaked with rust though it was not broken I heard it tinkle in the distance No answer though I allowed a more than decent interval Better ring again suggested the driver Hard Maybe they re up to some of their games and wants rousing Was there a chuckle in the fellow s voice I rang again and again with all the force I could The bell reverberated through what seemed like an empty house Is there no one in the place They re there right enough Where s another thing Maybe on the roof or in the cellar If they know you re coming perhaps they hear and don t choose to answer Better ring again I sounded another peal Presently feet were heard advancing along the passage several pairs it seemed and a light gleamed through the window over the door A voice inquired Who s there mister Christopher from London The information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter There was a rush of retreating feet an expostulating voice then darkness again and silence Who lives here Are the people mad Well thereabouts Once more I suspected the driver of a chuckle My temper was rising I had not come all that way and subjected myself to so much discomfort to be played tricks with I tolled the bell again After a few seconds interval the pit pat of what was obviously one pair of feet came towards the door Again a light gleamed through the pane A key was turned a chain unfastened bolts withdrawn it seemed as if some one had to drag a chair forward before one of these latter could be reached After a vast amount of unfastening the door was opened and on the threshold there stood a girl with a lighted candle in her hand The storm rushed in she put up her hand to shield the light from danger Can I see missus Wilson I m expected I m mister Christopher from London Oh That was all she said I looked at her she at me The driver s voice came from the background I drove him over from the station Miss There be a lot of luggage He do say he s come to stay with you Is that you Tidy I m afraid I can offer you nothing to drink We ve lost the key of the cellar and there s nothing out except water and I don t think you d care for that I can t say rightly as how I should Miss Next time will do Be it all right The girl continued to regard me Perhaps you had better come inside I think I had I went inside it was time Have you any luggage I admitted that I had Perhaps it had better be brought in Perhaps it had Do you think that you could manage Tidy The mare she ll stand still enough I should think I could miss CHAPTER II AND THE PERFORMANCE By degrees my belongings were borne into the hall hidden under an envelope of snow The girl seemed surprised at their number The driver was paid the cart disappeared the door was shut the girl and I were alone together We didn t expect that you would come Not expect me But it was all arranged I wrote to say that I would come Did you not receive my letter We thought that you were joking Joking Why should you imagine that We were joking You were Then I am to gather that I have been made the subject of a practical joke and that I am an intruder here Well it s quite true that we did not think you were in earnest You see it s this way we re alone Alone Who are we Well it will take a good while to explain and you look tired and cold I am both Perhaps you re hungry I am I don t know what you can have to eat unless it s to morrow s dinner To morrow s dinner I stared Can I see missus Wilson missus Wilson That s mamma She s dead I beg your pardon Can I see your father Oh father s been dead for years Then to whom have I the pleasure of speaking I m Madge I m mother now You are mother now The trouble will be about where you are to sleep unless it s with the boys The rooms are all anyhow and I m sure I don t know where the beds are I suppose there are servants in the house She shook her head No The boys thought that they were nuisances so we got rid of them The last went yesterday She wouldn t do any work so we thought she d better go Under those circumstances I think it probable that you were right Then am I to understand that there are children Rather As she spoke there came a burst of laughter from the other end of the passage I spun round No one was in sight She explained They re waiting round the corner Perhaps we d better have them here You people you d better come and let me introduce you to mister Christopher A procession began to appear from round the corner of boys and girls In front was a girl of about sixteen She advanced with outstretched hand and an air of self possession which took me at a disadvantage I m Bessie I m sorry we kept you waiting at the door but the fact is that we thought it was Eliza s brother who had come to insult us again Pray don t mention it I am glad that it was not Eliza s brother So am I He is a dreadful man I shook hands with the rest of them There were six more four boys and two girls They formed a considerable congregation as they stood eyeing me with inquiring glances Madge was the first to speak I wondered all along if he would take it as a joke or not and you see he hasn t I thought all the time that it was a risky thing to do I like that You keep your thoughts to yourself then It was you proposed it You said you d been reading about something of the kind in a story and you voted for our advertising ourselves for a lark The speaker was the biggest boy a good looking youngster with sallow cheeks and shrewd black eyes But Rupert I never meant it to go so far as this How far did you mean it to go then It was your idea all through You sent in the advertisement you wrote the letters and now he s here If you didn t mean it why didn t you stop his coming Rupert The girls cheeks were crimson Bessie interposed The thing is that as he is here it s no good worrying about whose fault it is We shall simply have to make the best of it Then to me I suppose you really have come to stay I confess that I had some notion of the kind to spend an old fashioned Christmas At this there was laughter chiefly from the boys Rupert exclaimed A nice sort of old fashioned Christmas you ll find it will be You ll be sorry you came before it s through I am not so sure of that There appeared to be something in my tone which caused a touch of silence to descend upon the group They regarded each other doubtfully as if in my words a reproof was implied Bessie was again the spokeswoman Of course now that you have come we mean to be nice to you that is as nice as we can Because the thing is that we are not in a condition to receive visitors Do we look as if we were To be frank they did not Even Madge was a little unkempt while the boys were in what I believe is the average state of the average boy And murmured Madge where is mister Christopher to sleep What is he to eat inquired Bessie She glanced at my packages I suppose you have brought nothing with you I m afraid I haven t I had hoped to have found something ready for me on my arrival Again they peeped at each other as if ashamed Madge repeated her former suggestion There s to morrow s dinner Oh hang it exclaimed Rupert It s not so bad as that There s a ham Uncooked You can cut a steak off or whatever you call it and have it broiled A meal was got ready in the preparation of which every member of the family took a hand And a room was found for me in which was a blazing fire and traces of recent feminine occupation I suspected that Madge had yielded her own apartment as a shelter for the stranger By the time I had washed and changed my clothes the impromptu dinner or supper or whatever it was was ready A curious repast it proved to be composed of oddly contrasted dishes cooked and sometimes uncooked in original fashion But hunger that piquant sauce gave it a relish of its own At first no one seemed disposed to join me By degrees however one after another found a knife and fork until all the eight were seated with me round the board eating some of them as if for dear life The fact is explained Rupert we re a rum lot We hardly ever sit down together We don t have regular meals but whenever anyone feels peckish he goes and gets what there is and cooks it and eats it on his own It s not quite so bad as that protested Madge though it s pretty bad It did seem pretty bad from the conventional point of view From their conversation which was candour itself I gleaned details which threw light upon the peculiar position of affairs It seemed that their father had been dead some seven years Their mother who had been always delicate had allowed them to run nearly wild Since she died some ten months back they appeared to have run quite wild The house with some six hundred acres of land was theirs and an income as to whose exact amount no one seemed quite clear It s about eight hundred a year said Rupert I don t think it s quite so much doubted Madge I m sure it s more declared Bessie I believe we re being robbed I thought it extremely probable They must have had peculiar parents Their father had left everything absolutely to their mother and the mother in her turn everything in trust to Madge to be shared equally among them all Madge was an odd trustee In her hands the household had become a republic in which every one did exactly as he or she pleased The result was chaos No one wanted to go to school so no one went The servants finding themselves provided with eight masters and mistresses followed their example and did as they liked Consequently after sundry battles royal lively episodes some of them had evidently been one after the other had been got rid of until now not one remained Plainly the house must be going to rack and ruin But have you no relations I inquired Rupert answered We ve got some cousins or uncles or something of the kind in Australia where so far as I m concerned I hope they ll stop When I was in my room which I feared was Madge s I told myself that it was a queer establishment on which I had lighted Yet I could not honestly affirm that I was sorry I had come I had lived such an uneventful and such a solitary life and had so often longed for someone in whom to take an interest who would not talk medicine chest that to be plunged all at once into the centre of this troop of boys and girls was an accident which if only because of its novelty I found amusing And then it was so odd that I should have come across a Madge at last In the morning I was roused by noises the cause of which at first I could not understand By degrees the explanation dawned on me the family was putting the house to rights A somewhat noisy process it seemed Someone was singing someone else was shouting and two or three others were engaged in a heated argument In such loud tones was it conducted that the gist of the matter travelled up to me How do you think I m going to get this fire to burn if you beastly kids keep messing it about It s no good banging at it with the poker till it s alight The voice was unmistakably Rupert s There was the sound of a scuffle cries of indignation then a girlish voice pouring oil upon the troubled waters Presently there was a rattle and clatter as if someone had fallen from the top of the house to the bottom I rushed to my bedroom door What on earth has happened A small boy was outside Peter He explained Oh it s only the broom and dustpan gone tobogganing down the stairs It s Bessie s fault she shouldn t leave them on the landing Bessie appearing from a room opposite disclaimed responsibility I told you to look out where you were going but you never do I d only put them down for a second while I went in to empty a jug of water on to Jack who won t get out of bed and there are all the boots for him to clean Injured tones came through the open portal You wait that s all I ll soak your bed tonight I ll drown it I don t want to clean your dirty boots I m not a shoe black The breakfast was a failure To begin with it was inordinately late It seemed that a bath was not obtainable I had been promised some hot water but as I waited and waited and none arrived I proceeded to break the ice in my jug it was a bitterly cold morning nice old fashioned weather and to wash in the half frozen contents As I am not accustomed to perform my ablutions in partially dissolved ice I fear that the process did not improve my temper It was past eleven when I got down feeling not exactly in a Christmassy frame of mind Everything and everyone seemed at sixes and sevens It was after noon when breakfast appeared The principal dish consisted of eggs and bacon but as the bacon was fried to cinders and the eggs all broken it was not so popular as it might have been Madge was moved to melancholy Something will have to be done We can t go on like this We must have someone in to help us Bessie was sarcastic You might give Eliza another trial She told you if you didn t like the way she burned the bacon to burn it yourself and as you ve followed her advice she might be able to give you other useful hints on similar lines Rupert indulged himself in the same vein Then there s Eliza s brother He threatened to knock your blooming head off for saying Eliza was dishonest just because she collared everything she laid her hands on he might turn out a useful sort of creature to have about the place It s all very well for you to laugh but it s beyond a jest I don t know how we re going to cook the dinner Can I be of any assistance I inquired First of all what is there to cook It seemed that there were a good many things to cook A turkey a goose beef plum pudding mince pies custard sardines it seemed that Molly the third girl as she phrased it could live on sardines and esteemed no dinner a decent dinner at which they did not appear together with a list of etceteras half as long as my arm One thing is clear you can t cook all those things to day We can t cook anything This was Rupert He was tilting his chair back and had his face turned towards the ceiling Why not Because there s no coal No coal There s about half a scuttle full of dust If you can make it burn you ll be clever What Rupert said was correct Madge confessed with crimson cheeks that she had meant over and over again to order some coal but had continually forgotten it until finally Christmas Day had found them with an empty cellar There was plenty of wood but it was not so dry as it might have been and anyhow the grate was not constructed to burn wood You might try smoked beef suggested Rupert When that wood goes at all it smokes like one o clock If you hung the beef up over it it would be smoked enough for anyone by the time that it was done I began to rub my chin Considering the breakfast we had had from my point of view the situation commenced for the first time to look really grave I wondered if it would not be possible to take the whole eight somewhere where something really eatable could be got But when I broached the subject I learned that the thing could not be done The nearest hostelry was the Boy and Blunderbuss and it was certain that nothing eatable could be had there even if accommodation could be found for us at all Nothing in the shape of a possible house of public entertainment was to be found closer than the market town eight miles off it was unlikely that even there a Christmas dinner for nine could be provided at a moment s notice Evidently the only thing to do was to make the best of things When the meeting broke up Madge came and said a few words to me alone I really think you had better not stay Does that mean that you had rather I went No not exactly that Then nearly that No not a bit that Only you must see for yourself how awfully uncomfortable you ll be here and what a horrid house this is My dear Madge everybody called her Madge so I did even if I wanted to go which I don t and I would remind you that you contracted to give me an old fashioned Christmas I don t see where there is that I could go Of course there s that I don t see either So I suppose you ll have to stay But I hope you won t think that I meant you to come to a place like this really you know I m sorry I had hoped you had That s not what I mean I mean that if I had thought that you were coming I would have seen that things were different How different I assure you that things as they are have a charm of their own That s what you say You don t suppose that I m so silly as not to know you re laughing at me But as I was the whole cause of your coming I hope you won t hate the others because of me She marched off brushing back with an impatient gesture some rebellious locks which had strayed upon her forehead That Christmas dinner was a success positively Of a kind let that be clearly understood I am not inferring that it was a success from the point of view of a chef de cuisine Not at all how could it be Quite the other way By dint of ransacking all the rooms and emptying all the scuttles we collected a certain amount of coal with which after adding a fair proportion of wood we managed Not brilliantly but after a fashion I can only say personally I had not enjoyed myself so much for years I really felt as if I were young again I am not sure that I am not younger than I thought I was I must look the matter up And after all even if one be say forty one need not be absolutely an ancient Madge herself said that I had been like a right hand to her she did not know what she would have done without me Looking back I cannot but think that if we had attempted to prepare fewer dishes something might have been properly cooked It was a mistake to stuff the turkey with sage and onions but as Bessie did not discover that she had been manipulating the wrong bird until the process of stuffing had been completed it was felt that it might be just as well to let it rest Unfortunately it turned out that some thyme parsley mint and other things had got mixed with the sage which gave the creature quite a peculiar flavour but as it came to table nearly raw and as tough as hickory it really did not matter My experience of that day teaches me that it is not easy to roast a large goose on a small oil stove The dropping fat caused the flame to give out a strong smelling and most unpleasant smoke Rupert who had charge of the operation affirmed that it would be all right in the end But by the time the thing was served it was as black as my hat Rupert said that it was merely brown but the brown was of a sooty hue and it reeked of paraffin We had to have it deposited in the ashbin I daresay that the beef would not have been bad if someone had occasionally turned it and if the fire would have burned clear As it was it was charred on one side and raw on the other and smoked all over The way in which the odour and taste of smoke permeated everything was amazing The plum pudding came to the table in the form of soup and the mince pies were nauseous Something had got into the crust or mincemeat or something which there at any rate was out of place Luckily we came upon a tin of corned beef in a cupboard and with the aid of some bread and cheese and other odds and ends we made a sort of picnic Incredible though it may seem I enjoyed it If there was anywhere a merrier party than we were I should like to know where it was to be found It must have been a merry one When I produced the presents in which a happy inspiration had urged me to invest the enthusiasm reached a climax I believe that is the proper form of words which I ought to use As I watched the pleasure of those youngsters I felt as if I were myself a boy again That was my first introduction to a lively family They came up to the description they had given of themselves I speak from knowledge for they have been my acquaintances now some time More than acquaintances friends the dearest friends I have At their request I took their affairs in hand Madge informally passing her trusteeship on to me Things are very different with them now The house is spick and span There is an excellent staff of servants Hangar Dene is as comfortable a home as there is in England I have spent many a happy Christmas under its hospitable roof since then The boys are out in the world after passing with honour through school and college The girls are going out into the world also Bessie is actually married Madge is married too She is missus Christopher That is the part of it all which I find is hardest to understand to have told myself my whole life long that the name of my ideal woman would be Madge and to have won that woman for my own at last That is greater fortune than falls to the lot of most men I thought that I was beyond that kind of thing that I was too old But Madge seemed to think that I was young enough And she thinks so still And now there is a little Madge who is big enough to play havoc with the sheets of paper on which I have been scribbling to whom one day this tale will have to be told BY DEPUTY A REMINISCENCE OF TRAVEL CHAPTER I DESPOILED It would seem Greenall 
7046-83701-0000	train-other-500	as if you couldn t even shoot It would seem like it wouldn t it As I sauntered back to the hotel I was conscious of a slight feeling of exacerbation As if I had been got at had
none	none	 No man likes to feel that he is a laughing stock 
7046-83701-0001	train-other-500	I felt that I had been made a laughing stock just then that
none	none	 indeed the process of manufacture had been going on ever since I showed my face in Ahmednugger 
7046-83701-0002	train-other-500	The men I had met were nice enough in their way Indeed they were almost too nice also in their way They appeared to have so little to do in the way of actual work
7046-83701-0003	train-other-500	that they had made it the business of their lives to perfect themselves in what are usually regarded say as accomplishments I was and am a plain civilian
7046-83701-0004	train-other-500	I have worked for and earned my little pile such as it is and until I set out upon that pleasure tour in the East
none	none	 it had never occurred to me that a man could be regarded as an uneducated idiot if he could not say run into double figures every time he took up his cue at billiards 
7046-83701-0005	train-other-500	A suspicion that a man might be so regarded had been dawning upon me ever since I arrived in India but until I came to Ahmednugger
none	none	 I had never quite realised how shockingly my education had been neglected on exactly those points on which it ought to have been most carefully attended to 
7046-83701-0006	train-other-500	The men of Ahmednugger were the most sporting individuals I had ever yet encountered
none	none	 Possibly I have not moved much among the congregations of the sporting men 
7046-83701-0007	train-other-500	but I certainly have seen something of men of business These men of Ahmednugger
none	none	 were not only the keenest sportsmen I had encountered 
7046-83701-0008	train-other-500	they were the keenest men of business too And talk of the rigour of a competitive examination They formed themselves into an examining board which very soon took the stiffening out of me
none	none	 They insisted on putting me through my paces before I had been a week in the place They examined me in every game of cards 
7046-83701-0009	train-other-500	which has been invented and found me wanting in them all They examined me as a rider as a driver
none	none	 as a shootist as a cueist 
7046-83701-0010	train-other-500	in fact in a range of subjects which I will not even venture to enumerate They refused me one solitary pass They plucked me in them all It did not add to my sense of satisfaction
7046-83701-0011	train-other-500	that I found my ignorance expensive The joke of the thing was
none	none	 that before I came to India I had rather fancied myself as an amateur sportsman I flattered myself that I had a decent seat in a saddle 
7046-83701-0012	train-other-500	whether across country or on the flat I thought that I made a tolerable fourth
none	none	 at whist 
7046-83701-0013	train-other-500	that I had some notion at any rate of English billiards and of a hazard off the red
none	none	 I certainly was under the impression that I could see with tolerable accuracy along the barrel of a gun 
7046-83701-0014	train-other-500	But these vain delusions were scattered at once and for ever by the men of Ahmednugger My all round purblind insensate ignorance had been so convincingly displayed that
none	none	 as I have said I was the laughing stock of all the place My latest performance in the exhibition line had been in a match with young Tebb the youngest and the latest joined of the subalterns Young Tebb had lured me on to skittles mister Tebb who would have been more correctly designated as Master Tebb was an awkward hobbledehoy who at any other place than Ahmednugger I should have looked down upon with the most supreme contempt 
7046-83701-0015	train-other-500	When he challenged me to see who could smash most glass balls with a rifle bullet he or I I rashly took his challenge up I flattered myself that at last I had a soft thing on
none	none	 I had myself been found a soft thing so many times that I looked forward to a little change 
7046-83701-0016	train-other-500	I had no notion it was rather late at night when the challenge was thrown down and taken up
none	none	 how difficult it really was to hit a glass ball with a rifle bullet I had never fired at a glass ball nor had I ever seen anyone else do so 
7046-83701-0017	train-other-500	But I conceived
none	none	 that at any rate young Tebb would find at least as much difficulty in the thing as I should 
7046-83701-0018	train-other-500	We were each to fire at fifty glass balls which were to be sent up into the air out of a trap We were of course to fire at them while they were in the air
none	none	 Out of my fifty I smashed one Out of his fifty young Tebb smashed forty nine It was the most mirth provoking exhibition that was ever seen Of course the young scoundrel had been doing nothing else but fire at glass balls his whole life long It was when I handed over the two hundred rupees which I had staked and lost that mister Tebb made his remark to the effect that I couldn t even shoot 
7046-83701-0019	train-other-500	When I returned to the hotel a man was standing in the doorway He addressed me as I came up the steps It strikes me that you and I might shake hands sir
7046-83701-0020	train-other-500	I asked him what he meant I ve made myself one kind of ass and you ve made yourself another kind
none	none	 We d be a pair of beauties I did not like being addressed in this manner 
7046-83701-0021	train-other-500	especially by a stranger and especially by a stranger like this stranger He was a short undersized man
none	none	 with a vacuous expression of countenance 
7046-83701-0022	train-other-500	His attire suggested seediness Perceiving that I did not appreciate his manner he explained No offence intended sir But I just now saw you playing pantaloon to that youngster s clown
7046-83701-0023	train-other-500	and I thought that he made the end of the poker rather hot As for me I m an ass all over My name s Johns I came to this place to shear the sheep There s been some shearing
7046-83701-0024	train-other-500	but it s the sheep that s done it They ve about sheared me
none	none	 I happened to have a trifle of money so I came to these parts to see if I could do a bit of bookmaking I ve done a bit The gentlemen in these parts have also done a bit 
7046-83701-0025	train-other-500	They ve got hold of pretty well every blessed mag I had I did not encourage mister Johns quite the contrary
none	none	 I had heard of him before 
7046-83701-0026	train-other-500	The regimental races had recently been held a bookmaker had appeared upon the scene mister Johns
none	none	 Nearly every man in the place had had bets with him 
7046-83701-0027	train-other-500	and to nearly every man in the place he had lost his money
none	none	 With a vengeance had the Philistine been spoiled CHAPTER II THE GAME Later in the day on which I had shot off that match with mister Tebb I encountered mister Johns again I was in the billiard room of what was called the club As regards membership it was very free and easy club indeed A local celebrity was taking the floor The room was tolerably full On one of the side seats was mister Johns The local celebrity was a mister Colson mister Colson was stud groom to the Rajah of Ahmednugger He was also and at the same time one of the most obnoxious persons I have in the course of my career had the pleasure of meeting There never was such a loud voiced braggart It set one s nerves on edge to hear him To listen to him there was nothing he could not do The misfortune was that some of the things which he said he could do he could do and do well I had found that out to my cost soon after my arrival in Ahmednugger And in consequence he had sat on me heavily ever since He was a horrible man That evening mister Colson was holding forth in his usual style on the subject of billiards I should mention that at the period of which I am writing mister John Roberts the famous player was on a tour in India I saw John Roberts at Calcutta observed mister Colson and he saw me He also saw me play When he saw me play he said he doubted if he could give me fifteen in a hundred I told him that I should like to see him do it But he wouldn t take it on Is that so asked mister Johns That is so I should like to see him give me ten in a hundred either John Roberts or any man now living I should like to have a game with you mister Colson You would mister Colson looked at mister Johns He looked him up and down mister Colson was large and florid mister Johns was small and underfed mister Colson was at least expensively attired About mister John s costume there was certainly no suspicion of expense I don t mind having you a hundred up my lad How many shall I give you I am no player mister Colson but I d like to play you even if only for the sake of saying that I d had the cheek to do it You shall have that pleasure And how much would you like to have on if only for the sake of saying that you had the cheek to have it on And mister Colson winked at the company in general Well mister Colson you and the other gentlemen have won all my money but I daresay I might manage ten rupees Put em up my lad Here s my ten We ll play for the twenty They played for the twenty And to my satisfaction and I believe to the satisfaction of most of the others who were in the room it was mister Johns who won I am bound to say that it seemed to me to be rather a fluky win mister Colson whose disgust was amusing had no doubt whatever about the fluke Never saw anything like it never The balls never broke for me not once As for you why you did nothing else but fluke Do you think so I ll play you again double or quits and I ll give ten in the hundred mister Colson mister Colson seemed amazed In fact I have no doubt he was amazed I like your modesty You ll give me ten Here s my twenty I ll take you on mister Colson took him on And by way of fair exchange mister Johns took him off That is to say he took off the stakes and the game He did it rather neatly just running in as mister Colson looked like winning mister Colson was adjectival Never saw anything like it never in all my born days Never saw anything like my somethinged somethinged somethinged luck And as for your fluking why it just beats anything Think so I ll play you again mister Colson and again double or quits and this time I ll give you twenty in a hundred You ll give me you ll give me twenty in a hundred You will Come on That ll be forty rupees a side here s mine Macbee put me on twenty and we ll see what I can do We did see what he could do We also saw that mister Johns seemed able to do a little better Once more he won the game I am sure that we were all enjoying ourselves very much much more than we had had any reason to anticipate As for mister Colson he went purple He showered on mister Johns a volley of that sort of language which I had found pretty fashionable at Ahmednugger mister Johns listened to him in silence while he pocketed the spoils Then he had his say You say I fluke Why my dear sir you ve no idea what a fluke is You ve no idea of any sort about billiards You can no more play billiards than you can play the gentleman you can t You re the sort of person whom it is just as well once in a way to expose You re a humbug mister Colson you re a humbug As for John Roberts doubting if he could give you fifteen in a hundred why he could give you ninety nine in a hundred and beat you single handed I tell you what I will do mister Colson I will play you five hundred up for five hundred rupees a side I will give you four hundred start and I will lay two to one against you with any gentleman who cares to back you I don t think that s an unfair offer mister Colson It struck me as at any rate a rash offer mister Colson was not such a tyro as mister Johns made out He had made mincemeat of me I do know that Yet the offer did not seem to be made in any spirit of braggadocio I fancy that the quiet matter of fact manner in which it was made impressed mister Colson more than he altogether cared to own My impression it that if he had had his own way he would have changed the subject But the odds offered him were such and the challenge was made in such a public manner that he probably felt that if he wished to preserve a rag of reputation now or never was the time to show the stuff that he was made of Anyhow the offer was accepted and the terms of the match were definitely arranged before the parties left the room CHAPTER III THE COALITION As I was retiring to rest some one tapped at my bed room door In response to my invitation to enter mister Johns came in Without any preamble he plunged at once into the purport of his presence in my chamber at that hour of the night or rather morning I have come mister Greenall to ask you to lend me five hundred rupees I turned I looked at him He met my glance without showing any signs of discomposure You have come to what He repeated his remark quite as though it were a matter of course To ask if you will lend me five hundred rupees I don t know if you are in earnest mister Johns If you are I would remark first that I am not a money lender and second that you are a complete stranger to me I want the money to stake in my match with mister Colson Indeed Is that so Then that is an added reason why I should decline to lend it to you In my opinion mister Johns your chances of success in that match are to say the least of it remote Look here mister Greenall I m the last man in the world to wish to make myself offensive but if we can understand each other I think that you and I might do each other a good turn I know all about how you ve been treated by the fellows here I know how they ve all been taking pop shots at you From what I hear they ve made you look like the biggest all round muff that ever left his mammy I daresay it s cost you something too I did not altogether appreciate this gentleman s free and easy style of conversation But to a certain extent I so to speak dissembled I do not know what warrant you have mister Johns for your remarks and in any case I fail to see what business it is of yours It s this way if you like you can be even with all the lot of them and more than even How By lending you five hundred rupees and letting you have as you put it a pop shot at me with the rest of them Thank you mister Johns By the way I fancy I have heard of some person or persons taking pop shots at you I think I did hear that you came here to make a fortune Did you make it mister Johns No I didn t hang em I m like you I owe them one And I mean to pay them with compound interest And if you like to say the word I ll pay them that little lot you owe them too Look here mister Greenall I don t mind owning that a keener lot of gentlemen than the gentlemen here I don t think I ever had to do with I won t say they robbed me but they certainly cut me up into very nice little pieces and they handed me round I ve seldom seen any thing of the kind which was better done But never mind my turn s coming I m not fond of bragging quite the other way If it wasn t that I was in a hole I wouldn t say a word But it is the simple truth that at all the things at which these fellows think they re dabsters I m as far ahead of them as they re ahead of you no offence intended You can take my word for it that I know what I m talking about It doesn t follow because just once in a way they happened to muck up my book that I m a flat As for being able to give Colson four hundred out of five hundred at billiards if I choose and I shall choose he s simply bound to lose I don t mean to say that I m a John Roberts because I m not But I do know how to play and that in a sense which Colson hasn t even begun to understand I ve heard that mister Colson hasn t behaved over well to you I thought that you d like to see him taken down a peg or two I should I should have liked to have seen more than one of them taken down a peg or two though I said nothing of that to mister Johns How came you to match yourself mister Johns when you were aware that you were not in possession of the required stakes I took it for granted that I should get the stakes from you mister Johns was frank at any rate From me What claim did you suppose yourself to have on me No claim but you see sir they ve had me and they ve had you They ve had both of us in fact pretty smartly And I thought that you might like to be even with some of them by deputy By deputy If it was workable that was not a bad idea I felt that I should like to be even with some of them beginning say with mister Colson how that man had squelched me beneath his elephantine foot the brute even as it were by deputy What guarantee have I that you will not lose my money as you already have lost your own If we get up early we shall have the billiard room all to ourselves If you like I will give you some idea of what I can do upon a billiard table We did get up early We did have the billiard room all to ourselves And mister Johns did give me some idea of what he could do upon a billiard table For one thing he got on the spot and he stopped there He continued to put the red down without once missing until the marker appeared When the marker did appear we thought that perhaps the proceedings had better cease If I can trust my memory before the proceedings ceased mister Johns had put the red down something like two hundred times in succession I thought that was good enough even for mister Colson I agreed to advance the necessary number of rupees The match came off It was a beautiful match The room was crowded to overflowing mister Johns had managed to back himself to a very fair amount Even I in my small way had managed to back him too But there was not so much readiness shown to support the local champion as I had expected They were keen were the men of Ahmednugger I fancy that already they had begun to smell a rat And not only so they were always willing to make a bet But on that particular occasion they were almost equally willing to see mister Colson come to grief I think that in those parts mister Colson was not so popular as he deserved to be I verily believe that there were some who objected to him almost as much as I did Poor mister Colson He was painfully nervous His nervousness prevented his showing even his usual form He had made fifteen when mister Johns getting on the spot stayed there He ran out without once putting down his cue Nothing like it had ever been seen before in Ahmednugger When the marker notified the fact that mister Johns had completed his fifth hundred mister Colson was for a moment speechless He seemed unable to realize that the thing was so It s a something swindle I beg your pardon mister Colson it s a what mister Colson s tone was loud and threatening mister Johns tone was quiet and almost indifferent Yet mister Colson did not seem to altogether like it He began to bluster You did not tell me that you were a professional No I did not tell you that I was a professional You didn t play the other night as you have played to day It looks to me uncommonly like a put up thing It looks to you like a put up thing does it mister Colson Well I ll give you a chance of showing your professional side I believe you can drive Drive mister Colson looked at the little man as if he would like to eat him I m the finest whip in India Indeed Is that so Well I ll drive you either four or eight in hand for a thousand rupees a side although you are the finest whip in India mister Colson snapped at his offer before it was fairly out of his mouth and I felt that mister Johns was going a little too far It was one thing to match him at billiards another thing to match him at driving There mister Colson was on his native heath When I was alone with mister Johns I told him so I don t know if you are aware mister Johns that mister Colson really is a first rate whip I am informed that it was his magnificent driving which first attracted the Rajah s attention mister Johns did not exhibit much appearance of concern I guess I ll fix him anyhow I haven t driven a stage over some of the worst country in the western states of America for nothing I ll back myself to drive a coach and four along a wall just wide enough to hold the wheels and I ll take you as a passenger if you like to come Thank you mister Johns my tastes do not incline that way Don t you worry mister Greenall I mean to take on the whole lot of em one after the other and show em a thing or two all round These gentlemen here fancy they know a little but we ll be more than even with them before we ve done The driving match came off I do not know how they manage similar affairs in England I have sometimes wondered But I am under the impression that they are not managed on the lines on which they managed that driving match in Ahmednugger The way in which they managed it there was this mister Colson was to drive upon the Monday mister Johns upon the Wednesday Each was to drive the same team eight in hand The horses by the way came out of the Rajah s stables The course was to be up and down the streets of Ahmednugger and then for a certain distance outside the city The judges occupied the front of the coach I had a seat among the insignificant people at the back On the whole I was content to sit behind The proceedings in the streets of Ahmednugger were distinctly exciting almost too exciting I felt for me Those streets were very narrow and they were blocked with traffic be it understood mister Colson and mister Johns each with his eight horses and a coach load of passengers went down those streets at full speed as if they had been fifty yards wide and as if there had not been a soul in sight What damages were done and what was the list of the killed and wounded I have never been informed I never quite realized what it meant to belong to a subject race till then It appeared to me that in the eyes of my companions a native had as a matter of course no rights at all We drove over whole streets full of them in style My heart was in my mouth most of the time We dashed round impossible corners shaking native tenements to their foundations But we kept ourselves alive somehow The peaceful pedestrians were slain I am no judge of coachmanship of such coachmanship as that at any rate Those who were judges without a dissentient voice awarded the palm to mister Johns and in consequence it was said mister Colson entered himself as a candidate for delirium tremens He was a dreadful man It seemed as if mister Johns was prepared to match himself against the men of Ahmednugger at exactly those things at which each man fancied he was strongest That is what he did do He challenged any one to meet him at driving or at billiards And when his challenge for what seemed to me to be sufficient reasons met with no response he challenged any one to ride him That challenge was taken up But he beat all takers He had a way with a horse which seemed little else than magical A horse would jump six feet for him when apparently it would not jump six inches for any other man in Ahmednugger I don t know how it was but so it was I know nothing of mister Johns beyond what I am writing I never heard his story nor how it was that a man of genius he was a man of genius came to find himself a broken down small bookmaker in that little town up country Perhaps he was another exemplification of the fact that only mediocrity succeeds I know that I was more than even with the men of Ahmednugger by deputy The band played to them as it had played to me He made them face the music and there was not one of them who did not leave his scalp upon the ground My belt was adorned with trophies by deputy When mister Johns had beaten the men of Ahmednugger as they had beaten me at riding and at driving and at billiards he took them on at shooting And so to speak he shot their heads off He showed them that in the presence of this man they were as nothing and less than nothing He even challenged mister Tebb to smash glass balls He fixed the point from which they were to fire at an abnormal distance and if I remember rightly he beat mister Tebb by about a score After he had annihilated that presumptuous young vagabond mister Johns informed me that shooting at glass balls really was not shooting I was quite prepared to admit it He said that it was only a trick When you had once mastered the trick it was impossible to miss Perhaps I have never fired at glass balls since then so I have no reason to suppose that I have mastered the trick When I do again fire at glass balls I am inclined to think that I shall not experience the slightest difficulty in missing every one of them CHAPTER IV EVENS When mister Johns had beaten the men of Ahmednugger at almost everything at which they could be beaten he began to amuse himself by taking a hand in various little games at cards It was remarked that to say the least of it his luck was wonderful There was scarcely a man in Ahmednugger who had not been compelled by mister Johns to take a lower seat to take a lower seat too just where he felt that his claim was strongest to take the highest one Naturally here and there a man resented it An even stronger spirit of resentment was evinced when the men of Ahmednugger found that their money was going in search of their vanished reputations There were some disagreeable little scenes Then there was a royal row it was at the club mister Johns had been carrying everything in front of him Things were said then other things were said Then mister Johns laid down his cards he faced the company Gentlemen I wish to inform you that you are individually and collectively a set of curs There were sounds which suggested neither the ways of pleasantness nor the paths of peace Softly Postpone the fighting for one minute I would remind you that when mister Greenall appeared in Ahmednugger you all with one accord took shots at him You used him as if he had been a variety of old Aunt Sally When I made my appearance you put your heads together and you bested me You see we were strangers and you took us in Neither mister Greenall nor I quite liked this sort of thing so we put our heads together and in our turn we ve bested you We ve used you as old Aunt Sallies We ve made you all sit up We ve made you all sing small Even at games of mingled chance and skill I ve beaten you Instead of taking your punishment like men you begin to whimper Therefore gentlemen I repeat that you are individually and collectively a set of curs Colonel Smith interposed so soon as mister Johns ceased speaking I fancy that the Colonel had only just entered the room mister Johns you very much forget yourself On the contrary Colonel I am remembering myself It is the gentlemen you have the honour to command who forget themselves Should there be any one present who resents the words which I have used I shall be happy to meet that person either with the gloves or without them or with any weapon he may choose for the honour of Ahmednugger There was silence grim silence Probably there was more than one there who would have liked to have ground mister Johns between the upper and the nether millstones But after all they were gentlemen in their way Bean stood up the adjutant of the th He was a big fellow head and shoulders taller than the audacious little challenger He went round to where mister Johns was sitting mister Johns you will either apologise for the words which you have just now used or take a thrashing I will take a thrashing said mister Johns He took it What is more he took it there and then The meeting was immediately adjourned and in the moonlight the little argument came off The proceedings were a trifle irregular perhaps over here we should deem them so I am not prepared to say that any dignitaries were actually present Still there was a goodly gathering The two men peeled In a very short space of time the little man had knocked the big man senseless This is not a fairy tale It is a simple record of a sober matter of fact It almost seems as if mister Johns was a lineal descendant of the Admirable Crichton Looking back I really fancy that he must have been When mister Bean s satisfaction had been signified in what I believe is the usual manner mister Johns addressed the lookers on Is there any other gentleman present who would like to thrash me for the honour of Ahmednugger Someone came out of the shadow someone who in those parts was a very great man indeed mister Johns you will be so good as to leave Ahmednugger within four and twenty hours mister Johns looked the great man up and down He seemed to be in no way awed even though he stood there in the moonlight without his shirt I am at a loss sir to understand by what authority you address yourself to me in such a manner I am in no way answerable for my movements to you I have not broken the law I have not even broken the peace As it happens I do intend to leave Ahmednugger and in less than four and twenty hours Not in deference to your orders but simply because I have had enough of Ahmednugger having taught your compatriots hereabouts what it strikes me was a much needed lesson the next time they encounter strangers except in the scriptural sense not to take them in The next day mister Johns did leave Ahmednugger And I went too He went his way I went mine I have neither seen nor heard of him since But as I continued on my journeyings I felt that after all I had been even and more than even with the men of Ahmednugger by deputy mister WHITING AND MARY ANN I did not mean to kiss her it was a pure accident Her face was close to mine or my face was close to hers and then her lips came into contact with my lips or my lips came into contact with her lips I don t know which it was and then at that moment her mother came into the room and she said mister Whiting may I ask what is the meaning of this I said it meant nothing nothing Absolutely nothing Only I found it difficult to explain and when I did explain she would not understand Her manner was not at all the sort of thing I care for The result is that I am engaged to Mary Ann Snelling without being conscious of having entertained any intention of the kind Not that I have a word to say against Mary Ann except that I never knew a girl with quite so many relations To begin with she had six brothers and five sisters and she is the eldest of the batch and there s not one of the brothers whom I feel drawn to Her father is a most remarkable person to say the least After they had arranged between them that I was engaged to Mary Ann I was really not allowed to have a voice in the matter her father remarked with a pointed air which I cannot but think under the circumstances was unusual that he thought it was about time that I did come to the scratch and that if I had kept on dilly dallying much longer he would have had a word to say to me of a kind I do not know what he meant and would rather not attempt to imagine But it is quite plain to me that all the arrangements for my wedding are going to be made by the Snellings I do not know when it is going to be but it will be either next week or the week after certainly at the earliest possible moment and I shouldn t be at all surprised to learn that all Mary Ann s things had been already bought and perhaps some of them marked We are to live in a house which belongs to a cousin of mister Snelling it is to be furnished by a brother of missus Snelling the house linen is to be supplied by the father of the young man to whom Jane Matilda is engaged and the ironmongery by the uncle to whom George Frederic is apprenticed All apparently that is left for me to do is to pay for everything It is most delightful It might just as well be some one else s wedding so unimportant is the part which I am set to play in it And it is all the result of an accident I deny that for the last six months I have been using mister Snelling s home as if it were a boarding house Nothing of the kind The mere suggestion is absurd It is true that I have dropped in to dinner now and then or to spend the evening or for an afternoon call or for an hour or two in the morning but that has been simply and solely because the Snelling family have evinced so marked a desire for my society The alteration which has taken place in their demeanour since my accident with Mary Ann is therefore all the more amazing For instance look at their behaviour in the matter of the ring The accident in question occurred upon the Sunday evening I had been with Mary Ann to church and had seen her home and had had a little supper and it was after supper that it happened I did not go and purchase the engagement ring the first thing on the Monday morning I own it Certainly not Nor did I take any steps in that direction during the whole of that week I was not pressed for time Besides I was turning things over in my mind But that was no reason why the Monday week following four of her brothers should have called on me on their way to the office when I was scarcely out of bed and actually breakfasting and assailed me in the way in which they did There was William Henry John Frank Ferdinand Augustus and Stephen Arthur Each of them twice my size and all of them frightfully ignorant and wholly regardless of the sensitive little points of those with whom they came in contact There is no circumlocution about them They go straight at what they want and were scarcely inside my door before they blurted out the purport of their coming It was Frederick Augustus if the thing is possible he is if anything more direct even than the rest of his family Look here Whiting how about Mary Ann s ring The girl is fretting but you don t seem to notice it And as you don t appear to know what is the proper thing to do in a case of this kind and don t understand that the ring ought to be bought straight away we ve bought it for you I gasped positively gasped Am I to understand that you ve purchased my engagement ring That s it on your account From a cousin of ours who s in that line I never saw people like the Snellings for possessing relatives in all sorts of lines No matter what you want or do not want and never will want they are sure to have some relative who has dealt in it his or her whole life long They produced the ring and told me what I had to pay for it A handsome price it was I was persuaded that somebody besides that cousin got a profit out of Mary Ann s engagement ring But I handed over the amount I did not want any unpleasantness and I am quite sure there would have been unpleasantness had I demurred Later in the day I took it with me when I went to call on Mary Ann She appeared to be surprised almost into speechlessness when I presented it to her Her head dropped on my shoulder and she kissed me under the chin observing You dear old Sam The moments when I am alone with Mary Ann are alleviations for those more frequent moments when I am not alone with Mary Ann Still I noticed that the ring fitted her perfectly and I could not but wonder if she had tried it on before At the same time I am beginning to be comforted by a suspicion that Mary Ann is on my side on my side that is as against the rest of her family There has been a difference of opinion as to where we are to spend our honeymoon It is from her action in that matter that my suspicion springs The Snellings have an aunt who lives in an out of the way hole at the other end of nowhere The woman s name is Brady There she owns a cottage or it may be a pigstye for all I know When she heard of my engagement with Mary Ann she wrote and suggested that we should spend our honeymoon in her cottage or pigstye and that I should pay her rent for it The matter was talked about at dinner Mary Ann was silent for some time then she quietly remarked Don t trouble yourselves to discuss Aunt Brady s proposal I shall do nothing of the kind This observation was followed by perfect silence The members of the family looked at one another But after a very considerable pause her mother said with quite unusual mildness Very well my dear Then it s settled After dinner I took advantage of an opportunity which offered to thank Mary Ann for her action in the matter because of course I had no wish to spend my honeymoon in a place of which I knew nothing to oblige an aunt of whom I knew still less Mary Ann beamed at me and she said You dear old man Presently she continued Do you know that in marrying me you are doing the best thing for yourself that you ever did in all your life I endeavoured to explain to her that I felt sure of it but I fear that my explanation was a little stumbling But she went on with the most perfect fluency There were no signs of faltering about her flow of language You want someone who can look after you and you could not by any chance have chosen a person who will look after you better than I shall Such an assurance was most satisfactory We had a long confidential chat on matters of business I found that as a woman of business she was beyond all my expectations I told her exactly what my income was and the source from which it came and all about it She drew up a plan on which we were to lay it out It was an admirable plan I had never had one but I saw clearly that in that way the money would go twice as far It turned out that she had a little money of her own about a hundred and thirty pounds a year And of course I had my expectations and she had hers It was plain that together we should manage most comfortably Delightfully in fact On the subject of wedding presents too her ideas were the most lucid I ever yet encountered It was wonderful to listen to her really wonderful I shall make papa give me five hundred pounds at least A bird in the hand is worth two in a bush and it will be something to have by us I quite agreed with her remarks about the bird in the hand and it certainly will be something to have by us I know what mamma can afford to give and I will see she gives it And I will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either I will take care that my relations do their duty I have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present and I shall tell them what they ought to give it won t be my fault if I don t get it Of course there are some people with whom you can t be perfectly plain but I shall be as plain as I can there s a way and a manner of doing that kind of thing I have no intention of being presented with an endless collection of duplicates or a lot of useless rubbish which I don t know what to do with If you take my advice you will follow in my footsteps I endeavoured to At least I drew up a list of people who ought to meet the occasion and I tried in more than one instance to drop a hint of what as I felt they ought to meet it with But I am bound to admit that so far my success has been as nothing compared with hers Hers has been prodigious It is certain that we have a large collection of really valuable property about the house the wedding presents to Mary Ann She has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants which is a little short of miraculous A singular feature about the situation is that people are actually beginning to pity me to sympathise with me for being about to marry Mary Ann I notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings The fact of having given Mary Ann a wedding present seems to fill them with a feeling of rancorous acidity which to me is inexplicable My belief is that they have been induced to spend at least twice as much as they intended and that they resent it Such is the selfishness of human nature But why on that account they should pity me I altogether fail to understand We have all been giving Mary Ann presents and I suppose you mister Whiting have been giving her something too That was what missus Macpherson said to me only the other day I have given Mary Ann two or three trifles and I said so And what inquired missus Macpherson has Mary Ann given you Her love Someone sniggered I cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead at least in that circle of society in which the Snellings move But that is not the only society the world contains As a matter of fact Mary Ann has given me a pair of slippers worked by her own hands It is true that they are a trifle large for me and that I shall never be able to keep them on my feet except when I am sitting still But Mary Ann does not seem to think that that matters so why should I Her youngest sister Clara Louisa has quite gratuitously informed me that she has had them by her for some considerable time and that not to put too fine a point on it they were originally designed for another individual altogether a mister Pilbeam But even supposing that what Clara Louisa says is true of which I have no evidence I have surely cause to congratulate myself on standing literally in mister Pilbeam s shoes even if they are a little spacious On the whole I do not know that I regret that accident I had with Mary Ann It is true that there are times when I am a little disposed to wish that she were not quite so good a manager now and then every man likes to call his soul his own On the other hand she is well qualified to protect me from the rest of the family She will keep them at bay Because it is beginning to dawn on me that singlehanded she is more than a match for them all Which is just as well If she had been like me they would have rent us limb from limb As it is unless I am mistaken some of the rending will be on our side And they know it P S The cards are out for the wedding It is to take place on Tuesday fortnight We are going for our honeymoon to Italy and the South of France A second cousin of Mary Ann s is in the Cook s Tours line He has given us free passes all the way to the end of our journey and all the way back again and coupons for free board and lodging at the hotel It s a wedding present So that as Mary Ann says our honeymoon need cost us practically nothing Besides which we can always sell the coupons and railway passes which we don t use Nothing could be more delightful A SUBSTITUTE

none	none	CHAPTER I 
7000_83706_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I AM APPOINTED CAPTAIN 
7000_83706_000005_000000	train-clean-360	I have some idea of cricket not much perhaps but I certainly have some 
7000_83706_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I was not in the Varsity team nor near it but I played in the Freshman s match and provided myself with spectacles 
7000_83706_000005_000002	train-clean-360	I was nearly in the school team once 
7000_83706_000005_000003	train-clean-360	That was when I carried my bat for forty five 
7000_83706_000005_000004	train-clean-360	I must own that my performance was a surprise to everyone and to myself among the rest 
7000_83706_000005_000005	train-clean-360	But as I never repeated it or anything like it they left me very wisely out of the eleven 
none	none	Thus it will be seen that from a cricketing point of view I did not even in my best days come up to first rate form and my best days were reckoning from last summer quite fifteen years ago During those fifteen years I do not remember once handling a bat far less hitting at a cricket ball with one and yet in this state of unpreparedness I had the presumption last summer to captain a team and to lead them on well not to victory but to disgrace It s a fact The match was Storwell v 
7000_83706_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Latchmere 
none	none	Storwell was my team and as I do not think a more remarkable match was ever known in the whole annals of cricketing history I here venture to report it 
7000_83706_000007_000000	train-clean-360	When they first asked me to play I thought they were mad Storwell on Sea is a village on the south coast I beg pardon I believe it is called by the inhabitants a town 
7000_83706_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It is a pretty place and not unknown in the locality 
none	none	It has a season and all that kind of thing and it was during the season I was there 
7000_83706_000007_000003	train-clean-360	And one day a deputation of the inhabitants called on me at my lodgings to ask if I would lead the local cricket club to say victory 
7000_83706_000007_000004	train-clean-360	As I have said my first impression was that they were mad either that or else that they were playing it off on the unprotected stranger 
7000_83706_000008_000000	train-clean-360	I hinted so much to the deputation 
7000_83706_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The deputation smiled 
7000_83706_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The chief spokesman was the local barber his name was Sapsworth 
none	none	He explained that mister Wingrave had sent them there Wingrave was the vicar we were up together and he must have known quite well whereabouts my cricketing form came in 
7000_83706_000008_000005	train-clean-360	I decided to crush the deputation before the thing went farther 
none	none	To show you the sort of man you propose should captain you I need only mention that it is more than fifteen years since I had a bat in my hand 
7000_83706_000010_000000	train-clean-360	But the admission did not crush them quite the other way 
7000_83706_000010_000001	train-clean-360	It opened the floodgates of their eloquence 
7000_83706_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 That s nothing mister Sapsworth cried 
none	none	There s Hedges here we ve had to put him in he don t even know the rules of the game and he s just turned sixty one 
7000_83706_000012_000000	train-clean-360	I glanced at mister Hedges thus frankly referred to 
none	none	He was a smiling red faced bald headed old gentleman who if not considerable in height was great in girth 
7000_83706_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He would certainly have turned the scale at sixteen stone 
7000_83706_000012_000003	train-clean-360	I felt that to cricketers who intended to play mister Hedges any objections which I might urge would appear quite trivial 
7000_83706_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 When is the match to be I asked 
7000_83706_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 To morrow was the startling reply 
7000_83706_000015_000000	train-clean-360	I was speechless 
none	none	That I after fifteen years total abstention should be asked to captain a team the members of which were entire strangers to me and of whose individual styles of play I had not the faintest notion in a match against an unknown foe at four and twenty hours notice was a little hard to credit 
7000_83706_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It was altogether too preposterous 
none	none	I told them so But they could not be brought to see it 
7000_83706_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The end of it was that I agreed to play 
7000_83706_000016_000001	train-clean-360	No man knows to what a depth of folly he can sink until he tries 
none	none	CHAPTER II mister BENYON BOWLS The match was to be played on mister Stubbs s field mister Stubbs was a local butcher mister Sapsworth had kindly promised to come and escort me to the scene of action He arrived at half past nine just as I was opening my morning s letters On the way he gave me a chart of the country It appeared that in batting we were not strong in fielding we were weak and that our bowling was more than shaky But we shall pull through mister Sapsworth added especially now and he glanced at me I hope you are under no delusion as to my powers mister Sapsworth I never was a first rate cricketer and as I have already told you it is more than fifteen years since I handled a bat If you ll excuse my saying so sir I ve generally noticed that them who doesn t say much does a deal That was one way of looking at it no doubt but if I did a deal I could only say that it would be a pleasant surprise to me And our opponents what sort of a team are they mister Sapsworth turned up his nose not metaphorically but as a matter of fact If we re bad he said they re wuss There s only one thing I ve ever seen those Latchmere blokes much good at and that is cheating You ll have to keep a sharp eye on them or they ll have all our chaps out when they ain t and they won t go out themselves not even when you ve bowled their three stumps down all of a row Surely I suggested those sort of questions are for the umpires to decide Umpires Up went mister Sapworth s nose again They bring their own umpire and he s got his own ideas of umpiring he has But we ve got our own umpire as well as them I said nothing but mister Sapsworth s words conveyed to my mind pleasant impressions of the strict rigour of the game When we arrived there was a goodly gathering already assembled in mister Stubbs s field A tent was erected in and about it was a nondescript collection of men and boys some forty or fifty others availing themselves of the opportunity afforded them for a little practice were actually disporting themselves on the pitch on which we were presently to play I consoled myself with the reflection that the worse the ground was the more my bowling would tell mister Sapworth introduced me to the crowd en masse Several persons touched their caps to me others nodded their heads some grinned Good morning gentlemen We re going to have a fine day for our match Our team all here mister Sapworth took upon himself to answer he had been searching about him with his eyes They re here all right I suppose those Latchmere chaps ain t come yet They had not come and they did not come for an hour or more I employed the interval in becoming acquainted with the individual members arranging the order of going in and their positions in the field matters in appearance simple enough but more difficult in practice But at last the preliminaries were settled somehow and the Latchmere men appeared upon the ground Their captain coming up was introduced to me I was informed afterwards that he was a blacksmith I thought he was by the way in which he grasped my hand His opening speech was a little surprising We ain t going to play you if you ve got eleven men you know I inquired into his meaning We ve only got ten he said And one of them s Soft Sawney and another s Sprouts I do not know if those were the correct names of the gentlemen referred to or only fancy ones by which they were known to their friends but he laid his hand on two of his followers and hauled them to the front One was a long weedy youth who one saw at a glance was more than half an imbecile and the other was a portly old gentleman of fifty five or six with a corporation like a barrel mister Sapsworth intervened What s that he cried We ve got Hedges He brought mister Hedges forward I could not but feel that to say the least of it mister Hedges balanced mister Sprouts If mister Hedges could run more than a dozen yards without pausing to take breath I was almost ready to express my willingness to eat my hat But we ve only got ten men persisted mister Barker You ll only have to have ten If you think we re going to play against your eleven we won t play you at all so that s all about it There was a prospect of unpleasantness even before the match began It seemed that one of us would have to retire in satisfaction of mister Barker s rather unjustifiable demand I was about to retire myself for I instinctively felt that as a captain I was no match for mister Barker when a rather curious incident occurred On a sudden a newcomer appeared upon the scene I say on a sudden for no one had noticed his approach and yet all at once there he was standing between the Latchmere captain and myself To me at any rate his presence was so unexpected and indeed so startling that I stared He seemed to have come out of space He was a big burly fellow with smooth cheeks round face bullet shaped head and sleepy looking black eyes Let me play for you he said For a moment mister Barker stared at the stranger in surprise in common with the rest of us Then he jumped at the offer Let you rather He thrust out his hand and caught the stranger s palm in his But no sooner had he got it firmly gripped than he dropped it with an exclamation Why what s the matter with you Ain t you well Your hand s as cold as a frozen corpse I went a little aside with mister Sapsworth Who is he I asked I don t know and yet I seem somehow to have seen his face before But let them have him He doesn t look as though he were up to much He did not Anyone looking less like a cricketer I have seldom seen His costume was ridiculous He had on a pair of large check trousers a check of the kind which the Oxford tailor explained to the undergraduate was a leetle too large to be seen to advantage on a single pair of understandings He had on a huge top hat of a size and shape which would have made the fortune of a lion comique A red woollen muffler was wound several times round his neck and his capacious person was enveloped in an enormous overcoat the like of which I had never seen before The day promised to remind us of the torrid zone yet mister Barker had cried out that the stranger s hand felt cold In the toss for innings victory fell to us So we went in I led the van My associate was a youth named Fenning He was a mere lad and looked too much of a lout to be much of a cricketer mister Barker led the bowling I soon saw that if he had any strength it was not as a bowler If I kept my head I told myself and he carried away my bails it would be owing to the ground for a rougher piece of turf I suppose few wickets have been pitched upon But I was far too nervous to take liberties even with mister Barker And indeed when the first over was finished and I found myself still in I drew a long breath of self congratulation The other bowler was in his own line as meritorious a specimen as his captain So on the whole things were going better than I had expected I had scored eleven six off mister Barker and the rest off his friend Even Fenning had hit up two literally hit up I was really beginning to think that I was getting set which in my palmiest days had only happened once thrice happy day when something took place which showed me not for the first time the advisability of never counting your chickens till the eggs are hatched mister Barker was just about to commence an over He actually had the ball in his hand when the substitute the stranger who had volunteered to fill the place of the eleventh man came marching right across the field mister Barker saw him coming and called out to him to stay where he was But wholly unheeding the substitute strode on He reached mister Barker and without saying a word so far as I could perceive he coolly held out his hand for the ball I fully expected that the Latchmere captain would remonstrate and not only remonstrate but remonstrate strongly but to my surprise he instantly surrendered the ball and slunk rather than walked to the place which the stranger had just quitted So the substitute was left to bowl Without doubt he was an eccentric character Up to that moment he had been fielding in his woollen muffler his overcoat and last but not least his wonderful top hat These however he now doffed and laid in a heap upon the ground Their disappearance revealed the fact that he wore a tight fitting jacket which was the same wonderful pattern in checks as his trousers From the look of him I certainly never supposed that he could bowl My surprise was therefore all the greater when I discovered that he could His action was peculiar He went right up to the wicket and stood quite still delivering the ball with a curious flourish of the wrist Its pace was amazing It pitched a good two feet to the off and broke right in perhaps aided by the ground though he certainly had found a spot I was so astounded by the pace which reminded me of the old stories told of Lillywhite you could hear it humming in the air that I never even moved my bat It was that which saved me As it was the bat was all but driven out of my hand I told myself that on the arrival of a second edition I should have to go Yet I did manage to stop the next four balls how I have not the faintest notion but the sixth for it seemed that in those parts they bowled six to the over took my middle stump breaking it clean off at the top As I entered the tent the scorer cried out What name Tom Benyon replied the bowler mister Hedges who was seated at the scorer s side brought down his fist upon the trestle table with a bang I knew it was I knowed him all along mister Hedges was in a state of odd excitement That chap who bowled you ain t a man sir he s a ghost He manages to put a good deal of pace on the ball for a ghost I answered And so he ought to Did you hear what name he said He said Tom Benyon There wasn t a better cricketer in all these parts than Tom Benyon used to be He played up in Lunnon more than once I know and got well paid for playing too But he always was a queer sort was Tom I knew him well I saw him buried And if it is him and not his ghost he ain t grown a day older these twenty years he ain t I laughed I supposed the old gentleman was jesting But not a bit of it When our second man had gone to the wicket mister Sapsworth drew me aside I don t like the look of this he said Nor I I answered supposing he referred to mister Benyon s bowling He ll bring down our stumps like ninepins It isn t that It it s the man he said Do you mean the ghost I asked jokingly It s easy to laugh But mister Sapsworth paused I could see he was ashamed of himself yet had his suspicions none the less I thought I had seen him before and I had It is Tom Benyon He says he is Tom Benyon and I suppose he should know best Yes mister Sapsworth fidgeted But Tom Benyon s been dead these twenty years Dead I cried and laughed He showed himself too much alive for me at any rate When I was a youngster continued mister Sapsworth Tom Benyon used to come into my father s shop to be shaved He was always on the drink One morning I was all alone minding the shop for father when he came in mad drunk I never shall forget that morning never He made me sit in the shaving chair and set about to shave me He soaped me all over face and hair and all I was that there frightened I couldn t make a sound I never shall forget how I sat and watched him with the soap all in my eyes as he put an edge upon the razor Then he set about shaving off my hair He had got off about half of it and I was streaming with blood when who should come in but my father If he hadn t Tom Benyon would have made an end of me He paused I perceived that the mere recollection of his little adventure affected him unpleasantly There was something queer about his death Some people said it was drink had done for him some of em said he had done for himself Anyhow the whole country side was at his funeral I was there I remember it as plainly as though it was yesterday While I was looking at mister Sapsworth and pondering his words there came the sound of laughter from the middle of the ground It was not a loud laugh but it was a distinctly disagreeable one I looked round mister Benyon was laughing at mister Fenning s discomfiture He had served him as he had served me he had taken his middle stump right out of the ground I turned to mister Sapsworth You follow Me mister Sapsworth turned several shades whiter Me He looked about him with a frightened air mister Trentham I I can t he said Nonsense Sapsworth You don t mean to say that you are going to allow yourself to be frightened by any nonsense about a ghost and in broad daylight too The little man did not look by any means reassured by my tone of derision He seemed more inclined to take to his heels than to take his place at the wickets It is not impossible that he might have done so had he not been addressed from a different quarter Bob Sapsworth It was mister Benyon calling to the little barber right across the field Come and be shaved I own that I myself was startled The words were apposite to say the least of it We had just been speaking of mister Sapsworth s experience of the shaver s art as practised by mister Benyon s hands and here was mister Benyon s namesake inviting him if not to be cut at least to come again On mister Sapsworth the effect of the invitation was surprising He had on his pads his bat was in his hand Without a word he shuffled towards the stumps If ever I saw a man go to the wickets in a state of mortal funk I saw him then I myself moved towards the scoring tent The state of things within it at once impressed me as peculiar It had been filled a little time ago with jovial faces Now the owners of those faces might have been attendants at a funeral And many a man has had a livelier following to the grave than I saw assembled then Fenning came shambling into the tent I spoke to him mister Benyon s bowling was too much for you eh Fenning Unless I am mistaken mister Fenning wiped a tear out of his eye He certainly put up his hand and rubbed the optic with his knuckles I never seed such bowling Tain t fair he said What is there unfair about it Fenning It comes so sharp I never seed the ball afore there was my wickets down I smiled Not so the company They regarded mister Fenning s words with different eyes mister Hedges gave expression to the general opinion You ain t never seen such bowling afore and you won t never see such bowling again Cause why Cause it s a ghost that s bowling not a man mister Fenning looked about him with open eyes and with open mouth as well A ghost he mumbled A ghost said mister Hedges I expostulated Come mister Hedges you frighten the lad I am surprised too that a man of your age and experience and wisdom should talk nonsense about ghosts mister Hedges looked up at me a little sharply If he ain t a ghost what s become of the things that he s took off I asked him what he meant He pointed across the ground He took off his hat and his coat and his scarf and he laid em on the grass He ain t touched em and no one ain t took em yet they re gone We saw em go If he ain t a ghost what s become of the things that he s took off mister Hedges grew a little excited I looked in the direction in which the old gentleman was pointing The garments he referred to had apparently vanished but of course their disappearance was susceptible of a most natural explanation I should have maintained this proposition with more confidence had it not been for something which immediately occurred mister Benyon was preparing to deliver his first ball to mister Sapsworth and as I eyed him I noted the extremely unworkmanlike attitude in which mister Sapsworth awaited the delivery Preparatory to delivering the ball mister Benyon divested himself of his remarkable coat which matched his trousers and in so doing disclosed a waistcoat which matched his coat Neatly folding up the garment he laid it beside him on the ground No sooner did it touch the ground than it disappeared I am unable to say how but it did and that before the eyes of all the lookers on This singular behaviour on the part of that curious garment took me by surprise After that I was prepared to excuse a certain amount of nervousness on the part of mister Sapsworth To mister Benyon mister Sapsworth s nervousness seemed to afford positive pleasure He cried in a tone which was perhaps meant to be jovial Now Bob Sapsworth prepare to be shaved The ball went from his hand like lightning mister Sapsworth yelled mister Benyon sent down his second ball whack not against the bat but I should say as nearly as possible against the same portion of mister Sapsworth s frame which it had struck before Any cricketer might have been demoralised after receiving two such blows but he would at least have tried to get out of the way of the ball instead of in it mister Sapsworth placed his person exactly where the ball might be expected to come and for once in a way expectation was realised it did come The third fourth and fifth balls found an exactly similar billet and the sixth not only knocked his bat out of his trembling hands but all three of his stumps clean out of the ground I said I d shave you Bobby shouted mister Benyon as the victim went limping from the place of execution Next man in I said I ain t going in courteously rejoined the player whose turn it was to follow I was about to ask him why when I was saved the trouble by mister Benyon Jack Hawthorn Oddly enough the man s name was Hawthorn though how mister Benyon came to know that he was next man in is more than I can say mister Hawthorn was a huge fellow quite six feet high but at the sound of mister Benyon s voice he rose docile as a child I m waiting for you Without pads mister Hawthorn went striding across the turf content to use the bat which mister Sapsworth had left lying on the ground That hero came limping into the tent It s a ghost he said I could not but feel that the fellow was something of a cur To this feeling I gave expression Ghost or no ghost rather than let him pound me all over the body with the ball I would have made one try to hit at it And you told me that you were an all round player No doubt the man must have been suffering considerable pain but I was too much annoyed at his cowardice to feel for him Besides the whole thing was so preposterous Undoubtedly as a trundler mister Benyon was superb I have no hesitation in saying that I do not remember to have seen finer bowling than his on any ground in England He combined two things which so far as I am aware are not to be found together in any living player pace and break But it was not his bowling fine as it was which promised to work our ruin so much as the absurd belief entertained by the members of the team that he check trousers and all was a ghost An idea came into my head I resolved that I would ask him point blank in the face of all the people if he was a ghost If his answers did not satisfy the doubters nothing would The opportunity occurred just as he was about to begin his following over Moving from the tent I advanced towards the wickets Excuse me mister Benyon but before you commence to bowl might I speak to you a word He turned and looked at me As he did so I was conscious that in the most emphatic sense of the word his appearance was peculiar He looked as though he were a corpse and an unhealthy corpse to boot the sort of corpse that no man would spend a night with willingly And this unpleasant appearance was accentuated by his ridiculous attire Fancy a dead man of a bloated habit of body taking his walks abroad in a suit of checks each check twelve inches square I was so uncomfortably conscious that mister Benyon did not look a clubbable kind of man that I faltered in my speech You will excuse me mister Benyon if the question I am about to put to you appears to you even worse than absurd but the members of my team have some ridiculous notion in their heads that you are a certain Tom Benyon who died twenty years ago and who now lies buried in the churchyard I am sure therefore you will forgive my asking are you a ghost mister Benyon eyed me and I eyed him not willingly but because for some reason or other I could not help it At last he answered speaking in a sort of shout I am Of course such an answer was absurd ridiculously absurd As I sit here writing no man could be more conscious of its absurdity than I am But then it was not that I was so conscious of as of a cold shiver going all down my back and of a sort of feeling as though Providence had sent me out into the world knock kneed I struggled against a strong inclination to sit down upon the turf and stop there But being at the same time dimly aware that I was making an unexampled fool of myself I made a frantic effort to regain the use of my tongue Oh you you are a ghost I I thought so Tha thanks How I got back to the tent I have not the faintest notion But I do know that after that exhibition of the sort of stuff that I was made of disaster followed hard upon disaster The first wicket my own had fallen for thirteen runs The second and the third had seen the score unaltered Hawthorn was the fourth man in He was so fortunate as to appear upon the scene just as I put my fatal question it was to give him a chance I put it The answer settled him that is if there was anything left to settle I am not able to state exactly what became of him but I have a clear impression that he was out at the end of the over Moreover of this I am well assured that nine wickets fell without an addition being made to the score I suppose that is in its way a record Whether mister Benyon owed the inhabitants of his native place a grudge the evidence before me does not enable one to decide but if he did he certainly paid it in full that day Although he bowled at the wickets he hit the players first Nor was this so far as appearances went in any way his fault they seemed to have a singular knack of getting just in the way of the ball The order of the innings was this the ball hit each man five times and the wickets once At the end of each of mister Benyon s overs a batsman returned to the tent a sadder and a lamer man One case in particular was hard It was the case of mister Hedges He was the last man in when his turn came with the score still at thirteen runs he stuck to his seat like glue Won t somebody go in for me he asked as he saw his doom approaching I ain t no cricketer he added a little later on Now am I He asked the question of his friends but his friends were still He addressed himself to mister Sapsworth Bob Sapsworth you asked me to play now didn t you You says to me If you play William Hedges you says I shouldn t be surprised but what the gent as we re going to ask to captain us stands you a free lunch you says not to speak of drinks you says I pricked up my ears at this but held my tongue But you says nothing about being bowled at by a ghost now did you now I ask you Bob Sapsworth did you now mister Sapsworth was silent The old gentleman went on I shan t go in he announced That was when the ninth batsman had received mister Benyon s first ball upon his person Nothing shan t make me go in to be bowled at by a ghost This second announcement followed the delivery of the second ball upon the batsman s person I ain t no cricketer and I don t know nothing about the rules of the game and I ain t going to stand up to be chucked at by a ghost and mister Hedges struck his fist upon the board There came a yell from the wickets mister Hedges gripped his seat tightly with his hands I won t go in he cried Another ball another yell mister Hedges repeated his determination over and over again as if in its reiteration he sought for strength to keep it I won t I won t I won t The last ball of the over and the ninth of our hopes had fallen A pause ensued The batsman came limping towards the tent mister Hedges time was come he clutched at the seat with the frenzy of despair Bill Hedges sang out mister Benyon but mister Hedges gave no sign Bill Hedges Still no reply Bill Hedges have I got to come and fetch you At that awful threat the old gentleman did rise His ample form went waddling across the ground I I m a coming Tom I I ain t no cricketer Tom Do don t you be too hard on me If you must hit me let it be behind Where s your bat The inquiry came from mister Benyon mister Hedges had arrived at the wicket without that batsman s requisite He scratched his head My bat I I don t want no bat I I ain t no cricketer You can hit me quite as well without it Tom Go and get your bat mister Hedges went and got it When he had it it was evident that he had but rudimentary notions of its uses He held it gingerly round side foremost as though he were afraid that if he grasped it tightly it would burn him Bill Hedges do you remember those drinks you paid for me the Saturday week before I died No Tom I can t say rightly as how I do You did It was at the Crown and Anchor I had no money I said if you d stand Sam I d pay you back again but I never did I ll pay you now mister Benyon paid him five times over The old gentleman bore it like a lamb Whack whack whack whack whack and the fall of his wicket at the end As he returned towards the tent he wiped his wrinkled brow I always said I wasn t no cricketer and I ain t he said CHAPTER III 
7000_83708_000002_000000	train-clean-360	AND BATS 
none	none	Our innings was over for thirteen runs 
7000_83708_000003_000001	train-clean-360	We sat there moping in a crowd I among the rest when mister Benyon bustling up reminded me of my duties as a captain 
7000_83708_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Now then turn out 
7000_83708_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Send your men into the field 
7000_83708_000004_000002	train-clean-360	We can t stop here all day 
7000_83708_000004_000003	train-clean-360	I m first man in soon I ll have to go and I haven t had a smack at a cricket ball these twenty years 
7000_83708_000005_000000	train-clean-360	We looked at each other 
7000_83708_000005_000001	train-clean-360	One part of his address gave us a certain gratification that part in which he stated that he soon would have to go 
7000_83708_000005_000002	train-clean-360	We turned out 
7000_83708_000005_000003	train-clean-360	I suppose a more unpromising set of fieldsmen never yet took their places in the field 
7000_83708_000005_000004	train-clean-360	The Latchmere men went slouching towards the tent some of them I noticed instead of going in stole towards the rear 
none	none	These I suspect stole off the ground I never set eyes on them again
7000_83708_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Trentham I I can t bowl whispered mister Sapsworth to me as we moved across the turf 
7000_83708_000007_000000	train-clean-360	He and I had agreed that we should start the bowling 
7000_83708_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I confess that I felt no more inclined to act up to the letter of our agreement than he did 
7000_83708_000007_000002	train-clean-360	But mister Benyon intervened 
7000_83708_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Now Bob Sapsworth you take the bowling one end and let your captain take the other 
7000_83708_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Captain you take first over 
7000_83708_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I obeyed without a murmur 
none	none	It might have been quite a usual thing to see in a match a member of one team ordering about the captain of the other 
7000_83708_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I do not think that our field was arranged on scientific principles I may certainly claim that I had nothing to do with its arrangement 
7000_83708_000009_000003	train-clean-360	There is a suspicion floating through my mind that at one or two points two or more men were placed unusually close together For instance at deep mid off very deep mid off mister 
7000_83708_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Hawthorn and mister Hedges were not only doing their best to trample on each other s toes but each was seeking for a place of security behind the other s back 
7000_83708_000010_000000	train-clean-360	mister Barker shared with mister Benyon the honour of being first man in The Latchmere captain as a captain had become quite as much a figurehead as I had 
7000_83708_000010_000001	train-clean-360	His bearing was indicative of extreme depression I think he had learned that to take off hand the first substitute who offered was now and then unwise 
7000_83708_000011_000000	train-clean-360	To enable him to bat with more advantage mister Benyon had removed his waistcoat which matched his trousers and his coat 
7000_83708_000011_000001	train-clean-360	What he had done with it I cannot say possibly it had vanished with his other garments into air 
7000_83708_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Now he had on a bright red flannel shirt his tastes in costume seemed a trifle lurid the sleeves of which were turned up above the elbows 
7000_83708_000011_000003	train-clean-360	His pose was almost as peculiar as his costume 
7000_83708_000011_000004	train-clean-360	He stood bolt upright his legs together his feet drawn heel to heel not at all in the fashion of a modern cricketer who seeks to guard his wickets with his legs 
7000_83708_000011_000005	train-clean-360	His bat he held straight down in front of him the blade swinging gently in the air 
none	none	I am afraid I wasted more time in preparing to deliver my first ball than I need have done but if mister Benyon had not had a smack with a bat for twenty years it was a good fifteen since I had bowled a ball After such a lapse of time one requires to pull oneself together before exhibiting one s powers to a cricketer of mister Benyon s calibre He however did not seem to recognise the necessity which I myself felt that I was under
7000_83708_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Hurry up sir 
7000_83708_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Don t I tell you that soon I ll have to go 
7000_83708_000014_000000	train-clean-360	I hurried up 
7000_83708_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I gave him an overhand full pitch which would have made a decent catch for point if point had been close in which he wasn t However in any case mister Benyon would have saved him the trouble 
none	none	He hit the ball a crack the like of which I had never seen before 
7000_83708_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He drove it over the hedge and over the trees and up to the skies and out of sight 
7000_83708_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think that s a bad little smack to start with he observed I like your kind of bowling mister 
7000_83708_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I suppose that s a boundary He called to the scorer if there was one which I doubt Put down Tom Benyon six 
7000_83708_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He turned again to me 
7000_83708_000015_000003	train-clean-360	 It s no good wasting time looking for that ball 
7000_83708_000015_000004	train-clean-360	I ve another in my pocket you can have 
7000_83708_000016_000000	train-clean-360	He put his hand into his trousers pocket 
7000_83708_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Those remarkable garments fitted him like eel skins 
7000_83708_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I had certainly never supposed that he could by any possibility have such a thing as a cricket ball in one of the pockets 
none	none	But it appeared that he had 
7000_83708_000016_000004	train-clean-360	He drew one out and threw it up to me 
7000_83708_000017_000000	train-clean-360	My second ball was a colourable imitation of my first only this time it was wide to leg 
7000_83708_000017_000001	train-clean-360	To long leg mister Benyon sent it flying 
7000_83708_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Put down Tom Benyon another six he cried 
none	none	I do like your bowling mister 
7000_83708_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I ve got another ball which you can have 
7000_83708_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He produced a second ball from the same pocket from which the first had come 
7000_83708_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I could scarcely believe my eyes 
7000_83708_000019_000002	train-clean-360	But I was discovering with Horatio that there were more things in heaven and earth than had been contained in my philosophy 
7000_83708_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Since mister Benyon professed such affection for the style of bowling which I favoured I sent him down another sample 
none	none	This time it was fairly straight by which I mean that it would not have pitched more than a yard from the wickets if mister Benyon had allowed it to pitch which he didn t 
7000_83708_000019_000005	train-clean-360	He treated it as he had done the first he drove it with terrific force right above my head 
7000_83708_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Never mind about the ball 
7000_83708_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind about the ball he said 
7000_83708_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve got another in my pocket 
7000_83708_000021_000000	train-clean-360	He had the third 
7000_83708_000021_000001	train-clean-360	And in the same pocket from which the other two had come 
7000_83708_000022_000000	train-clean-360	My fourth ball he treated to a swipe to square leg 
7000_83708_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He seemed to have a partiality for swiping 
7000_83708_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Quite unnecessarily he allowed that this was so 
7000_83708_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I do like a ball which I can get a smack at he remarked as he produced a fourth ball from the same pocket of his tightly fitting trousers which had contained the other three 
7000_83708_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 A swipe does warm me so 
none	none	Your kind of bowling mister s just the thing 
7000_83708_000024_000000	train-clean-360	It was kind of him to say so though to my thinking his remark did not convey a compliment 
7000_83708_000024_000001	train-clean-360	When he sent my fifth ball out of sight I wished that his love for swiping had been less or my bowling of another kind 
7000_83708_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The sixth however which he also produced from the same wondrous store contained in his breeches pocket he contented himself with what he called snicking 
7000_83708_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what I call a pretty snick he said 
7000_83708_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The snick in question was a tremendous drive to deep mid off 
7000_83708_000026_000001	train-clean-360	It was stopped quite involuntarily by mister Hawthorn and mister Hedges 
none	none	So far as I could see it stunned the pair of them 
7000_83708_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Neither of them made the slightest attempt to return the ball 
7000_83708_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Run it out cried mister Benyon 
7000_83708_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He and mister Barker began to run 
7000_83708_000027_000002	train-clean-360	They ran four and then they ran two more and still the ball was not thrown in 
7000_83708_000027_000003	train-clean-360	mister Benyon urged the fielders on 
7000_83708_000027_000004	train-clean-360	 Hurry up Bill Hedges 
7000_83708_000028_000000	train-clean-360	mister Hedges did not hurry up he never could have hurried up even if his manner of fielding the ball had not wholly deprived him of his wind 
7000_83708_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But the ball was at last thrown in when the pair had run eleven 
7000_83708_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Forty one runs off his first over was a result calculated to take the conceit out of the average bowler 
none	none	And mister Benyon s last performance his snick had placed him at the other wicket prepared to receive mister Sapsworth s bowling when it came Now Bob Sapsworth I ll have a smack at you he said He had 
7000_83708_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I felt for mister Sapsworth 
7000_83708_000030_000002	train-clean-360	But since I had suffered it was only fair that he should suffer too 
7000_83708_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Crack smack whack went the balls out of sight in all directions 
7000_83708_000030_000004	train-clean-360	And for each ball that disappeared mister Benyon produced another from his breeches pocket 
7000_83708_000030_000005	train-clean-360	I felt that these things must be happening to me in a dream 
7000_83708_000030_000006	train-clean-360	I was rapidly approaching the condition in which Alice must have been in Wonderland prepared for anything 
7000_83708_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Time went on 
7000_83708_000031_000001	train-clean-360	mister Sapsworth and I bowled over after over 
7000_83708_000031_000002	train-clean-360	mister Benyon was making a record in tall scoring 
7000_83708_000031_000003	train-clean-360	No performance of W 
7000_83708_000031_000004	train-clean-360	G s ever came within many miles of it 
7000_83708_000031_000005	train-clean-360	And the balls he lost 
7000_83708_000031_000006	train-clean-360	And the balls which he produced 
7000_83708_000031_000007	train-clean-360	And the diabolical ingenuity with which he managed at the close of every over to change his end 
7000_83708_000031_000008	train-clean-360	If mister Barker did no hitting he did some running 
7000_83708_000031_000009	train-clean-360	He never had a chance to make a stroke but his partner took care to make him run an incredibly large odd number as a wind up to every over 
7000_83708_000031_000010	train-clean-360	mister Benyon did not seem to be distressed by the exertion in the least mister Barker emphatically did 
none	none	mister Benyon had buoyed us up by his statement that he would soon have to go His ideas of soon were different from ours 
7000_83708_000032_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose at the outside our innings had lasted half an hour 
none	none	How long we bowled to mister Benyon is more than I can say 
7000_83708_000032_000004	train-clean-360	I know that I bowled until I felt that I should either have to stop or drop 
7000_83708_000032_000005	train-clean-360	By degrees one fact began to be impressed upon me 
7000_83708_000032_000006	train-clean-360	It was this that the number of spectators was growing smaller by degrees and beautifully less 
7000_83708_000032_000007	train-clean-360	Originally there had been quite a crowd assembled 
7000_83708_000032_000008	train-clean-360	In course of time this had dwindled to half a dozen stragglers 
none	none	A little later on even these had gone 
7000_83708_000032_000010	train-clean-360	And not only spectators but cricketers had disappeared 
7000_83708_000032_000011	train-clean-360	If my eyes did not deceive me there was not a member of the Latchmere team left on the ground 
none	none	They had had enough of mister Benyon or his ghost 
7000_83708_000033_000000	train-clean-360	What was more some of our own team took courage and leg bail 
7000_83708_000033_000001	train-clean-360	I caught one of them the lad Fenning in the act of scrambling through the hedge 
7000_83708_000033_000002	train-clean-360	But I had not the heart to stop him 
7000_83708_000033_000003	train-clean-360	I only wished that I had been so fortunate as to have led the van 
none	none	The thing grew serious 
7000_83708_000034_000001	train-clean-360	So far as I could see mister Hawthorn mister Hedges mister Sapsworth and I were the only members of the Storwell team left on the ground 
7000_83708_000034_000002	train-clean-360	And the reflection involuntarily crossed my mind what fools we were to stay 
none	none	The amount of running about we had to do And the way in which mister Benyon urged us on 
7000_83708_000034_000005	train-clean-360	The perspiration was running off from us in streams I had never had such a sweater before 
7000_83708_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I do like your kind of bowling mister mister Benyon would constantly remark 
7000_83708_000036_000000	train-clean-360	If I had had an equal admiration for his kind of batting we should have been quits but I had not at least not then 
7000_83708_000037_000000	train-clean-360	A little later looking round the field I found that mister Hawthorn had disappeared and that mister Hedges stuck in a hedge was struggling gallantly to reach safety on the other side 
none	none	It was the last ball of mister Sapsworth s over 
7000_83708_000037_000002	train-clean-360	mister Benyon ran thirteen for a hit to leg 
7000_83708_000037_000003	train-clean-360	He made mister Barker run them too it was the proverbial last straw 
7000_83708_000037_000004	train-clean-360	As mister Barker was running the thirteenth run instead of going to his wicket he dropped his bat the bat which he had never had a chance to utilise and bolted off the field as though Satan was behind him 
7000_83708_000037_000005	train-clean-360	mister Benyon called out to him but mister Barker neither stopped nor stayed It seemed that the match was going to resolve itself into a game of single wicket 
none	none	To make things better when I came up to bowl I perceived that mister Sapsworth s power of endurance had reached its tether The position he had taken up in the field had not much promise of usefulness He first stood close up to the hedge then he stood in the middle of the hedge then I doubt if he stood upon the other side But at least he had vanished from my ken And I was left alone to bowl to mister Benyon 
7000_83708_000038_000005	train-clean-360	That over
