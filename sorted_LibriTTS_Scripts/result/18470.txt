none	none	and the Waldos XXIII The Thin Wall XXIV The Anniversary XXV The Allegory XXVI The Three Words THE SECOND LATCHKEY CHAPTER I A WHITE ROSE Even when Annesley Grayle turned out of the Strand toward the Savoy she was uncertain whether she would have courage to walk into the hotel With each step the thing the dreadful thing that she had come to do loomed blacker It was monstrous impossible like opening the door of the lions cage at the Zoo and stepping inside There was time still to change her mind She had only to turn now jump into an omnibus jump out again at the familiar corner and everything would be as it had been Life for the next five ten maybe twenty years would be what the last five had been At the thought of the Savoy and the adventure waiting there the girl s skin had tingled and grown hot as if a wind laden with grains of heated sand had blown over her But at the thought of turning back of going home oh misused word a leaden coldness shut her spirit into a tomb She had walked fast after descending at Bedford Street from a fierce motor bus with a party of comfortable people bound for the Adelphi Theatre Never before had she been in a motor omnibus and she was not sure whether the great hurtling thing would deign to stop except at trysting places of its own so it had seemed wise to bundle out rather than risk a snub from the conductor who looked like pictures of the Duke of Wellington But in the lighted Strand she had been stared at as well as jostled a girl alone at eight o clock on a winter evening bare headed conspicuously tall if conspicuous in no other way dressed for dinner or the theatre in a pale gray sequined gown under a mauve chiffon cloak meant for warm nights of summer Of course as missus Ellsworth giver of dress and wrap often pointed out beggars mustn t be choosers and Annesley Grayle was worse off than a beggar because beggars needn t keep up appearances She should have thanked Heaven for good clothes and so she did in chastened moods but it was a costume to make a girl hurry through the Strand and just for an instant she had been glad to turn from the white glare into comparative dimness That was because offensive eyes had made her forget the almost immediate future in the quite immediate present But the hotel with light hearted taxis tearing up to it brought remembrance with a shock She envied everyone else who was bound for the Savoy even old women and fat gentlemen with large noses They were going there because they wanted to go for their pleasure Nobody in the world could be in such an appalling situation as she was It was then that Annesley s feet began to drag and she slowed her steps to gain more time to think Could she could she do the thing For days her soul had been rushing toward this moment with thousand horsepower speed like a lonely comet tearing through space But then it had been distant the terrible goal She had not had to gasp among her heart throbs Now It is now Creep as she might three minutes brought her from the turning out of the Strand close to the welcoming entrance where revolving doors of glass received radiant visions dazzling as moonlight on snow No I can t the girl told herself desperately She wheeled more quickly than the whirling door hoping that no one would think her mad All the same I was mad she admitted to fancy I could do it I ought to have known I couldn t when the time came I m the last person to well I m sane again now anyway A few long steps carried the girl in the sparkling dress and transparent cloak into the Strand again But something queer was happening there People were shouting and running A man with a raucous alcoholic voice yelled words Annesley could not catch A woman gave a squeaking scream that sounded both ridiculous and dreadful Breaking glass crashed A growl of human anger mingled with the roar of motor omnibuses and Miss Grayle fell back from it as from a slammed door in a high wall As she stood hesitating what to do and wondering if there were a fire or a murder two women laughing hysterically rushed past into the hotel court Hurry up panted one of them They ll think we belong to the gang Let s go into the hotel and stay until it s over Oh what is it Annesley entreated running after the couple Burglars at a jeweller s window close by there are women they re being arrested one of the pair flung over her shoulder as both hurried on Women being arrested That meant that if she plunged into the fray she might be mistaken for a woman burglar and arrested with the guilty Even if she lurked where she was a prowling policeman might suppose she sought concealment and bag her as a militant Imagine what missus Ellsworth would say and do if she were taken off to jail Annesley s heart seemed to drop out of its place to go crossways as her old Irish nurse used to say a million years ago Without stopping to think again or even to breathe she flew back to the hotel entrance as a migrating bird follows its leader and slipped through the revolving door behind the fugitives It s fate she thought This must be a sign coming just when I d made up my mind Suddenly she was no longer afraid though her heart was pounding under the thin cloak Fragrance of hot house flowers and expensive perfume from women s dresses intoxicated the girl as a glass of champagne forced upon one who has never tasted wine flies to the head She felt herself on the tide of adventure moving because she must the soul which would have fled to return to missus Ellsworth was a coward not worthy to live in her body She had room in her crowded mind to think how queer it was and how queer it would seem all the rest of her life in looking back that she should have the course of her existence changed because burglars had broken some panes of glass in the Strand Just because of them creatures I ll never meet I m going to see this through to the end she said flinging up her chin and looking entirely unlike the Annesley Grayle missus Ellsworth knew To the end She thrilled at the word which had as much of the unknown in it as though it were the world s end she referred to and she were jumping off Will you please tell me where to leave my wrap she heard herself inquiring of a footman as magnificent as and far better dressed than the Apollo Belvedere Her voice sounded natural She was glad This added to her courage It was wonderful to feel brave Life was so deadly worse so stuffy at missus Ellsworth s that if she had ever been normally brave like other girls she had had the young splendour of her courage crushed out The statue in gray plush and dark blue cloth came to life and showed her the cloak room Other women were there taking last affectionate peeps at themselves in the long mirrors Annesley took a last peep at herself also not an affectionate but an anxious one Compared with these visions was she in missus Ellsworth s cast off clothes made over in odd moments by the wearer so dowdy and second hand that that a stranger would be ashamed to The question feared to finish itself I do look like a lady anyhow the girl thought with defiance That s what he that seems to be the test Now she was in a hurry to get the ordeal over Instead of hanging back she walked briskly out of the cloak room before those who had entered ahead of her finished patting their hair or putting powder on their noses It was worse in the large vestibule where men sat or stood waiting for their feminine belongings and she was the only woman alone But her boat was launched on the wild sea There was no returning The rendezvous arranged was in what he had called in his letter the foyer Annesley went slowly down the steps trying not to look aimless She decided to steer for one of the high back brocaded chairs which had little satellite tables Better settle on one in the middle of the hall This would give him a chance to see and recognize her from the description she had written of the dress she would wear she had not mentioned that she d be spared all trouble in choosing as it was her only real evening frock and to notice that she wore according to arrangement a white rose tucked into the neck of her bodice She felt conscious of her hands and especially of her feet and ankles for she had not been able to make missus Ellsworth s dress quite long enough Luckily it was the fashion of the moment to wear the skirt short and she had painted her old white suede slippers silver She believed that she had pretty feet But oh what if the darn running up the heel of the pearl gray silk stocking should show or have burst again into a hole as she jumped out of the omnibus She could have laughed hysterically as the escaping women had laughed when she realized that the fear of such a catastrophe was overcoming graver horrors Perhaps it was well to have a counter irritant Though Annesley Grayle was the only manless woman in the foyer the people who sat there with one exception did not stare Though she had five feet eight inches of height and was graceful despite self consciousness her appearance was distinguished rather than striking Yes distinguished was the word for it decided the one exception who gazed with particular interest at that tall slight figure in gray sequined chiffon too old looking for the young face He was sitting in a corner against the wall and had in his hands a copy of the Sphere which was so large when held high and wide open that the reader could hide behind it He had been in his corner for fifteen or twenty minutes when Annesley Grayle arrived glancing over the top of his paper with a sort of jaunty carelessness every few minutes at the crowd moving toward the restaurant picking out some individual then dropping his eyes to the Sphere For the girl in gray he had a long appraising look studying her every point but he did the thing so well that even had she turned her head his way she need not have been embarrassed All she would have seen was a man s forehead and a rim of smooth black hair showing over the top of an illustrated paper What he saw was a clear profile with a delicate nose slightly tilting upward in a proud rather than impertinent way an arch of eyebrow daintily sketched a large eye which might be gray or violet a drooping mouth with a short upper lip a really charming chin and a long white throat skin softly pale like white velvet thick ash blond hair parted in the middle and worn Madonna fashion there seemed to be a lot of it in the coil at the nape of her neck The creature looked too simple too not dowdy but too unsophisticated to have anything false about her Figure too thin hardly to be called a figure at all but agreeably girlish and its owner might be anywhere from twenty to five or six years older Not beautiful just an average lady like English girl or perhaps more of Irish type but certainly with possibilities If she were a princess or a millionairess she might be glorified by newspapers as a beauty Annesley forced her nervous limbs to slow movement because she hoped or dreaded anyhow expected that one of the dozen or so unattached men would spring up and say constrainedly Miss Grayle I believe er how do you do If only he might not be fat or very bald headed He had not described himself at all Everything was to depend on her gray dress and the white rose That seemed now one came face to face with the fear rather ominous But no one sprang up No one wanted to know if she were Miss Grayle and this although she was ten minutes late Her instructions as to what to do at the Savoy were clear If she were not met in the foyer she was to go into the restaurant and ask for a table reserved for mister N Smith There she was to sit and wait to be joined by him She had never contemplated having to carry out the latter clause however and when she had loitered for a few seconds the thought rushed over her that here was a loop hole through which to slip if she wanted a loop hole One side of her did want it the side she knew best and longest as herself Annesley Grayle a timid girl brought up conventionally and taught that to rely on others older and wiser than she was the right way for a well born sheltered woman to go through life The other side the new desperate side that missus Ellsworth s stuffiness had developed was not looking for any means of escape and this side had seized the upper hand since the alarm of the burglars in the Strand Annesley marched into the restaurant with the air of a soldier facing his first battle and asked a waiter where was mister Smith s table The youth dashed off and produced a duke like personage his chief A list was consulted with care and Annesley was respectfully informed that no table had been engaged by a mister N Smith for dinner that evening Are you sure persisted Annesley bewildered and disappointed Yes miss madame I am sure we have not the name on our list said the head waiter The blankness of the girl s disappointment looked out appealingly from wistful wide apart eyes The man was sorry There may be some misunderstanding he consoled her Perhaps mister Smith has telephoned and we have not received the message I hope it is not the fault of the hotel We do not often make mistakes yet it is possible We have had a few early dinners before the theatre and there is one small table disengaged Would madame care to take it it is here close to the door and watch for the gentleman when he comes When he comes The head waiter comfortably took it for granted that mister Smith had been delayed that he would come and that it would be a pity to miss him The polite person might be right though with a sinking heart Annesley began to suspect herself played with abandoned as she deserved for her dreadful boldness Perhaps mister Smith had been in communication with someone else more suitable than she and had thrown over the appointment without troubling to let her know Or perhaps he had been waiting in the foyer had inspected her as she passed and hadn t liked her looks This latter supposition seemed probable but the head waiter was so confident of what she ought to do that the girl could think of no excuse After all it would do little harm to wait and see what happened As mister Smith was apparently not living at the Savoy he had merely asked her to meet him there he might have had an accident in train or taxi Annesley had made her plans to be away from home for two hours so she could give him the benefit of the doubt A moment of hesitation and she was seating herself in a chair offered by the head waiter It was one of a couple drawn up at a small table for two Sitting thus Annesley could see everybody who came in and what was more important could be seen By what struck her as an odd coincidence the table was decorated with a vase of white roses whose hearts blushed faintly in the light of a pink shaded electric lamp A quarter of an hour twenty minutes dragged along and no mister Smith Annesley could follow the passing moments on her wrist watch in its silver bracelet the only present missus Ellsworth had ever given her with the exception of cast off clothes and a pocket handkerchief each Christmas Every nerve in the girl s body seemed to prickle with embarrassment She played with a dinner roll changed the places of the flowers and the lamp trying to appear at ease and not daring to look up lest she should meet eyes curious or pitying What if they make me pay for dinner after I ve kept the table so long she thought in her ignorance of hotel customs And I ve got only a shilling Half an hour now all but two minutes There was nothing more to hope or fear But there was the ordeal of getting away I ll sit out the two minutes she told herself Then I ll go Ought I to tip the waiter Horrible doubt And she must have been dreaming to touch that roll Better sneak away while the waiter was busy at a distance Frightened miserable she was counting her chances when a man whose coming into the room her dilemma had caused her to miss marched unhesitatingly to her table CHAPTER II SMITHS AND SMITHS Annesley glanced up her face aflame like a fanned coal The man was tall dark lean square jawed handsome in just that thrilling way which magazine illustrators and women love the ideal story hero to look at even to the clothes which any female serial writer would certainly have described as immaculate evening dress It was too good oh far too wonderfully good to be true that this man should be mister Smith Yet if he were not mister Smith why should he Annesley got no farther in the thought though it flashed through her mind quick as light Before she had time to seek an answer for her question the man who was young or youngish not more than thirty three or four had bent over her as if greeting a friend and had begun to speak in a low voice blurred by haste or some excitement You will do me an immense service he said if you ll pretend to know me and let me sit down here You sha n t regret it and it may save my life Sit down answered something in Annesley that was newly awake She found her hand being warmly shaken Then the man took the chair reserved for mister Smith just as she realized fully that he wasn t mister Smith Her heart was beating fast her eyes fixed on the man s face waiting for some explanation were dilated Thank you he said leaning toward her in his hand a menu which the waiter had placed before the girl while she was still alone She noticed that the hand was brown and nervous looking the hand of a man who might be a musician or an artist He was pretending to read the menu and to consult her about it You re a true woman the right sort brave I swear I m not here for any impertinence Now will you go on helping me Can you keep your wits and not give me away whatever happens I think so answered the new Annesley What do you want me to do She took the pitch of her tone from his speaking quietly and wondering if she would not wake up in her ugly brown bedroom at missus Ellsworth s as she had done a dozen times when dreaming in advance of her rendezvous at the Savoy It will be a shock when I tell you he answered But for Heaven s sake don t misunderstand I shouldn t ask this if it weren t absolutely necessary In case a man comes to this table and questions you you must let him suppose that you are my wife Oh gasped Annesley Her eyes met the eyes that seemed to have been waiting for her look and they answered with an appeal which she could not refuse She did not stop to think that if the dark eyes had not been so handsome they might have been easier to resist She the suppressed and timid girl never allowed to make up her mind let herself go with the wave of strong emotion carrying her along and reached a resolve It means trusting you a great deal she answered But you say you re in danger so I ll do what you ask I think you can t be wicked enough to pay me back by trying to hurt me You think right the man said and it struck her that his accent was not quite English She wondered if he were Canadian or American Not that she knew much about either A woman like you would think right he went on Only one woman out of ten thousand would have the nerve and presence of mind and the humanity to do what you re doing When I came into this room and saw your face I counted on you Annesley blushed again in a rush of happiness She had always longed to do something which would really matter to another soul She had even prayed for it Now the moment seemed to have come God would not let her be the victim of an ignoble trick I m glad she said her face lit by a light from within And at that moment bending toward each other they were a beautiful couple A seeker of romance would have taken them for lovers Tell me what you want me to do Annesley said once more The worst of it is I can t tell you exactly Two men may come into this restaurant looking for me One or both will speak to me They ll call me a certain name and I shall say they ve made a mistake You must say so too You must tell them I m your husband and stick to that no matter what the man or men may tell you about me The principal thing now is to choose a name But by Jove I forgot it in my hurry Are you expecting any one to join you If you are it s awkward I was expecting someone but I ve given him up Was this table taken in his name or yours Or perhaps but no I m sure you re not Sure I m not what Married You re a girl Your eyes haven t got any experience of life in them Annesley looked down and when she looked down her face was very sweet She had long curved brown lashes a shade or two darker than her hair I m not married she said rather stiffly I thought a table had been engaged in the name of mister Smith but there was a misunderstanding The head waiter put me at this table in case mister Smith should come I ve given him up now and was going away when When you took pity on a nameless man But it seems indicated that he should be mister Smith unless you have any objection No I have none You d better take the name as I mentioned it to the waiter And the first name I don t know The initial I gave was N Very well I choose Nelson Where do we live Annesley stared frightened Forgive me the man said I ought to have explained what I meant before asking you that or put the question another way Will you go on as you ve begun and trust me farther by letting me drive with you to your home if necessary in case of being followed At worst I ll need to beg no more than to stand inside your front door for a few minutes if we re watched and but I see that this time I have passed the limit I m expecting too much How do you know but I may be a thief or a murderer I hadn t thought of such a thing Annesley stammered I was only thinking it isn t my house It doesn t even belong to my people I live with an old lady missus Ellsworth I hope she ll be in bed when I get back and the servants too I have a key because because I told a fib about the place where I was going and consequently missus Ellsworth approved If she hadn t approved I shouldn t have been allowed out I could let you stand inside the door

none	none	any one followed us to the house and saw the number he could look in the directory and find out that it belonged to missus Ellsworth not mister Smith He couldn t have a directory in his pocket By the time he got hold of one and could make any use of his knowledge I d be far away Yes I suppose you would Annesley thought aloud and a little voice seemed to add sharply in her ear Far away out of my life This brought to her memory what she had in her excitement forgotten the adventure she had come out to meet had faded into thin air The unexpected one which had so startlingly taken its place would end to night and she would be left to the dreary existence from which she had tried to break free She was like a pebble that had succeeded in riding out to sea on a wave only to be washed back into its old place on the shore The thought that after all she had no change to look forward to gave the girl a passionate desire to make the most of this one living hour among many that were born dead missus Ellsworth s house she said is twenty two A Torrington Square Thank you Only these two words he spoke but the eager dark eyes seemed to add praise and blessings for her confidence My name is Annesley Grayle she volunteered as if to prove to the man and to herself how far she trusted him also perhaps as a bid for his name in payment of that trust So at least he must have understood for he said If I don t tell you mine it s for your own protection I m not ashamed of it but it s better that you shouldn t know that if you heard it suddenly it should be strange to you just like any other name Don t you see I m right I dare say you are Then we ll leave it at that But we can t go on pretending to study this menu for ever You came to dine with mister Smith You ll dine with his understudy instead You ll let me order dinner It s part of the programme Very well Annesley agreed The man nodded to the head waiter who had been interested in the little drama indirectly stage managed by him Instead of sending a subordinate he came himself to take the order With wonderful promptness considering that mister Smith s thoughts had not been near the menu under his eyes several dishes were chosen and a wine selected Madame is glad now that I persuaded her not to go the waiter could not resist and Annesley replied that she was glad As the man turned away mister Smith raised his eyebrows with rather a wistful smile I m afraid you re sorry really he said If I d come a minute later than I did you d have been safe and happy at home by this time Not happy amended the girl Because it isn t home If it were I shouldn t have told fibs to missus Ellsworth to night That sounds interesting remarked her companion It s not interesting she assured him Nothing in my life is I don t want to bore you by talking about my affairs but if you think we may be interrupted perhaps I d better explain one or two things while there s time I wanted to come here this evening to keep an engagement I d made but it s difficult for me to get out alone missus Ellsworth doesn t like to be left and she never lets me go anywhere without her except to the house of some friends of mine the only real friends I have It s odd but their name is Smith and that saved my telling a direct lie Not that a half lie isn t worse it s so cowardly missus Ellsworth likes me to go to Archdeacon and missus Smith s because I m afraid because she thinks they re swells missus Smith has a duke for an uncle missus Ellsworth said yes at once when I asked and gave me her key and permission to stop out till half past ten though everyone in the house is supposed to be in bed by ten She s almost sure to be in bed herself but if she gets interested in one of the books I brought from the library to day it s possible she may be sitting up to read and to ask about my evening Our bedrooms are on the ground floor at the back of an addition to the house What if she should hear the latchkey it s old fashioned and hard to work and what if she should come to the swing door at the end of the corridor where she d see you with me What would you say or do H m It would be awkward But isn t there a young Smith in your Archdeacon s family There is one but I haven t seen him since I was a little girl He s a sailor He s away now on an Arctic expedition Then it wasn t that mister Smith you came to meet at the Savoy No They re not related As Annesley returned in thought to the mister Smith who had thrown her over she took from her bodice the white rose which was to have identified her for him and found it a place in the vase with the other white roses She had a special reason for doing this The real mister Smith if by any chance he appeared now would be a complication Without the rose he could not claim her acquaintance Why do you do that her companion broke the thread of his questioning to ask The girl was tempted to tell some easy fib that the rose was faded or too fragrant but somehow she could not They both seemed so close to the deep down things of life at this moment that to speak the truth was the one possible thing I arranged to wear a white rose for mister Smith to recognize me We have never seen each other she confessed Yet you say there s nothing interesting in your life It s true This thing was was dreadful It could happen only to a girl whose life was not interesting Now I understand why you put away the rose for my sake in case mister Smith should turn up after all Will you give it to me I won t flaunt it in my buttonhole I ll hide it sacredly in memory of this evening and of you Not that I shall need to be reminded of anything which concerns this night you especially and your generosity your courage But it may be that the men I spoke of won t find me here If they don t the worst of your ordeal is over It will only be to finish dinner and let me put you into a taxi To morrow you can think that you dreamed the wretch who appealed to you and be glad that you will never see him again Annesley selected her white rose from its fellows dried its stem daintily with her napkin and gave the flower to mister Smith Already it looked refreshed as she herself felt refreshed after five years of stuffiness by these few throbbing moments Their hands touched and through Annesley s darted a little tingle of electricity that flashed up her arm to her heart where it caught like a hooked wire She was surprised almost frightened by the sensation and ashamed because she didn t find it disagreeable It must be that people who re really alive as he is give out magnetism she thought And the thrill lingered as the man thanked her with eyes and voice When he had looked at the rose curiously as if expecting to learn from it the secret of its wearer he put the flower away in a letter case in an inner breast pocket of his coat For once Annesley was face to face with romance and even though she would presently go back to the old round since the adventure she came out to meet had failed she was stirred to a wild gladness in this other adventure The hors d oeuvres appeared then soup and wine which mister Smith begged her to taste Drink luck for me he insisted You and you alone can bring it Annesley drank And the champagne filliped colour to her cheeks Now we ll go on and think out the problem of what may happen at your door if Fate takes me there the man said Your old friend s sailor son is no use to me He can t be whisked back from the North Pole to London for my benefit Perhaps I may be an acquaintance of Archdeacon Smith s mayn t I if worst comes to worst I ve been dining there and brought you back in a taxi Will that do If there are fibs to tell I ll tell them myself and spare you if possible After all I ve told to night one or two more can t matter said Annesley They won t hurt missus Ellsworth It s the other danger that s more worrying the danger from 
589_146346_000017_000002	train-clean-360	those men 
none	none	I ve thought of something that may help if they follow us to Torrington Square They may ask a policeman whose house we ve gone into and find out it s missus Ellsworth s before you can get away So it will be better not to tell them it s yours You can be visiting There is a mister Smith who comes sometimes from America where he lives though he s not American Even the policemen who have that beat may have heard of him from missus Ellsworth s servants There s a room kept always ready for him and called mister Smith s room That does help said the man It s clever and kind of you to rack your brains for me A mister Smith from America It s easy for me to play that part I m from America Perhaps you ve guessed that But you re very different from missus Ellsworth s mister Smith Annesley warned him hastily He s middle aged eccentric and not good looking He comes to England for his nerves when he has worked too hard and tired himself out I think he s rich and once he was robbed in some big hotel so he likes to stay at a plain sort of house where there s no danger He has a horror of burglars and won t even stop at the Archdeacon s since they had a burglary a few years ago He pays missus Ellsworth for his room I believe A funny arrangement it came about through me But that s not of importance to you It may be We can t tell Better let me know as much as possible about these Smiths There s missus Ellsworth s Smith and the Smith you came to meet We needn t talk of him anyway There was a hint of anger in the girl s protest but her resentment was for the man who had humiliated her by breaking his appointment such an appointment She hurried on trying to hide all signs of agitation You see missus Ellsworth once hoped to have Archdeacon Smith and his wife for friends They didn t care for her but they loved my father oh long ago in the country where we lived When he died and I hadn t any money or training for work they were nice to missus Ellsworth for my sake or rather for my father s sake and persuaded her to take me as her companion She was glad to do it to please them but soon she realized that they didn t mean to reward her by being intimate Poor woman I was almost sorry for her disappointment You see she s a snob at heart and though Smith sounds a common name both the Archdeacon and his wife have titled relations So have I and that was another reason for taking me She adores a title Doesn t that sound pitiful But she has few interests and no real friends so she s never given up hope of collecting the Smiths That s why she lets me visit them And when I happened to mention for something to say that the Archdeacon had an eccentric cousin in America who was afraid of hotels and even of visiting at their house because of a fad about burglars she offered to give him the better of her two spare rooms whenever he came to England I never thought he d accept but he did only he would insist on paying That s the story if you can call it a story for mister Ruthven Smith isn t a bit exciting nor interesting When he appears generally quite suddenly he finds his room ready He has his breakfast sent up and lunches out at his club or somewhere He mostly dines out too but he has a standing invitation to dine with missus Ellsworth and we always have good dinners when he is staying to be ready in case of the worst The man smiled rather a charming smile Annesley could not help noticing In case of the worst he repeated He must be deadly if his society bores you more than that of an old lady on whom I suppose you dance attendance morning noon and night Now my situation is so er peculiar that I ought to be thankful to exchange identities with any man But I wouldn t with mister Ruthven Smith for all his money and jewels Annesley opened her eyes Did I say anything about jewels she asked No you didn t the man assured her except in mentioning the name of Ruthven Smith Anybody who has lived in America as long as I have associates jewels with the name of Ruthven Smith His Ruthven lifts him far above the ruck of a mere Smith like myself for instance and he smiled again Annesley began curiously to feel as if she knew him well This made her more anxious to give him help for it would not be helping a stranger it would be helping a friend I ve heard of course that he s something I m not sure what in a firm of jewellers she said But I d no idea of his being so important He s third partner with Van Vreck company her companion explained I ve heard he joined at first because of his great knowledge of jewels and because he s been able to revive the lost art of making certain transparent enamels The Van Vrecks sent for him from England years ago He buys jewels for the firm now I believe No doubt that s why he s in such a funk about burglars Fancy your knowing more about mister Smith than

none	none	Perhaps more than missus Ellsworth knows exclaimed Annesley forgetting the strain of expectation the dread that a pair of mysterious nightmare men might break up the dreamlike dinner party for two I don t know more about him than half America and Europe knows laughed the man It s lucky I do know something though as I may have to be mistaken for Ruthven Smith and add an N to his initials I suppose he s not in England now by any chance No It must be six or seven months since he was here last said Annesley I don t think missus Ellsworth has heard from him She hardly ever does until a day or two before he s due to arrive neither do his cousins A peculiar fellow it would seem remarked her companion And then out of a plunge into thought You say you ve never seen the mister Smith you came to meet at the Savoy How can you be sure it isn t old R S as they call him at Van Vreck s wanting to play you a trick give you a surprise Annesley shook her head If you knew mister Ruthven Smith you d know that would be impossible Why I don t believe he remembers when I m out of sight that I exist Still more peculiar Miss Grayle I haven t any right to ask you questions But I shouldn t be a man if I weren t forgetting my own affairs in in curiosity if you want to call it that I don t about yours No I won t let it pass for ordinary curiosity Can t you understand you re doing for me more than any woman ever has done or any man would do That does make a bond between us You can t deny it Tell me about this mister Smith whom you don t know and never saw yet came to the Savoy Hotel to meet CHAPTER III WHY SHE CAME Surprised by the abruptness of his question Annesley s eyes dropped from the eyes of her host which tried to hold them She felt that she ought to be angry with him for taking advantage of her generosity for it amounted to that Yet anger would not come only shame and the desire to hide a thing which would change his gratitude to contempt Don t let s waste time talking about me she said We haven t arranged We ve arranged everything as well as we can For the rest I must trust to luck and you Do tell me why you came here why you thought you came here I mean for I m convinced you were sent for my sake by any higher powers there may be I felt that the minute I saw you I feel it ten times more strongly now I know that whatever your reason was it s nothing to be ashamed of I am ashamed Annesley was led on to confess You d despise me if I told you for you can t realize what my life s been for five years And that s my one excuse Only a fool would want a woman like you to excuse herself for anything I swear I wouldn t despise you I couldn t If you should tell me knowing you as little or as well as I do that you d been plotting a murder I d be certain you were justified and my first thought would be to save you as you re saving me now Annesley felt again the man s intense magnetism Suddenly she wanted to tell him everything It would be a relief She would watch his face and see how it changed It would be like having the verdict of the world on what she had done or meant to do I saw an advertisement in the Morning Post she said with a kind of breathless violence from a man who who wanted to meet a girl with a view to marriage The words brought a blush so painful that the mounting blood forced tears to her eyes But she looked her vis a vis unwaveringly in the face That did not change at all unless the interest in his eyes grew warmer The sympathy she saw there gave Annesley a new and passionate desire to defend herself If he had shown disgust she would not have cared to try she thought I told you it was horrid and not interesting or romantic she dashed on But I was desperate missus Ellsworth is awful I don t suppose you ever met such a woman She s not cruel about starving my body It s only my soul she starves What business have I with a soul except in church where it s proper to think about such things But she nags nags She makes my hair feel as if it were turning gray at the roots and my face drying up like an apple I wasn t nineteen when I came to her I m twenty three now and I feel old desiccated thanks to those piling up hundreds of days with her They ve killed my spirit I used to be different I can feel it I can see it in the mirror It isn t only the passing days but having nothing better to look forward to I m too cowardly or too religious or something to kill myself even if I knew how to decently But the deadliness of it all the airlessness of her house and her heart A man couldn t imagine it She s made me forget not only my own youth but that there s youth in the world Why at first I was so wild

none	none	have loved to say dreadful things or strike her But now I haven t the spirit left to feel like that My blood s turning white The other day when I was reading aloud to missus Ellsworth I read a lot the stupidest parts of the papers and the silliest books that turn my brain to fluff I caught sight of an advertisement in the Personal Column I stopped just in time and didn t read it out Only a glimpse I had for I was in the midst of something else when my eyes wandered But when missus Ellsworth was taking her nap after luncheon I got the Post again and read the advertisement through carefully The reason I was interested was because even the glance I took showed that the girl who was wanted seemed in some ways rather like me The advertisement said she must be from twenty one to twenty six needn t be a beauty but of pleasant appearance money no object the essentials were that she must have a fair education and be of good birth and manners so as to command a certain position in society I believe those were the very words And it didn t seem too conceited to think that I answered the description I m not bad looking and my mother s father was an earl an Irish one I couldn t get the advertisement out of my head It fascinated me No wonder exclaimed mister Smith He had been listening intently and though she had paused panting a little more than once he had not broken in with a word Do you honestly think it no wonder Annesley flashed at him It was like a prisoner seeing a key sticking in a door that has always been locked he said
589_146346_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 How strange 
none	none	you should think of that she cried It was the thought which came into my mind and seemed to excuse me if anything could Annesley felt grateful to the man She was sure she could never have explained herself in this way or pleaded her own cause with the real mister Smith A man cold blooded enough to advertise for a wife well born and able to command a certain position in society would have frozen her into an ice block of reserve She might possibly have accepted his proposition one couldn t speak of it in the ordinary way as a proposal provided that on seeing her he had judged her suitable for the place but she could never have talked her heart out to him as she was led on to do by this other man equally a stranger yet sympathetic because of his own trouble and the mystery which made of him a figure of romance It isn t strange I should think of the prison door and the key her companion said That was the situation N Smith was rather clever in his way There must be many girls of good family and good looks who are in prison pining to escape He must have had a lot of answers that fellow but none of the girls could have come within a mile of you I m selfish I bless my lucky stars he didn t turn up here I dare say it s the best thing that could happen Annesley agreed with a sigh Probably he s horrible But there was one thing I thought though he must be a snob and vulgar advertising as he did for a wife of good birth that very thing looked as if he were no worse than a snob Not a villain I mean Otherwise I shouldn t have dared answer But I did answer the same day while I had the courage I posted a letter with some of missus Ellsworth s which she sent me out to drop into the box His address was N S the Morning Post and I told him to send a reply if he wrote to the stationery shop and library where missus Ellsworth makes me go every day to change her books And the answer What was it like What impression did it give you questioned the man who sat in mister Smith s place Oh it was written in a good hand But it was a stiff commonplace sort of letter except that it asked me to wear a white rose White roses happen to be the ones I like best So do I said mister Smith Did he tell you to come to a table here and wait for him Not exactly He was to meet me in the foyer But if he did not I was to understand he d been delayed and in that case I must come to the restaurant and inquire for a table engaged by mister N Smith Lots of times I decided not to do anything But you see I came and this is my reward A poor one her companion finished I don t mean that I mean he hasn t come at all Maybe he never meant to Maybe he got some letter he liked better than mine and arranged to meet the girl somewhere else A man of that sort wouldn t write to tell the straight truth in time and save the unwanted one from humiliation Are you very sorry he didn t No Annesley said frankly I m not sorry It s good to be able to help someone I m glad I came So am I mister Smith answered with a sudden change in his voice from calm to excitement And now the moment isn t far off I think for the help to be given The men I spoke of are here They re in the restaurant You can t see them without turning your head which would not be wise They re speaking to a waiter They haven t seen me yet but they re sure to look soon They re pointing to a table near us It s free The waiter s leading them to it In an instant you ll have a better view of them than I shall Now but don t look up yet From under her lashes Annesley saw in the way women do see without seeming to use their eyes two men conducted to a table directly in front of her As she sat on her host s right at the end of the table not opposite to him this gave her the advantage or disadvantage of facing the newcomers fully while mister Smith who had faced them as they entered would have his profile turned toward their table The pair seated themselves in the same way that Annesley and her companion were placed one at the right hand of the other This caused the first man to face the girl fully and gave her the second in profile One table only intervened between mister Smith s and that selected by the late arrivals and the latter had hardly sat down when the party of four at the intermediate table rose to go Under cover of their departure bowing of waiters and readjustment of ladies sable or ermine stoles Annesley ventured a lightning glance at the men She saw that both were black haired and black bearded with dark skins and long noses There was a slight suggestion of resemblance between them They might be brothers They were in evening dress but did not look Annesley thought like gentlemen mister Smith was eating blennes au caviar apparently with enjoyment He called a waiter and told him to put more whipped cream on the caviare as yet untouched in the middle of Annesley s pancake That s better I think he said genially And as the waiter went away What are they doing now Annesley lifted her champagne glass as an excuse to raise her eyes I m afraid they ve seen us and are talking about you Can t we hadn t we better go Certainly not replied mister Smith At least I can t But if you repent I don t Annesley broke in I was thinking of you of course Bless you said her host His tone was suddenly gay She glanced at him and saw that his face was gay also his eyes bright and challenging his look almost boyish She had taken him for thirty three or four now she would have guessed him younger Annesley could not help admiring his pluck for he had said that the arrival of these men meant danger She ought to be sorry as well as frightened because they had come but at that moment she was neither Her companion s example was contagious Her spirits rose And the thought flashed through her head This adventure won t end here If she had had time she would have been ashamed of her gladness but there was no time Smith was talking again in a suppressed yet cheerful tone You won t forget that we re mister and missus Nelson Smith No no I sha n t forget You may have to call me Nelson and I to call you Annesley It s a pretty name odd for a woman to have How did you get it Oh you don t want to hear that now Why not unless you d rather not tell me We can t do anything more till the blow falls except enjoy ourselves and go on with our dinner How did you come to be Annesley It was part of my mother s maiden name She was an Annesley Seton There s a Lord Annesley Seton isn t there Yes Related to you A cousin But Grayle isn t a name in their set He and his wife have forgotten my existence I m not likely to remind them of it His wife was an American girl wasn t she How odd that you should know Not very I remember there being a lot in the papers about the wedding six or seven years ago The girl was very rich a Miss Haverstall Her father s lost his money since then How can you keep such uninteresting things in your mind just now They re not uninteresting They concern you Lord Annesley Seton s affairs don t concern me and never will I wonder said Smith looking thoughtful and the girl wondered too not about her future or her relatives but what the next few minutes would do with this strange young man and how at such a time he could bear to talk commonplaces If you re trying to keep me from being nervous she whispered it s not a bit of use I can t think of anything or any one except those men They ve stopped whispering But they re looking at you Now they re getting up They re coming toward us CHAPTER IV THE GREAT MOMENT The men were staring so keenly at mister N Smith that it seemed to Annesley he must feel the stab of eyes sharp as pin pricks in his back He had the self control however not to look round not even to change expression No man in the restaurant appeared more calmly at ease than he The couple had accompanied their stare with eager whisperings Then as if on some hasty decision they pushed back their chairs and got up Taking a few steps they separated approaching Smith on right and left One therefore stood between him and Annesley as if to prevent an exchange of words or glances There was something Eastern and oddly alien about them in spite of their conventional clothes mister Michael Varcoe said the bigger and older he who stood on the left of Smith The other kept in the background not to crowd with conspicuous rudeness between Annesley and her host The man who spoke had a thick voice and a curious accent which the girl with her small experience was unable to place No answered Smith in a puzzled tone You mistake me for someone else I think not insisted the bearded man in a hostile drawl I think not I m sure not echoed the other You are Michael Varcoe There s no getting away from that The emphasis seemed to add And no getting away from us Excitement stirred Annesley to courage Why how horrid she exclaimed bending past the human obstacle people taking you for some foreigner I m sure you can t be like a man with such a name as Michael Varcoe Tell them who we are My name is Nelson Smith said her official husband My wife is not Your wife repeated the man standing opposite Annesley He stared with insolent incredulity mister and missus Nelson Smith A good name to take It happens to have been given me Slight sharpness broke the tolerance of Smith s tone I don t believe you exclaimed the other Smith s black brows drew together It doesn t matter whether you believe or not he said What does matter is that you should annoy us I tell you I m not Michael Varcoe and never heard the name If you re not satisfied and if you don t go back to your dinner and let us finish ours in peace I ll appeal to the management Well grumbled the taller of the pair If you re not the man I want you re his image minus moustache and beard You must be Varcoe Of course he s Varcoe insisted the other Of course he s not said Annesley with just the right amount of irritation Our name is Smith Nelson do tell this person to ask the head waiter who engaged the table and not stay here making a fuss Anybody can engage a table in the name of Smith sneered the first speaker That is nothing We go by something more convincing than a name There are countries where men have been arrested on less resemblance or put out of the way Oh Nelson he s frightening me faltered Annesley He must have lost his senses You think that do you The fierce eyes fixed her with a stare You tell me you madame that you are this man s wife I do tell you so the girl replied firmly though I don t see that it s your affair Now go away Very well we take your word returned the man in a tone which said that he did nothing of the sort And we go back to our table to let you finish your meal mister and missus Smith His black glance sprang like a tarantula from her face to her companion s then to his friend s The latter accepted the ultimatum and followed in sulky silence but when the pair were seated at their own table though they ordered food and wine their attention was still for the alleged mister and missus Smith Annesley tried to ignore the fact that they stared without ceasing but she could not help being aware of their eyes She felt faint and everything in the room whirled giddily Drink some champagne said Smith s quiet voice The girl obeyed and the ice cold wine cooled the fire in blood and nerves You have been splendid Smith encouraged her I know you won t fail me now I promise you I will not returned Annesley The worst is over I feel ready for anything How can I thank you he murmured If I had all the rest of my life to do it in instead of a few minutes it wouldn t be too much You were perfect in your manner not anxious only annoyed just the right air for a self respecting missus Smith They both laughed and Annesley was surprised that she could laugh naturally and gaily Presently she laughed again when mister Smith remarked that she had missed her vocation in not being an actress she the country mouse who had hardly been inside a theatre The two lingered over their dinner watched with impatience by the men at the other table who had ordered only one dish and paid for it immediately that they might be ready for anything at an instant s notice They had also a small bottle of wine which they sipped abstemiously as an excuse to remain after their food had been eaten When at last mister and missus Smith had finished their bombe surprise and trifled with some fruit Annesley said Evidently they don t care how long they have to wait I suppose there s nothing for us to do but to go Oh yes there s still something said Smith We ll have coffee in the foyer and see what the enemy s next move is It would be a mistake to let the brutes believe they re frightening us Annesley agreed in silence but in her heart she was glad to lengthen out the adventure Soon she would have to creep back to her dull modern substitute for a moated grange and after that not the deluge nothing so exciting extinction As they walked out of the restaurant together the girl glanced up at the dark profile mysterious as a stranger s yet familiar as a friend s The man had told her nothing about himself except that he was in danger and had given no hint as to what that danger was but the girl s heart was warm with belief in him If there were a question of crime the crime was not his His superiority over those creatures must be moral as well as physical and social By an odd coincidence mister Smith steered for the sofa in the corner whence a man had stared from behind an open newspaper at a tall lonely girl in gray earlier in the evening Annesley knew nothing of this coincidence because she had not noticed the man but even if she had she would have forgotten him She had been thinking of herself when she first trailed her gray dress over the red carpet of the foyer now returning she thought of the man who was with her and the two who were certain to follow Scarcely were she and Smith seated before the others appeared The men sat down in chairs drawn up at a little table and not only must those in the corner pass by them in escaping but every word spoken above a whisper must be overheard This fact did not embarrass Smith He ordered coffee and cigarettes and talked to Annesley in an ordinary tone about a motor trip which it would be pleasant to take The watchers also demanded coffee But the waiter they summoned was slow in fulfilling their order When it was obeyed before the pair had time to lift cup to lip mister Smith took impish pleasure in getting to his feet Come dear he said we d better be off He laid on the table money for the coffee and cigarettes with a satisfactory tip Then without looking at their neighbours he and Annesley passed walking shoulder to shoulder with a leisurely step toward the entrance I suppose there s no chance of shaking them off the girl whispered None whatever said Smith But we ve had the fun of cheating them out of their coffee because they won t chance our stopping to pick up our wraps They ll be on our heels till the end of the journey so there s nothing for it except to stick to the original plan of my going home with you I hope you don t mind I hope you re not afraid of me now I m not at all afraid said Annesley Thank you for that If our taxi outruns theirs I sha n t need to trespass on your kindness beyond the doorstep But if they overtake us and are on the spot before you can vanish into the house and I can disappear in some other direction are you still game to keep your promise the promise to let me go indoors with you Yes I am game to the end whatever the end may be the girl answered and she wondered at herself because her heart was as brave as her words Five minutes later Annesley wrapped in her thin cloak was stepping into a taxi As Smith followed and told the chauffeur where to drive the two watchers shot through the revolving door in time to overhear and also to order a taxi Annesley wondered for one dismayed instant why her companion should have given the real address He might have mentioned some other street and thus have gained time but a second thought told her that with the pursuing taxi so close upon their heels an attempt to deceive would have been useless The policy of defiance was the only one For a few moments neither the girl nor the man spoke although Annesley felt that there were a thousand things to say Every second was taking them nearer to Torrington Square and their parting must come soon After that all would be blankness for her as before this wonderful night Such thoughts made the girl a prisoner of silence and mister Smith was also tongue tied Was he concentrating his mind upon some plan of escape from these mysterious enemies She told herself this must be so yet his first words proved that he had been thinking of the risk she ran If the dragon comes out of her den and catches us at the door will that mean a catastrophe for you or can I be explained away he inquired I don t know said Annesley And somehow I don t care I care the man replied I can t have harm come to you through me But tell me before we go farther does it matter to you Miss Grayle that in a little while you and I may see the last of each other I feel I have a sort of right to ask that question because it matters such a lot to me I ve got to know you better in this one evening than I could in a year in a commonplace way I don t want you to go out of my life because you re the best thing that ever came into it And if I dared hope that I might mean to you some day half what you ve begun to mean for me already why I wouldn t let you go Annesley clasped her hands under her cloak They were cold yet tingling Her blood was leaping but she could not speak She was afraid of saying too much Can t you give me a grain of hope he went on His voice was wistful We have so little time What do you want me to say Annesley stammered I want you to say that you don t wish to see the last of me to night I shouldn t be human if I could wish that the words seemed to speak themselves and she who had been taught to repress and hide emotion as if it were a vice was glad that the truth was out After all they had gone through together she couldn t send this man away believing her indifferent I it doesn t seem as if we were strangers she faltered on Strangers I should think not he echoed We mayn t know much about each other s tastes but we do know about each other s souls which is more than can be said of most men and women acquainted for half a lifetime As for our pasts you haven t had one and I well if I swear to you that I ve never murdered anybody or been in prison or committed an unforgivable crime will you take my word If you told me you were a murderer or had committed some unforgivable crime I I don t feel as if I could believe it Annesley assured him It would hurt me to think evil of you I m sure it isn t you who are evil but these men You re an angel to feel like that and speak like that exclaimed Smith I don t deserve your goodness but I appreciate it I d like to take your hand and kiss it when I thank you but I won t because you re alone with me under my protection To save me from trouble you ve risked danger and put yourself in my power I may be bad in some ways most men are or would be in women s eyes if women saw them as they are but I m not a brute The worst I ve ever done is to try to pay back a great injury an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth Do you blame me for that I have no right I don t know what the injury was said the girl and hesitating a little still I don t think I could find happiness in revenge I could or anyhow satisfaction I confess that About happiness I don t know much But you could teach me I Yes Do you believe there can be such a thing as love at first sight I can t tell Books say so Perhaps There s no perhaps I ve found that out to night I believe love that comes at sight must be the only real love a sort of electric call from soul to soul The thing that s happened is just this I ve met the one woman my help mate If I come out of this trouble and can ask a girl like you to give herself to me will you do it Oh you say this because you think you ought to be grateful cried Annesley But I don t want gratitude This is the first time I ve ever lived I owe that to you And it s more than you can owe to me The man laughed a happy laugh as though danger were miles away instead of on his heels You know almost as much about men as a child knows Miss Grayle he said if you think I m one of the sort if there is such a sort who would tie himself to a woman for gratitude I ve just one motive in wanting you to marry me I love you and need you I couldn t feel more if I d known you months instead of hours The wonder of it swept over Annesley in a flood Even in her dreams and she had had wild dreams sometimes she had never pictured a man such as this loving her and wanting her To the girl s mind he was so attractive that it seemed impossible his choice of her could be from the heart She would wake up to a stale flat to morrow and find that none of these things had really happened Still she might as well live up to the dream while it lasted and have the more to remember It s a fairy story surely she said trying to laugh There are so many beautiful girls in the world for a man like you that I A man like me What am I like Oh it s hard to put into words But well you re brave I m sure of that I hope I m not a coward All normal men are brave That s nothing What else am I to you Interesting More interesting than than any one I ever saw If you feel that you don t want to send me out of your life do you after you ve stood by and sheltered me from danger No o I don t want to send you out of my life But There s only one way in which you can keep me and I can keep you circumstanced as we are We must be husband and wife Oh The girl covered her face with both hands The world was on fire around her I frighten you Yet you might have consented to marry that other Smith You went to meet him to decide whether he was possible I know But I see now if he d kept his appointment it would have ended in nothing even if if he had been pleased with me I couldn t have brought myself to say yes How can you be certain Because Annesley spoke almost in a whisper because he wasn t you Smith snatched her clasped hands and kissed them The warm touch of the man s lips gave the girl a new mysterious sensation No man had ever kissed even her hands Suddenly she felt sure that what she felt must be love love at first sight which according to him was an electric call from soul to soul His kiss told her that they belonged to each other for good or evil Darling he said You are mine I sha n t let you go For love of you I ll free myself from this temporary trouble I m in and come back to claim you soon When I ask you to be my wife you ll say to me what you wouldn t have said to the other Smith If I can escape to hear you But you don t know missus Ellsworth saint George rescued the princess from the dragon so will I though I ve warned you I m no saint When we meet again I ll tell you what I am and perhaps my real name which is better than Smith though it mayn t be as safe Now there are other things to say But there was no time to say them for the taxi stopped The time seemed so short since the Savoy that Annesley couldn t believe they were in Torrington Square Perhaps the chauffeur had made a mistake She looked out hoping that it might be so but before her were the darkened windows of the dull familiar house twenty two A The great moment was upon them CHAPTER V THE SECOND LATCHKEY Without another word Smith opened the door and sprang out As Annesley put her hand into his to descend she gave him the latchkey It had been inside the neck of her dress and the metal was warm from the warmth of her heart Take this she whispered If they are watching it will be best for you to have the key mister Smith bestowed a generous tip on the driver and was rewarded with a loud cheerful Thank you sir which must have reached the ears of a chauffeur in the act of stopping before a house near by Annesley glancing sidewise at the other taxi thought that it drew up with suspicious suddenness as if it had awaited a cue There was little doubt in her mind as to who the occupants were and her heart beat fast though she controlled herself to walk with calmness across the strip of pavement On the doorstep she turned to wait for her companion and without seeming to look past him saw that no one got out from the neighbouring taxi They don t care whether we guess who they are or not was her thought They mean to find out whether we have a latchkey and can let ourselves into a house in this square When they see us go in will they believe the story and drive away or will they stay on What would happen if the watchers persisted Annesley dared not think but she knew that she would sacrifice herself in any way rather than send the man she loved yes she did love him out to face peril Having paid the chauffeur mister N Smith joined the figure on the doorstep and fitted into the lock Annesley s latchkey Then he opened the door for the girl and followed her in with a cool air of proprietorship which ought to have impressed the watchers A minute later if another proof had been needed that mister and missus Smith were actually at home it was given by a sudden glow of red curtains in the two front windows of the ground floor This touch of realism meant extra risk for Annesley in case missus Ellsworth were awake but she took it with scarcely a qualm of fear The house was quiet and there were ten chances to one against its mistress being on the alert at this hour so long past her bedtime When the girl had switched on the lights of the two branched chandelier over the dining table she beckoned to her companion who noiselessly followed her from the dark corridor into the room There with one sweeping glance at the dull red walls the oil painted landscapes in sprawling gilt frames the heavy plush curtains the furniture with its saddle bag upholstery the common Turkish carpet and the mantel mirror with tasteless tasselled draperies Nelson Smith seemed to comprehend the deadly stuffiness of Annesley Grayle s existence The look of missus Ellsworth s middle class dining room and the atmosphere whence oxygen had been excluded were enough to tell him if he had not realized already why the lady s companion had gone out to meet a strange man with a view to marriage To Annesley however for the first time this room was neither hideous nor depressing It seemed years since she had seen it She was a different girl from the spiritless slave who had crept out after luncheon in the wake of her mistress that short shapeless form with a large head set on a short neck and a trailing old fashioned dress of black Now with a man holding her hands and calling her an angel a dear brave angel it looked to the girl a beautiful room There was glamour upon it and upon the rest of the world Surely life could never seem commonplace again Ssh Annesley whispered We mustn t wake missus Ellsworth or she ll run to the front door in her dressing gown and call Police She s old but her ears are sharp as a cat s She can almost hear one thinking But I m glad she can t quite How frightful if she could Nothing about her need be frightful to you any more said the man You have saved me Soon it will be my turn to rescue you I haven t saved you yet the girl reminded him They are sure to be waiting to see whether you come out But I ve thought of one more thing to make them believe that you live here I can steal softly upstairs to the front room on the second floor above the drawing room the one we call mister Smith s to turn on the lights and then those hateful creatures will think She hesitated and the colour sprang to her cheeks That mister and missus Nelson Smith have gone to their room the man finished her sentence His eyes beamed love and gratitude a glorious reward You re wonderful You forget nothing that can help Do you know your trust your faith in me in spite of appearances are the best things that have come into my life You call those fellows hateful creatures because they re my enemies Yet for all you know they may be injured innocents and I the hateful one This may be my way of getting into a rich old woman s house to steal her jewels and money making you a cat s paw Don t Annesley cut him short I can t bear to hear you say such things I trust you because surely a woman can tell by instinct which men to trust I don t need proof
589_146346_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 By Jove he exclaimed 
none	none	his eyes fixed upon her face You are the kind of girl whose faith could turn Lucifer back from devil into archangel I you re a million times too good for me I didn t even want to meet a white saint like you But now I have met you nothing on earth is going to make me give you up if you ll stand by me I m unworthy and I don t expect to be much better But there s one thing I can give you a gayer life than here Perhaps I can even make you happy if you don t ask for a saint to match yourself You shall have my love and worship and I ll be true as steel Oh listen Annesley broke in Don t you hear a sound Yes he said A door creaked somewhere missus Ellsworth s bedroom door What shall we do There s just the short passage at the back and then she ll be at the baize door that opens into the front corridor Quick You not I must go upstairs to that second floor front room I spoke of Hurry Before she gets to the swing door Without a word he obeyed remembering his hat which he had laid on the table One step took him out of the lighted dining room into the dimness beyond Another step and he was on the stairs There for the moment at least he was safe from detection for the staircase faced the front door and missus Ellsworth must approach from the back She would come to the door of the dining room and expecting only the girl would not think of spying at the foot of the stairs Besides there was no light in the corridor except that which streamed through the reddish globes of the chandelier above the dining table If only the man did not stumble on his way up the situation might be saved He was alert deft quick witted and light of foot as a panther Who but he would have remembered at such a moment to snatch up a compromising hat and take it with him Annesley stood still rigid in every muscle fighting to control her heart throbs that she might be ready to answer a flood of questions She dared not even let her thoughts rush ahead It was all she could do to face the present The rest must take care of itself He had said that she would make a good actress Now was the moment to prove that he had judged her truly She began to unfasten one of her long gray gloves A button was loose She must give it a few stitches to morrow Strange that there should be room for such a thought in her mind But she caught at it gladly It calmed her as she heard a shuffling tread of slippered feet along the corridor and she forced herself not to look up until she was conscious that a shapeless figure in a dressing gown filled the doorway like a badly painted portrait too large for its frame A nice time of night for you to be back barked the bronchitic voice hoarsened by years of shut windows Give you an inch and you take an ell I told you half past ten Here it is eleven Annesley looked up as if surprised Oh missus Ellsworth you frightened me she exclaimed I was delayed But it won t be eleven for ten minutes This dining room clock keeps such good time you know And I ve been in the house for a few moments I thought I came so softly I m sorry I waked you up Waked me up repeated missus Ellsworth I have not been to sleep I never can close my eyes when I know anybody is out and has got to come back especially a careless creature as likely as not to leave the front door unlatched That s why I said half past ten at latest If I don t fall asleep before eleven I get nervous and lose my night s rest You ve heard me say that twenty times yet you have no consideration This is the first time I ve been out late Annesley defended herself As she spoke she looked at missus Ellsworth as she might have looked at a stranger This fat old woman with hard eyes low unintelligent forehead and sneering yet self indulgent mouth had been for five years the mistress of her fate The slave had feared to speak lest she should say the wrong thing had hesitated before taking the most insignificant step knowing that missus Ellsworth s sharp tongue would accuse her of foolishness or worse But now Annesley wondered at her bondage If only the man upstairs could escape never again would she be afraid of this old tyrant You don t need to tell me how long you have been in said missus Ellsworth blissfully ignorant that the iron chain was broken and enjoying her power to wound I ve been sitting up watching the clock My fire s nearly out and no more coals in the scuttle the servants all three snoring while I am kept up If I m in bed with a cold to morrow I shall have you to thank Miss Grayle I ll get you some more coal if you want it said Annesley Hadn t you better go to bed now I am back Not till I ve made you understand that this must never occur again insisted the old woman Annesley was shocked at herself for daring to think that the unwieldy bulk in the gray flannel dressing gown looked like a hippopotamus You don t seem to realize that you ve done anything out of the way You re as calm as if it was eight o clock Not a word of regret Not a question as to my evening you re so taken up with yourself and your smart clothes clothes I gave you I haven t had much chance to ask questions have I Annesley ventured to remind her mistress Won t you tell me about your evening when you are in bed and I have made up your fire You say it is bad for you to stand I say so because it is the truth and doctor s orders rapped out missus Ellsworth I thought I had been upset enough for one evening but this last straw had to be added to my burden Why what can have upset you Annesley inquired more for the sake of appearing interested than because she was so But the look on her mistress s face told her that something really had happened I don t care to be kept out of my bed to be catechized by you returned missus Ellsworth pleased that she had aroused curiosity and determined not to gratify it Turn on the light in the corridor and give me your arm My rheumatism is very bad owing to the chill I have caught and if I stumble I may be laid up for a week The girl proffered a slender arm hoping that the pounding of her heart might not be detected by missus Ellsworth s hand She wished that she could have slipped it under her right arm instead of the left but owing to missus Ellsworth s position in the doorway it was impossible to do so except by pushing her aside She rejoiced however in the order to put on the light in the corridor for this meant that after settling her mistress in bed and transferring the dining room coal scuttle to the bedroom she must return to switch the electricity off Then with missus Ellsworth out of the way she could help the man upstairs to escape if the watchers had abandoned the game The tyrant shuffling along in heelless woollen slippers made the most of her infirmity and hung on the arm of her tall companion In silence they passed through the baize door at the end of the corridor so into the addition at the back of the house which contained missus Ellsworth s room and bath with another small room suitable for a maid and occupied by Annesley This addition had been built a year or two before Annesley s arrival and saved missus Ellsworth the necessity of mounting and descending the stairs as she used the dining room to sit in and seldom went into the drawing room on the floor above Annesley was not surprised to see that the fire in her mistress s room was still a bank of glowing coals for one of missus Ellsworth s pleasures was to represent herself in the light of a martyr The girl made no remark however she was far too experienced for such mistakes in tact Still in silence she peeled the stout figure of its dressing gown and helped it into a short knitted bed jacket When you get the dining room scuttle put out the light there and in the corridor missus Ellsworth said If you leave this door open you can see your way with the coals No use your creaking back and forth just as I ve settled down to rest Besides there s somebody else to think of I hope he hasn t been disturbed already Somebody else echoed the girl with a gasp There was no longer any fear that her curiosity had not caught fire missus Ellsworth was satisfied Yes somebody else she condescended to repeat A certain person has come since you went out I suppose in the circumstances you do not need to be told who I I don t know what you mean by in the circumstances Annesley stammered That s not intelligent of you considering where you have spent the evening sneered missus Ellsworth Annesley s ears tingled as if they had been boxed Could it be that missus Ellsworth knew of the trick played on her knew that her companion had not been to the Smiths I m afraid I don t understand she deprecated missus Ellsworth sat in bed staring up at her Either you are a fool she said or else I have caught you or him in a lie I don t know which yet But I soon shall Perhaps you were not the only person in this house who went out to night with a latchkey Now do you guess No I don t the girl had to answer though a dreadful idea was whirring an alarm in her brain I dare say he is back before this being more considerate of my feelings than you and less noisy went on the old woman anxious to prove that Annesley Grayle and nobody else was responsible for keeping her from rest Anyhow what a man does is not my business What you do is Now did or did not a certain person walk in and surprise you at the Archdeacon s Don t stand there blinking like an owl Speak out Yes or no No Annesley breathed Then you haven t been to the Smiths I can more easily believe you are lying than he Hark There he comes Isn t that a latchkey in the front door It sounds like it But perhaps it s a mouse in the wall Mice make such strange noises They re not making this one He never could manage that key properly Nobody with ears could mistake the sound with both my door and the baize door open between as they are now No You aren t to run and let him in I don t want him to think we spy on him He s free to come and go as he pleases but I wish he wasn t so fond of surprises It s not fair to me at my time of life As I was sitting down to dinner he walked in Of course I had to ask him to dine though there wasn t enough food for two However he refused saying he would drop in at the Archdeacon s mister Smith has come Annesley cried out wildly interrupting her mistress for the first time in all their years together Oh he will go upstairs I must stop him I mean speak to him I You will do nothing of the kind missus Ellsworth leaned out of bed and seized the girl s dress Careless of any consequence save one Annesley struggled to free herself But the old hand with its lumpy knuckles was strong in spite of fat and rheumatism It clung leechlike to chiffon of cloak and gown and though Annesley tore at the yellow fingers she could not loosen them Desperate she cried out in a choked voice mister Smith mister Smith then checked herself lest the wrong mister Smith should answer But her voice was like the voice of one who tries to scream in a nightmare It was muffled and though the two intervening doors were ajar the door of missus Ellsworth s bedroom and the baize door dividing the corridors old and new her call did not reach even the real mister Smith To be sure he was slightly deaf and had to use an electric apparatus if he went to the theatre or opera still Annesley hoped that her choked cry might arrest him that he might stop and listen for it to come again thus giving time for the man upstairs to change his quarters after the grating of the latchkey in its lock Wicked wicked girl missus Ellsworth was shrilling How dare you hurt my hand Have you lost your senses Out of my house you go to morrow But Annesley did not hear Her mind her whole self had escaped from her body and rushed out into the hall to intercept mister Ruthven Smith It seemed that he must feel the influence and stop If he did not some terrible thing would happen unless indeed the other man had heard and heeded the warning sound at the front door What if those two met on the stairs or in the room on the second floor Her lover would believe that she had betrayed him missus Ellsworth she said in a fierce low voice utterly unlike her own you must let me go or you will regret it I don t want to hurt you but there s only one thing that matters If The words seemed to be beaten back against her lips with a blow From somewhere above a sharp dry explosion struck the girl s brain and shattered her thoughts like breaking glass missus Ellsworth let go the chiffon cloak and dress so suddenly that Annesley almost lost her balance The noise had dazed the girl The world seemed full and echoing with it She did not know what it was until she heard missus Ellsworth gasp A pistol shot In my house Thieves Murder CHAPTER VI THE BEGINNING OR THE END For one confused instant the girl stood statue still then realizing that she was free without a thought for missus Ellsworth she ran out of the room In the front corridor and in the dining room the electric light was still on and as she reached the stairs Annesley saw Ruthven Smith standing near the top with a small pistol in his hand She feared that he would fire a second shot and there was no time to reach him Somehow he must be stopped with a word but what word Everything depended on that Sheer desperation inspired her Stop He s my lover she cried Don t shoot Ruthven Smith a tall lanky figure in a long over coat kept his weapon aimed at someone out of the girl s sight but he jerked his head aside for a glance down at her It was a brief glance for the man who dreaded burglars would not be caught napping He turned again instantly to face a possible antagonist eyes as well as weapon ready But the light from below had lit up his features for a second and Annesley realized that disgust and astonishment were the emotions her confession had inspired The fact that he was inclined to believe her statement showed how low was his opinion of women Annesley knew that he did not think highly of her sex but he had liked her and she had liked him despite his eccentricities His look said So you are the same as the rest But in case you re lying I sha n t be thrown off guard The girl felt physically sick as she understood the irrevocability of what she had just said and the way in which her words were construed If she could have waited Nelson Smith might have saved himself without compromising her for he was above all things resourceful In announcing that he was her lover she had committed him as well as herself He would have to make the best of a situation she had recklessly created This she realized but had no time to wonder how he would do it before he spoke mister Ruthven Smith what Miss Grayle says is the truth We re engaged to be married All I want is a chance to explain why you find me where I am I m not armed so you can safely give me that chance You know my name exclaimed Ruthven Smith suspiciously He still covered the other with his pistol as Annesley could see now because Nelson Smith had coolly advanced within a yard of the Browning s small black muzzle and finding the electric switch had flooded the upper corridor with light I ve heard your name from Miss Grayle said the younger man I know it must be you because no other person has a right to make himself at home in this house as you are doing I certainly haven t But bringing her home a few minutes ago after dining out we saw a light in what she said was your room She was afraid some thief had got in and I proposed to her that I should take a quiet look round while she went to see if missus Ellsworth was safe No doubt she was all right because I heard them talking together while I examined your premises The next thing I knew as I was coming down with the news that everything was quiet you blazed away It was quite a surprise I fired in the air not at you Ruthven Smith excused himself more or less convinced Annesley clutched the banisters in the sudden weakness of a great revulsion from panic to relief She might have known that he would somehow rescue her even from her own blundering The shamed red which had stained Annesley s cheeks at Ruthven Smith s contempt died away Her lover he was openly that now had miraculously made his presence in the other Smith s room after eleven o clock at night in this early bed going household the most natural thing in the world At least Ruthven Smith s almost apologetic tone in answering proved that he had been persuaded to think it so With missus Ellsworth however it would be different There would lie the stumbling block but with all danger from the Browning ended the girl was in no mood to borrow trouble for the future even a future already rushing into the arms of the present I should always fire the first shot in the air Ruthven Smith went on unless directly threatened Lucky for me replied the other I don t want to die yet And it would have been hard lines as I was trying to do you a good turn rid you of a thief if there were one But I suppose you or some servant must have left the light on in your room I m pretty sure I didn t said Ruthven Smith still speaking with the nervousness of a suspicious man yet at the same time slowly half reluctantly pocketing his pistol We must find out how this happened Perhaps there has been a thief No sign of anything being disturbed in your room the younger man assured him However you d best have a look round If you like and he laughed a frank sounding laugh I m quite willing to be searched before I leave the house so you can make sure I m not going off with any booty Certainly not Nothing of the kind I accept your explanation protested Ruthven Smith He laughed also though stiffly and with an effort I have no valuables in my luggage I have brought none with me It s not worth my while to open the boxes in my room as there s nothing there to tempt a thief Still one gets a start coming to a quiet house at this time of night finding a light in one s windows that ought to be dark and then seeing a man walk out of one s room My nerves aren t over strong I confess I have a horror of night alarms I travel a good deal and have got in the habit of carrying a pistol However all s well that ends well I apologize to you and to Miss Grayle When I know you better I hope you ll allow me to make up by congratulating you both on your engagement As he spoke in his prim old fashioned way he began to descend the stairs taking off his hat as if to join the girl whom in thought he had wronged for an instant Nelson Smith followed smiling at Annesley over the elder man s high narrow head sparsely covered with lank hair of fading brown It was at this moment missus Ellsworth chose to appear habited once more in a hurriedly donned dressing gown a white silk scarf substituted in haste for a discarded nightcap Panting with anger and fierce with curiosity she had forgotten her rheumatism and abandoned her martyred hobble for a waddling run Thus she pounced out at the foot of the stairway and was upon the girl before the three absorbed actors in the scene had heard the shuffling feet in woollen slippers What does this mean she quavered so close to Annesley s ear that the girl wheeled with a start of renewed alarm Who s this strange man in my house What s this talk about engagements A strange man echoed Ruthven Smith prickling with suspicion again Haven t you met him Miss Grayle s fiance Miss Grayle s fiddlesticks shrilled the old woman The girl s a baggage a worthless baggage In my room just now she struck me beat my poor rheumatic knuckles For five years I ve sheltered her given her the best of everything even to the clothes she has on her back This is the way she repays me with insults and cruelty and smuggles strange men secretly into my house at night and pretends to be engaged to them The dark young man in evening dress passed the lean figure in travelling clothes without a word and putting Annesley gently aside stepped between her and missus Ellsworth There is no question of pretending he said sternly Miss Grayle has promised to marry me If our engagement has been kept a secret it s only because the right moment hadn t come for announcing it I entered your house for a few moments to night for the first time on an errand which seemed important as mister Ruthven Smith will explain I don t feel called upon to apologize for my presence in the face of your attitude to Miss Grayle It was our intention that you should have plenty of notice before she left you time to find someone for her place but after what has happened it s your own fault madame if we marry with a special licence and I take her out of this house to morrow I only wish it might be now It shall be now missus Ellsworth screamed him down The girl doesn t darken my doors another hour I don t know who you are and I don t want to know But with or without you Annesley Grayle leaves my house to night missus Ellsworth surely you haven t stopped to think what you re saying protested Ruthven Smith You can t turn a girl into the street in the middle of the night with a young man you don t know even if she is engaged to him I won t have her here after the way she s treated me after the way she s acted altogether missus Ellsworth insisted Let her go to your cousins if you think they d approve of her conduct As for me I doubt it And I m sure she lied when she said they d asked her to dine with them to night I don t believe she went near them Ruthven Smith who had made a surprise visit at the Archdeacon s and dined there had heard no mention of Annesley Grayle being expected For an instant he was silenced but the girl did not lack a defender She will not need to beg for Archdeacon Smith s hospitality said the young man And even if missus Ellsworth implored her to stay I couldn t allow it now I will see that Miss Grayle is properly sheltered and cared for to night by a lady whose kindness will make her forget what she has suffered As soon as possible we shall be married by special licence Go to your room dearest and put together a few things for to night and to morrow morning just what will fit into a hand bag If there s anything else you value it can be sent for later Then I ll take you away The words were brave and comforting and a wave of emotion swept Annesley s soul toward the mysterious unknown soul of her knight It was so strong so compelling a wave that she had no fear in trusting herself to him He was her refuge her protector For a moment of gratitude she even forgot he was mysterious forgot that a few hours ago she had been ignorant of his existence When remembrance flooded her brain her only fear was for him What if the watchers should still be there when they went out of the house together She had turned to go to her room as he suggested when suddenly this question seemed to be shouted in her ear Hesitating she looked back her eyes imploring to meet a smile so confident that it defied fate Annesley saw that he understood what was in her mind and this smile was the answer For some reason he thought himself sure that the watchers were out of the way The girl could not guess why unless he had spied on the taxi from Ruthven Smith s window and saw it go But she would soon learn Her room was a mere bandbox at the back of the addition behind missus Ellsworth s bedroom and bath and dashing into it now the new vividly alive Annesley seemed to meet and pity the timid hopeless girl whose one safe haven these mean quarters had been She tried to gather the old self into her new self that she might take it with her and comfort it rescuing it from the tyrant The two trunks she had brought five years ago were stored in the basement box room but under the camp bed was her dressing bag the only lock up receptacle she possessed In it she kept a few letters and an abortive diary which in some moods had given her the comfort of a confidant The key of this bag was never absent from her purse and opening it with quivering hands the girl threw in a few toilet things for the night a coat skirt and blouse for morning and a small flat toque which would not crush Afterward in that wonderful dim afterward which shone vaguely bright like a sunlit landscape discerned through mist she could send for more of her possessions But she would have nothing which had been given her by missus Ellsworth and she would return the dress and cloak she was wearing to night Three minutes were enough for the packing of the bag then luggage in hand she turned at the door for a last look such as a released convict might give to his cell Good bye she said with a thought of compassion for her successor And passing missus Ellsworth s room she would have thrown a farewell glance at its familiar chairs and tables each one of which she hated with a separate hatred but with a shock of surprise she found the door shut That must mean that the dragon had retreated from the combat and retired to her lair Not to be chased from the house by the sharp arrows of insult seemed almost too good to be true But when Annesley arrived bag in hand in the front corridor it was to see Ruthven Smith standing there alone and the door open to the street missus Ellsworth has gone to her room he explained and er your friend your fiance is looking for a taxi not to keep you waiting He didn t leave till missus Ellsworth went I don t think he would have trusted me to protect you without him though I er I did my best with her Good heavens what a fury I never saw that side of her before I must say I don t blame you for making your own plans Miss Grayle I I don t blame you for anything and I hope you ll feel the same toward me I d be sorry to think that er after our pleasant acquaintance this was to be our last meeting Won t you show that you forgive me for the mistake I made I think it was natural and tell me what your married name will be Annesley looked anxiously at the half open front door If only the absent one would return and save her from this new dilemma If she did not speak mister Ruthven Smith would think her harsh and unforgiving yet she could not answer unless she gave the name adopted temporarily for convenience She hesitated her eyes on the door but the darkness and silence outside sent a doubt into her heart cold and sickly as a bat flapping in from the night What if he never came back What if the watchers had been hiding out there lying in wait and two against one both bigger men physically than he and perhaps armed they had overpowered him What if she were never to see him again and this hour which had seemed the beginning of hope were to be its end

none	none	 THE COUNTESS DE SANTIAGO You don t wish to tell me the name Ruthven Smith was saying 
589_146346_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The repetition irritated the girl whose nerves were strained to snapping point 
589_146346_000004_000001	train-clean-360	She could not parry the man s questions 
589_146346_000004_000002	train-clean-360	She could not bear his grieved or offended reproaches 
589_146346_000004_000003	train-clean-360	If he persisted through these moments of suspense she would scream or burst out crying 
589_146346_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Trembling with tears in her voice she heard herself answer 
589_146346_000004_000005	train-clean-360	And yet it did not seem to be herself but something within stronger than she that suddenly took control of her 
589_146346_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Why should I not wish to tell you the Something was saying 
589_146346_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 The name is the same as your own Smith 
589_146346_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Nelson Smith And before the words had left her lips a taxi drew up at the door 
589_146346_000006_000000	train-clean-360	There was one instant of agony during which the previous suspense seemed nothing an instant when the girl forgot what she had said her soul pressing to the windows of her eyes 
589_146346_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Was it he who had come or 
589_146346_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It was he 
589_146346_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Before she had time to finish the thought he walked in confident and smiling as when she had left him a few minutes or a few years ago and in the wave of relief which overwhelmed her Annesley forgot Ruthven Smith s question and her answer 
589_146346_000007_000002	train-clean-360	She remembered again only with the shock of hearing him address the newcomer by the name she had given 
none	none	I hear from Miss Grayle that we are namesakes mister Ruthven Smith said as Nelson Smith sprang in and took the girl s bag from her ice cold hand
589_146346_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I he asked me 
589_146346_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I told him Annesley stammered her eyes appealing seeking to explain and begging pardon 
none	none	But if
589_146346_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Quite right 
none	none	Why not tell he answered instantly his first glance of surprise turning to cheerful reassurance Now missus Ellsworth is eliminated I m no longer a secret And I expect you ll like to meet mister Ruthven Smith again when you have a house to entertain him in So speaking he offered his hand with a smile to his namesake and Annesley realized from the outsider s point of view the peculiar attraction of the man Ruthven Smith felt it as she had felt it though differently and in a lesser degree 
589_146346_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Not only did he shake hands but actually came out to the taxi with them asking Annesley if he should tell his cousins of her engagement or if she preferred to give the news herself 
none	none	It flashed into the girl s mind that it would be perfect if she could be married to her knight by Archdeacon Smith but she had been imprudent too often already 
589_146346_000012_000001	train-clean-360	She dared not make such a suggestion without consulting the other person most concerned so she answered that she would write missus Smith or see her 
none	none	To say that you too are going to be missus Smith chuckled the Archdeacon s cousin in his dry way which made him seem even older than he was
589_146346_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Well you can trust me with missus Ellsworth 
none	none	If she goes on as she began to night I m afraid I shall have to follow your example fold my tent like an Arab and silently steal away Ha ha By the by I dare say she s owing you salary 
589_146346_000013_000004	train-clean-360	I ll remind her of it if you like tell her you asked me 
none	none	It may help with the trousseau
589_146346_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you but my wife won t need to remind missus Ellsworth of her debt the answer came before Annesley could speak 
none	none	And she will be my wife in a day or two at latest 
589_146346_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Good night 
589_146346_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Glad to have met you even if it was an unpromising introduction 
589_146346_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Then they were off they two alone together and Annesley guessed that the chauffeur must have had his instructions where to drive as she heard none given 
none	none	Perhaps it was best that their destination should not be published aloud for there are walls which have ears 
589_146346_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It occurred to the girl that precautions might still have to be taken 
589_146346_000015_000003	train-clean-360	But in another moment she was undeceived 
none	none	I thought old Ruthven Smith would be shocked if he knew the safe refuge I have for you is no more convent like than the Savoy Hotel her companion laughed By Jove neither you nor I dreamed when we got out of the last taxi that we should soon be in another going back to the place we started from
589_146346_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 The Savoy exclaimed Annesley 
589_146346_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh but we mustn t go there of all places 
none	none	Those men I assure you it s safer now than anywhere in London the man cut her short I can t explain why that is I could explain if I cared to rig up a story 
589_146346_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But there s something about you makes me feel as if I d like to tell you the truth whenever I can and the truth is that for reasons you may understand some day though I hope to Heaven you ll never have to my association with those men is one of the things I long to turn the key upon 
none	none	I know that that sounds like Bluebeard to Fatima but it isn t as bad as that 
589_146346_000018_000004	train-clean-360	To me it doesn t seem bad at all 
none	none	And I swear that whatever mystery if you call it mystery there is about me it sha n t hurt you 
589_146346_000018_000006	train-clean-360	Will you believe this and trust me for the rest 
589_146346_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve told you I would the girl reminded him 
none	none	I know But things were different then not so serious They hadn t gone so far 
589_146346_000020_000003	train-clean-360	I didn t suppose that Fate would give you to me so soon 
none	none	I didn t dare hope it I Are you sure you want me Annesley faltered Surer than I ve ever been of anything in my life before It s only of you I m thinking 
589_146346_000022_000002	train-clean-360	I wanted to arrange my business matters so as to be fair to you 
589_146346_000022_000003	train-clean-360	But you ll make the best of things 
589_146346_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You are being noble to me said the girl and I ve been very foolish I ve complicated everything 
none	none	First by what I told mister Ruthven Smith about about us And then saying your name was Nelson Smith
589_146346_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 You weren t foolish he contradicted 
none	none	You were only playing into Fate s hands You couldn t help yourself Destiny And all s for the best 
589_146346_000024_000005	train-clean-360	You were an angel to sacrifice yourself to save me and your doing it the way you did has made me a happy man at one stroke 
589_146346_000024_000006	train-clean-360	As for the name what s in a name 
589_146346_000024_000007	train-clean-360	We might as well be in reality what we played at being to night mister and missus Nelson Smith There are even reasons why I m pleased that you ve made me a present of the name 
589_146346_000024_000008	train-clean-360	I thank you for it and for all the rest 
none	none	Oh but if it isn t really your name we sha n t be legally married shall we Annesley protested By Jove he exclaimed
589_146346_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I hadn t thought of that 
589_146346_000026_000002	train-clean-360	It s a difficulty But we ll obviate it somehow 
589_146346_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Don t worry 
589_146346_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Only I m afraid we can t ask your friend the Archdeacon to marry us as I meant to suggest because I was sure you d like it 
none	none	I should But it doesn t matter said the girl
589_146346_000027_000002	train-clean-360	 Besides I feel that to morrow I shall find I ve dreamed all this 
589_146346_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I ve dreamed you at the same time and I m not going to let you slip out of my dream now I ve got you in it 
none	none	I intend to go on dreaming you for the rest of my life And I shall take care you don t wake up 
589_146346_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Afterward there came a time when Annesley called back those words and wondered if they had held a deeper meaning than she guessed 
none	none	But having uttered them he seemed to put the thought out of his mind and turn to the next
589_146346_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 About the Savoy he went on 
none	none	I want to take you there because I know a woman staying in the hotel a woman old enough to be your mother who ll look after you to please me till we re married Afterward you ll be nice to her and that will be doing her a good turn because she s apt to be lonesome in London She s the widow of a Spanish Count and has lived in the Argentine but I met her in New York 
589_146346_000030_000003	train-clean-360	She knows all about me or enough and if she d been in the restaurant at dinner this evening she could have done for me what you did 
none	none	I had reason to think she would be there when I bolted in to get out of a fix 
589_146346_000030_000005	train-clean-360	But she was missing 
589_146346_000030_000006	train-clean-360	Are you sorry 
589_146346_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 If she d been there you would have gone to her table and sat down and we should never have met Annesley thought aloud 
none	none	How strange Just that little thing your friend being out to dinner and our whole lives are to be changed Oh you must be sorry I tell you meeting you and winning you in this way is worth the best ten years of my life 
589_146346_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But you haven t answered my question 
589_146346_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll answer it now cried the girl 
none	none	Meeting you is worth all the years of my life I m not much of a princess but you are saint George
589_146346_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 saint George he echoed a ring of bitterness under his laugh 
589_146346_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 That s the first time I ve been called a saint and I m afraid it will be the last 
none	none	I can t live up to that but if I can give you a happy life and a few of the beautiful things you deserve why it s something Besides I m going to worship my princess 
589_146346_000034_000003	train-clean-360	I d give anything to show you how I but no I was good before when I was tempted to kiss you 
none	none	You re at my mercy now in a way all the more because I m taking you from your old existence to one you don t know I sha n t ask to kiss you except maybe your little hand if you don t mind until the moment you re my wife 
589_146346_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Meantime I ll try to grow a bit more like what your lover ought to be and later I shall kiss you enough to make up for lost time 
none	none	If five hours ago any one had told Annesley Grayle that she would wish to have a strange man take her in his arms and kiss her she would have felt insulted 
589_146346_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Yet so it was 
589_146346_000036_000002	train-clean-360	She was sorry that he was so scrupulous She longed to have him hold her against his heart 
none	none	The thought thrilled her like an electric shock a thousand times more powerful than the tingling which had flashed up her arm at the first touch of his hand though even that had seemed terrifying then But she sat still in her corner of the taxi and gave him no answer lest she should betray herself 
589_146346_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Her silence after the warmth of his words seemed cold 
589_146346_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps he felt it so for he went on after an instant s pause as if he had waited for something in vain and his tone was changed 
589_146346_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Annesley thought it by contrast almost businesslike 
none	none	You mustn t be afraid he said that I mean to stay at the Savoy myself Even if I d been stopping there I should move if I were going to put you in the hotel But I have my own lair in London I ve been over here a number of times 
589_146346_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Indeed I m partly English born in Canada though I ve spent most of my life in the United States 
589_146346_000039_000005	train-clean-360	Nobody at the Savoy but the Countess de Santiago knows who I am and she ll understand that it may be convenient for me to change my name 
589_146346_000039_000006	train-clean-360	Nelson Smith is a respectable one and she ll respect it 
589_146346_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Now my plan is to ask for her she ll be in by this time have a few words of explanation on the quiet not to embarrass you and the Countess will do the rest 
589_146346_000040_000001	train-clean-360	She ll engage a room for you next to her own suite or as near as possible then you ll be provided with a chaperon 
589_146346_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not anxious about myself but about you Annesley said 
none	none	You haven t told me yet what happened after you went upstairs at missus Ellsworth s and how you knew those men were gone 
589_146346_000041_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose you did know 
589_146346_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Or did you chance it 
589_146346_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I was as sure as I needed to be Nelson Smith answered 
589_146346_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 A moment after I switched on the electricity in the room up there I heard a taxi drive away 
589_146346_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I turned off the light so I could look out 
589_146346_000042_000003	train-clean-360	By flattening my nose against the glass I could see that the place where those chaps had waited was empty but in case the taxi was only turning and meant to pass the house again I lit the room once more for realism 
none	none	That s what kept me rather long that and waiting for the dragon to go Otherwise I should have been down before Ruthven Smith trapped me For a second it looked as if the game of life was up And then I found out how much you meant to me It was you I thought of 
589_146346_000044_000003	train-clean-360	It seemed beastly hard luck to leave you fast in that old woman s clutches 
none	none	Annesley put out her hand with a warm impulse 
589_146346_000045_000001	train-clean-360	He took it raising it to his lips and both were startled when the taxi stopped 
none	none	They had arrived at the Savoy and though Annesley seemed to have lived through a lifetime of emotion just one hour and thirty minutes had passed since she and her companion drove away from these bright revolving doors The foyer was as brilliant and crowded as when they left at half past ten People were parting after supper or they were lingering in the restaurant beyond 
589_146346_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Nobody paid the slightest attention to the newcomers and Annesley settled down unobtrusively in a corner while her companion went to scribble a line to the Countess de Santiago 
none	none	When he had finished and sent up the letter he did not return and again the girl had a few moments of suspense thinking of the danger which might not after all be over Just as she had begun to be anxious however she saw him coming with a wonderful woman Annesley could have laughed remembering how he had said the Countess would mother her Any one less motherly than this Juno like beauty in flame coloured chiffon over gold tissue it would be hard to imagine The Spanish South American Countess was of a camelia paleness and had almond shaped dark eyes with brooding lashes under slender brows that met In contrast her hair was of a flame colour vivid as her draperies and her lips were red At first glance Annesley thought that the dazzling creature could not be more than thirty but when the vision had come near enough to offer her hand without waiting for an introduction a hardness about the handsome face a few lines about the eyes and mouth and a fullness of the chin showed that she was older forty perhaps Still Annesley hoped that her lover had not asked the lady to mother his fiancee 
589_146346_000051_000001	train-clean-360	She had not the air of one who would be complimented by such a request 
none	none	As Annesley put her hand into that of the Countess she noticed that this hand was as wonderful as the rest of the woman s personality It was very long very narrow with curiously supple looking fingers exquisitely manicured and wearing many rings 
589_146346_000052_000002	train-clean-360	Even the thumb was abnormally long which fact prevented the hand from being as beautiful as it was somehow unforgettable 
none	none	This is a pleasure and a surprise began the Countess smiling her eyes appearing to take in the full length portrait of Annesley Grayle with their wide unmoving gaze When she smiled she was still extremely handsome but not so perfect as with lips closed for her white teeth were too short somewhat irregular and set too wide apart 
589_146346_000053_000002	train-clean-360	She spoke English perfectly with a slight foreign accent and a roll of the letter r 
none	none	My friend Nelson Smith she turned laughing to him has told me ex citing news We have known each other a long time 
589_146346_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I think this is the best thing that can happen 
none	none	And you will be a lucky girl 
589_146346_000054_000004	train-clean-360	He too will be lucky 
589_146346_000054_000005	train-clean-360	I see that with another smile 
none	none	Annesley was disappointed because the beautiful woman s voice was not sweet
589_146346_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Now you must engage her room Nelson Smith said abruptly 
589_146346_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 It s late You can make friends afterward 
none	none	Very well the Countess agreed
589_146346_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 And you will you come to the desk Yet no it is better not 
589_146346_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Miss Grayle and I will go together two women alone and independent 
589_146346_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Lucky it s not the season or we might find nothing free at short notice 
none	none	But Don I mean Nelson always did have luck 
589_146346_000057_000005	train-clean-360	I hope he always will 
none	none	She flashed him a meaning look though what the meaning was Annesley could not guess She knew only that she did not like the Countess as she had wished to like her lover s friend There was something secret in the dark eyes something repellent about the long slender thumb with its glittering nail CHAPTER VIII THE BLUE DIAMOND RING Annesley had not expected to sleep There were a million things to think of and it was one o clock before she was ready to slip into bed in the green and white room with its bathroom annex But the crowding experiences of five hours had exhausted the girl Sleep fell upon her as her head nestled into a downy pillow and she lay motionless as a marble figure on a tomb until a sound of knocking forced itself into her dreams She waked with a start The curtains were drawn across the window but she could see that it was daylight A streak of sunshine thrust a golden wedge between the draperies and seemed a good omen for the sun had hidden from London through many wintry weeks The knocking was real not part of a dream It was at her door and jumping out of bed she could hardly believe a clock on the mantelpiece which said half past ten Who is it she asked timidly fearing that the Countess de Santiago s voice might answer but a man replied A note from a gentleman downstairs please and he s waiting an answer Annesley opened the door a crack and took in a letter The new master of her destiny had written Hurrah my darling our affairs march I have been arranging about the licence et cetera and I believe that you and I can join forces for the rest of our lives to morrow blessed day How soon can you come down and talk over plans I ve a hundred to propose Will you breakfast with me or have you finished Yours since last night till eternal night N S The girl scribbled an answer confessing that she had overslept but promising to be down in half an hour for breakfast She did not stop to think of anything but the need for a quick reply yet when the note was sent and she was doing her hair after a splash in the porcelain bath what luxury for the girl who had been practically a servant she re read her love letter spread on the dressing table She liked her lover s handwriting It seemed to express character just such character as she imagined her knight s to be There were dash and determination and an originality which would never let itself be bound by convention Perhaps if she had been critical if the handwriting had been that of a stranger she might have thought it too bold Long ago when she was a very young girl she had superficially studied the science of chirography from articles in a magazine and had fancied herself a judge She remembered disliking missus Ellsworth s writing the first time she saw it foreseeing the selfishness which afterward enslaved her Since then she had had little time to practise until the day when she heard from mister N Smith after her answer to his advertisement in the Morning Post One reason for feeling sure she could never care for the man was because his handwriting prejudiced her in advance it was so stiff so devoid of character How different she reflected now from the writing of the man who had taken his place She made such haste in dressing that her fingers seemed to be all thumbs and when at length she was ready she gazed gloomily into the mirror Last night she had not been so bad in evening dress but now in the cheap ready made brown velveteen coat and skirt and plain toque to match which had been her best for two winters she feared lest he should find her commonplace The first thing I do when he s had time to look me over must be to tell him he s free if he wants his freedom she decided And she kept her word when in the half deserted foyer she had shaken hands with a young man who wore a white rose in his buttonhole Please tell me frankly if you don t like me as well by daylight she gasped I like you better he said You re still my white rose See I ve adopted it as your symbol I shall never wear any other flower on my coat This is yours No it s you And I ve kept the one I took last night I mean to keep it always No danger of my changing my mind But you I ve lain awake worrying for fear you might He held her hand questioning her eyes with his She shook her head smiling But he would not let the hand go At that hour there was no one to stare The Countess didn t warn you off me Annesley opened her eyes Of course not Why you told me you were old friends So we are as friends go in this world pals anyhow She s done me several good turns and I ve paid her She d always do what she could to help for her own sake as well as mine But her idea of a man may be different from yours She wasn t with me long explained Annesley She said I needed sleep After she d looked at my room to see if it were comfortable she bade me good night and we haven t met this morning The few remarks she did make about you were complimentary What did she say I m curious Well if you must know she said that you were a man few women could resist and she didn t blame me H m You call that complimentary Let s suppose she meant it so Now we ll have breakfast and forget her unless you d like her called to go with us on a shopping expedition I ve set my heart on What kind of a shopping expedition Annesley wanted to know To buy you all the pretty things you ve ever wished for The girl laughed To do that would cost a fortune Then we ll spend a fortune Shall you and I do it ourselves or would you like to have the Countess de Santiago s taste Oh let us go without her Annesley exclaimed unless you Rather not I want you to myself You darling We ll have a great day spending that fortune The next thing we do it can wait till after we re married is to look for a house in a good neighbourhood to rent furnished But we ll get your swell cousins Lord and Lady Annesley Seton to help us choose Perhaps there ll be something near them Why they hardly know I exist I doubt if Lady Annesley Seton does know replied the girl They ll do nothing to help us I m sure Then don t be sure because if you made a bet you d lose Take my word they ll be pleased to remember a cousin who is marrying a millionaire Good gracious gasped Annesley Are you a millionaire Her lover laughed Well I don t want to boast to you though I may to your cousins but if I m not one of your conventional stodgy millionaires I have a sort of Fortunatus purse which is never empty I can always pull out whatever I want We ll let your people understand without any bragging I think Lady Annesley Seton nee Miss Haverstall whose father s purse has flattened out like a pancake will jump for joy when she hears what you want her to do But come along let s have breakfast Overwhelmed Annesley walked beside him in silence to the almost deserted restaurant where the latest breakfasters had finished and the earliest lunchers had not begun So the mysterious mister Smith was rich The news frightened rather than pleased her It seemed to throw a burden upon her shoulders which she might not be able to carry with grace The girl had little self confidence but the man appeared to be troubled with no doubts of her or of the future Over their coffee and toast and hot house fruit he began to propose exciting plans and had got as far as an automobile when the voice of the Countess surprised them She had come close to their table without being heard Good morning she exclaimed I was going out but from far off I saw you two with your profiles cut like silhouettes against all this glass and sunshine I couldn t resist asking how Miss Grayle slept and if there s anything I can do for her in the shops As she spoke her eyes dwelt on Annesley s plain toque and old fashioned shabby coat as if to emphasize the word shops The girl flushed and Smith frowned at the Countess No thank you he replied for Annesley There s nothing we need trouble you about till the wedding to morrow afternoon You can put on your gladdest rags then and be one of our witnesses I believe that s the legal term isn t it I do not know said the Countess with a suppressed quiver in her voice and a flash in the eyes fixed studiously on the river I know nothing of marriages in England Who will be your other witness if it s not indiscreet to ask I haven t decided yet returned Smith laconically Ah of course you have plenty of friends to choose from and so the wedding will be to morrow Yes One fixes up these things in next to no time with a special license Luckily I m a British subject I never thought much about it before but it simplifies matters and I ll have been living in this parish a fortnight to morrow That s providential for it seems that legally it must be a fortnight I ve been up since it was light learning the ropes and beginning to work them Even the hour s fixed two thirty This was news for Annesley also as there had been no time to begin talking over the hundred plans Smith had mentioned in his letter You are prompt and businesslike returned the Countess and again the girl blushed She did not like to think of her knight of romance being businesslike in his haste to make her his wife But perhaps the Countess didn t mean to suggest anything uncomplimentary At what church will the ceremony take place as the newspapers say she went on It is to be a fashionable one No replied Smith shortly Weddings in fashionable churches are silly unless there s to be a crowd and my wife and I are going to collect our circle after we re married I ll let you know in time where we are going As you ll be with the bride you can t lose yourself on the way so you needn t worry I don t laughed the Countess I m at your service and I shall try to be worthy of the occasion But now I shall take myself off or your coffee will be cold You have a busy day and it s late even later than our breakfasts on the Monarchic three weeks ago Already it seems three months Au revoir Don Au revoir Miss Grayle She finished with a nod for Annesley and turned away Smith let her go in silence and the girl watched the tall figure as perfect in shape and as perfectly dressed as a French model walk out of the restaurant into the foyer She seemed to have taken with her the golden glamour which had made up for lack of sunshine in the room before her arrival or if she had not taken it at least it was dimmed Annesley gazed after the figure until it disappeared because she felt vaguely that it would be best not to look at her companion just then She knew that he was angry and that he wanted to compose himself The Countess was as handsome by morning light in her black velvet and chinchilla as at night in flame colour and gold But the girl hoped she was not ill natured she looked meretricious If she were made up the process defied Annesley Grayle s eyes yet surely never was skin so flawlessly white and such golden red hair with dark eyes and eyebrows must be unique Great Scott I thought she meant to spend the morning with us Smith broke out viciously I realize now I ve seen you together that she s not the ideal chaperon But any port in a storm I thought you liked her Annesley said So I do within limits At least I appreciate qualities that she has But there are times when a little of her goes a long way I m afraid she realized that you weren t making her welcome Annesley smiled You weren t very nice to her were you I was as nice as she deserved the man excused himself But she was good to me last night She owes it to me to be good It s a debt I expect her to pay that s all and I m not sure she s paying it generously You needn t be too grateful dear Perhaps as she s known you some time she feels you re sacrificing yourself Annesley defended the Countess I don t blame her She s sharp enough to see that I m in great luck said Smith But I suppose there s always a dash of the cat in a woman of her race I hope there s no need to tell you that she has no right to be jealous If she had I wouldn t have put you within reach of her claws There are assorted sizes and kinds of jealousy though Some women want all the lime light and grudge sparing any for a younger and prettier girl Annesley laughed Prettier Why she s a beauty and I Wait till I introduce you to missus Nelson Smith who s going to be one of the best dressed best looking young women in London and you ll be sorry for the poor old Countess returned Smith warmly You can afford then to heap coals of fire on her head which can t make it redder than it is Meanwhile it occurs to me from the way the wind blows you d better go carefully with the lady Don t let her pump you about yourself or what happened at missus Ellsworth s It s not her business Don t confide any more than you need and if she pretends to confide in you understand that it will be for a purpose The Countess is no ingenue But enough about her he went on abruptly She sha n t spoil our first breakfast together even by reminding me of gloomy meals I used sometimes to eat with her when we happened to find ourselves in each other s society on board the Monarchic I was feeling down on my luck then and she wasn t the one to cheer me up But things are different now Have you noticed by the way that she has a nickname for me Yes Annesley admitted She calls you Don It s a name she made up because she used to say when we first met I was like a Spaniard and I can jabber Spanish among other lingos It s more her native tongue you know than English I only refer to it because I want you to have a special name of your own for me and I don t want it to be that one It can t be Nelson because well I can never be at home as Nelson with the girl I love best the one who knows how I came to call myself that Will you make up a name for me and begin to get used to it to day I d like it if you could May I call you Knight Annesley asked shyly I ve named you my knight already in my mind and and heart He looked at her with rather a beautiful look clear and wistful even remorseful It s too noble a name he said Still if you like it I shall Maybe it will make me good Jove it would take something strong to do that But who knows From now on I m your Knight You needn t wrestle with Nelson except when we re with strangers And look here he broke off I ve another favour to ask Better get them all over at once the big ones that are hard to grant You reminded me last night that we wouldn t be legally married if I didn t use my own name That may be true I can t very well make inquiries But just in case I m giving my real name and shall sign it in a register That s why our marriage must be quietly performed in a quiet place It shall be in church because I know you wouldn t feel married if it wasn t but it must be in a church where nobody we re likely to meet ever goes and the parson must be one we won t stand a chance of knocking up against later Managed the way I shall manage it there ll be no difficulty mister and missus Blank will walk out of the vestry after they ve signed their names and lose themselves No reason why they should ever be associated with mister and missus Nelson Smith Do you much mind all these complications Not if they re necessary to save you from danger the girl answered By Jove you re a trump But I haven t come to the big favour yet Now for it When I write my real name in the register I don t want you to look Is that the one thing too much Annesley tried not to flinch under his eyes Yet he had put her to a severe test Last night when he said that it would be better for her not to know his name she had quietly agreed But there was the widest difference between then and now At that time they had been strangers flung together by a wave of fate which it seemed might tear them apart at any instant In a few hours all was changed They belonged to each other This man s name would be her name yet he wished her to be ignorant of it If the girl had not thought of him truly as her knight if she had not been determined to trust him the big favour would indeed have been too big Despite her trust and the romantic new born love in her heart she was unable to answer for a moment Her breath was snatched away but as she struggled to regain it and to speak a bleak picture of the future without him rose before her eyes She couldn t give him up and go on living after the glimpse he had shown her of what life might be No it s not too much she said slowly It s only part of the trust I ve promised to my knight He gave a sigh of relief Thank you and my lucky star for the prize you are he exclaimed Some men would have offered their thanks to God or to Heaven Annesley noticed that he praised his star This was one of many disquieting things large and small for she had been brought up to be a religious girl and was mentally on her knees before God in gratitude for the happiness which illuminated her gray life She could not bear to think that God was nothing to the man who had become everything to her She wanted to shut her eyes to all that was strange in him but it was as difficult as for Psyche to resist lighting the lantern for a peep at her mysterious husband in his sleep For instance there was the Countess de Santiago s reference to their association on board the Monarchic which Knight had refrained from mentioning He had spoken of it after the Countess had gone to be sure but briefly and because it would have seemed odd if he had not done so It had struck Annesley that his annoyance with the lady was connected with that sharp little dig of hers and she could not sweep her mind clean of curiosity The moment the Monarchic s name was brought up she remembered reading a newspaper paragraph about the last voyage of that great ship from New York to Liverpool Fortunately or unfortunately her recollection of the paragraph was nebulous for when she read news aloud to her mistress she permitted her mind to wander unless the subject happened to be interesting She tried to keep up a vaguely intelligent knowledge of world politics but small events and blatant sensations such as murders burglaries and society divorces she quickly erased from her brain Something dramatic had occurred on the Monarchic Her subconscious self recalled that But it was less than a month ago that she had read the paragraph therefore the sensation whatever it was must have happened when Knight and the Countess de Santiago were on board coming to England and she could easily learn what it was by inquiring Not for the world however would she question her lover to whom the subject of the trip was evidently distasteful Still less would she ask the Countess behind his back There was another way in which she could find out a sly voice seemed to whisper in Annesley s ear She could get old numbers of the Morning Post the only newspaper that entered missus Ellsworth s house and search for the paragraph But she was ashamed of herself for letting such a thought enter her head Of course she would not be guilty of a trick so mean She would not try to unearth one fact concerning her Knight his name his past or any circumstances surrounding him even though by stretching out her hand she could reach the key to his secret He talked of things which at another time would have palpitated with interest their wedding their honeymoon their homecoming and Annesley responded without betraying absent mindedness It was the best she could do until the effect of the biggest favour and the doubts it raised were blurred by new sensations She would not have been a normal woman if the shopping excursion planned by Knight had not swept her off her feet The man with Fortunatus purse seemed bent on trying to empty it temporarily for her benefit if she had been sent out alone to buy everything she had ever wanted with no regard to expense Annesley Grayle would not have spent a fifth of the sum he flung away on evening gowns street gowns boudoir gowns hats high heeled paste buckled slippers a gold fitted dressing bag an ermine wrap a fur lined motor coat and more suede gloves and silk stockings than could be used it seemed to the girl in the next ten years He begged for the privilege of helping choose not because he didn t trust her taste but because he feared she might be economical and during the whole day in Bond Street Regent Street Oxford Street and Knightsbridge she was given only an hour to herself That hour she was expected to pass and did pass in providing herself with all sorts of intimate daintiness of nainsook lace and ribbon too sacred even for a lover s eyes And Knight spent the time of his absence from her upon an errand which he did not explain I ll tell you what I did and show you to morrow when I come to wish you good morning he said Unless you re going to be conventional and refuse to see me till we meet at the altar as the sentimental writers say I think I ve heard that s the smart thing But I hope it won t be your way If I didn t see you from now till to morrow afternoon I should be afraid I d lost you for ever Annesley felt the same about him and told him so They dined together but not at the Savoy The Countess s name was not mentioned yet Annesley guessed it was because of her that Knight proposed an Italian restaurant When he left her at last at the door of her own hotel everything was settled for the wedding day and after Knight was to produce two friends both men to one of whom must fall the fatherly duty of giving the bride away He suggested their calling upon her in the morning while he was with her at the Savoy in order that they might not meet as strangers at the church and the girl thought this a wise idea As for the honeymoon Knight confessed to knowing little of England outside London and asked Annesley if she had a choice Would she like to have a week or so in some warm county like Devonshire or Cornwall or would she enjoy a trip to Paris or the Riviera It was all one to him he assured her only he had set his heart on getting back to London soon finding a house and beginning life as they meant to live it Annesley chose Devonshire She said she would like to show it to Knight I think you ll love it she told him We might stay at several places I used to adore when I was a child And if we get to Sidmouth maybe you ll have a glimpse of those cousins you were talking about the Annesley Setons I believe they have a place near by called Valley House but I don t know whether they live there or let it We ll go to Sidmouth he said The girl smiled His desire that she should scrape acquaintance with Lord and Lady Annesley Seton seemed boyish and amusing to her but she did not see how it could be brought about Next morning at eleven o clock when Annesley had been up for two hours packing her new things in her new trunks and the gorgeous new dressing bag she was informed that mister Nelson Smith had arrived The girl had forgotten that Knight had hinted at something to tell and something to show her on the morning of their marriage day and expected to find his two friends with him but he had come alone We ve got a half hour together he said Then doctor Torrance and the Marchese di Morello may turn up at any minute Torrance is an elderly man a decent sort of chap and deadly respectable He ll do the heavy father well enough Paolo di Morello is an Italian I don t care for him but the troublesome business about my name is a handicap I can trust these men And at least they won t put you to shame You can judge them when they come so enough talk about them for the present This is my excuse for being here and he put into Annesley s hand a flat oval shaped parcel My wedding gift to my bride he added in a softer tone Open it sweet The white paper wrapping was fastened with small red seals If the girl had had knowledge of such things she would have known that it was a jeweller s parcel But the white gold stamped silk case within surprised her She pressed a tiny knob and the cover flew up to show a string of pearls which made her gasp For the Princess from her Knight he said And here he took from the inner pocket of his coat a band of gold set with a big white diamond is your engagement ring Every girl must have one you know even if her engagement is the shortest on record I ve the wedding ring too But it isn t the time for that A good sized diamond s the obvious sort of thing advertises itself for what it is and that s what we want You ll wear it as much as to say I was engaged like everybody else But if there wasn t a reason against it this is what I should like to put on your finger As he spoke he hid the spark of light in his other hand and from the pocket whence it had come produced another ring If she had not seen this Annesley would have exclaimed against the word obvious for the splendid brilliant as big as a small pea which Knight put aside so carelessly But the contrast between the modern ring with its solitaire diamond and the wonderful rival he gave it silenced her She was no judge of jewellery and had never possessed any worth having but she knew that this second ring was a rare as well as a beautiful antique It looked worthy she thought of a real princess Even the gold was different from other gold the little that was visible for the square cut stone of pale scintillating blue was surrounded by a frame of tiny brilliants encrusting the rim as far as could be seen on the back of the hand when the ring was worn A sapphire Annesley exclaimed My favourite stone Yet I never saw a sapphire like it before It s wonderful brighter than a diamond It is a diamond said Knight A blue diamond and considered remarkable It s what your friend Ruthven Smith would call a museum piece if you showed it to him But you mustn t He d move heaven and earth to get it Nobody must see it but you and me It wouldn t be safe It s too valuable And if you were known to have it you d be in danger from all the jewel thieves in Europe and America You wouldn t like that No it would be horrible Annesley shuddered But what a pity it must be hidden Is it yours It s yours at present said Knight if you ll keep it to yourself and look at it only when you and I are alone together I can t give it to you precisely to have and to hold as I shall give you myself in a few hours because this ring is more a trust than a possession Something may happen which will force me to ask you for it But again it may not And anyhow I want you to have the ring until that time comes I ve bought a thin gold chain and you can hang it round your neck unless I almost think you re inclined to refuse Another mystery But the blue diamond in its scintillating frame was so alluring that Annesley could not refuse She knew that she would have more pleasure in peeping surreptitiously at the secret blue diamond than in seeing the obvious white one on her finger I can t give it up she said laughing But I hope it isn t one of those dreadful historic stones which have had murders committed for it like famous jewels one reads of I should hate anything that came from you to bring bad luck So should I hate it If there s any bad luck coming I want it myself Knight said gravely I wish I hadn t spoken of bad luck to day the girl remorsefully exclaimed But I am not afraid Give me the ring He gave it and pulled from his pocket the slight gold chain on which he meant it to hang He was leisurely threading the ring upon this when two men looked in at the door of the reading room One of the pair was of more than middle age He was tall thin and slightly stooping His respectable clothes seemed too loose for him His hair and straggling beard were gray contrasting with the sallow darkness of his skin He wore gold rimmed spectacles and peered through them as if they were not strong enough for his failing sight The other man was younger He too was dark and sallow but his close cut hair was black He was clean shaven and well dressed He wore a high almost painfully high collar which caused him to keep his chin in air He might be a Spaniard or an Italian Annesley had certainly not seen him before She told herself this twice over Yet she was frightened There was something familiar about him It must be her foolish imagination which took alarm at everything But with fingers grown cold she covered up the blue diamond CHAPTER IX THE THING KNIGHT WANTED When doctor Torrance who was to give her away and the Marchese di Morello who was to be Knight s best man had been introduced to Annesley she laughed at the stupid scare which had chilled her heart for a moment If Knight had remained with her after his friends finished their call she might have confessed to him how she had fancied in the tall dark young man a likeness to one of the dreaded watchers Until Knight spoke their names she had feared that the pair looking in at the door were there to spy that one at all events was disguised cleverly yet not cleverly enough quite to hide his identity But Knight said good bye and went away with his friends giving the girl no chance for further talk with him They did not meet again until with the Countess de Santiago Annesley arrived at the obscure church chosen for the marriage ceremony There doctor Torrance awaited them outside the door and took charge of the bride while the Countess found her way in alone and Annesley saw through the mist of confused emotion her Knight of love and mystery waiting at the altar During the ceremony that followed he made his responses firmly his eyes calling so clearly to hers that she answered with an almost hypnotized gaze His look seemed to seal the promise of his words In spite of all that was strange and secret and unsatisfying about him she had no regrets Love was worth everything and she could but believe that he loved her This strong conviction went with the girl to the vestry and made it easier to turn away when his name his real name which she though his wife was not to know was recorded by him in the book They parted from Torrance Morello and the Countess at the church door an arrangement which delighted Annesley In the haste of making plans she and Knight had forgotten to discuss what they were to do after the wedding and before their departure but Knight had found time to decide the matter These people were the best material I could get hold of at a moment s notice he remarked coolly when he and Annesley were in the motor car he had hired for the journey to Devonshire We ve used them because we needed them Now we don t need them any longer It seems to me that a newly married couple ought to keep only dear friends around them or no one Later we can repay these three for the favour they ve done us if you call it a favour Meanwhile we ll forget them Knight had neglected no detail which could make for Annesley s comfort or save her from any embarrassment arising from the hurried wedding Her luggage had been packed by a maid in the hotel and all but the dressing bag and a small box made for an automobile sent ahead by rail to Devonshire She and Knight were to travel in the comfortable limousine which would protect them against weather It did not matter Knight said how long they were on the way At Exeter they would visit some good agency in search of a lady s maid Annesley said that she did not need a woman to wait on her since she had been accustomed not only to taking care of herself but missus Ellsworth Knight however insisted that his wife must be looked after by a competent woman It was the right thing but his idea was that in the circumstances it would be pleasanter to have a country girl than a sharp London bred woman or a Parisienne In Exeter an ideal person was obtainable a Devonshire girl who had been trained to a maid s duties as the agent boasted by a lady of title She had accompanied the Marchioness to France and had had lessons in Cannes from a hair dresser masseuse and manicurist Now her mistress was dead and Parker was in search of another place She was a gentle sweet looking girl and though she asked for wages higher than missus Ellsworth had paid her companion Knight pronounced them reasonable She was directed to go by train to the Knowle Hotel at Sidmouth where a suite had been engaged by telegram for mister and missus Nelson Smith and maid and to have all the luggage unpacked before their arrival Flung thus into intimate association with a man almost a stranger Annesley had been afraid in the midst of her happiness She felt as a young Christian maiden a prisoner of Nero s day might have felt if told she was to be flung to a lion miraculously subdued by the influence of Christianity Such a maiden could not have been quite sure whether the story were true or a fable whether the lion would destroy her with a blow or crouch at her feet But Annesley s lion neither struck nor crouched He stood by her side as a protector Knight seemed more and more appropriate as a name for him Though there were roughnesses and crudenesses in his manner and choice of words all he did and said made Annesley sure that she had been right in her first impression Not a cultured gentleman like Archdeacon Smith or Annesley s dead father and the few men who had come near her in early childhood before her home fell to pieces he was a gentleman at heart she told herself and in all essentials It struck her as beautiful and even pathetic rather than contemptible that he should humbly wish to learn of her the small refinements he had missed in the past that mysterious past which mattered less and less to Annesley as the present became dear and vital I ve knocked about a lot all over the world he explained in a casual way during a talk they had had on the night of their marriage at the first stopping place to which their motor brought them My mother died when I was a small boy died in a terrible way I don t want to talk about and losing her broke up my father and me for a while He never got over it as long as he lived and I never will as long as I live The way my father died was almost as tragic as my mother s death he went on after a tense moment of remembering I was only a boy even then and ever since the knocking about process has been going on I haven t seen much of the best side of life but I ve wanted it That was why for one reason you made such an appeal to me at first sight You were as plucky and generous as any Bohemian though I could see you were a delicate inexperienced girl brought up under glass like the orchid you look and are I m used to making up my mind in a hurry I ve had to so it didn t take me many minutes to realize that if I could get you to link up with me I should have the thing I d been looking for Well by the biggest stroke of luck I ve got you sooner than I could have dared to hope and now I don t want to make you afraid of me I know my faults and failings but I don t know how to put them right and be the sort of man a girl like you can be proud of It s up to you to show me the way Whenever you see me going wrong you re to tell me That s what I want turn me into a gentleman When Annesley tenderly reassured him with loving flatteries he only laughed and caught her in his arms Like a prince am I he echoed Well I ve got princely blood in my veins through my mother but there are pauper princes and in the pauper business the gilding gets rubbed off I trust you to gild my battered corners No good trying to tell me I m gold all through because I know better but when you ve made me shine on the outside I ll keep the surface bright Annesley did not like the persistent way in which he spoke of himself as a black sheep who at best could be whitened and trained not to disgrace the fold yet it piqued her interest Books said that women had a weakness for men who were not good and she supposed that she was like the rest He was so dear and chivalrous that certain defiant hints as to his lack of virtue vaguely added to the spice of mystery which decorated the background of the picture the vivid picture of the stranger knight When they had been for three days in the best suite at the Knowle Hotel and had made several short excursions with the motor he asked the girl if she felt like getting acquainted with her cousins She did not protest as she had at first Already she knew her Knight well enough to be assured that when he resolved to do a thing it was practically done She had had chances to realize his force of character in little ways as well as big ones and she understood that he was bent on scraping acquaintance with Lord and Lady Annesley Seton Had he not decided upon Sidmouth the instant she mentioned their ownership of a place in the neighbourhood She had been certain that he would not neglect the opportunity created How are we to set about it was all she said Oh Valley House is a show place I suppose you know replied Knight I ve looked it up in the local guide book It s open to the public three days a week Any one with a shilling to spare can see the ancestral portraits and treasures and the equally ancestral rooms of your distinguished family Does that interest you Ye es But I m a distant relation as well as a poor one Annesley reminded him with her old humility You re not poor now And blood is thicker than water when it s in a golden cup It s Lord and Lady Annesley Seton s turn to play the poor relations It seems they re stony Even the shillings the public pay to see the place are an object to them Oh I m sorry exclaimed Annesley That s generous seeing they never bothered themselves about you when they had plenty of shillings and you had none I don t suppose they knew there was a me Lord Annesley Seton must have known if his wife didn t know But we ll let that pass I was thinking we might go to the house on one of the public days with the man who wrote the local guide book I ve made his acquaintance through writing him a note complimenting him on his work and his knowledge of history He answered like a shot with thanks for the appreciation and said if he could help me he d be delighted He s the editor of a newspaper in Torquay If we invite him to lunch here at the Knowle he ll fall over himself to accept Then we ll be able to kill two birds with one stone He ll tell us things about the heirlooms at Valley House we shouldn t be able to find out without his help or a lot of dreary drudgery and also he ll put a paragraph about us in his newspaper which he ll send to your cousins Now isn t that a combination of brilliant ideas Yes laughed Annesley But why should you take so much trouble and how can you tell that the editor s paragraph would make the Annesley Setons want to know us As for the paragraph you may put your faith in me And as for the trouble nothing s too much to launch my wife on the top wave of society where she has every right to be I want missus Nelson Smith to have her chance to shine Money would do the trick sooner or later but I want it to be done sooner Besides I have a feeling I should like us to get where we want to be without the noisy splash money bags make when new rich candidates for society are launched Your people will see excellent reasons why their late poor relation is worth cultivating But trust them to save their faces by keeping their real motive secret with a touch of sarcasm I seem to hear them going about among their friends whom they ll invite to meet us saying how charming and unspoilt you are though you ve got more money than you know what to do with I With the protesting pronoun Annesley disclaimed all ownership of her husband s fortune whatever it might be It s the same thing You and I are one Whatever is mine is yours I don t swear to make you a regular unfailing allowance worthy of the new position you re going to have because you see I do business with several countries and my income s erratic I m never sure to the day when it will come or how much it will be But there s nothing you want which you can t buy remember that And when we begin life in London you shall have a standing account at as many shops as you like Annesley made no objection to Knight s plan for luring the journalist into his trap which was a harmless one According to his prophecy mister Milton Savage of the Torquay Weekly Messenger accepted the invitation from his correspondent and came to luncheon on the day when the public were free to view Valley House He was a small man with a big head and eyes which glinted large behind convex spectacles Annesley was charming to him not only in the wish to please Knight but because she was kind hearted and had intense sympathy for suppressed people mister Savage was grateful and admiring and drank in every word Knight dropped as if carelessly about the relationship to Lord Annesley Seton Knight allowed himself to be pumped concerning it and also his wife s parentage letting fall with apparent inadvertence bits of information regarding himself his travels his adventures and the fortune he had picked up I m the exception he said to the proverb that a rolling stone gathers no moss I ve gathered all I want or know what to do with and now I m married I mean to take a rest I haven t decided yet where or how but it will be somewhere in England We re looking for a house in London and later we might rent one in the country too Annesley admired his cleverness in touching the goal but somehow these smart hits disturbed rather than amused her Knight s complexity was a puzzle to her She could not understand despite his explanations why these fireworks of dexterity were worth while Knight was a brave figure of romance She did not want her hero turned into an intriguer no matter how innocent his motive After luncheon they drove five or six miles in the motor to Valley House a place of Jacobean times There was an Italian garden and an English garden containing every flower plant and herb mentioned by Shakespeare Each garden had a distant view of the sea darkly framed by Lebanon cedars and immense beeches while the house itself not large as show houses go was perfect of its kind with carved stone mantels elaborate oak panelling and staircases leaded windows and treasures of portraits armour ancient books and bric a brac which would have remade the family fortune if all had not been heirlooms There was not a picture on the walls nor an old piece of jewellery in the many locked glass cabinets of which mister Milton Savage could not tell the history as he guided the Nelson Smiths through hall and corridors and rooms with marvellous moulded ceilings The liveried servant told off to show the crowd over the house had but a superficial knowledge of its riches compared with the lore of the journalist and the editor of the Torquay Weekly Messenger became inconveniently popular with the public He was not blind to the compliment however and motoring into Torquay at the end of the afternoon with his host and hostess expressed himself delighted with his visit That night was his night for going to press but he found time to write the paragraph which Nelson Smith expected Next morning a copy of the Messenger with a page marked arrived at the Knowle Hotel and another also marked went to Valley House The bride and bridegroom were at breakfast when the paper came There were also three letters all for Knight the first which either had received since their marriage Knight cut open the envelopes slowly one after the other and made no comment Annesley could not help wondering if the Countess had written for an involuntary glance had made her sure that one of Knight s letters was from a woman a purple envelope with a purple monogram and a blob of purple wax sealed with a crown He read all three put them back into their envelopes rose dropped them into the fire watched them burn to ashes and quietly returned to his seat Then as if really interested he tore the wrapping off the Torquay Messenger Now we shall see ourselves in print he said and a moment later was reading to Annesley an account of the two most interesting guests the Knowle Hotel has entertained this season mister and missus Nelson Smith were described with enthusiasm They were young and handsome He was immensely rich she was highly connected as well as beautiful having been a Miss Annesley Grayle related on her mother s side to the Earl of Annesley Seton The modesty of the young couple was so great however that though the bridegroom was a millionaire well known in his adopted country America and the bride quite closely linked with his lordship s family they had refused to make their presence in the neighbourhood known to the Earl and Lady Instead they had visited Valley House with a crowd of tourists on a public day expressing the opinion to a representative of the Messenger that it would be intrusive to present themselves to Lord and Lady Annesley Seton They were spending their honeymoon in Devonshire and might find during their motor tours a suitable country place to buy or rent In any case they would look for a house in which to settle on their return to London Good for Milton Savage laughed Knight Now we ll lie low and see what will happen Annesley thought that nothing would happen but she was wrong The next morning a note came by hand for missus Nelson Smith brought by a footman on a bicycle The note was from Lady Annesley Seton CHAPTER X BEGINNING OF THE SERIES No man who had not known the seamy side of life could have guessed the effect of Milton Savage s paragraph upon the minds of Lord and Lady Annesley Seton I told you if you bet against me you would bet wrong Knight said when the astonished girl handed the letter across the breakfast table Even he had hardly reckoned on such extreme cordiality He had expected a bid for acquaintanceship with the millionaire and his bride but he had fancied there would be a certain stiffness in the effort Lady Annesley Seton had begun My dear Cousin and her frank American way was disarming She wrote four pages of apology for herself and her husband explaining why they had neglected looking up missus Nelson Smith when she was Miss Annesley Grayle The letter went on I hadn t been married long when my husband read out of some newspaper the notice of a clergyman s death and mentioned that he was a cousin by marriage whom he hadn t met since boyhood although the clergyman s living was in our county somewhere off at the other end My husband thought there was a daughter and I remember his remarking that we ought to write and find out if she d been left badly off Of course it was my duty to have kept his idea alive and to have carried it out But I was young and having such a good time that I m afraid it was a case of out of sight out of mind We forgot to inquire and heard no more It was horrid of us and I m sure it was our loss Probably we should have remembered if things had gone well with us but perhaps you know that my father whose money used to seem unlimited to me lost it all and we were mixed up in the smash We ve been poorer than any church mice since and trying to make ends meet has occupied our attention from that day to this I have to confess that if our attention hadn t been drawn to your name we might never have thought of it again But now I ve eased my conscience and as fate seems to have brought us within close touch do let us see what she means to do with us We should so like to meet you and mister Nelson Smith who is apparently more or less a countryman of mine I m not allowed out yet in this cold weather after an attack of flu but my husband will call this afternoon on the chance of finding you in carrying a warm invitation to you both to waive ceremony and dine with us at Valley House en famille Looking forward to meeting you Yours most cordially Constance Annesley Seton Sweet of her isn t it Annesley exclaimed when she and Knight had read the letter through Knight glanced at his wife quizzically opened his lips to speak and closed them Perhaps he thought it would be unwise as well as wrong to disturb the girl s faith in Lady Annesley Seton s disinterestedness Yes it s real sweet he said exaggerating his American accent but keeping a grave face They were duly at home that afternoon though they had intended to go out and the caller found them in a private sitting room filled with flowers suggesting much money and a love of spending it Annesley had put on Knight s favourite frock one of the model dresses he had chosen for her in their whirlwind rush through Bond Street a white cloth trimmed with narrow bands of dark fur and she had never looked prettier Lord Annesley Seton a tall thin man of the eagle nosed soldier type wearing pince nez but youthful looking for the forty four years Burke gave him could not help thinking her a satisfactory cousin to pick up and Nelson Smith was far from being in appearance the rough self made man he had dreaded He was delighted with them both so young so handsome so happy so fortunate and luckily so well bred He did not make the short conventional call he had intended but stayed to tea and at last went home to give his wife an enthusiastic account of the visit The girl s a lady and might be a beauty if she had more confidence in herself you know what I mean taking herself for granted as a charmer the way you smart women do he said She isn t that kind But with you to show her the ropes she ll be liked by the right people There s a softness and sweetness and genuineness that you don t often see in girls now As for the man you ll think him a ripper Connie so will other women Has the air of being a gentleman born and then having roughed it all over the world A strong man I should say A man s man as well as a woman s Might take if he s started right We ll see to that said Constance Annesley Seton who was not too ill to go out but had not wanted to seem too eager She was less than thirty but looked more because she had worried and drawn faint lines between her delicate auburn brows and at the corners of her greenish gray eyes There were also a few fading threads in the red locks which were her one real beauty but she had a marvellous hair varnish which prevented them from showing We ll see to that If they ll let us Are they going to let us Yes I think so Annesley Seton reassured her They re a pair of children willing to be guided They can have anything they want in the world but they don t seem to know what to want Splendid laughed Constance Can t we will them to want our house in town and invite us to visit them I shouldn t wonder replied her husband You might make a start in that direction when they come to dinner to morrow evening Lord Annesley Seton had outgrown such enthusiasms as he might once have had therefore his account of the cousins encouraged Constance to hope much and she was not disappointed On the contrary she thought that he had not said enough especially about the man If she had not had so many anxieties that her youthful love of larks had been crushed out she would have adored a flirtation with Nelson Smith It would have been great fun to steal him from the pretty beanpole of a girl who would not know how to use her claws in a fight for her man but as it was Connie thought only of conciliating Cousin Anne and winning her confidence Other women would try to take Nelson Smith from his wife but Connie would have her hands full in playing a less amusing game She thought seeing that the handsome dark young man she admired had a mind of his own it would be a difficult game to play and Nelson Smith saw that she thought so His sense of humour caused him to smile at his own cleverness in producing the impression and he would have given a good deal for someone to laugh with over her maneuvers to entice him along the road he wished to travel But he dared not point out to Annesley the fun of the situation To do so would be to put her against him and it She too had a sense of humour suppressed by five years of missus Ellsworth but coming delightfully to life like a half frozen bird in the sunshine of safety and happiness Knight appealed to and encouraged it often for he could not have lived with a humourless woman no matter how sweet Yet he did not dare wake it where her cousins were concerned Her sense of honour was more valuable to him than her sense of humour He was afraid to put the former on the defensive and he was glad to let her believe the Annesley Setons were genuinely warming to them in a way which proved that blood was thicker than water The girl had wondered from the first why he was determined to make friends with these cousins whom she had never known and he was grateful because she believed in him too loyally to attribute his desire to snobbishness He wished her to suppose he had set his heart on providing her with influential guidance on the threshold of a new life and it was important that she should not begin criticizing his motives By the time dinner was over Constance Annesley Seton had decided that the Nelson Smiths had been sent to her by the Powers that Be and that it would be tempting Providence not to annex them Not that she put it in that way to herself for she did not trouble her mind about Providence All she knew was that she and Dick would be fools to let the chance slip It was as much as she could do not to suggest the idea in her mind that the Nelson Smiths should take the house in Portman Square that she and her husband should introduce them to society and that the Devonshire place should either be let to them or that they should visit there when they wished to be in the country as paying guests But she controlled her impatience limiting herself to proposing plans for future meetings She suggested giving a dinner in honour of the bride and bridegroom and inviting people whom it would be nice for them to know in town Knight said that he and Anita his new name for Annesley a souvenir of Spanish South America would accept with pleasure And the girl agreed gladly because she thought her cousin and his wife were very kind After dinner Annesley Seton and Knight followed Constance and Anita almost directly the former asking his guests if they would like to see some of the family treasures which they could only have glanced at in passing with the crowd the other day Before sugar went to smash we blazed into all sorts of extravagances here he said bitterly with a glance at the deposed Sugar King s daughter Among others putting electric light into this old barn We ll have an illumination and show you some trifles Connie and I wish to Heaven a kind hearted burglar would relieve us of Of course the beastly things are heirlooms as I suppose you know We can t sell or pawn them or I should have done one or the other long ago They re insured by the trustees who are the bane of our lives for the estate But a sporting sort of company has blossomed out lately which insures against loss of use I think that s the expression I pay the premium myself even when I can t pay anything else and if the valuable contents of this place are stolen or burned we shall benefit personally I don t mind you or all the world knowing we re stony broke he went on frankly And everyone does know anyhow that we d be in the deuce of a hole without the tourists shillings which pour in twice a week the year round You see each object in the collection helps bring in those shillings and loss of use of a single one would be a real deprivation So it s fair and above board But thus far I ve paid my premium and got no return these last three years Our tourists are so disgustingly honest or our burglars so clumsy and unenterprising that as you say in the States there s nothing doing As he talked Dick Annesley Seton sauntered about the immense room into which they had come from the state banqueting hall switching on more and more of the electric candle lights set high on the green brocade walls This was known as the green drawing room by the family and the Room of the Miniatures by the public who read about it in catalogues Come and look at our white elephants he went on when the room dimly and economically lit at first was ablaze with light and mister and missus Nelson Smith joined him eagerly Constance followed too bored but resigned and her husband paused before a tall narrow glass cabinet standing in a recess See these miniatures he exclaimed fretfully There are plenty more but the best are in this cabinet and there s a millionaire chap in New York perhaps you can guess his name Smith who has offered a hundred thousand pounds for the thirty little bits of ivory in it I think that must have been the great Paul Van Vreck Knight hazarded I thought you d guess There aren t many who d make such an offer Think what it would mean to me if it could be accepted and I could have the handling of the money There are three small pictures in the little octagon gallery next door too Van Vreck took a fancy to on a visit he paid us from Saturday to Monday last summer We never thought much of them and they re in a dark place labelled in the catalogue Artist unknown School of Fragonard but he swore they were authentic Fragonards and would have backed his opinion to the tune of fifteen thousand pounds for the trio or six thousand for the one he liked best Isn t it aggravating In the Chinese room he went mad over some bits of jade especially a Buddha nobody else had ever admired He s one of the few millionaire collectors who is really a judge of all sorts of things Knight replied But great Scott I m no expert yet it strikes me these miniatures are something out of the ordinary Well yes they are Annesley Seton admitted modestly That queer one at the top is a Nicholas Hilliard I believe he was the first of the miniaturists And the two just underneath are Samuel Coopers They say he stood at the head of the Englishmen There are three Richard Cosways and rather a nice Angelica Kauffmann It was the Fragonard miniature mister Van Vreck liked best put in Constance It seems he painted only a few And next the Goya Good heavens where is the Fragonard cried Dick his eyes bulging behind his pince nez Surely it was here Oh surely yes panted his wife It was never anywhere else For an instant they were stricken into silence both staring at a blank space on the black velvet background where twenty nine miniatures hung There was no doubt about it when they had reviewed the rows of little painted faces The Fragonard was gone Stolen gasped Lady Annesley Seton Unless one of you or some servant you trust with the key is a somnambulist said Knight I don t see how it would pay a thief to steal such a thing It must be too well known He couldn t dispose of it that is if he weren t a collector himself and even then he could never show it But by Jove What is it What have you seen Annesley Seton asked sharply Knight pointed without touching the cabinet He had never come near enough to do that It looks to me as if a square bit of glass had been cut out on the side where the lost miniature must have hung he said I can t be sure from where I stand because the cabinet is too close to the wall of the recess Dick Annesley Seton thrust his arm into the space between green brocade and glass then slipped his hand through a neatly cut aperture just big enough to admit its passage With his hand in the square hole he could reach the spot where the miniature had hung and could have taken it off the hook had it been there But hook as well as miniature was missing That settles it he exclaimed It is a theft and a clever one Strange we should find it out when I was demonstrating to you how much I wished it would happen Hurrah That miniature alone is insured against burglary for seven or eight hundred pounds Nothing to what it s worth but a lot to pay a premium on with the rest of the things besides I wish now I hadn t been so cheese paring You ll be witnesses you two of our discovery I m glad Connie and I weren t alone when we found it out Something nasty might have been said We ll back you up with pleasure Knight replied What was the miniature like I wonder if we saw it when we were here the other day Anita I remember these but can t recall any other Neither can I returned Annesley But I am stupid about such things We saw so many and passed so quickly I wonder if Paul Van Vreck was here in disguise among the tourists said Dick beginning to laugh It would have been the one he d have chosen if he couldn t grab the lot Oh surely no one in the crowd could have cut a piece of glass out of a cabinet and stolen a miniature without being seen Annesley cried Dick is half in joke Constance explained It would have been a miracle yet the servants are above suspicion Those horrid trustees never let me choose a new one without their interference And of course Dick didn t mean what he said about mister Van Vreck Of course not I understood that Annesley excused herself blushing lest she had appeared obtuse All the same to carry on the joke let s go into the octagon room and see if the alleged Fragonard pictures have gone too said Annesley Seton He led the way turning on more light in the adjoining room as he went and outdistancing the others they heard him stammer Good Lord before they were near enough to see what he saw They aren t gone shrieked his wife hurrying after him One of them is In an instant the three had grouped behind him where he stood staring at an empty frame between two others of the same pattern and size charming old frames twelve or fourteen inches square within whose boundaries of carved and gilded wood nymphs held hands and danced Are we dreaming this gasped Constance Thank Heaven we re not the husband answered The two paintings are on wood you see So was the missing one Someone has simply unfastened it from the frame and trusted to this being a dark out of the way corner not to have the theft noticed for hours or maybe days By all that s wonderful here s another insurance haul for me What about the jade Buddha in the Chinese room They rushed back into the green drawing room and so to the beautiful Chinese room beyond with its priceless lacquer tables and cabinets In one of these latter a collection of exquisite jade was gathered together And the Buddha which Paul Van Vreck had coveted was gone CHAPTER XI ANNESLEY REMEMBERS There was great excitement for the next few days at Valley House and throughout the neighbourhood for the Annesley Setons made no secret of the robbery and the affair got into the papers not only the local ones but the London dailies Two of the latter sent representatives to whom Lord Annesley Seton granted interviews Something he said attracted the reporters attention to mister and missus Nelson Smith who had been dining at Valley House on the evening when the theft was discovered and Knight was begged for an interview He was asked if he had formed an opinion as to the disappearance of the three heirlooms and whether he knew personally mister Paul Van Vreck the American collector and retired head of the famous firm of jewellers who had wished to buy the vanished treasures Having spent most of his life in America Knight had the theory that unless you wished to be misrepresented the only safe thing was to let yourself be interviewed He was accordingly so good natured and interesting that the reporters were delighted with him If he had been wishing for a wide advertisement of his personality his possessions and his plans he could not have chosen a surer way of getting it The two newspapers which had undertaken to boom the Valley House Heirloom Theft had almost limitless circulations One of them possessed a Continental edition and the other was immensely popular because of its topical illustrations Snapshots not so unflattering as usual were obtained of the young Anglo American millionaire and his bride as they started away from the Knowle Hotel in their motor or as they walked in the garden Though Knight had disclaimed any personal acquaintance with the great Paul Van Vreck he was able to state that mister Van Vreck had been convalescing at Palm Beach in Florida at the time of the robbery He had had an attack of pneumonia in the autumn and instead of travelling in his yacht to Egypt as he generally did travel early in the winter he had been ordered by his doctors to be satisfied with a place in the sun nearer home Everyone in America knew this Knight explained and everyone in England might know it also unless it had been forgotten If mister Van Vreck were well enough to take an interest in the papers he was sure to be amused by the coincidence that the things stolen from Valley House were among those he had wanted to buy Knight thought however that even if the clever thief or thieves had heard of Van Vreck s whim no attempt would be made to dispose of the spoil to him The elderly millionaire though one of the most eccentric men living was known as the soul of honour The relationship between young missus Nelson Smith and Lord Annesley Seton was touched upon in the papers and though it was irrelevant to the subject in hand mention was made of the Nelson Smiths plan to live in London This gave Constance her chance At an impromptu luncheon at the Knowle Hotel before the intended dinner party at Valley House she referred to the interest Society would begin to take in this romantic couple Everybody will have fallen in love with you already she said from those snapshots in the Looking Glass They make you both look such darlings though they don t flatter either of you All the people we know will be clamouring to meet you so you must hurry and find a nice house in the right part of town before some other sensation comes up and you re forgotten How would it be if you took our house for a couple of months while you re looking round Naturally if you liked it you could keep it on We d be delighted for we have to let it when we can and it would be a pleasure to think of you in it If we re in it you must both come and stay and not only think of us but be with us mustn t they Anita Knight proposed Of course Annesley said yes and meant yes Not that she really wanted her duet with Knight to be broken up into a chorus but she longed to succeed as a woman of the world since that was what he wanted her to be and she realized that Lady Annesley Seton s help would be invaluable So through the theft at Valley House and the developments therefrom the hidden desires of Nelson Smith and the daughter of the deposed Sugar King accomplished themselves Connie still believing that she had engineered the affair with diplomatic skill and Knight laughing silently at the way she had played into his hands Detectives were set to work by the two insurance companies who hoped to trace the thief and discover the stolen Fragonards and the jade Buddha but their efforts failed and at the dinner party given in honour of the new cousins Lord and Lady Annesley Seton rejoiced openly in their good luck All the same Constance said I should like to know how the things were spirited out of the house and where they are It is the first mystery that has ever come into our lives I wish I were a clairvoyante It would be fun Did you ever hear of the Countess de Santiago when you lived in America asked Knight in his calm voice He did not glance toward Annesley who sat at the other end of the table but he must have guessed that she would turn with a start of surprise on hearing the Countess s name in this connection The Countess de Santiago Connie echoed No What about her She sounds interesting She is interesting And beautiful Everybody had stopped talking by this time to listen and in the pause Knight appealed to his wife That s not an exaggeration is it Anita Annesley wondering and somewhat startled answered that the Countess de Santiago was one of the most beautiful women she had seen This riveted the attention which Knight had caught He had his audience and went on in a leisurely way Come to think of it she can t have been heard of in your part of the world until you d left for England he told Constance She s the most extraordinary clairvoyante I ever heard of That s what made me speak of her Unfortunately she s not a professional and won t do anything unless she happens to feel like it But I wonder if I could persuade her to look in her crystal for you Lady Annesley Seton She s an old acquaintance of mine he went on casually I met her in Buenos Aires before her rich elderly husband died about seven or eight years ago She was very young then I came across her again in California when she was seeing the world as a free woman after the old fellow s death Then I introduced her by letter to one or two people in New York and I believe she has been admired there and at Newport But I ve only heard all that Knight hastened to explain I ve been too busy till lately to know at first hand what goes on in the smart or the artistic set My world doesn t take much interest in crystal gazers and palmists amateur or professional even when they happen to be handsome women like the Countess But I ran against her again on board the Monarchic about a month ago crossing to this side and we picked up threads of old acquaintance She was staying at the Savoy when I left London He paused a moment and added As a favour to me she might set her accomplishments to work on this business Only she d have to meet you both and see this house for I ve heard her say she couldn t do anything without knowing the people concerned and getting the atmosphere Oh we must have her cried Constance and all the other women except Annesley chimed in begging their hostess to invite them if the Countess came No one thought it odd that missus Nelson Smith should be silent for her remark about the Countess de Santiago s beauty showed that she had met the lady but to any one who had turned a critical stare upon her then her expression must have seemed strange She had an unseeing look the look of one who has become deaf and blind to everything outside some scene conjured up by the brain What Annesley saw was a copy of the Morning Post Knight s mention of the Countess de Santiago s power of clairvoyance at the same time with the liner Monarchic printed before her eyes a paragraph which her subconscious self had never forgotten For the moment only her body sat between a young hunting baronet and a distinguished elderly general at her cousins dinner table Her soul had gone back to London to the ugly dining room at twenty two A Torrington Square and was reading aloud from a newspaper to a stout old woman in a tea gown She was even able to recall what she had been thinking as her lips mechanically conveyed the news to missus Ellsworth She had been wondering how much longer she could go on enduring the monotony and what missus Ellsworth would do if her slave should stop reading shriek and throw the Morning Post in her face As she pictured to herself the old woman s amazement followed by rage she had pronounced the words SENSATIONAL OCCURRENCE ON BOARD THE S S MONARCHIC Even that exciting preface had not recalled her interest from her own affairs She could remember now the hollow mechanical sound of her voice in her own ears as she had half heartedly gone on tempted to turn the picture of her wild revolt into reality The paragraph seemingly forgotten but merely buried under other memories had told of the disappearance on board the Monarchic of certain pearls and diamonds which were being secretly brought from New York to London by an agent of a great jewellery firm He had been blamed by the chief officer for not handing the valuables over to the purser The unfortunate man who had not advertised the fact that he was an agent for Van Vreck company until he had had to complain of the theft excused this seeming carelessness by the statement that he had hoped his identity might pass unsuspected His theory was that safety lay in insignificance He had engaged a small cheap cabin for himself alone taking an assumed name had pretended to be a schoolmaster on holiday and had worn the pearls and other things always on his person in a money belt Even at night he had kept the belt on his body a revolver under his pillow and the door of his cabin locked with an extra patent adjustable lock of his own invented by a member of the firm he served It had not seemed probable that he would be recognized or possible that he could be robbed Yet one morning he had waked late with a dull headache and sensation of sickness to find that his door though closed was unfastened and that all his most valuable possessions were missing from the belt Some were left as though the thief had fastidiously made his selection scorning to trouble himself with anything but the best The mystery of the affair was increased by the fact that though the man Annesley vaguely recalled some odd name like Jekyll or Jedkill felt certain he had fastened the door there was no sign that it had been forced open His patent detachable lock however had disappeared like the jewels And despite the sensation of sickness and pain in the head there were no symptoms of drugging by chloroform or any odour of chloroform or other anaesthetic in the room It struck Annesley as strange almost terrifying that these details of the Monarchic sensation should come back to her now but she could not doubt that she had actually read them and the rest of the story continued to reprint itself on her brain as the unrolling of a film might bring back to one of the actors poses of his own which he had let slip into oblivion She remembered how some of the more important passengers had suggested that everybody on board should be searched even to the ship s officers sailors and employes of all sorts that the search had been made and nothing found but that a lady supposed to possess clairvoyant powers had offered mister Jekyll or Jedkill to consult her crystal for his benefit She had done so and had seen wireless messages passing between someone on the Monarchic and someone on another ship with whom the former person appeared to be in collusion She had seen a small fair man dressed as a woman hypnotizing the jewellers agent into the belief that he was locking his door when instead he was leaving it unlocked Then she had seen this man who she asserted firmly was dressed like a woman walk into his victim s cabin hypnotize him into still deeper unconsciousness and take from his belt three long strings of pearls and several magnificent diamonds set and unset These things she saw made up into a bundle wrapped in waterproof cloth attached to a faintly illuminated life preserver and thrown overboard Almost immediately after she said the life preserver was picked up by a man in a small motor launch let down from a steam yacht The launch quickly returned to the yacht was taken up and the yacht made off in the darkness No life belt was missing from the Monarchic and even if suspicion could be entertained against any small fair man which was not the case apparently there was no justification for a search Therefore although a good many people believed in the seeress s vision it proved nothing and the sensational affair remained as deep a mystery as ever when the Monarchic docked The Countess de Santiago was the woman who looked in the crystal Annesley said to herself She wondered why if Knight had been vexed with the Countess for speaking of their friendship and of the Monarchic as he had once seemed to be he should refer to it before these strangers She looked down the table past the other faces to his face and the thought that came to her mind was how simple and almost meaningless the rest were compared to his Among the fourteen guests seven women and seven men though some had charm or distinction his face alone was complex mysterious and baffling Yet she loved it Now more than ever she loved and admired it The dinner ended with a discussion between Knight and Constance as to how the Countess de Santiago could be induced to pay a visit to Valley House despite the fact that she had never met Lord and Lady Annesley Seton Like most women who had lived in Spanish countries the Countess was rather a stickler for etiquette her friend Nelson Smith announced Besides her experience as an amateur clairvoyante made her quick to resent anything which had the air of patronage One must go delicately to work to think out a scheme if Lady Annesley Seton were really in dead earnest about wanting her to come At this point Knight reflected for a minute while everyone hung upon his silence and at last he had an inspiration I ll tell you what we can do he exclaimed My wife and I you re willing aren t you Anita can ask her to stay over this week end with us I think she ll come if she isn t engaged and we can invite you to meet her at dinner Oh you must invite us all pleaded a pretty woman sitting next to Knight All of you who care to come certainly he agreed Won t we Anita Oh of course It will be splendid if everybody will dine with us Annesley backed him up with one of the girlish blushes that made her seem so young and ingenuously attractive We can send a telegram to the Countess She did her best to speak enthusiastically and succeeded No one save Knight and Constance guessed it was an effort Knight saw and was grateful Constance saw also and smiled to herself at what she fancied was the girl s jealousy of an old friend of the new husband an old friend who was one of the most beautiful women the girl had seen Annesley s hesitation inclined Constance to be more interested than ever in the Countess de Santiago CHAPTER XII THE CRYSTAL Motoring back from Valley House to the Knowle Hotel Annesley was asking herself whether she might dare refer to the Monarchic and mention the story she had read In the Morning Post She burned to do so yet stopped each time a question pressed to her lips remembering Knight s eyes as he had looked at the Countess in the Savoy restaurant the day before the wedding Perhaps the wish would have conquered if some imp had not whispered What about that purple envelope addressed in a woman s handwriting Maybe it was from her hinting to see him again and that is what has put this plan into his head Perhaps he brought up the subject of the Countess on purpose to make them invite her here This thought caused the Countess de Santiago to seem a powerful person with an influence over Knight though he had appeared not to care for her Could it be that he wanted an excuse to have her near him The suggestion closed Annesley s mouth by making her afraid that she was turning into a suspicious creature like jealous brides she had read about She determined to be silent as a self punishment and firmly steered the Monarchic into a backwater of her thoughts while Knight talked of the Valley House party and their credulous superstition Every man Jack and every woman Jill of the lot believe in that crystal and clairvoyant nonsense he laughed I mentioned it for fun but I went on simply to pull their legs I hope you don t mind having the Countess down do you child Of course I made it out to be a favour that so wonderful a being should consent to come at call But between us Anita the poor woman will fall over herself with joy She s a restless lonely creature who has drifted about the world without stopping anywhere long enough to make friends and I have a notion that her heart s desire is to get into society in England This will give her a chance because these good ladies and gentlemen who are dying to see what she s like and persuade her to tell their pasts and futures are at the top of the tree It s a cheap way for us to make her happy and we can afford it Don t you believe she really is clairvoyant and sees things in her crystal Annesley ventured It was then that Knight made her heart beat by answering with a question Didn t you read in the newspapers about the queer thing that happened on board the Monarchic Ye es I did read it the girl said in so stifled a voice that the reply became a confession Why didn t you tell me so Because the day I heard you were on the Monarchic I couldn t remember what I d read It was vague in my mind No other reason Only that that I fancied You fancied I didn t like to talk about the Monarchic Well when the Countess spoke of it you looked cross I was cross But only with the way she spoke as if she and I had come over together because we were pals That s all Though I ve every cause to hate the memory of that trip When did you remember what you had read in the newspapers Only this evening I thought so At dinner I saw a look come over your face I didn t know you noticed me I m always noticing you And I was proud of you to night Well You remembered About a man on board being robbed and a lady an amateur clairvoyante seeing things in a crystal I thought it must have been the Countess de Santiago It was though her name was kept out of the papers by her request She s sensitive about the clairvoyance stuff afraid people may consider her a professional and look down on her from patronizing social heights Of course I suppose it s nonsense about seeing things in a glass ball but I believe she does contrive to take it seriously for she seems in earnest She did tell people on board ship things about themselves true things they said and they ought to know As for the jewel affair he added nobody could be sure if there was anything in her visions but people thought them extraordinary even the captain a hard headed old chap You see a yacht had been sighted the evening before the robbery while the passengers were at dinner It might have kept near with lights out for the Monarchic is one of the huge slow going giants and the yacht might have been a regular little greyhound It seems she didn t answer signals The captain hadn t thought much of that because there was a slight fog and she could have missed them But it came back to him afterward and seemed to bear out the Countess s rigmarole Besides there was the finding of the patent lock where she told the man Jedfield he ought to look for it I don t remember that in the paper It was in several if not all She saw the missing lock a thing that goes over a bolt and prevents it sliding back in one of the lifeboats upon the boat deck caught in the canvas covering Well it was there And there could be no suspicion of her putting the thing where it was found so as to make herself seem a true prophetess She couldn t have got to the place That s why people were so impressed with the rest of the visions We re all inclined to be superstitious Even I was interested Though I don t pin my faith in such things I asked her to look into the crystal and see if she could tell what had become of my gold repeater which disappeared the same night Oh exclaimed Annesley So you had something stolen It looked like it Anyhow the watch went And the Countess lost a ring during the trip a valuable one I believe She couldn t see anything for herself but she got a glimpse of my repeater in the pocket of a red waistcoat Nobody on board confessed to a red waistcoat And in the searching of passengers luggage which I should have proposed myself if I hadn t been among the robbed nothing of the sort materialized However that proved nothing Jedfield s pearls and other trinkets must have been somewhere on board in someone s possession if the yacht vision wasn t true Yet the strictest search gave no sign of them It was a miracle how they were disposed of unless they were thrown overboard and picked up by someone in the plot as the Countess said Is that why you hate to think of the trip because you lost your watch Annesley asked Yes Just that It wasn t so much the loss of the watch though it was a present and I valued it as because it made me feel such a fool I left the repeater under my pillow when I got up in the middle of the night to go on deck thinking I heard a cry I couldn t have heard one for nobody was there And next morning when I wanted to look at the time my watch was equally invisible Then there was the business of the passengers being searched and the everlasting talk about the whole business One got sick and tired of it I got tired of the Countess and her crystal too but the effect is passing away now I expect I can stand her if you can Annesley said that she would be interested She refrained from adding that she did not intend to make use of the seeress s gift for her own benefit The Countess de Santiago wired her acceptance of the invitation and appeared at the Knowle Hotel on Saturday with a maid and a good deal of luggage Annesley had secretly feared that the effect of the beautiful lady on the guests of the hotel would be overpowering and had pictured her brilliantly coloured and exquisitely dressed breaking like a sunburst upon the dining room at luncheon time But she had underrated the Countess s cleverness and sense of propriety The lady arrived in a neat tailor made travelling dress of russet brown tweed which with a plain toque of brown velvet and fur cooled the ruddy flame of her hair It seemed to Annesley also that her lips were less red than before and though she was as remarkable as ever for her beauty she was not to be remarked for meretriciousness She was pleasanter in manner too as well as in appearance and Annesley s heart which had difficulty in hardening itself for long was touched by the Countess s thanks for the invitation You are so happy and wrapped up in each other I didn t expect you to give a thought to me the beautiful woman said You don t know what it means to be asked down here after so many lonely days in town and to find that you and Don are going to give me some new friends This note which Knight also had struck in explaining the Countess s heart s desire was the right note to enlist Annesley s sympathy One might have thought that both had guessed this Annesley and Knight gave their dinner party in a private room adjoining their own sitting room and connecting also with another smaller room which they had had fitted up for a special purpose This purpose was to enshrine the seeress and her crystal As Knight had said she seemed to take her clairvoyant power seriously and insisted that she could do herself justice only in a room arranged in a certain way In the afternoon she directed that the furniture should be removed with the exception of one small table and two chairs Even the pictures had to be taken down and under the Countess s supervision purple velvet draperies had to be put up covering the walls and window These draperies she had brought with her and they had curtain rings sewn on at the upper edge which could be attached to picture hooks or nails From the same trunk came also a white silk table cover embroidered in gold with figures representing the signs of the zodiac There were in addition three purple velvet cushions two for the chairs and one the Countess explained for the table to make an arm rest By her further desire a large number of hot house lilies in pots were sent for and ranged on the floor round the walls As for the Turkish carpet of banal reds blues and greens it had to be concealed under rugs of black fur which luckily the hotel possessed in plenty It was all very mysterious and exciting and Annesley could imagine the effective background these contrivances would give the shining figure of the Countess When later on she saw her guest dressed for dinner the girl realized even more vividly the genius of the artist who had planned the picture For the Countess de Santiago wore a clinging gown made in Greek fashion of a supple white material shot with interwoven silver threads She wore her copper red hair in a classic knot with a wreath of emerald laurel leaves She would gleam like a moonlit statue in her lily perfumed purple shrine Annesley thought and was not surprised that the lady should achieve an instant success with the county folk who had begged for an invitation to meet her The Countess de Santiago did not seem to mind answering questions about her powers which everyone asked across the dinner table She said that since her seventh birthday she had been able under certain circumstances to see hidden things in people s lives and future events Her first experience as a child was being shut up in a darkened room and looking into a mirror where figures and scenes appeared like waking dreams She had been frightened and screamed to be let out Her mother had taken pity and released her saying that after all it was what might be expected from the seventh child of a seventh child born on All Saints Eve The Nelson Smiths guests listened breathlessly to every word and were enchanted when she promised to give each man and woman a short sitting with her crystal after dinner Nothing was said about the purple room so that the surprise could not help being impressive It was a delightful dinner well thought out between the host and head waiter but no one wished to linger over it Never had bridge fiends been so eager to get to work as these people were to take their turn with the Countess and her crystal At Lady Annesley Seton s suggestion they drew lots for these turns and Constance herself drew the first chance She and the gleaming figure of the Countess went out together and ten or twelve minutes later she returned alone Everyone stared eagerly to see if she looked excited and it took no stretch of imagination to find her face flushed and her eyes dilated Well Has she told you anything wonderful A clamour of voices joined in the question Yes she has replied Constance She s simply uncanny She could pick up a fortune in London in one season if she were a professional She has told me in what sort of place the heirlooms are now but that we shall never see them again So saying Lady Annesley Seton plumped down on a sofa beside her hostess as the next person hurried off to plunge into the mysteries I feel quite weak in the knees Constance whispered to Annesley Has she told you anything No said the girl I don t want to know things She might have added Things told by her But she did not say this Constance shivered The woman frightened me with what she knew I mean not about our robbery that s a trifle but about the past That crystal of hers seems to be a sort of Town Topics But I must say she didn t foretell any horrors for the future not for me personally If she goes on as she s begun she can do what she likes with us all Dear little Anne you must ask her often to your house when you re finding your feet and I m helping you in London I prophesy that she ll prove an attraction Why it would pay to have a room fitted up for her in purple and black with relays of fresh lilies Annesley smiled But she made up her mind that if a room were done in purple and black with relays of lilies anywhere for the Countess de Santiago it would not be in her house Unless of course Knight begged it of her as a favour And even then but somehow she didn t believe despite certain appearances that Knight was anxious to have his old friend near him He had the air of one who was paying a debt and she remembered how he had said on the day of their wedding We will find a time to pay back the favours they ve done us This visit and dinner and introduction to society was perhaps his way of paying the Countess Only was it payment in full or an instalment Annesley wondered Vaguely she wondered also what had become of doctor Torrance and the Marchese di Morello Would the next payment be for them and what form would it take She was far from guessing There was no anti climax that night in the success of the Countess with her clients They were deeply impressed and even startled Not one woman said to herself that she had been tricked into giving the seeress a lead There was nothing in the past hidden from that crystal and the dark eyes which gazed into it As for the future her predictions were remarkable and she must have given people flattering accounts of their characters as everyone thought the analysis correct What a pity the women whispered that such an astonishing person was not a professional who could be paid in cash As it was she would expect to be rewarded with invitations and though she was presentable You know my dear she s frightfully pretty the red haired sort that s the most dangerous not a bit safe to have about one s men Still no price is too high We shall all be fighting for her or over her And before the evening had come to an end the Countess de Santiago had had several invitations for town and country houses To be sure they were rather informal But the beautiful lady knew when to be lenient and so she accepted them all She told me that our stolen things are hidden away for ever and that we ll be robbed again Connie said to her husband on the way back to Valley House She told me the same said Dick And I hope to goodness we may be We ve done jolly well out of that last affair Yes his wife agreed The only thing I don t like about it is the mystery It makes me feel as if something might be hanging over one s head Over the trustees heads laughed Lord Annesley Seton I wish the other night could be what the Countess called the first of a series The first of a series Constance repeated What a queer expression What was she talking about She was looking in her crystal answered Dick slowly as if something he had seen rose again before his eyes Constance was pricked with curiosity You might tell me what the woman said she exclaimed You haven t told me what message she had for you I ve just said that she prophesied we should be robbed again That s only one thing What about the rest Oh A lot of stuff which wouldn t interest you You can keep your secret And I ll keep mine remarked Dick Annesley Seton aggravatingly Anyhow for the present We ll see how it works out See how what works out his wife echoed The series CHAPTER XIII THE SERIES GOES ON After all Annesley had not written to her friends Archdeacon Smith and his wife on leaving missus Ellsworth s to tell the surprising news of her engagement She had asked mister Ruthven Smith not to speak of it to his cousins because she would prefer to write But then the putting of the news on paper in a way not to offend them after their kindness in the past had been difficult Besides there had been little time to think out the difficulties and find a way of surmounting them There had been only one whole day before the wedding and that day she had spent with Knight buying her trousseau It had been a wonderful day never to be forgotten but its end had found her tired and when Knight had said good bye and left her she had not been equal to composing a letter Nevertheless she had tried for it had seemed dreadful to marry and go away from London without letting her only friends know what had happened what she was doing and why she had not invited them to her wedding Ah why In explaining that she confronted the great obstacle She had not known how to exonerate herself without hurting their feelings or telling a lie The girl hated lying She could not remember that in her life she had ever spoken or written a lie in so many words though like most people who are not saints she had prevaricated a little occasionally to save herself or others from some unpleasantness In this case no innocent prevarication would serve Even if she had been willing to lie she could think of no excuse which would seem plausible Tired as she had been that last night as Annesley Grayle and throbbing as she was with excitement at the thought of the new life before her she did begin a letter It was a feeble effort She tore it up and essayed another The second was worse than the first and the third was scarcely an improvement Discouraged and so nerve racked that she was on the point of tears the girl put off the attempt But days passed and when no inspiration came and she was still haunted by the thought of a duty undone she compromised by telegraphing from Devonshire Her message ran Dear Friends I beg you to forgive me for seeming neglect but it was not really that I am married to a man I love It had to be sudden I could not let you know in time though I wanted to I shall not be quite happy till I ve seen you and introduced my husband Say to your cousin he may explain as far as he can When we meet will tell you more Coming back to London in fortnight to take house in Portman Square and settle down Love and gratitude always My new name is same as yours Annesley Smith To this she added her address in Devonshire feeling sure that unless the Archdeacon and his wife were hopelessly offended by her neglect and horrified at Ruthven Smith s story they would write She cared for them very much and it would always be a grief she thought that she and Knight had not been married by her old friend Every night she prayed for a letter waking with the hope that the postman might bring one and five days after the sending of her telegram her heart leaped at sight of a fat envelope addressed in missus Smith s familiar handwriting They forgave her That was the principal thing And they rejoiced in her happiness All explanations if dear Annesley wished to make any could wait until they met The kind woman wrote Cousin James Ruthven Smith was loyal to his promise and gave us no hint of your news We did not of course know of the promise till after your telegram came and we showed it to him Then he confessed that he was in your secret that he had been witness of a scene in which poor missus Ellsworth made herself more than usually unpleasant and that you had asked him to let you tell us the glad tidings of your engagement and hasty wedding I say poor missus Ellsworth because it seems she has been ill since you left and has had other misfortunes The illness is not serious and I imagine now I have heard fuller details of her treatment of you that it is merely a liver and nerve attack the result of temper If she had not been confined to bed and very sorry for herself I am sure nothing could have prevented her from writing to us a garbled account of the quarrel and your departure As it turned out I hear she rang up the household after you went that night had hysterics and sent a servant flying for the doctor He a most inferior person according to Cousin James having a sister who is a trained nurse put her in charge of the patient at once where she has remained since In consequence of the nurse s tyrannical ways the servants gave a day s notice and left in a body Three temporary ones were got in as soon as possible from some agency and last night four days I believe after they were installed a burglary was committed in the house Only fancy poor Ruthven He was afraid to stay even with us in our quiet house when he came to London because once years ago we were robbed You know how reticent he is about his affairs and how he never says anything concerning business One might think that to us he would show some of the beautiful jewels he is supposed to buy for the Van Vrecks But no he never mentions them We should not have known why he came to England this time after a shorter interval than usual or that he had valuables in his possession if it had not been for this burglary As he was obliged to talk to the police and describe to them what had been stolen from him I forgot to mention that he as well as missus Ellsworth was robbed but you would have guessed that from my beginning even if you haven t read the morning papers before taking up my letter there was no reason why for once he should not speak freely to us He has been lunching here and has just gone as I write but will transfer himself later to our house as it has now become unbearable for him at missus Ellsworth s I fancy that arrangement has been brought to an end Your presence in the menage was the sole alleviation James it appears came to London on an unexpected mission differing from his ordinary trips You may remember seeing in the papers some weeks ago that an agent of the Van Vreck firm was robbed on shipboard of a lot of pearls and things he was bringing to show an important client in England some Indian potentate James tells us that he procured the finest of the collection for the Van Vrecks and as he is a great expert and can recognize jewels he has once seen even when disguised or cut up or in different settings he was asked to go to London to help the police find and identify some of the lost valuables Also he was instructed to buy more pearls to be sold to the Indian customer instead of those stolen from the agent on shipboard James had not found any of the lost things but he had bought some pearls the day before the burglary at missus Ellsworth s Wasn t it too unlucky I have tried to give the poor fellow a little consolation by reminding him how fortunate it is he hadn t bought more and that the loss will be the Van Vrecks or that of some insurance company not his personally But he cannot be comforted He says that his not having ten thousand pounds worth of pearls doesn t console him for being robbed of eight thousand pounds worth James has little hope that the thieves will be found for he feels that the Van Vrecks are in for a run of bad luck after the good fortune of many years They have lost the head of the firm the great Paul as James calls him who has definitely retired and occupies himself so exclusively with his collection that he takes no interest in the business Then there was the robbery on the ship which in James s opinion must have been the work of a masterly combination And now another theft The poor fellow has quite lost his nerve which as you know has for years not been that of a young man His deafness no doubt partly accounts for the timidity with which he has been afflicted since the first and only other time he was robbed And now he blames it for what happened last night He s trained himself to be a light sleeper and if he could hear as well as other people he thinks the thief would have waked him coming into his room Once in the wretch must have drugged him because the pearls were in a parcel under his pillow But how the man or men got into the house is a mystery unless one of the new servants was an accomplice Nothing was broken open In the morning every door and window was as usual Of course the servants are under suspicion but they seem stupid ordinary people according to James As for missus Ellsworth he says she is making a fuss over the wretched bits of jewellery she lost things of no importance She too slept through the affair and knew what had happened only when she waked to see a safe she has in the wall of her bedroom wide open It seems that in place of her jewel box and some money she kept there was an insulting note announcing that for the first time something belonging to her would be used for a good purpose To James this is the one bright spot in the darkness When Annesley had read this long letter with its many italics she passed it to Knight who in exchange handed her a London newspaper with a page folded so as to give prominence to a certain column It was an account of the burglary at missus Ellsworth s house which he had been reading Generous with money as Nelson Smith was he was not a man who would allow himself to be done and in some ways the Annesley Setons were disappointed in the bargain they arrived at with him He appeared delighted with the chance of getting their London house and of having them come to stay in order to introduce his wife and himself to the brightest most particular stars in the galaxy of their friends Yet when it came to making definite terms he seemed to take it for granted that as the Annesley Setons would be living in the house as guests they would not only be willing but anxious to accept a low price This had not been their intention On the contrary they had meant their visit and social offices to be a great extra favour which ought to raise rather than lower the rent In some mysterious way however without appearing to bargain or haggle Nelson Smith the young millionaire from America made his bride s relatives understand that he was prepared to pay so much and no more That they could take him on his own terms or let him go Terrified therefore lest he and his money should slip out of their hands they snapped at his carelessly made offer without venturing an objection And they realized at the same time in a way equally mysterious and to their own surprise that not they but mister and missus Nelson Smith would be master and mistress of the house in Portman Square If there were ever a clash between wills Nelson Smith s would prevail over theirs How this impression was conveyed to their intelligence they could hardly have explained even to each other The man was so pleasant so careless of finances or conventionalities that not one word or look could be treasured up against him The fellow s a genius Annesley Seton said to Constance when they were talking over the latest phase of the game And they respected him Lady Annesley Seton wished to bring to town the servants including a wonderful butler who had been transferred for economy s sake to Valley House This proposal however Nelson Smith dismissed with a few good natured words He had his eye upon a butler whose brother was a chauffeur Besides it wouldn t be fair to Anita he explained Your servants would scorn to take orders from her and I want her to learn the dignity of a married woman with responsibilities of her own That s the first step toward being the perfect hostess She s the sweetest girl in the world but she s timid and distrustful of herself I want her to know her own worth and then it won t be long before everyone around her knows it There was no answer to this except acquiescence which Dick and Constance were obliged to give They did give it the more readily because they were inclined to suspect a hidden hint a pill between layers of jam If the girl had been transferred from the earth to Mars the new conditions of life could scarcely have been more different from the old than was life in Portman Square married to Nelson Smith from the treadmill as missus Ellsworth s slave companion What the Portman Square experiences of the bride would have been if Knight had allowed the Annesley Setons to begin by ruling it would be dangerous to say But he had taken his stand and without guessing that she owed her freedom of action to her husband s strength of will she revelled in it with a joy so intense that it came close to pain Sometimes if he were within reach she ran to find Knight and hugged him almost fiercely with a passion that surprised herself I m so happy that s all she would explain if he asked What has happened My soul was buried You ve brought it back to life When she said such things Knight smiled and seemed glad He would hold her to him for a minute or kiss her hand like an humble squire with a princess But now and then he looked at her with a wistfulness that was like a question she could not hear because she was deaf She never got any satisfaction though if she asked what the look meant Oh I don t know I was only thinking of you he would answer or some other words of lover language The Annesley Setons first move on the social chessboard was to make use of a pawn or two in the shape of society reporters They knew a few men and women of good birth and no money who lived by writing anonymously for the newspapers These people were delighted to get material for a paragraph or photographs for their editors Connie took her new cousin to the woman photographer who was the success of the moment and as she said to Knight the rest managed itself Meanwhile an application was made to the Lord Chamberlain for missus Nelson Smith s presentation by her cousin Lady Annesley Seton at the first Court of the season It was granted and the bride in white and silver made her bow to their majesties As for Knight he laughingly refused Dick s good offices No levees for me he said I ve lived too long in America and roughed it in too many queer places to take myself seriously in knee breeches Besides they have to know about your ancestors back to the Dark Ages don t they or else they cancel you My father was a good man and a gentleman but who his father was I couldn t tell to save my head My mother was by way of being a swell but she was a foreigner so I can t make use of any of her quarterings even if I could count them Annesley was presented in February and had by that time been settled in Portman Square long enough to have met many of her cousins friends After the Court which launched her in society she and Knight with a list supplied by Connie gave a dinner dance The Countess de Santiago was not asked but soon afterward there was a luncheon entirely for women in American fashion at which the Countess was present When luncheon was over she gave a short lecture on the Science of Palmistry and the Cultivation of Clairvoyant Powers Then there was tea and the Countess allowed herself to be consulted by the guests the dozen most important women of Connie s acquaintance Annesley though she was not able to like the Countess was pleased with the praise lavished upon her both for her looks and her accomplishments that afternoon She had guessed from the beautiful woman s constrained manner when they met at a shop the day after the dinner dance that she was hurt because she had not been invited though why she should expect to be asked to every entertainment which the Nelson Smiths gave Annesley could not see Vaguely distressed however by the flash in the handsome eyes and the curt How do you do the girl appealed to Knight Ought we to have had the Countess de Santiago last evening she asked perching on his knee in the room at the back of the house which he had annexed as a den Certainly not he reassured her promptly All the people were howling swells The Annesley Setons had skimmed the topmost layer of the cream for our benefit and the Countess would have been out of it in such a set unless she d been telling fortunes You can ask her when you ve a crowd of women She ll amuse them and gather glory for herself But I m not going to have her encouraged to think we belong to her We ve set the woman on her feet by what we ve done Now let her learn to stand alone The ladies luncheon was a direct consequence of this speech but complete as was the Countess s success Annesley felt that she was not satisfied that it would take more than a luncheon party of which she was the heroine to content the Countess now that Nelson Smith and his bride had a house and a circle in London Occasionally when she was giving an At Home or a dinner Annesley consulted Knight Shall we ask the Countess was her query and the first time she did this he answered with another question Do you want her for your own pleasure Do you like her better than you did Annesley had to say no to this catechizing whereupon Knight briefly disposed of the subject That settles it We won t have her And so during the next few weeks the Countess de Santiago who had moved from the Savoy Hotel into a charming furnished flat in Cadogan Gardens came to Portman Square only for one luncheon and two or three receptions By this time however she had made friends of her own and if she had cared to accept a professional status she might have raked in a small fortune from her seances She would not take money however preferring social recognition but gifts were pressed upon her by those who though grateful and admiring did not care for the obligation to admit the Countess into their intimacy She took the rings and bracelets and pendants and flowers and fruit and bon bons and books because they were given in such a way that it would have been ungracious to refuse But the givers were the very women whose bosom friend she would have liked to seem in the sight of the world a duchess a countess or a woman distinguished above her sisters for some reason She worked to gain favour and when she had any personal triumph without direct aid from Portman Square she put on an air of superiority over Annesley when they met If she suffered a gentle snub she hid the smart but secretly brooded blaming missus Nelson Smith because she was asked to their house only for big parties or when she was wanted to amuse their friends She blamed Nelson too but womanlike blamed Annesley more Sometimes she determined to put out a claw and draw blood from both but changed her mind remembering that to do them harm she must harm herself Once it occurred to her to form a separate secret alliance with Constance Annesley Seton There were reasons why that might have suited her and she began one day to feel her ground when Connie had telephoned and had come to her flat for advice from the crystal She had seen things which she thought Lady Annesley Seton would like her to see and when the seance was ended in a friendly talk the Countess de Santiago begged Constance to call her Madalena You are my first real friend in England she said Except my cousin Anne Connie amended with a sharp glance from the green gray eyes to see whether Madalena were working up to anything Oh I can t count her said the Countess She doesn t like me She wouldn t have me come near her if it weren t for her husband I am quick to feel things You I believe really do like me a little so I can speak freely to you And you know you can to me But Constance in the slang of her girlhood days wasn t taking any She was afraid that Madalena was trying to draw her into finding fault with her host and hostess in order to repeat what she said with embroideries to Nelson Smith or Annesley She was not a woman to be caught by the subtleties of another and in dread of compromising herself did the Countess de Santiago an injustice If she had ventured any disparaging remarks of Cousin Anne they would not have been repeated The season began early and brilliantly that year for the weather was springlike even in February and people were ready to enjoy everything The one blot on the general brightness was a series of robberies Something happened on an average of every ten or twelve days and always in an unexpected quarter where the police were not looking Among the first to suffer were mister and missus Nelson Smith The Portman Square house was broken into the thief entering a window of the den on the ground floor and making a clean sweep of all the jewellery Knight and Annesley owned except her engagement ring the string of pearls which had been her lover s wedding gift and the wonderful blue diamond on its thin gold chain These things she wore by night as well as day but a gold chain bag a magnificent double rope of pearls a diamond dog collar several rings brooches and bangles which Knight had given her since their marriage all went His pearl studs his watch a present out of Annesley s allowance hoarded for the purpose and a collection of jewelled scarf pins shared the fate of his wife s treasures Unfortunately a great deal of the Annesley Seton family silver went at the same time regretted by Knight far beyond his own losses Dick was inclined to be solemn over such a haul but Constance laughed Who cares she said We ve no children and for my part I m as pleased as Punch that your horrid old third cousins will come into less when we re swept off the board Meanwhile we get the insurance money for loss of use again It s simply splendid And that dear Nelson Smith insists on buying the best Sheffield plate to replace what s gone It s handsomer than the real Neither she nor Dick lost any jewellery though they possessed a little with which they had not had the courage to part And this seemed mysterious to Constance She wondered over it and remembering how the Countess de Santiago had prophesied another robbery for them telephoned to ask if she d be a darling and look again in her crystal Madalena telephoned back I ll expect you this afternoon at four o clock CHAPTER XIV THE TEST Madalena had meant to go out that afternoon but she changed her mind and stopped at home I know what you ve come for she said as she kept Connie s hand in hers It was an effective way she had as if contact with a person helped her to read the condition of that person s mind Do you really exclaimed Constance Why I but you mean you ve guessed what has hap It s not guessing it s seeing answered the Countess I m in one of my psychic moods to day A prophecy of mine has come true No o yes Well in a way you re right In a way you re wrong What is it you see I see that you ve lost something probably last night This morning I waked with the impression I wasn t surprised when you telephoned Now let me go on holding your hand and think I ll shut my eyes I don t need my room and the crystal Yes The impression grows clearer You have lost something But it is not a thing to care about You re glad it s gone You are extraordinary Constance wondered aloud Can you see what I lost and whether it was Dick s or mine or both His said Madalena after shutting her eyes again His And he does not care much either That seems strange But I tell you what I feel You are telling me the truth Constance admitted Now go on tell what was the thing itself and the way we lost it I haven t seen that yet I haven t tried Perhaps I shall be able to in the crystal perhaps not I don t always succeed But it comes to me suddenly that this thing isn t directly or entirely what brought you here Right again O Witch laughed Connie I came to ask you to find out you re so marvellous why I didn t lose other things which I really do value The two women had been standing in the drawing room Lady Annesley Seton s hand still in the Countess s But now without speaking again Madalena led her visitor into the room adjoining which was fitted up much as the room at the Devonshire hotel had been for her first seance The seeress gave herself here at home the same background of purple velvet the floor was carpeted with black and spread with black fur rugs she was never without fragrant white lilies ranged in curious pots along the purple walls but in her own house the appointments were more elaborate and impressive than the temporary fittings she carried about for use when visiting On her table was a cushion of cloth of gold embroidered with amethysts and emeralds the lucky jewels of her horoscope and her gleaming ball of crystal lay like a bright bubble in a shallow cup of solid jet which she told everyone had been given her in India by the greatest astrologer in the world What was the name of this man and when she had visited him in India she did not reveal They sat down at the table she and Constance Annesley Seton opposite each other Madalena unveiled the crystal which was hidden under a covering of black velvet when not in use At first she gazed into the glittering ball in vain and her companion watched her face anxiously It looked marble white and expressionless as that of a statue in the light of seven wax candles grouped together in a silver candelabrum Suddenly as it seemed to Constance s hypnotized stare the statue face came alive It was not the first time that Constance had seen this thrilling change It invariably happened when the crystal began to show a picture and so powerful was its effect on the nerves of the watcher in this silent perfumed room as to give an illusion that she too could see dimly what the seeress saw forming in those transparent depths A man is there Madalena said in a low measured voice as if she were talking in her sleep He is shutting a door It is the front door of a house like yours Yes it is yours There is the number over the door and I recognize the street It is Portman Square He puts a latchkey in his pocket How could he have got the key I do not know Perhaps I could find out but there is no time I must follow him He is hurrying away He carries a heavy travelling bag A closed carriage is coming along not a public one It has been waiting for him I think He gets in and the coachman who is in black drives off very fast They go through street after street I can t be sure where It seems to be north they are going There s a park Regent s Park maybe I don t know London well The carriage is stopping before a closed house in a quiet street There is a little garden in front and a high wall The man opens the gate and walks in The carriage drives off The coachman must know where to go for no word is said Someone inside the house is waiting He lets the man with the bag into a dark hallway Now he shuts the door and goes into a room There is a light The first man puts the bag on a table it is a dining table The other man much older watches The first one takes things out of the bag Oh a great deal of beautiful silver I have seen it at your house And there are other things a string of pearls and a lot of jewellery He pours it out of a brown handkerchief on to the table But still the second man is not pleased I think he is asking why there isn t more The first man explains He makes gestures So does the other They are quarrelling The man who brought the bag is afraid of the older one He apologizes He seems to be talking about something that he will do He goes to a mantelpiece in the room and points to a calendar He touches a date with his forefinger What date Lady Annesley Seton cried out It was forbidden to speak to the seeress in the midst of a vision but Constance forgot in the strain of her excitement The Countess gave a gasp fell back in her chair and put her hands over her eyes Oh she stammered as though she awoke from sleep How my head aches It is all gone I m so sorry Constance apologized It began to seem so real I thought I was in that room with you You are unaccountable You couldn t know what happened Yet you have been seeing the thief who stole our silver last night and the Nelson Smiths jewellery but no jewellery of ours That is the strange part of the affair for I have a few things I adore and they would have been easy to find You didn t even know we had been robbed did you No of course not said the Countess I am sorry Was it in the papers It will be this evening and to morrow morning But the police must hear about this vision of yours the vision of the man with the latchkey It may help them You must not tell the police Madalena said I have warned you all that if you talked too much about me and my crystal the police might hear and take notice There are such stupid laws in England I may be doing something against them If you or Lord Annesley Seton speak of me to the police I will go away and you will never hear more of my visions as you call them in future Unless you promise that you will let the police find the thieves in their own way without dragging me in I shall be so unnerved that my eyes will be darkened Oh I promise if you feel so strongly about it said Constance I didn t realize that it might do you harm to be mentioned to the police She wished very much to have Madalena go on looking in the crystal She had been excited carried out of herself for a few minutes but she had not heard what she had come to hear why she had been spared the loss of her personal treasures The desired promise hurriedly made the Countess gave her attention once more to the crystal For a time she could see nothing The mysterious current had been severed by the diversion and had slowly to be rewoven by the seeress s will I can see only dimly Madalena said It was clear before I cannot tell you why the things you care for were left Something new is coming It seems that this time I am looking ahead into the future The picture is blurred like a badly developed photograph The thing I see has still to materialize Where whispered Constance thrilled by the thought that some event on its way to her down the unknown path of futurity was casting a shadow into the crystal Where I see a beautiful room There are a number of people there men and women You are with them and Lord Annesley Seton and Nelson Smith and your cousin Anne I know most of the faces not all Everyone is excited Something has happened They are talking it over Now I see the room more clearly It is as if a light were turned on in the crystal Oh it is what you call the Chinese drawing room at Valley House I know why the room lights up and why I see everything so much more clearly It is because I myself am coming into the picture The people want me to tell them the meaning of the thing that has happened It seems that I know about it I do not hesitate to answer It must be that I have been consulting the crystal for I seem sure of what I say to them I point toward the door or is it at something on the wall or is it a person Ah the picture is gone from the crystal How irritating cried Lady Annesley Seton who felt that supernatural forces ought to be subject to her convenience Can t you make it come back if you concentrate Madalena shook her head No it will not come back I am sure of that because when the crystal clouds as if milk were pouring into it I know that I shall never see the same picture again Whether it is a cross current in myself or the crystal I cannot tell but it amounts to the same thing I am sorry It is useless to try any more Shall we go to the other room and have tea Constance did not persist as she wished to do She had to take the Countess s word that further effort would be useless but she felt thwarted as if the curtain had fallen by mistake in the middle of an act and the characters on the stage had availed themselves of the chance to go home It was vexatious enough that Madalena had not been able to explain the mystery of last night But this was ten times more annoying Am I not to know the end of the act she asked as her hostess poured tea The latter shrugged her shoulders as if to shake off responsibility Ah I cannot tell Perhaps if She stopped and handed her guest a cup Perhaps if what Oh nothing Madalena tasted her own tea and put in more cream Do tell me what you were going to say dear Countess unless you want me to die of curiosity I should be sorry to have you do that smiled Madalena But if I said what I was going to say you might misunderstand You might think I was asking for an invitation Instantly Constance s mind unveiled the other s meaning There was to be an Easter party at Valley House a very smart party The Countess de Santiago wished to be a member of it Lady Annesley Seton shrewd as she was had a vein of superstition running through her nature and though one side of that nature said that the scene with the crystal had been arranged for this end the other side held its belief in the vision You mean she said that if you should be at Valley House when the thing happens and we are puzzled and upset about it you might be able to help The fancy passed through my head It was the picture in the crystal suggested it Madalena explained Do have an eclair Face and voice expressed indifference but Constance knew that the other had set her heart on being at Valley House for Easter and there was really no visible reason why she shouldn t be there People liked her well enough she was never a bore Well you must be in at the death with the rest of us Lady Annesley Seton assured her Of course though it s my house this Easter party is practically the Nelson Smiths affair You know what poverty stricken wretches we are They are paying all expenses and taking the servants so I suppose I am bound to go through the form of consulting Anne before I ask even you Still Madalena s eyes flamed Consult your cousin s husband she said It is only he who counts As a favour to me speak to him Constance smiled at the other over her teacup with a narrowed gaze Why shouldn t I speak to them together Because I want to know what to think If he says no it will be a test Very well so be it said Constance making light of what she knew was somehow serious I ll tackle Nelson alone without Anne That is all I want And if I am asked to be of your party I think I can t tell why but I feel it strongly that everybody may have some reason for being glad It seemed unlikely there would be a chance for a talk that evening as Nelson Smith was dining at one of the clubs he had joined The other three members of the household were to have a hasty dinner and go to the first performance of a new play a play in which Knight was not interested Afterward they expected to sup at the Savoy with the friend who had asked them to her box at the theatre but the box was empty save for themselves While they wondered a messenger brought a note of regret Sudden illness had kept their would be hostess in her room Without her the supper was considered not worth while The play had run late and the trio voted for home and bed If Nelson has come I ll try and have a word with him to night after all thought Constance provided I can keep my promise by getting Anne out of the way Then I can phone to Madalena early in the morning yes or no and put her out of her suspense No such luck though as that he will have got back from his club He had got back however The entrance hall was in twilight when Dick Annesley Seton let them into the house with his latchkey for all the electric lights save one were turned off That one was shaded with red silk and in the ruddy glow it was easy to see the line of light under the door of the den Annesley noticed it but made no comment Knight never asked her to join him in the den but alluded to it as an untidy place a mere work room which he kept littered with papers and only the new butler Charrington was allowed to straighten its disorder This of course was not butler s business but Knight said the footmen were stupid and Charrington had been persuaded or bribed into performing the duty Annesley s life of suppression had made her shy of putting herself forward and though Knight had never told her that she would be a disturbing element in the den his silence had bolted the door for her Constance however was not so fastidious Oh look she said before Dick had time to switch on another light Nelson s got tired of his club and come home As she spoke almost as if she had willed it the door opened But it was not Knight who came out It was the younger Charrington the chauffeur called Char to distinguish him from his solemn elder brother the butler The red haired red faced black eyed young man stopped suddenly at sight of the newcomers He had evidently expected to find the hall untenanted Taking up his stand before the door he barred the way with his tall liveried figure and it struck Constance that he looked aggressive as if had he dared he would have shut the door again almost in her face I beg your pardon madame he said in so loud a voice that it was like a warning to his master that an intruder might be expected It occurred to her also for the first time that his accent sounded rather American and he had forgotten to address her as my lady This was odd for his brother was the most typical British butler imaginable as Nelson had remarked soon after the two servants had been engaged She stared surprised but Char still kept the door until his master showed himself in the lighted aperture Then the chauffeur saluting courteously stepped aside Funny that he should be here thought Constance She might have been malicious enough to imagine that Nelson Smith had drunk too heavily at his club and had been helped into the house by Char who wished to protect him until the last but he was unmistakably his usual self cool and more than ordinarily alert Oh how do you do he exclaimed I heard Char say Madame and thought it was Anita at the door No she has gone upstairs explained Lady Annesley Seton So has Dick I alone had courage to linger I feel like Fatima with the blood stained key in Bluebeard s house you are such a bear about this den you really are you know I didn t expect you three so soon said Knight calmly If I d known you had a curiosity to see Bluebeard s Chamber I d have had it smartened up As it is I shouldn t dare let you peep You the mistress of the house before we took it over would be critical of the state I delight to keep it in Untidiness is my one fault I ll put off the visit till a more propitious hour Constance reassured him if you ll spare me a moment in the hall It s only a word about Madalena She has asked me to call her that The Countess de Santiago Knight questioned smiling He closed the door of the den and came out into the hall turning on still another of the lights Yes I ve been to see her to day Will you believe it she saw the whole affair of last night in her crystal and the thief and everything Oh indeed did she How intelligent But she says we mustn t mention her name to the police She d be lumped with common or garden palmists and fortune tellers I suppose Yes that s what she fears But she wants to be in our Devonshire house party at Easter to save us from something Knight looked interested Save us from what She couldn t see it distinctly in the crystal He laughed She could see distinctly that she wanted to be there Well we hadn t thought of having her She seemed out of the picture with the lot who are coming the Duchess of Peebles for instance But we ll think it over Why don t you ask Anita It occurs to me that she is the one to be consulted Now was the moment for Madalena s test The Countess wished me to speak to you alone and let you decide Probably because you re such an old friend I think she feels that Anita doesn t care for her Knight s face hardened She gave you that impression did she Yet thinking Anita doesn t like her and she s nearly right she wants to come all the same She wants to presume on my er friendship to force herself on my wife Jove I guess that s a little too strong It s time we showed the fair Madalena her place don t you think so Lady A What precisely is her place Connie laughed Well she seems determined to push herself into the foreground My idea is that what artists call middle distance is better suited to her colouring Seriously I resent her putting you up to appeal to me over Anita s head I m not taking any Please tell her or write or phone or whatever you ve arranged to do that we re both sorry say both please that we don t feel justified in persuading you to add her to the list of guests this time as Valley House will be full up She will be hurt objected Constance I m inclined to think she deserves to be hurt Oh well if you ve made up your mind But she s a charming woman of course Still I shouldn t wonder if there s something of the tigress in her and she could give a nasty dig Let her try said Knight In the morning Constance telephoned to the flat in Cadogan Gardens She had not long to wait for an answer to her call The Countess was evidently expecting to hear from her early in the day He wasn t in the right mood I m afraid when I spoke to him Connie temporized He seemed to resent your wish to to as he expressed it get at him over Anne s head That is what I wanted to be sure of Madalena answered Now I know CHAPTER XV NELSON SMITH AT HOME The Countess de Santiago took her defeat like a soldier But her line both of attack and defence was of the sapping and mining order Once she had cared as deeply as it was in her to care for the man known to London as Nelson Smith He was of the type which calls forth intense feeling in others Men liked him immensely or disliked him extremely Women admired him fervently or detested him cordially It was not possible to regard him with indifference His personality was too magnetic to leave his neighbours cold and as a rule it was only those whom he wished to keep at a distance who disliked him As for Madalena de Santiago for a time she had enjoyed thinking herself in love There were reasons she knew why she could not hope to be the man s wife and if he had chosen a plain woman to help him on in the world she would have made no objection to his marriage But at first sight she had realized that Annesley Grayle shy and unconscious of power to charm as she was might be dangerous Madalena had anxiously watched the two together and at breakfast the day before the wedding she had distrusted the light in the man s eyes as he looked at the girl It had seemed incredible that he should be in love with a creature so pale so formless still in character as Annesley appeared to Madalena that a man like Don should be caught by a pair of gray eyes and a softness which was only the beauty of youth Still the Countess had been made to suffer and if she could have found a way to prevent the marriage without alienating her friend she would have seized it But she could think of no way except to drop a sharp reminder of what Don owed to her The hint had been unheeded The marriage had taken place and Madalena had been obliged to play the part of the bride s friend and chaperon Afterward to be sure she had been paid Her reward had come in the shape of invitations and meetings with desirable people Nelson Smith s marriage had given her a place in the world and at first her success consoled her Soon however the pain of jealousy overcame the anodyne She could not rest she was forever asking herself whether Don were glad of her success for her own sake or because it distracted her attention from him Was he falling in love with his wife or was his way of looking at the girl of speaking to the girl only an intelligent piece of acting in the drama Once or twice Madalena tried being cavalier in her manner to Annesley she dared not be actually rude and Nelson Smith appeared not to notice but afterward the offender was punished by missing some invitation This might have been taken as the proof for which she searched could she have been sure where lay the responsibility for the slight whether on the shoulders of Annesley or of Annesley s husband Madalena strove to make herself believe that the fault was the girl s But she could not decide Sometimes she flattered her vanity that Annesley was trying to keep her away from Don Again she would wrap herself in black depression as in a pall believing that the man was seeking an excuse to put her outside the intimacy of his life Then she burned for revenge upon them both yet her hands were tied Her fate seemed to be bound up with the fate of Nelson Smith and evil which might threaten his career would overwhelm hers also She spent dark moments in striving to plan some brilliant yet safe coup which would ruin him and Annesley in case she should find out that he had tired of her At last by much concentration her mind developed an idea which appeared feasible She saw a thing she might do without compromising herself But first she must be certain where the blame lay Constance Annesley Seton s explanation over the telephone left her little doubt of the truth She had the self control to answer quietly then when she had hung up the receiver she let herself go to pieces She raged up and down the room swearing in Spanish tears tracing red stains on her magnolia complexion She dashed a vase full of flowers on the floor and felt a fierce thrill as it crashed to pieces That is you Michael Donaldson she cried Like this I will break you That girl shall curse the hour of your meeting She shall wish herself back in the house of the old woman where she was a servant And you can do nothing nothing to hurt me Later that morning when she had composed herself Madalena wrote a letter to Lady Annesley Seton My Kind Friend I am sorry that I may not be with you for Easter and sorry for the reason I can read between the lines But that does not interest you Myself I can do no more for your protection in the unknown danger which threatens but again I am in one of those psychic moods when I have glimpses of things beyond the veil It comes to me that if the Archdeacon friend of your cousin could be asked to join your house party with his wife and especially with his relative who is so rare a judge of jewels is not his name Ruthven Smith trouble might be prevented This is vague advice But I cannot be more definite because I am saying these things under guidance I am not responsible nor can I explain why the message is sent I feel that it is important But you must not mention that it comes from me Nelson and his wife would resent that and the scheme would fall to the ground Write and tell me what you do I shall not be easy in my mind until your house party is over May all go well Yours gratefully and affectionately Madalena P S Better speak of having the Smiths to missus Nelson not her husband He might refuse Archdeacon Smith and his wife and their cousin Ruthven Smith were the last persons on earth in whom Constance would have expected the Countess de Santiago to interest herself All the more therefore was Lady Annesley Seton ready to believe in a supernatural influence Madalena s request to be kept out of the affair would have meant nothing to her had she not agreed that the Nelson Smiths would object to the Countess s dictation Constance proposed the Smith family as guests in a casual way to Annesley when they were out shopping together saying that it would be nice for Anne to have her friends at Valley House The Archdeacon wouldn t be able to come said Annesley Easter is a busy time for him and missus Smith wouldn t leave him to go into the country What a dear old fashioned wife laughed Connie Well what about their cousin that mister Ruthven Smith who used to stay at your gorgon s till our friends the burglar band called on him There are things in Valley House which would interest an expert in jewels And you ve never asked him to anything have you Oh yes said Annesley he s been invited every time I ve asked the Archdeacon and missus Smith but he always refused saying he was too deaf and too dull for dinner parties I m sure he would hate a house party far worse Why not give the poor man a chance to decide Constance persisted He must be a nervous wreck since the burglary A change ought to do him good Besides he would love Valley House If you like to make a wager I ll bet you something that he d jump at the invitation Annesley refused the wager but she agreed that it would be nice to have all three of the Smiths Constance was supposed to be hostess in her own house though Knight was responsible for the financial side of the Easter plan and it was for her to ask the guests even those chosen by the Nelson Smiths Remembering Madalena s hint that Nelson might refuse to add Ruthven Smith s name to the list Connie gave Annesley no time to consult her husband While her companion was being fitted for a frock at Harrod s Lady Annesley Seton availed herself of the chance to write two letters one to missus Smith inviting her and the Archdeacon another to Ruthven saying that she wrote at dear Anne s express wish as well as her own She added cordially on her own account I have heard so much of you from Anne that it would be a pleasure to show you the Valley House treasures which I think you would appreciate Do come She stamped her letters and slipped them into the box at the Harrod post office before going to see if Anne were ready Nothing more was said about the invitation for the Smiths until that evening at dinner when it occurred to Annesley to mention it Knight had come home late just in time to dress and she had not thought to speak of the house party Oh Knight she said Cousin Constance proposed asking the Archdeacon and his wife and mister Ruthven Smith I m sure the Archdeacon can t come but mister Ruthven might perhaps Oh I don t think I d have him with a lot of people he doesn t know and who don t want to know him Knight vetoed the idea He s clever in his way but it s not a social way Among the lot we re going to have he d be like an owl among peacocks But he d love their jewels Annesley persevered They ll bring some of the most beautiful ones in England You said so yourself I m thinking more of their pleasure than his said Knight He s deaf as well as dull The peacocks are invited already and the owl isn t so I m afraid he is When Anne agreed that she d like to have the Smiths I wrote at once and by this time they ve got my letters Constance broke in with a pretence at penitence Oh dear I have put my foot into it with the best intentions What shall we do Nothing said Knight If they ve been asked they must come if they want to I doubt if they will That doubt was dispelled with the morning post missus Smith was full of regrets for herself and the Archdeacon but Ruthven accepted in his precise manner with much pleasure and gratitude for so kind an attention The matter was settled and Connie telephoned to Madalena No Archdeacon no missus Archdeacon But I ve bagged the jewel man Will he be strong enough alone to spread over us that mantle of mysterious protection your crystal showed you I hope so the Countess answered Yet the woman at the other end of the wire thought the voice sounded dull and was disappointed even vaguely anxious Her anxiety would have increased if she could have seen the face of the seeress Now that the match was close to the fuse Madalena had a wild impulse to draw back It was not too late Nothing irrevocable had been done Ruthven Smith s acceptance of the invitation to Valley House would mean only a few days of boredom for his fellow guests unless she herself made the next move in the game Before she decided to make it she resolved to see the man of whom she thought as Michael Donaldson So far nothing had happened to raise any visible barrier between them She was not supposed to know that he did not want her to join the Easter house party and he and she and Annesley were on friendly terms It would be easy for her to see Don to see him alone if she could only choose the right time unless There was an unless but she thought the face of the butler would settle it There were certain times on certain days when Nelson Smith was at home for certain people These days were not those when Annesley and Constance were at home In fact they had been chosen purposely in order not to clash The American millionaire had from his first appearance in London interested himself in more than one charitable society Representatives of these associations called upon him during appointed hours and were shown straight to his den Indeed they were the only persons welcomed there but the Countess de Santiago had some reason to expect that an exception might be made in her favour Luckily the day when she heard the news from Lady Annesley Seton was one of the two days in the week when Nelson Smith was certain not to be out of the house in the afternoon Luckily also she knew that his wife was equally certain to be absent Anita was going to play bridge at a house where Madalena was invited She got her maid to telephone an excuse the Countess had a bad headache Had she said heartache it would have been nearer the truth But one does not tell the truth in these matters Not for years not since the strenuous times when Don had saved her from serious trouble and put her on the road to success had Madalena de Santiago been so unhappy Whichever way she looked she saw darkness ahead yet she hoped something from her talk with Don just what she did not specify to herself in words but something I wish to see mister Nelson Smith on important business she said looking the butler straight in the eyes It was he who opened the door of the Portman Square house on the charity days He gave her back look for look losing the air of respectable servitude and suddenly becoming a human being mister Smith is not alone he answered contriving to give some special meaning to the ordinary words which made them almost cryptic But I think he will be free before long if you care to wait madame and I will mention that you are here You must say it is important she impressed upon him as she was ushered into a little reception room A few minutes later Charrington took her to the door of the den where Knight received her with casual cheerfulness This is an unexpected pleasure he said Don t let us bother with conventionalities Don she exclaimed her emotion showing itself in petulance I had to come and have an understanding with you An understanding Knight was very calm so calm that she who knew him in many phases was stung with the conviction that he needed to ask no questions He was temporizing and her anger passionate unavailing anger beating itself like waves on the rock of his strong nature broke out in tears You know what I mean She choked on the words You re tired of me There s nothing more I can do for you and so and so oh Don say I m wrong Say it s a mistake Say it s not you but she who doesn t want me She s jealous Only say that It s all I want Just to know it is not you who are so cruel after the past Knight remained unmoved He looked straight at her frowning What past he inquired blankly You ask me that you We have never been anything to one another Knight said Not even friends You know that as well as I do We ve been valuable to each other after a fashion I to you you to me and we can be the same in future if you don t choose to play the fool She was cowed and hated herself for being cowed hated Knight too What do you call playing the fool she asked Behaving as you re behaving now and as you ve been behaving these last few weeks I m not blind you know You have been trying your power over me I suppose that s what you d call the trick Well my dear Madalena it won t work I hoped you might realize that without making a scene but you wouldn t You ve brought this on yourself and there s nothing for it now but a straight talk My wife is not jealous It s not in her to be jealous If she doesn t like you Madalena it s instinctive mistrust I don t think she s even seen the claws sticking out of the velvet But I have I ve seen exactly what you are up to You talk about our past You want to force my hand You expect me because I ve been a decent pal and paid what I thought was due to pay higher a fancy price I won t My wife had no hand in keeping you out of the Easter house party It was I who said you weren t to be asked You had to be taught that you couldn t dictate terms You wouldn t take no for an answer so the lesson had to be more severe than I meant Now we understand each other I doubt it cried Madalena You mean I don t understand you I think I do my friend And I m not afraid If I m not a white angel certainly you re not We re tarred with the same brush Forget this afternoon if you like and I ll forget it We can go back to where we were before But only on the promise that you ll be sensible No cat scratchings No mysteries It was all that the Countess de Santiago could do to bite back the threat which alone could have given her relief Yet she did bite it back Her triumph would be incomplete in ruining the man if he could not know that he owed his punishment to her But she must be satisfied with the second best thing She dared not put him on his guard and she dared not let him guess that she meant to strike He would wonder perhaps when the blow fell and say to himself Can Madalena have done this She must so act that his answer would be No It s an accident of fate Knight was not the sort of man who for a mere wandering suspicion without an atom of proof would pull a woman down And there would be no proof You are not kind was the only response she ventured And you are not just I did not want to scratch I would not injure you for the world even if I could Yet it does hurt to think our friendship in the past has meant nothing to you when it has meant so much to me It hurts But I must bear it I shall not trouble you about my feelings again If she had hoped that her meekness might make him relent she was disappointed He merely said Very good We ll go back to where we were That same evening Madalena wrote to Ruthven Smith She took pains to disguise her handwriting and not satisfied with that precaution went out in a taxi and posted the letter in Hampstead It was a short letter and it had no signature but it made an impression on Ruthven Smith CHAPTER XVI WHY RUTHVEN SMITH WENT Never in his life had Ruthven Smith been blessed or cursed by an anonymous letter He did not know what to make of it or how to treat it Instead of exciting him as it might had he been a man of mercurial temperament it irritated him intensely That was the way when things out of the ordinary happened to Ruthven Smith he resented them He was not and recognized the fact that he was not the type of man to whom things ought to happen It was only one strange streak of the artistic in his nature which made him a marvellous judge of jewels and attracted adventures to come near him He was constitutionally timid He was conventional and prim in his thoughts of life and all he desired it to give He was a creature of a past generation and whenever in time he had chanced to exist he would always have lagged a generation behind But there was that one colourful streak which somehow as if by a mistake in creation had shot a narrow rainbow vein through his drab soul like a glittering opal in gray brown rock He loved jewels He had known all about them by instinct even before he knew by painstaking research He could judge jewels and recognize them under any disguise of cutting He could do this better than almost any one in the world and he could do nothing else well therefore it was preordained that he should find his present position with some such firm as the Van Vrecks and being in it adventures were bound to come Many attempts to rob him had doubtless been made One had lately succeeded His nerves were in a wretched state He was jumpy by day as well as night and sometimes when at his worst he even felt for five minutes at a time that he had better hand in his resignation to the firm who had employed him for nearly twenty years and retire into private life like a harried mouse into its hole But that was only when he was at his very worst Deep down within him he was aware that while the breath of life and his inscrutable genius were together in him he could not would not resign It was part of Ruthven Smith an intimate part of him not to be able to decide for a long time what to do when he was confronted with one of those emergencies unsuited to his temperament He was afraid of doing the wrong thing yet was too reserved to consult any one He generally counted on blundering through somehow and so it was in the matter of the anonymous letter He had heard and dimly believed that it was morally wrong and still worse quite bad form to take notice of anonymous letters But this one must be different it seemed to him from any other which anybody had ever received Duty to his employers and duty to the one thing he really loved was above any other duty and for fear of losing forever an immense an unhoped for advantage which might possibly be gained he dared not ignore the letter At all events he had told himself no matter what he might decide later it was just as well that he had accepted the invitation to Valley House Perhaps someone he could not think who was playing a stupid practical joke with the object of getting him there But he would risk that and go and let his conduct shape itself according to developments For instance if his eyes were able to detect the small detail mysteriously mentioned in the letter he would feel bound to act as it suggested yes bound to act but how unpleasant it would be And the worst of the whole unpalatable affair was that if he did act in that suggested way and if he accomplished what he might with dreadful deftness be supposed to accomplish it would be the moment when perhaps he might be fooled If the letter were written by a practical joker he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of all who were in the secret And that thought brought him back to the question which over and over he asked in his mind Who could have written the anonymous letter It must be someone acquainted with him or with his profession someone who knew the Nelson Smiths and the Annesley Setons well enough to be aware that there was to be an Easter party at Valley House The writer hinted in vague terms that he was a private detective aware of certain things yet so placed that he could have no handling of the affair except from a distance and through another person He pretended a disinterested desire to serve Ruthven Smith and signed himself A Well Wisher but the nervous recipient of the advice felt that his correspondent was quite likely to be of the class opposed to detectives What if there were some scheme for a robbery on a vast scale at Valley House and this letter were part of the scheme What if the band of thieves supposed to be working lately in London should try to make him a cat s paw in bringing off their big haul This was a terrifying idea and more feasible than the one suggested by the anonymous writer that missus Nelson Smith should oh certainly it seemed the wildest nonsense Still there was his duty to the Van Vrecks They must be considered ahead of everything So Ruthven Smith nervous as a rabbit who has lost its warren travelled down to Devonshire on Saturday afternoon invited to stay at Valley House till Tuesday It was as Knight had said the dull deaf man was as completely out of the picture in that house party as an owl among peacocks for he was an inarticulate person and could not talk interestingly even on his own subject jewels His idea of conversation with women was a discussion of the weather contrasting that of England with that of America or perhaps touching upon politics He was afraid of questions about jewels lest he should allow himself to be pumped and the information he might inadvertently give away be somehow used But he was by birth and education a gentleman and his relationship to Archdeacon Smith whom everybody liked was a passport to people s kindness Duchesses and countesses were of no particular interest to Ruthven Smith but their adornments were fascinating At Valley House one duchess and several countesses were assembled for the Easter party and they were women whose jewels were famous Most of these were family heirlooms but their present owners had had the things reset and no queen of fairyland or musical comedy could have owned more becoming or exquisitely designed tiaras crowns necklaces earrings dog collars brooches bracelets and rings than these great ladies For this reason the ladies themselves were interesting to Ruthven Smith and he might have been equally so to them if he would have told them picturesquely all he knew about the history of their wonderful diamonds pearls emeralds and rubies It was too bad that he wouldn t for there was not a famous jewel in England or Europe of which Ruthven Smith had not every ancient scandal in connection with it at his tongue s end But on his tongue s end it stayed even when for the sake of his own pleasure if nothing else his hosts and hostesses tried to draw him out Nevertheless he was not sorry that he had come There was an element of joy in seeing met together and sparkling together those exquisite historic beauties of which he had read It had been a bother to Lady Annesley Seton and her cousin Anne to decide how Ruthven Smith should be put at table In a way he was an outsider the only one among the guests without a title or military rank which mechanically indicated his place in relation to others Besides no woman would want to have him to scream at Fortunately however there were two women asked on account of their husbands and so according to Connie s code of no importance in themselves Providence meant them to be pushed here and there like pawns on a chessboard and they were pushed to either side of Ruthven Smith at the dinner table on Saturday night Both had been placated by being told beforehand what a wonderful man he was with frightfully exciting things to say if he could tactfully be made to say them But only one of the two had courage or spirit to rise to the occasion the woman he was given to take in a Lady Cartwright married to Major Sir Elmer Cartwright who was always asked to every house whenever the Duchess of Peebles was invited Lady Cartwright was Irish wrote plays had a sense of humour and was not jealous of the Duchess Because she wrote plays she was continually in search of material digging it up even when it looked unpromising I have heard such charming things about you she began I beg your pardon said Ruthven Smith unable to believe his ears And because he was somewhat deaf himself he could not gauge the inflections of his own voice Sometimes he spoke almost in a whisper sometimes very loudly This time he spoke loudly and several people surprised at the sound rising above other sounds like spray from a flowing river paused for an instant to listen What a wonderful expert in jewels you are Lady Cartwright replied in a higher tone realizing that she had a deaf man to deal with And that you have been one of the sufferers from that gang of thieves Scotland Yard can t lay its hands on Ruthven Smith was on the point of shrinking into himself as was his wont if any personal topic of conversation came up when it flashed into his mind that here was an opportunity If he did not take it so easy a one might not occur again He braced himself for a supreme effort Oh yes yes I was robbed he admitted A serious loss Some fine pearls I had been buying not for myself but for the Van Vrecks I seldom collect valuables for myself I only wish these things had been mine I should not have that sense of being an unfaithful servant though I did my best Of course you did Lady Cartwright soothed him But these thieves if it s the same gang as we all think are too clever for the cleverest of us As for the police they seem to be nowhere I haven t suffered yet but each morning when I wake up I m astonished to find everything as usual Not that it wouldn t seem as usual even if the gang had paid us a visit and made a clean sweep of our poor possessions They appear to be able to leak through keyholes as nothing in the houses they go to is ever disturbed Anyhow they have latchkeys retorted Ruthven Smith with what for him might be considered gaiety of manner The thief or thieves who relieved me of my pearls or rather my employer s pearls apparently walked in as a member of the household might have done Among those who had involuntarily suspended talk to hear what Ruthven Smith was saying about jewels and jewel thieves was Annesley Though the party would never have been but for Knight and herself Dick and Constance were playing host and hostess with all the outward responsibility of those parts Lord Annesley Seton had a duchess on his right a countess on his left Lady Annesley Seton was fenced in by the duke and the count pertaining to these ladies missus Nelson Smith sat between two less important men who liked the dinner provided by the American millionaire s miraculous new chef and they could safely be neglected for a moment Annesley felt that Ruthven Smith was in a way her special guest and she was anxious that he should not be the failure Knight had prophesied She wanted him not to regret that he had flung himself on the tender mercies of this smart house party and almost equally she wanted his two neighbours not to be bored by him Knight would hate that He attached so much importance to amusing the people whom he invited She listened and thought that mister Ruthven Smith and Lady Cartwright seemed to have begun well Then as she turned to Lady Cartwright s handsome husband the Duchess of Peebles was talking to Dick Annesley Seton just then she caught the word latchkey It seized her attention She knew they were speaking of the burglary at missus Ellsworth s house She heard Ruthven Smith go on to explain in his high pitched voice that the two woman servants had been suspected but that their characters had emerged stainless from the examination Besides he continued neither of them had a latchkey to give to any outside person The two women slept together in one room At the time of the robbery there was no butler Annesley heard no more Suddenly the door of her spirit seemed to close She was shut up within herself listening to some voice there What became of your latchkey it asked The blood streamed to her face and made her ears tingle as it used to do when she had been scolded by missus Ellsworth If any one had looked at her then it must have been to wonder what Sir Elmer Cartwright or Lord John Dormer had said to make missus Nelson Smith blush so furiously She was remembering what she had done with her latchkey She had given it to Knight to open the front door and so escape from the two watchers who had followed them in a taxi to Torrington Square She had never thought of it from that moment to this Could it be possible that some thief had stolen the latchkey from Knight and used it when missus Ellsworth s house was robbed Her thoughts concentrated violently upon the key Had her neighbours spoken she would not have heard but they did not speak She was free to let her thoughts run where they chose They ran back to the first night of her meeting with Nelson Smith and her arrival with him at the house in Torrington Square She recalled as if it were a moment ago putting the key into his hand which had been warm and steady despite the danger he was in while hers had been trembling and cold She said to herself that she must ask Knight as soon as they were alone together what he had done with the key whether he had left it in the house or flung it away But of course he must have left it in the house or close by otherwise no thief would have known where it belonged That made her feel guilty toward Ruthven Smith She ought not to have been so utterly absorbed in her own affairs that night She ought to have asked to have the key back and then to have laid it where it could be found by missus Ellsworth in the morning Perhaps indirectly she was responsible for the burglary at that house And now she thought of it what a queer burglary it had been The thieves must certainly have known something about missus Ellsworth or else in helping themselves to her valuables it would not have occurred to them to scrawl a sarcastic message That message had delighted Knight when he heard of it He had laughed and said I like those chaps They can have my money when they want it Since then they had had his money and other possessions If the theory of the police were right that a gang of foreign thieves was working London Annesley was glad that she and Knight had been robbed It made her feel less to blame for her carelessness in the matter of that latchkey At least she had suffered too and so had Knight Could it be she asked herself that the watchers were somehow mixed up in the business Were they members of the supposed gang That did not seem likely for how could a man like Knight have got involved with thieves Yet it seemed from what he had said that night at the Savoy and never referred to again as if he were somehow in their power How curiously like one of them Morello had been She remembered thinking so with a shock of fear Then she had lost the feeling of resemblance and told herself that she must have imagined it The two faces came back to her now and again she saw them alike She was glad that Knight had never invited Morello to call and glad that when grudgingly she had asked one day after the two men who had witnessed their marriage Knight had said Gone out of England We just caught them in time As for the watchers she had heard no more of them Knight ignored the episode or the part of it connected with those men The memory of them was shut up in the locked box of his past and he never left the key lying about as apparently he had left the key of missus Ellsworth s house Suddenly while Annesley listened to Ruthven Smith she became conscious that as he talked to Lady Cartwright his eyes had turned to her This proves the fancy ran through her head that if you look at or even think of people you attract their attention She glanced away and at her neighbours They were both absorbed for the moment she need not worry lest they should find her neglectful She took some asparagus which was offered to her and began to eat it but she still had the impression that Ruthven Smith was looking at her She wondered why He can t be expecting me to scream at him across the table she thought Yes he was saying to Lady Cartwright it was a misfortune to lose those pearls Two I had selected to make a pair of earrings can scarcely be duplicated But none of the things stolen from me compared in value to those our agent lost on board the Monarchic I suppose you read of that affair Oh yes said Lady Cartwright her voice raised in deference to her neighbour s deafness It was most interesting Especially about the clairvoyant woman on board who saw a vision of the thief in her crystal throwing things into the sea attached to a life belt with a light on it or something of the sort to be picked up by a yacht One would have supposed with that information to go upon the police might have recovered the jewels but they didn t and probably they never will now I m not sure the police pinned their faith to the clairvoyante s visions replied Ruthven Smith with his dry chuckle Really But I ve understood though the name wasn t mentioned then I believe that the woman was that wonderful Countess de Santiago we re so excited about She is certainly extraordinary Nobody seems to doubt her powers I rather thought she might be here Ruthven Smith showed no interest in the Countess de Santiago Once on the subject of jewels it was difficult to shunt him off on another at short notice Or possibly he had something to say which he particularly wished not to leave unsaid at that stage of the conversation The newspapers did not publish a description of the jewels stolen on the Monarchic he went on brushing the Countess de Santiago aside It was thought best at the time not to give the reporters a list To me that seemed a mistake Who knows for instance through how many hands the Malindore diamond may have passed If some honest person recognizing it from a description in the papers for instance The Malindore diamond exclaimed Lady Cartwright forgetting politeness in her interest and cutting short a sentence which began dully Isn t that the wonderful blue diamond that the British Museum refused to buy three years ago because it hadn t enough money to spend or something Quite so replied Ruthven Smith adding with pride But the Van Vrecks had enough money They always have when a unique thing is for sale and they are rich enough to wait for years with their money locked up till somebody comes along who wants the thing That happened in the case of the Malindore diamond The Van Vrecks hoped to sell it to mister Pierpont Morgan But he died and it was left on their hands till this last autumn Ah then that lovely blue diamond was sold with the other things the Van Vreck agent lost on the Monarchic Was to be sold if the prospective buyer liked it He had married a white wife you know and Oh yes of course It was Lady Eve Cassenden That marriage made a big sensation among us Horrid I call it But she hadn t a penny and they say he s the richest Maharajah in India The Malindore diamond was once in his family I understand about five hundred years ago when we first begin to get at its history Ruthven Smith went on ignoring the Maharajah as he had ignored the Countess de Santiago It was then the central jewel of a crown But later Louis XIV on obtaining possession of it had it set in a ring and surrounded with small white brilliants It still remains in that form or did so remain until it was stolen from our agent on the Monarchic What form it is in and where it is now only those who know can say So strong was the call from Ruthven Smith s eyes to Annesley s eyes that she was forced to look up She had been sure that she would meet his gaze fixed upon her and so it was He was staring across the table at her with a curious expression on his long hatchet face CHAPTER XVII RUTHVEN SMITH S EYEGLASSES Annesley could not read the look Yet she felt that it might be read if her soul and body had not been wrenched apart and hastily flung together again upside down it seemed with her brain where her heart had been and vice versa Why had Ruthven Smith looked at her as he spoke in his loud voice of the stolen Malindore diamond a blue diamond set with small brilliants in a ring Had he found out that she did he believe but she could not finish the thought It seemed as though the ring Knight had given her and told her to hide was burning her flesh Could her blue diamond be the famous diamond about which the jewel expert was telling Lady Cartwright A horrible sensation overcame the girl She felt her blood growing cold and oozing so sluggishly through her veins that she could count the drops drip drip drip She hoped that she had not turned ghastly pale Above all things she hoped that she was not going to faint If she did that Ruthven Smith would think what would he not think She found herself praying for strength and the power of self control that she might reason with her own intelligence Of course if this were the diamond Knight didn t dream that it had been stolen Just then a hand reached out at her left side and poured champagne into her glass It was the hand of Charrington the butler Annesley saw that it was trembling She had never seen Charrington s hand tremble before Butlers hands were not supposed to tremble Charrington spilled a little champagne on the tablecloth only a very little no more than a drop or two yet Annesley started and glanced up The butler was moving away when she caught a glimpse of his face It was red as usual for his complexion and that of his younger brother were alike in colouring but there was a look of strain on his features as if he were keeping his muscles taut Sir Elmer Cartwright began to talk to her His voice buzzed unmeaningly in her ears as though she were coming out from under the influence of chloroform What will become of me she said to herself and then was afraid she had said it aloud How awful that would be Her eyes turned imploringly to Sir Elmer He was smiling unaware of anything unusual Oh yes she exclaimed at random Fortunately it seemed to be the right answer and the relief this assurance gave was like a helping hand to a beginner skating on thin ice Sir Elmer went on to repeat some story which he said he had been telling the Duchess Annesley suddenly thought of a woman rider she had seen at a circus when she was a child The woman stood on the bare back of one horse and drove six others three abreast all going very fast and noiselessly round a ring I must drive my thoughts as she did the horses came flashing into the girl s head I must think this out and I must listen to Sir Elmer and go on giving him right answers and I must look just as usual I must For Knight s sake She seemed to hear the words whispered Why for Knight s sake Oh but of course she must try to think how it would involve him if the blue diamond was the famous one stolen from the Van Vrecks agent on the Monarchic He would not be to blame for if he had known he would not have bought the diamond And yet might he not have known He had told her few details of his life before they met but he had said that it had been hard sometimes that he had travelled among rough people and picked up some of their rough ways He had confessed frankly that his ideas of right and wrong had got mixed and blunted From the first he had never let her call him good Would it seem dreadful to him to buy a jewel which he might guess from its low cost had to be got rid of at almost any price Annesley was forced to admit much as she loved Knight that his daring original nature so she called it to herself might enter into strange adventures and intrigues for sheer joy in taking risks She imagined that some wild escapade regretted too late might have led him into association with the watchers Maybe they had all three been members of a secret society she often told herself and Knight had left against the others will in spite of threats That would be like him and brave and splendid as was his image in her heart she could not say that he would never be guilty of an act which might be classed as unscrupulous This admission instead of distressing calmed her Allowing that he had certain faults seemed to chase away a dreadful thought which had pressed near out of sight yet close as if it stood behind her chair leaning over her shoulder For a moment she felt happy again She would tell Knight what she had heard about the Malindore diamond and how like its description was to hers Then no matter how much he might hate to let it go he must show the blue diamond ring to mister Ruthven Smith and have its identity decided The girl drew a long breath and determined to put the subject out of her mind until after dinner so that Sir Elmer Cartwright need not think her a complete idiot But the deep sigh that stirred her bosom stirred also the fine gold chain on which hung the blue diamond The chain lay loosely on her shoulders lost or almost lost among soft folds of lace She wore it like that with a low dress not only to prevent it from attracting attention and making people wonder what ornament she hid but also because the thin band of gold if seen would break the symmetry of line It was Knight who had given her this little piece of advice the first time after their marriage that she had dined with him in evening dress and since then she had never forgotten to follow it To night however feeling suddenly conscious of the chain she was on the point of looking down to make sure that it was shrouded in her laces Something stopped her With a quick warning thump of the heart she glanced across at Ruthven Smith A few minutes ago he had not been wearing his eyeglasses Now they were on pinching the high bridged thin nose And he was peering through them at her peering at her neck her dress as if he searched for something Ruthven Smith knew about the blue diamond He knew that she wore it on a chain hidden in her dress The certainty of this shot through brain and body like forked lightning and seemed to sear her flesh She was afraid She could not tell yet of what she was afraid but when she could disentangle her twisted thoughts one from another the reason would be clear Then it was as if her mind separated itself from the rest of her and began to run back along the path she had travelled with Knight since the hour of their first meeting It ran looking on the ground seeking and picking up things dropped and almost forgotten Knight had not been pleased when the Countess de Santiago talked to him of their being together on the Monarchic The Countess had seemed wishful to annoy him in some way She had taken that way They had known each other well and for a long time They knew a good deal about each other s affairs Sometimes one would say that the Countess still liked to annoy Knight and he resented that He had been unwilling to have her asked to Valley House for Easter though he knew she longed to come And Ruthven Smith Knight had not wanted him Could it possibly be on account of the blue diamond Had Knight heard what she had heard there at the dinner table and was he anxious about what might happen next Hastily she flung a glance toward her husband He was not looking at her but it seemed perhaps she imagined it that his face had something of the same tense strained expression she had caught on Charrington s How odd if it were true that both should have that look One would almost fancy they shared a secret trouble But Annesley shook the idea away as she would have shaken a hornet trying to sting How dare she let such a disloyal fancy even cross the threshold of her mind A secret between her husband and his servant a secret concerning the blue diamond which stabbed them both with the same prick of anxiety at the mention of the jewel No sooner was the venomous thing dislodged than it crept back and settled close over her heart For Knight s eyes turned to her and in them was the look of a drowning man Just for the fraction of a second she saw it Then the curtain was drawn over his real self that had come to the window and signalled for help He smiled a friendly smile and took up the conversation with his right hand neighbour But he had hidden his soul too late The message could not be taken back and Annesley was sure that he too had heard the story Ruthven Smith had told so loudly to Lady Cartwright The fact that he had lost his unruffled nonchalant coolness even for a single instant warned Annesley that Knight must be desperately troubled He bought the diamond for me knowing what it was she told herself and knowing that it must have been stolen Of course that s why he made me wear it where nobody could see But who else knew besides the man who sold it to Knight Somebody must have known and told mister Ruthven Smith Perhaps the thief himself hoping to be spared and to get money from both sides That is why mister Ruthven Smith accepted the invitation here which I was so sure he would refuse He has come because he thinks the Malindore diamond is in this house That must be it But how can he have found out that I am wearing it As she thought these things asking herself questions sometimes answering them sometimes unable to answer she managed to keep up some desultory talk first with one of her neighbours then with the other It seemed to take all her strength to do this and made her feel weak and broken not excited and vital as she had felt on the wonderful night at the Savoy when Nelson Smith had praised her pluck and presence of mind in saving him from a danger which had never been explained How she wished with all her anxious troubled heart that she knew how to save him to night It had been very wrong to buy a stolen diamond but he had done it from no mercenary motives for he had given it to her She supposed that he had loved the beautiful thing and felt when it was offered to him that he could not bear to let it go Perhaps the Countess de Santiago had stolen it on the Monarchic That might be a cruel thought but Annesley could not help having it for it would explain many things Besides it would help to exonerate Knight He was very chivalrous where women were concerned and he would have felt bound to protect his old friend At all events he could not have given her up to justice and very likely she had been in debt and needed money She had wonderful clothes and must be extravagant Yes the more Annesley dwelt on the idea the more convinced she became that Madalena de Santiago had stolen the blue diamond and perhaps all the other things on the Monarchic while pretending to have a vision in her crystal of the thief and of the way the jewel had been smuggled off the ship Then the Countess had been angry with Knight and had tried to have him suspected even of being mixed up in the theft though that last idea seemed too far fetched How hateful how mean of her Annesley thought ashamed because it was so easy to believe bad things of the Countess and to pile up one upon another Probably she put it into Constance s head to suggest having mister Ruthven Smith asked And then she put it into his head to to The girl stopped short appalled What had been put into the jewel expert s head What precisely had he come to Valley House to do He has come to find the blue diamond the answer flashed into her brain Madalena de Santiago s eyes were as piercing as they were beautiful She might have noticed the fine gold chain which her pal s wife wore always round her neck She might have guessed that the ring with the blue diamond was hidden at the end of the chain yet she could not know for certain because Knight would never have told her that Therefore it followed that neither could Ruthven Smith know for certain He meant to find out and if he did find out Knight would be punished far more severely than he deserved for buying a thing illegally come by I will save him again Annesley resolved But how What might she expect to happen And whatever it was how could she prevent it happening CHAPTER XVIII THE STAR SAPPHIRE Picture after picture grew and faded in her mind She saw policemen coming to the house she saw Ruthven Smith demanding that she and Knight be searched and arrested if the diamond were found It might be difficult to prove that they had had nothing to do with the theft especially as Knight had been on board the Monarchic He must have travelled under his own name then the name that he had not let her see when he wrote it in the register after the wedding If Ruthven Smith knew about the Monarchic and the change of name he might make things very unpleasant for Knight And what must he himself be thinking at this moment as he peered through his eyeglasses Annesley had always told herself that Ruthven Smith looked like a schoolmaster He looked more than ever like one to night a very severe schoolmaster planning to punish a rebellious pupil But he can t have accepted our invitation and have come to this house to make a scene and a scandal before everybody she tried to reassure her troubled heart Still he wouldn t look like that if he didn t believe that I m wearing the diamond and if he did not mean to do something about it It was a terrifying prospect for Annesley and suddenly with a shock of certainty she told herself that Ruthven Smith would not give her time if he could help it to get rid of the ring and conceal it somewhere else He ll think of an excuse after dinner to make me show what I have on my chain or perhaps he has thought of the excuse already It seemed to the girl that the room had become bitterly cold She shivered slightly I must take off the ring and put something else on the chain when we go away and leave the men she decided But no Even then it might be too late Ruthven Smith neither smoked nor drank Very likely he would follow the ladies to the drawing room without giving her the chance of cheating him If she were to save Knight from trouble she must do the thing she had to do at once That thing was to unfasten the clasp of the chain slip off the ring with the blue diamond substitute another ring fasten the chain again and replace it inside her dress all without letting Ruthven Smith across the table or her neighbours suspect what was being done Her plate was whisked away at that moment and leaning back in her chair she seized the opportunity of looking at her hands Brain and heart were throbbing so fast that she could not remember without counting what rings she had put on Knight had tried to console her for the loss she d suffered through the burglary a fortnight before by making her a present of half a dozen new rings Poor Knight How anxious he always was to give her pleasure no matter at what expense He had such good taste in choosing jewellery too that one might almost fancy him as great an expert as Ruthven Smith But he had laughed when she said this to him protesting that he was a rank amateur The new rings were all beautiful each unique in its way The big white diamond of her engagement ring was the least original of her possessions To night in addition to that and her wedding ring she wore on her left hand a grayish star sapphire of oval shape curiously set with four small diamonds white ones at top and bottom pale pink and yellow at the sides This ring was rather large for her and as she wore it above the engagement ring the stones easily slipped round toward the palm The dark blue scarab on her right hand Ruthven might have observed but she was hopeful that the star sapphire had escaped his notice She took it off and laid it in her lap ready Her dress of white charmeuse embroidered with violets was fastened in front under a folded and crossed fichu of shadow lace and a bunch of real violets held on by an old fashioned brooch Bending forward she played at eating Punch a la Romaine while with her left hand she contrived to undo three or four hooks from their delicately worked eyelets Then slipping two fingers into the aperture she tore open her lace underbodice This accomplished she felt the ring of the blue diamond but she dared not break the chain as she could easily have done If Ruthven Smith were planning some trick by which to obtain a glimpse of ring and chain the latter must be intact Pinching the chain between thumb and finger patiently persistently and very cautiously she pulled it along until she touched the tiny clasp As she did this she glanced down at the lace of her fichu now and then to make sure that she did not draw the thin line of gold so tightly across her neck that it became visible in moving At last she had the clasp in her hand Pressed upon sharply it opened and the ring with the blue diamond fell into her palm She pushed it inside her frock as far down as her fingers would reach and slid the star sapphire ring on to the chain before fastening the clasp again She was shivering still as if with cold and her hands trembled so that she could hardly put the hooks of her dress into their eyelets But somehow she did at last and was sure that no one had seen More than one course had come and gone before her stealthy task was finished and three or four minutes after the last hook had decided to bite Constance looked at the Duchess of Peebles Everyone rose and as Annesley had feared Ruthven Smith followed the ladies out of the great dining hall Constance led them to the Chinese drawing room for coffee and as the women grouped themselves to chat or gaze at Buddhas and treasures of ancient dynasties she suddenly recalled Madalena s latest vision in the crystal It seemed that it would interest rather than frighten her friends to hear of it Besides if it did frighten them a little she didn t much mind She bore the Duchess of Peebles and several others a grudge because they had come to Valley House not on her account or Dick s but because it was an open secret who were the real host and hostess on this occasion Last year if she had invited these people they would have been dreadfully sorry they were already promised for Easter It was Nelson Smith s money and popularity which had lured them They knew they would have wonderful things to eat and probably the women were counting on presents of Easter eggs in the morning with exciting surprises inside Are you all very brave she asked aloud and gaily Because I ve just remembered that the Countess de Santiago saw a picture of us in her crystal grouped together as we are now in this very room and something happening Something nice or horrid asked the Duchess a tall pretty woman who looked as if Rossetti had created her with finishing touches by Burne Jones Ah she couldn t see The vision faded Constance replied But perhaps we shall see if this is to be the night As she spoke the men came into the room Ruthven Smith s example was contagious They had been deserted by the ladies hardly ten minutes ago Annesley felt sure that Knight had contrived to hurry the others He too then had guessed why Ruthven Smith had gone out of the dining hall with the women Perhaps he also had a plan He came straight to his wife who was standing with Lady Cartwright Not far off was Ruthven Smith still with his eyeglasses on He was hovering with a nervous air in front of a cabinet full of beautiful things at which he scarcely glanced Seeing Knight approach Annesley he lifted his head took a hesitating step in her direction and stopped He looked timid and miserable yet obstinate Anita I ve been telling the Duke about that star sapphire I picked up for you the other day Knight began He says he never saw one with anything resembling a star in it Will you fetch it for him to look at I noticed as you got up from the table that you hadn t put it on to night For an instant the girl could not answer If only he had hit upon something else If only it had occurred to her to hide her left hand after taking off the ring But she could not have foreseen this For the first time she inclined to believe in the Countess de Santiago s supernatural power Could it be that this scene had pictured itself in the crystal Could it be that now in a moment something dreadful would happen She realized that Knight was trusting to the quickness of her wits that not only had he overheard Ruthven Smith s talk about the Malindore diamond but he credited her with having caught the drift of the words and counted on her loyalty to help him As he spoke he looked at her with the wistful seeking look she had seen in his eyes when they were first married He s afraid I m angry with him for buying the diamond in spite of knowing what it was she thought but he trusts me to stand by him now Her mind grew clear After a pause no longer than the drawing of a breath she was ready to rise to the situation Knight had created In fact she saw safety for him and herself as well as a realistic surprise for Ruthven Smith But the latter rendered brave to act through fear of loss was too quick for her I beg your pardon Before you go may I have the pleasure of a nearer look at that beautiful enamel brooch of yours It was Annesley s impulse to step back as without waiting for permission the narrow head sleekly brushed and slightly bald at the top bent over her laces But she remembered herself in time and stood still She dared not glance at Knight to send him a message of encouragement but she knew that for once even his resourcefulness had failed and that he must be steeling himself to the brutal discovery of his secret Yet even then she did not guess what Ruthven Smith s plan was until the thing had happened He peered at the brooch which represented a bunch of grapes in small cabochon amethysts and leaves of green enamel Adjusting his eyeglasses they slipped from his nose and fell on the lace of her fichu Oh how awkward of me A thousand pardons he cried Making a nervous grab for the glasses which hung from a chain he snatched up her chain as well and with a quick jerk of seeming inadvertence wrenched from its warm hiding place a ring with a flash of brilliants and a glint of blue Annesley s heart had given one great throb and then missed a beat for there had been an awful instant as the plan developed when she feared that the ring with the blue diamond might after all her pains have become entangled with the chain If it had the violence of the jerk might have brought it to light But she had accomplished her task well She could afford to smile though her lips trembled as she saw the bird of prey look fade from Ruthven Smith s face and turn into bewildered humiliation Right was on his side yet he had the air of a culprit and some wild strain in Annesley s nature which had been asleep till that instant sang a song of triumph in the victory of her plan over his How delighted Knight would be and how amazed and grateful grateful as he had been when she stood by him with the watchers As Ruthven Smith stammered apologies her eyes flashed to Knight s but there was none of the defiant laughter she had expected and felt bound to reproach him for later He was pale and though his immense power of self control kept him in check Annesley shrank almost with horror from the fury of rage against Ruthven Smith which she read in her husband s gaze and the beating of the veins in his temples Terrified lest his anger should break out in words she hurried on to say what she would have said before the sudden move by the jewel expert Here is the sapphire ring you asked about Knight she said I was just going to take off this chain and give it to you to show to the Duke when When mister Ruthven Smith took an unwarrantable liberty Knight finished the sentence icily I I meant nothing Really I can t tell you how I regret the wretched man stuttered But Knight was without mercy Pray don t try any further he cut in My wife is not a figurine in a shop window to have her ornaments stared at and pawed over You are an old friend of hers mister Ruthven Smith and you are my guest or rather my friend Annesley Seton s guest therefore I will say no more But in some countries where I have lived such an incident would have ended differently Oh please Knight exclaimed Annesley thankful that at least he had spoken his harsh words in so low a voice that no one outside their own group of three could hear But she was shocked out of her brief exultation by his white rage and the depths revealed by the lightning flash of anger Also she was sorry for Ruthven Smith even while she resented the plot which it was evident he had come to carry out With unsteady hands she lifted the delicate chain over her hair and gave it to her husband The ring is rather large for my finger Here it is for you to show to the Duke she reminded him Thank you Anita he said And she knew that he thanked her for more than what she gave him I am a thousand times sorry Ruthven Smith persisted More sorry than I can ever explain or you will ever know Indeed it was nothing the girl comforted him in her soft young voice But she read in his words a hidden meaning as she had read one into Knight s She did know that which he believed she would never know the meaning of his act and the effort it had cost to screw his courage to the sticking place Also as the star sapphire with its sparkle of diamonds had flashed into sight she had seemed to read his mind She guessed he must be telling himself that his informant the Countess or some other had mistaken one blue stone for another Let s go and join Constance and the Duchess she went on quietly They re looking at some lovely things you will like to see And you must forget that Knight was cross He has lived in wild places and he has a hot temper I deserved what I got I m afraid murmured Ruthven Smith After all nothing exciting seems likely to happen to night in this room in spite of the Countess s prophecy said Constance Perhaps it may be to morrow or Monday I hope nothing more exciting will happen then than to night Annesley exclaimed with a kindly glance at her companion She pitied him but she pitied herself more for by and by she and Knight would have to talk this thing out together For the first time she dreaded the moment of being alone with her husband There was a stain of clay on the feet of her idol and though she had helped him to hide it from other eyes nothing could be right between them again until she had told him what she thought until he had promised to make restitution somehow of the thing he should never have possessed CHAPTER XIX THE SECRET Knight and Annesley had a suite of rooms on the ground floor in what was known as the new wing at Valley House On the floor above were the rooms occupied by Lord and Lady Annesley Seton This wing was a dreadful anachronism shocking to architects for it had been tacked on to the house in the eighteenth century by some member of the family who had made the grand tour and fallen in love with Italy Seeing no reason why a classic addition with a high pillared loggia should be unsuitable to a house in England built in Elizabethan and Jacobean days he had made it Fortunately it was so situated as not to be seen from the front of the building or anywhere else except from the one side which it deformed and there a more artistic grandson had hidden the abortion as much as possible by planting a grove of beautiful stone pines As for the wing itself the interior was the most liveable part of the house and with the modern improvements put in to please the American bride before her fortune vanished it had become charming within Annesley s bedroom and her husband s adjoining had long windows opening out on the loggia and looking between tall straight trunks of umbrella pines toward the distant sea It was late before she could slip away to her own quarters for she had been wanted for bridge an amusement which she secretly thought the last refuge for the mentally destitute She had told her maid not to sit up and she was thankful to close the door of the small corridor or vestibule which led into the suite knowing that until Knight came she would be alone She wanted him to come and meant to wait it did not matter how long until they could have that talk she wished for yet dreaded intensely Meanwhile however it was good to have a few minutes in which to compose her mind to decide whether she should begin or expect Knight to do so and how she could frankly let him see her state of mind without seeming too harsh too relentless to the man who had given her happiness with both hands the only real happiness she had ever known She sat for a while in the boudoir thinking that Knight might come soon before she began to undress There was a dying glow of coal and logs in the fireplace but staring into the rosy mass brought no inspiration She could not concentrate her thoughts on the scene which must presently be enacted they would go straggling wearily to other scenes already acted even as far back as that hour at the Savoy when a young man who looked to her like the hero of a novel begged to sit at her table He still seemed as much as ever like the hero of a novel in which he had splendidly made her the heroine but it was not a pleasant chapter she had to read now It reminded her too intensely of the mystery surrounding the hero and forced her to realize that stories of real life have not always happy endings But ours must she said to herself springing up unable to rest Nothing can break our love and while we have that we have everything She could no longer sit still and going into her bedroom she peeped through the door into Knight s room beyond It was dark as she expected to find it for she had been almost sure that she would have heard him if he had entered the vestibule Returning to her own rooms she pulled back the sea blue curtains which covered the large window looking on to the loggia The sky was silver white with moonlight between the black stems of the tall pines and a flood of radiance poured into the room It was so beautiful and bright bringing with it so heavenly a sense of peace that the girl could not bear to draw the curtains again She began slowly to undress by moonlight and the faint red glow in the fireplace Her first act was to recover the blue diamond ring and to drop it with shrinking fingers into the jewel case on her dressing table Taking off her dinner frock she put on a white silk gown which turned her into a pale spirit flitting hither and thither in the silver dusk Still Knight had not come She pulled out the four great tortoise shell pins which held up her hair and let it tumble over her shoulders As she began to twist it into one heavy plait she walked to the window and stood looking out It seemed to her that the black trunks and outstretched branches of the trees were like prison bars across the moonlight She wished she had not had that thought but as it persisted a figure moved behind the bars the figure of a man At first she was startled for it was very late long after one o clock but as the man came nearer she recognized him although the light was at his back It was Knight and as though her thought called to him he stopped suddenly pausing on the lawn not far from the loggia She could not see his face but it seemed that he was staring straight up at her window He has been walking in the moonlight thinking things over just as I have in here the girl told herself Surely he could see her But no he turned and was striding away with his head down when she knocked sharply and impulsively on the pane Hearing the sound yet not knowing whence it came he stopped again and so gave Annesley time to open the window Knight she called softly Then he came straight to her across the strip of lawn and up the two steps that led to the loggia She met him on the threshold and saw his face deadly pale in the moonlight Perhaps it was only an effect of light but she thought that he looked tired even ill Still he did not speak Knight you almost frightened me she said I was afraid for an instant you might be might be A thief he finished for her Or a ghost she amended Weren t you coming in No he said I hadn t thought of it Do you want shall I come in Yes please do I I ve been waiting for you I m sorry I hoped you d have gone to bed But I might have known you wouldn t As she retreated from the window he followed her as if reluctantly into the room Shall I draw the curtains he asked There was weariness in his voice as in his face Annesley s heart went out to her beloved sinner with even more tenderness than before No let s talk in the moonlight she answered Oh Knight I am glad you ve come I began to think you never would Did you That s not strange for I was saying to myself that same thing What same thing I don t understand That I well that I never ought to come to you again She sank down on a low sofa near the window and looked up to him as he stood tall and straight seeming to tower over her like one of the pine trees out there under the moon Oh Knight she faltered It s not so bad as that Isn t it he caught her up sharply eagerly Do you mean what you say Isn t it to you as bad as that No no she soothed him You see I love you That s all the difference isn t it You ve been everything to me You ve made my life that used to be so gray so bright so sweet Only the blackest thing oh an unimaginably blackest thing could come between us or Before she could finish he was on his knees at her feet holding her in his arms crushing her against his breast soft and yielding in her light dressing gown with her flowing hair My God Annesley it s too good to be true he said his breath hot on her face as he kissed her cheek her hair her eyes You can forgive me I thought you d go away I thought you d refuse to let me come near you I was walking out there wondering how to make it easy for you whether I could get rid of myself without scandal She had been sure that he must have repented long ago and that it would hurt him dreadfully to have her find out the thing he had done but she had not dreamed that his self abasement would be so complete She put her arms around him as he held her and pressed his head against her neck the dear smooth black head which she loved better than ever in this rush of pardoning pity Dearest she whispered Never never think or speak of such a dreadful way out Of course it was horribly wrong and of course it was a great shock to me but you might have known from my doing what I could to help that I didn t hate you I said to myself there must be some excuse some big excuse And now if only you wouldn t mind telling me about it from the beginning I believe it would be the best way for us both Then I might understand You are God s own angel Anita he said in a choked voice You don t know how I ve learned to love you better than anything in this world or the next if there is a next I knew you were a saint but I didn t know that saints forgave men like me Shall I really tell you from the beginning You ll listen and bear it It s a long story Annesley did not see why the story of his buying the historic stolen diamond and giving it to her should be so very long even with its explanations but she did not say this I don t care how long it is she told him But you will be tired down on your knees I couldn t tell my story to you in any way except on my knees he answered And the new humility of the man she had loved half fearfully for his daring his defiant way of facing life almost hurt as his sudden passion had startled the girl I hardly know how to begin he said Perhaps it had better be with my father and mother because it was the tragedy of their lives that shaped mine He was silent for a moment as if thinking Then he drew a long breath as a man does when he is ready to take a plunge into deep water My mother was a Russian Her people were noble but that didn t keep them from going to Siberia She was brought to America by a man and woman who d been servants in her family She was very young only fifteen Her name was Michaela I m named after her Michael The three had only money enough to be allowed to land as immigrants and to get out west though her people had been rich He paused a moment for a sigh She and the servants they passed as her father and mother found work in Chicago My father was a lawyer there He was an Englishman you know I ve told you that before but he thought his profession was overstocked at home so he tried his luck on the other side The old Russian chap was hurt in the factory where he worked and that s the way my father whose name was Robert Donaldson got to know my mother There was a question of compensation and my father conducted the case He won it And he won a wife too She was nineteen when I was born Father was getting on but they were poor and had a hard time to make ends meet They worshipped each other and worshipped me You can think whether I adored them Mother was the most beautiful creature you ever saw Everyone looked at her I used to notice that when I was a wee chap walking with my hand in hers When I was ten and going to school my father had a bad illness rheumatic fever We got hard up while he was sick and then came a letter for mother from Russia Some distant relations in Moscow had had her traced by detectives It seemed there was quite a lot of money which ought to come to her and if she would go to Russia and prove who she was she could get it If father d been well and making enough for us all he d never have let her go but he was weak and anxious about the future so she took things into her own hands and went without waiting for yes or no or anything except to find a woman who d look after father and me while she was gone Well she never came back Can you guess what became of her he asked huskily She died Annesley asked forgetting in her interest which grew with the story to wonder what the history of Knight s childhood and his parents troubles had to do with the Malindore diamond She died before my father could find her but not for a long time God what a time of agony for her Things happened I can t tell you about We heard nothing after a letter from the ship and a cable from Moscow with two words Well Love For a while father waited and tried not to be too anxious but after a time he telegraphed and then again and again No answer He went nearly mad Before he was well enough to travel he borrowed money and started for Russia to look for her I stayed in Chicago and kept on going to school The friends who took care of me made me do that or thought so But when I could I played truant I was in a restless state I remember how I felt as if it were yesterday Nothing seemed real except my father and mother I thought about them all the time I couldn t sleep and I couldn t study I couldn t bear to sit at a desk I picked up some queer pals in those months or they picked me up I suppose that was the beginning of the end I think while he was away finding out terrible unspeakable things my father forgot about me or else he didn t realize I was big enough to mind He never wrote When he came back after eleven months he was an old man with gray hair I ll never forget the night he came and how he told me about mother It was a moonlight night like this with no light in the room It was the last night of my childhood As the man talked he had lifted his head from the soft pillow of the girl s white neck and was looking into her eyes his face close to hers Annesley was not thinking about the diamond For a long time Knight went on slowly father could not trace my mother He expected to find the relations who had sent her word about the legacy but they were gone nobody could tell where Nobody wanted to speak of them They seemed afraid Father went to the British and American Embassies no use But at last he got to know in subterranean ways that mother hadn t realized how dangerous it is to speak your mind in Russia She d left there before she was sixteen She had said things about her father and mother and what she thought of the ruling powers and that same night she d been in Moscow two days she and her relatives disappeared It leaked out through a member of the secret police that she could have been saved by her beauty someone high up offered to get her free But she preferred another fate She was sent to Siberia where her father and mother had gone and had died years before My father met a man who had seen her on the way as he was coming back She was only just alive The man was sure she couldn t have lived more than a few weeks Yet father wouldn t give up He went after her But what s the use of going on He found the place where she had died Which ends that part of the story as a story Only it didn t end it for us It filled our hearts with bitterness We wanted revenge Yet my father was too good a man to take it when his chance came His conscience held him back But he talked talked like an anarchist a man out to fight and smash all the hypocritical institutions of society If it hadn t been for me he d have killed himself in Siberia where his wife had died a martyr and it would have been well for him if he had Because of the wild way he talked when suspicion of fraud was thrown on him by a partner the fool public believed in his guilt He died in prison when I was fifteen and I swore to punish the beast of a world that had killed all I loved I swore I d make that my life s work and I have But God I ve punished myself too at last I m punished through you because I ve fallen in love with you Anita and for your sake I d give the years that may be in front of me all time but one day to be glad in if I could blot out the past Maybe the girl faltered maybe you re too hard on yourself I can t believe that you who have been so good to me could have been very bad to others If I could hope you wouldn t be too hard on me that s all I care for now he cried passionately You remember my saying that night in the taxi that the worst I d ever done was to try and pay back a great wrong and take revenge on society If I could hope you meant what you said about understanding I d tell you the story of that revenge I did mean it Knight My love will help me to understand You make me believe in a God for surely only God could have sent such an angel as you into my life In a way I haven t deceived you about myself for I warned you I was a bad man But when I think of the night we met and the trick I played on you it makes me sick I thought you d loathe me if you ever found out But I didn t intend to let you find out It was to be a dead secret forever like the rest Yet if I tell you what my life has been you ll have to know that part too If I kept it back you might think it worse than it was A trick echoed Annesley Yes A trick to interest you to make you like and want to help me Besides it was to be a test of your courage and presence of mind If you hadn t those qualities you d have been a failure from my point of view You see I hadn t had time to fall in love with you then And I wanted you for a help mate in the literal sense of the word It seems a pretty sordid sense looking back from where we ve got to now But that was my scheme A mean cowardly scheme And it s thanks to you and your blessed dearness I see it in its true light Do you begin to understand Anita knowing something of what my life has been or must I explain I I m afraid you must explain she answered in a small voice like a child s She felt suddenly weak and sick as if she might collapse in the man s arms It was as if some terrible weapon wrapped round and half hidden in folds of velvet were lifted above her head to strike her down She shrank from the blow yet asked for it Already she guessed dimly that Knight s confession was to be very different from and far more terrible than anything she had expected I was the man whose advertisement you answered the man who wrote you the stiff letter in the handwriting you didn t like signed N Smith Oh The word broke from her in a moan Darling Have I lost you if I go on You must go on she cried out sharply For both our sakes you must go on I know how it looks to you And it was vile But I couldn t be sure when I advertised what an angel would answer to my call and what a brute I should be to deceive her I thought the sort of girl who d reply to an ad for a wife would be fair game that I should be giving her an equivalent for what she d give me For my business that I had to carry out in England I needed a wife of another sort from any woman I knew or could get to know in an ordinary way she had to be of good birth and education nice looking and pleasant mannered if possible with highly placed friends or relatives Money didn t matter I had enough or would have I got a lot of answers but the only one that seemed good was yours I felt nearly certain you were the woman I wanted so I rigged up a plan You know how it worked out Maybe I m stupid Annesley said dry lipped I don t understand yet Why I thought the thing over and it seemed to me that married life if it came to that would be easier for both if the man could make some sort of appeal to the love of romance in a girl Well she wouldn t think the man who had to get the right sort of wife by advertising much of a figure of romance So the idea came to me of of starting two personalities I wrote you a stiff precise sort of letter in a disguised business hand making an appointment at the Savoy When that was done the writer went out of your life He just ceased to exist except that he sat behind a big screen of newspaper and watched for a girl in gray and purple wearing a white rose to pass through the foyer That was his way of finding out if she d suit Jove how beastly it does sound put into words and confessed to you But you said I must go on Yes go on Annesley breathed You were about one hundred times better than my highest hopes And seeing what you were I was glad I d thought out that plan Even then it was borne in on me that it wouldn t be long before I found myself falling in love if I had the luck to secure you And from that minute the business turned into an exciting play for me just as I meant to make it for you I let you wait for a while but if you d showed any signs of vanishing I d have stepped up I d got a trick ready for that emergency But I hoped you d follow instructions and go to the restaurant Once there I was sure the head waiter d persuade you to sit down at a table and the rest went exactly as I planned The two men we called the watchers used to be vaudeville actors did a turn together and their specialty was lightning changes Their make ups even at short notice could fool Sherlock Holmes Even though you despise me for it Anita you must admit it was a smart way to make you take an interest and prove your character Lord but you stood the test I wouldn t have given you up at any price then even if I hadn t begun falling in love I saw how good you were and in that taxi going to Torrington Square I felt mean as dirt for tricking you But of course I had to go on as I d begun At first I thought it was luck tumbling into the same house with Ruthven Smith but now I see it was the devil s luck If it hadn t been for Ruthven Smith I might have gone on living the part I played You need never have known the truth And I swear to you Annesley I d made up my mind after finishing off my work with the men who are with me that I d run straight for the rest of my days The business was making me sick for being close to your goodness threw a light into dark places By heaven Anita it does seem hard just as I was near to being the man you thought me that that dried up curmudgeon Ruthven Smith should call my hand and make me show you the man I was But I can t help seeing there s a kind of what they call poetical justice in it the blow coming from him I ve always been like that seeing both sides of a thing even when I wanted to see only one But if you can see both sides you will make the good grow as the bright side of the moon grows and turns the dark side to gold Can you do that do you think Anita Can you see any excuse for me in going against the world to pay it out for going against me and mine If you ve been piecing bits of evidence together since Ruthven Smith spoke you ll have remembered that only heirlooms and things insured by or belonging to public companies have been taken no poor people have been robbed and except in the case of missus Ellsworth where I wanted to see her paid out for her treatment of you Robbed Catching the word Annesley heard none of those that followed Robbed Oh it s not possible you mean Her voice broke With both hands against his breast she pushed him off and struggled to rise to tear herself loose from him But he would not let her go What s the matter How have I hurt you worse than you were hurt already by finding out he appealed to her his arms like a band of steel round her shuddering body When you heard the truth about the diamond it was the same as if you d heard everything wasn t it You guessed Ruthven Smith suspected someone must have told him Madalena perhaps You guessed he had some trick to play and in the quietest cleverest way you checkmated him without hint or help from any one You saved me from ruin and not only me but others And on top of all that when I hoped for nothing more from you you promised me forgiveness That s what I understood Was I mistaken I was mistaken she answered almost coldly then broke down with one agonized sob I thought oh what good is it now to tell you what I thought You must tell me I thought you had bought the blue diamond knowing it had been stolen but wanting it so much you didn t care how you got it I didn t dream that you were a That I was what A thief and a cheat My God And now you know I m both you hate me Anita You must or you wouldn t throw those words at me like stones Let me go she panted pushing him from her again with trembling ice cold hands He obeyed instantly The band of steel that had held her fell apart She stumbled up from the low sofa and trying to pass him as he knelt she would have fallen if he had not sprung to his feet and caught her But recovering herself she turned away quickly and almost ran to a chair in front of the dressing table not far off There she flung herself down and buried her face on her bare arms Knight followed to stand staring in stunned silence at the bowed head and shaking shoulders He could hear the ticking of a small nervous sounding clock on the mantelpiece It was like the beating of a heart that must soon break At last when the ticking had gone on unbearably long he spoke Anita you called me a cheat he said I suppose you mean that I cheated you by playing the hero that night at the Savoy and stealing your sympathy and help under false pretenses that I ve been steadily cheating you and your friends every day since That s true in a way or it was at first But lately it s not been the same sort of cheating It began to be the real thing with me I mean I felt it in me to be the real thing As for the other name you gave me thief I m not exactly that not a thief who steals with his own hands though I dare say I m as bad If I haven t stolen I ve shown others the most artistic way to steal I ve shown men and women how to make stealing a fine art and I ve been in with them in the game Indeed it was my game Madalena de Santiago and the two men you knew first as the watchers then as Torrance and Morello now as Charrington and Char have been no more than the pawns I used or rather they ve been my cat s paws There s only one other man at the head of the show besides me and that is one whose name I can t give away even to you But he s a great man a kind of financial Napoleon a great artist too He doesn t call himself a thief He s honoured by society in Europe and America yet what I ve done in comparison to what he s done is like a brook to the size of the ocean He has a picture gallery and a private museum which are famous but there s another gallery of pictures and another museum which nobody except himself has ever seen His real life his real joy are in them Most of the masterpieces and treasures of this world which have disappeared are safe in that hidden place which I ve helped to fill That man has no regrets He revels in what he calls his secret orchard He thinks I ought to be proud of what I ve done for him and so I was once I came here and brought the other people over to England to work for him Not that that fact will whitewash me in your eyes not that I wasn t working for myself too and not that I m trying to make more excuses by explaining this But I d like you to understand at least for the sake of your own pride that you haven t been cheated into loving and living with a common thief Does that make it hurt less No she said in a strange tone which made her voice sound like that of an old woman That doesn t make it hurt less It makes no difference I think nothing can ever make any difference My life is over Don t for God s sake say that Don t force me to feel a murderer he cried out sharply There s nothing else to say I wish I could die to night If one of us is to die he said let it be me If you hadn t happened to see me and call me in when I was under the trees bidding good bye to your window by this time I might have found a way out of the difficulty without any scandal or trouble to you whatever No one would have known that it wasn t an accident I should have known But if you had it would have been a relief No Because I I hadn t heard the truth I didn t understand at all I thought you had done one unscrupulous thing I didn t dream your whole life was what it is I loved you as much as ever It would have broken my heart if you But now that you don t love me it wouldn t break your heart I don t seem to have any heart Annesley sighed It feels as if it had crumbled to dust But it would break my life if you ended yours If anything could be worse than what is it would be that Very well you can rid yourself of me in another way the man answered You can denounce me give me up to justice If you hand over the Malindore diamond to Ruthven Smith and tell him how you got it You must know I wouldn t do that Why not Because I couldn t It needn t spoil your life No one could blame you I would tell the story of how I deceived you You could free yourself get a divorce Don t the girl cut him short I m not thinking of myself I m thinking of you I can t love you again and I wouldn t if I could now that I know You re a different man The one I loved doesn t exist and never did yet you ve told me your secret and I m bound to keep it I don t need to stop and reflect about that But as for what s to become of me and how we re to manage not to let people guess that everything s changed I don t know I must think I must think all to night until to morrow Perhaps by that time I can decide Now I beg of you to go and leave me this moment I can t bear any more and live He stood looking at her but she turned her head away with a petulant gesture of repulsion and lest her eyes might feel the call of his she covered them with her hands Her hopelessness her loathing of him enclosed her like a wall of ice So The dream s over he said This woman to this man What a farce what a tragedy When she looked up again he had gone and the door between their rooms was shut The moon no longer lit the high window With Knight s going darkness fell CHAPTER XX THE PLAN Annesley sat as Knight had left her for a long time minutes perhaps or hours But at last she was very tired and very cold so tired that she threw herself weakly on the bed in her dressing gown because she couldn t sit up All through the rest of the dark hours she lay shivering and did not even trouble to roll herself in the warm down coverlet spread lightly over the bed It seemed right somehow that she should be cold and miserable physically She did not care or wish to be comfortable Over and over again she asked herself What shall I do What is to become of me of both of us She tried to pray but her heart was too hard toward the man who had trampled on her life and love for his own cruel purposes It seemed to her that God would not hear a prayer sent up in such a mood yet she did not want to soften her heart toward the sinner Because it had been so full of forgiveness before he poisoned the chalice with the bitter stream of confession it was the more impossible to forgive now It even seemed to Annesley that it would be monstrous to forgive in the ordinary human sense of the word a man who was a living lie If there were room for thanksgiving in her wretchedness it lay in the fact that her love had died a swift and sudden death Had she gone on loving in spite of all such love she thought must have brought death into her soul She did not know how to name her husband now Even in thinking of him she would not call him Knight What a mockery the name had been How he must have laughed to know that she was fool enough to believe him a knight of chivalry who had come like saint George to rescue her from the dragon She knew at last that the name he had not wished her to see in the parish register was Michael Donaldson That meant she supposed that her name was Donaldson too a name he had dragged through the mire He pretended to love her But such a man could not speak the truth He had tried to excuse himself in every way To talk of love and its purifying influence was only one of these ways He would not even have confessed if he had not fallen into the mistake of thinking she understood that he was a thief or head of a gang of thieves He seemed almost to boast of what he was Oh how horrible life had become and how she wished that it were over She wondered if it would be wicked to pray that her heart might stop beating to night Yet morning came and her heart beat on She did not even feel very ill only weak with a wiry throbbing of each separate nerve in her head She had meant to use the quiet hours to decide what must be done next but always when she had tried to pin her mind to the question it had escaped like a fluttering moth and turned to self pity or to calling up pictures of the past which brought tears to her eyes Now the time was upon her when realities must be faced Before seven o clock it was light but neither she nor Knight were accustomed to early tea and there was more than an hour to spare before they would be called by Parker The girl sat up shivering though the room heated by steam had not grown bitterly cold when the grate fire died She looked heavy eyed toward her husband s closed door They must talk things over and make some plan She hated the very word plan since his story of the trick he had played at the Savoy She hated the necessity to talk with him but it was a necessity They ought to arrange something for the future the blank and hateful future before Parker came and daily life began There would be many things to settle questions to ask and answer a sort of hideous campaign would have to be mapped out in details not one of which defined itself clearly in her tired brain It s no use she said to herself I can t think after all until I see him again Perhaps he will make some suggestions and I can accept or refuse But I can t go to his door and call him As she hesitated Knight who was a knight no longer in her eyes opened the door very softly not to disturb her if she slept In the morning light which paled the uncurtained window their eyes met Annesley slipped off the bed and stood up cloaking her bare white neck with her hair Suddenly she felt that he was a strange man who had no right to be in her room He was not the husband she had loved with a beautiful and sacred love I won t come if you d rather I didn t he said I only looked in to see if you were awake I thought if you were and if you could stand it it would be best to talk about what s to be done He spoke quietly standing at the door He was dressed for the day as if nothing had happened and Annesley felt dimly resentful because he looked bathed and well groomed his black hair smooth and carefully brushed altogether his usual self except that he was pale and grave You had better come in I suppose the girl replied grudgingly I was thinking too that we must talk Let us get it over You haven t been to bed I see he said his eyes lingering on her sadly It flashed through Annesley s mind that it was as if he were looking for the last time at the sweetness and happiness of life But her heart did not soften It was his fault that there was no longer any happiness or sweetness left in their lives No I haven t been to bed she returned But it doesn t matter I am not ill Please let us not waste time in discussing me There are other things Yes there are other things he agreed But we ll not begin to talk of them until you have got into bed and covered yourself up You re as white as marble I don t want she began but he cut her short What will Parker think if she finds your bed hasn t been slept in Oh very well Annesley assented impatiently I must get used to tricks Perhaps not said Knight I ve been thinking of ways and means Have you Because if there s anything you feel you would like to do you ve only to tell me I haven t been able to think she confessed Well then I ll tell you what I ve thought Annesley had now crept into bed and before she could protest Knight had carefully covered her with the down quilt Having done this he drew a chair near yet not too near and sat down It was as if he recognized her right to keep him at a distance You said last night he began that you didn t mean to denounce me If you ve changed your mind I shan t blame you I deserve it All I ask is that you grant me time to warn certain persons who would go down if I went down and give them time to make a bolt Madalena de Santiago is one I m pretty sure that out of spite she put Ruthven Smith on to looking for the diamond but I don t want to punish her Evidently she or whoever it was didn t have much information to give or the man wouldn t have backed down and apologized I should like to find out exactly what he had to go upon But if you ve changed your mind it s not worth while to bother about that I have not changed my mind Annesley said You are very good a very noble woman If I were the only one to suffer by being denounced I don t think I d care much as things have turned out But there are others And above all there s you You could patch up your life but you d have to suffer more or less if I were dragged over the coals And so taking everything together I m thankful to accept your generosity We ll call that settled I don t think Ruthven Smith has any suspicion We ll see about that later Meanwhile he doesn t count And Madalena at her worst I can manage There s nothing to be feared But the question is how are we two to go on You must whatever else we decide you must give up the girl stammered from her pillows and could not bring herself to finish That goes without saying doesn t it In any case there was only to be one more coup I d warned everybody concerned of my decision as to that One more How terrible Not here Yes if you must have that too it was to be here It was to be a big thing But there s time to stop it Annesley buried her head with a stifled moan It wouldn t have hurt any of the people Only family heirlooms again everything insured And as for the insurance companies if you worry over them it s part of the game They re wallowing in money But I ll call the thing off And that s the end for me I m not rich not the millionaire I pose for still I ve earned something My Napoleon has paid me well and I ve had a share now and then of some good things There s enough to make you comfortable Do you think I d take a penny of such money the girl cried sick with indignation I ve worked for it Knight said with a kind of unhappy defiance and it was come by as honestly as a lot of fortunes made on the stock market You must have money I can earn some as I did before No never as you did before Besides I thought you d decided on having no open break between us no scandal Or wasn t that what you meant It was But I don t see yet how it can be managed Do you The way I had in my mind was since I ve lost your love oh I m not complaining the way I had in my mind was to leave you over here with plenty of money and be suddenly called to America on business Then if it would hurt your feelings to have me put myself out of the way it needn t hurt them for something to seem to happen Nelson Smith could be wiped off the map and if you weren t free to marry somebody else at least you d be free of me But if you won t take my money that plan will not work You can hate me as much as you like but I m not going to leave you alone in the world without a penny Neither you nor any one can force me to that I ve thought of another thing though since we began to talk Only I don t like to propose it Anita It isn t a good plan from your point of view I d better hear it Well I might get a cable hurrying me across to the other side and you might go along Oh I warned you you wouldn t think it a good plan But since I ve begun let me finish In Canada and the United States I m known in my least important character as Michael Donaldson and I ve tried to keep the name clean because of my father and mother When there s been anything shady doing I ve taken a fancy name and made such changes as I could in myself The reason I didn t want you to see the name in the register was because of what happened on the Monarchic I d given you that ring you know I couldn t resist doing that I wanted you to have it not because of its value but because it s beautiful I thought it was like you somehow I had to make up its loss in another way to the man who expected to have it that Napoleon I mentioned I know the old man Paul Van Vreck Annesley guessed with weary impatience I ll not say yes or no to that But it will be bad for me and perhaps for you too if you ever mention Paul Van Vreck in such a connection Not that you d be believed I sha n t mention him again Just as well not But it was my name and my plan I began to speak about I was going to say you needn t be afraid that if you took my name which is yours now you d have to be ashamed of it We could go to America and in England mister and missus Nelson Smith would soon be forgotten I d hand over the money you hate to charities not the kind of charities I ve been supporting here They ve all been part of what you call my fraud and have only given me a chance to bring some rather queer looking fish around me who might have raised curiosity if I couldn t have accounted for them But real charities And if you d stick by me I don t mean love me I know you can t do that but live in the same house and not chuck me altogether I d turn over a new leaf I d begin again from the beginning In Texas I ve got some land a ranch It isn t worth much I m afraid but I came by it honestly for me I won it at poker from a man named Jack Haslett He was a devil for cards but it didn t matter He was rich and he had a better ranch that he lived on He s dead now was near dead then of consumption He liked me Said he was glad I d won the ranch It was only a bother to him I was with Jack when he died and did what I could to ease him at the end He was grateful and what money his bad luck at cards had left him he willed to me It was only eight thousand dollars If it had come to me any other way I dare say I d have chucked it away in a month It wouldn t have seemed worth saving But I was sort of sentimental about poor old Haslett and his feeling for me I didn t care to lump his money in with what I got in my line of life I made a separate fund of it Some had to go toward improvements on the place before I could let the ranch to any one but there s about six thousand dollars left I guess The fellow I let to wrote me a few weeks ago that he was tired of ranching and wanted to clear out He hoped I could find someone to buy his cattle and the furniture he s put in the house The letter was forwarded by a man I keep in touch with my business and whereabouts so he can look after my interests I ve had no time to answer yet I was going to write that I didn t know any one who cared to settle in Texas but now what if I wrote that I d take the place and everything on it off the fellow s hands myself I don t know what Texas is like Annesley replied coldly But anything would be better than the life you re leading now I wasn t intending to go alone Knight reminded her I said if you d stick by me not throw me over altogether I d try and begin again In that case Texas would do as well as anywhere and the place and the money are clean How could I go with you and live under the same roof with everything so changed the girl exclaimed It would kill me As bad as that Well then I must rack my brains for something else But I m sorry this won t do Would you care to live with Archdeacon Smith and his wife No No And they wouldn t want me That seems queer to me that any one should have the chance of keeping you with them and not want you How would it be for you to go on the same ship with me and find a little home somewhere on an allowance I could make you out of that fund You see you are my wife in the eyes of the law so I m bound to support you And you re bound to let me do it if I can do it honestly Annesley flung up her arms in a gesture of abandonment Let it go at that she sighed until I can think of something better Very well We won t argue that part yet The thing to make sure of at the moment is this Do I get a cable say on the day everyone s leaving Valley House calling me back to America on urgent business and do I take you with me Annesley s thoughts raced through her head and would not stop Knight did not speak He was waiting with outward patience for her decision It seemed that she would never know what to say She was about to tell him in despair that she must have the rest of the day to make up her mind but before she could speak Parker knocked at the door I ll go with you the girl said hastily On the ship But after that Parker knocked again Come in called Annesley Thank you Knight said getting up from his chair near her bed Don t thank me I But Parker had opened the door All that was conventional and agreeably commonplace in the lives of happy well to do people seemed to enter the room with her CHAPTER XXI THE DEVIL S ROSARY Ruthven Smith summoned courage to ask for a few words alone with Knight that Easter morning in order to explain as well as apologize for the seeming liberty he had taken By dint of stammering and punctuating his sentences with short dry coughs he made a clean breast as he called it of the whole business He had come to Valley House he confessed because of an anonymous letter written apparently by a person of education to inform him that the Malindore diamond had come into the possession of the Nelson Smiths Whether they were aware of its identity the writer was not sure but in any case their ownership of the jewel was kept secret Having got so far in his story Ruthven Smith decided that the easiest way of finishing it would be to produce the letter He did so a typewritten sheet of plain creamy paper in an envelope post marked West Hampstead and simplified things for himself by pointing to the last sentence missus Nelson Smith always wears a thin gold chain round her neck which she lets drop to her shoulders for evening dress What precious thing which has to be hidden hangs on that chain mister Ruthven Smith is advised to find out I see now the unfortunate man excused himself that someone has been taking advantage of my anxiety about the losses of my firm to play a cruel practical joke on me I can t help thinking at the same time that the person must have had a grudge against you and your wife also Or else a desire to make mischief between you and us was Knight s calm suggestion Ruthven Smith caught it up eagerly Ah that possibility hadn t occurred to me I suppose we all have enemies Knight pursued the subject without excitement The writer probably wished to put the idea in your head that I had deliberately bought an historic diamond which I knew to be stolen But that would have been ridiculous exclaimed the jewel expert and felt sincere in making his protest Nevertheless he had glanced at Annesley s face while talking of the Malindore diamond to Lady Cartwright It had been on the edge of his mind that if she looked self conscious it would be a point against her and her husband Also he had determined to make his daring attempt at discovery before she had time to get rid of the diamond if she were hiding it Now however in the light of her shining innocence he had almost forgotten that he had suspected an underhand design on her part He asked Nelson Smith if he could think of any one man or woman among his acquaintances capable of writing the anonymous letter Nelson Smith replied that his brain was a blank and that he hardly thought it worth while to follow the matter up unless Ruthven Smith wished to do so In that case they might put the affair in the hands of the police But the elder man was of the younger s opinion He had made a fool of himself and was ashamed that he had attached importance to an unsigned communication All he desired was to let the unpleasant business drop This being settled Knight in whose hand was the typewritten letter tossed the thing into the fireplace of the library where the two had been talking When he and Ruthven Smith had shaken hands and agreed to forget the whole incident the latter was glad to escape from the interview He went to his room and lay down to soothe his nerves and think of an excuse to return to London early on Monday morning As soon as his meagre back was turned Knight stooped and retrieved the letter in its envelope unscorched from the fireplace There was nothing about it not even a tell tale perfume to give any clue to the writer Nevertheless Knight considered it of value He intended to use it as a bluff to frighten the Countess de Santiago for only through her own fear could he prove her treachery Most of the guests at Valley House went to church to give thanks for the fairy like Easter eggs they had received Annesley had a headache however and no one was surprised that her husband should choose to stop at home to look after her His adoring devotion for the girl was no secret People laughed at it but admired it too and some women envied Annesley They imagined him spending the morning with his wife but as a matter of fact he did not go near her He feared to speak lest she might change her decision and refuse to travel to America with him His one hope a desperate hope lay in her going He decided not to see her alone again until Monday evening after the arrival of the cable from America In order to insure the coming of this message and to make it realistic he motored into Torquay and sent a long telegram partly in cipher Returning he had a conversation with Charrington the butler and Char the chauffeur a conversation which left the brothers grave and subdued Later Char went off in the car again though it poured with rain and was gone until late at night Between twelve and one o clock Knight strolling toward the garage heard the automobile return and stopped in the blaze of the acetylene for the motor to slow down Is it all right he inquired It s all right Char answered somewhat sullenly yet with a certain reluctant respect Nothing will happen here Monday night Good his master answered and smiled at the thought of Madalena s malicious prophecy which would not be fulfilled It was not a pleasant smile yet as he had said to Annesley he planned no revenge against the tigress the woman whose claws had ripped his heart open Tigress or no she was a woman and he knew that as far as she was capable of caring she had cared for him Perhaps it had been partly his fault She was handsome and had been years younger when he had met her first She was married then to an old man jealous and suspicious knowing that his money had won the beautiful wild creature for him It was at Buenos Aires and the husband had found Madalena out in an intrigue partly political partly mercenary and partly passionate He had turned her from his house without a penny and Knight not personally concerned in the intrigue but interested had been flush enough at the time to lend her a thousand dollars enough to go away with It had been called a loan but he had not expected to get the money back and never did get it In California she had set herself up as a palmist and had become successful a success she duplicated in New York and she had gladly made herself useful in many ways to Don and those with whom he worked One way was to find out the number and worth of her rich clients jewels and where they were kept Through her crystal gazing she was able to conjure women s secrets without their realizing that they not she gave them to the light And aboard the Monarchic was not by any means the first time that Madalena had been invaluable in diverting suspicion by throwing it upon the wrong track Knight had consulted her praised her and flattered her from time to time Now he told himself that he was paying for his thoughtlessness He had taken Madalena for granted regarding her as a machine rather than a woman and though he owed to her the loss of his happiness that happiness had been undeserved and as he expressed it to himself walking the wet paths at midnight he had stood to lose it anyhow He would frighten Madalena so that she would never dare to try her tricks again and he would let her understand that because of what she had done their partnership had come to an end once and forever Otherwise she should feel herself safe from him Bad he might be and was as he knew but he didn t think it was in his make up somehow to strike a woman He did not go back to the house after his short talk with Char until after he had heard the stable clock strike four It was easier to think and see things clearly out of doors than in his room adjoining Annesley s that closed room forbidden to him now where she was perhaps crying and surely hating him As for the long nightmare day he had lived through it had been too full for much deliberate thinking and he wanted to plan for the future how to begin again and how to keep the woman who had come to mean more for him than anything else had ever meant more he knew than anything else could mean He was not sure whether the love in his heart was a punishment or a blessing but there it was It had come to stay This woman to this man He found himself repeating the words he remembered best in the marriage service not bitterly as he had repeated them to Annesley but yearningly clingingly groping after some promise of hope in them She gave herself to me I m the same man she loved after all though she says I m not he told himself God What s the good of being a man at all if I can t get her back As he wandered through one winter saddened garden after another the Italian garden the Dutch garden the rose garden he searched his soul asking it how much more he should have to tell the girl about his past In a kind of desperate resignation he persuaded himself that there was nothing he would not be willing to tell her now if it were for her good and if she wished to hear But something within him said that she would wish to hear no more She would deign to put no questions to him even if she felt curiosity She would doubtless refuse to listen if he volunteered a further confession He was instinctively sure of his ground there and in his bitterness of spirit there was a faint gleam of comfort certain details of his degradation she would think it that might be kept decently hidden For instance he would not have to tell her how as a boy in Chicago he had learned to make strange use of those clever nervous hands of his which she had lovingly praised as sensitive and artistic He could almost see the girl shudder and grow pale at hearing how proud he had been at sixteen of being admitted to friendship with a swell mobsman fascinating as any Raffles of fiction how it had amused the fellow to teach him a deft and delicate touch beginning his lessons with the game of jack straws in which he was given prizes if he could separate the whole stack one straw from another without disturbing the balance of the pile It would gain him no credit in Annesley s eyes if he should assure her that though he knew how to pick pockets none better he had somehow never cared to put his skill in practice but had always preferred leaving that part of the industry to others No excuse could help him with her and he was glad she need not know all the ways in which he had served the eccentric friend and employer with whose interests he had been associated more or less since his twenty fifth year How disgusting would seem to Anita the inside history of the Monarchic episode upon which he had rather prided himself until love for her had begun making subtle changes in his view of life He and old Paul Van Vreck had laughed together at the patent lock on which the agent depended a lock invented by the retired member of the firm himself and followed by a second invention even more clever a little instrument designed to open a door in spite of it There had been the drug too which leaving no odour behind had the same effect as chloroform and took even more quickly Paul Van Vreck had read of certain experiments made by a professor of chemistry in Tours had gone to France to see the man had bought the formula which had not yet proved itself entirely successful had added an ingredient on his own account and triumphed These parts of the complicated and well fitting scheme had seemed deliciously amusing to Knight in those days that Van Vreck should use his secret skill against his own brothers and nephews in the business he had made that the great expert should add to his fortune by stealing from his own firm or rather from the great insurance company who would repay their losses that in such ways with such money he could add treasures to his famous collection practically at no expense to himself and have besides the exquisite pleasure of laughing in his sleeve at the world It had all added zest to the work And Knight had been pleased with some small inventions of his own praised by Van Vreck a smart hiding place in the heel of a boot almost impossible to detect and another equally convenient and invisible in the jet standard of Madalena de Santiago s famous crystal He had enjoyed the excitement when he and Madalena and their two assistants among the other passengers on board ship had consented to be searched for the missing jewels And he had laughed sneeringly at the credulity of those who believed in Madalena s trumped up vision of the small fair man the lighted life preserver dropped into the sea at night and the yacht which sent out a boat to pick it up For that other vision her crystal had supplied after the robbery in Portman Square he was not responsible but it was he who had suggested the pictures for her to see on shipboard He hated the recollection now Even Annesley could not think it more contemptible than he did Still worse was the remembrance of missus Ellsworth s latchkey the keeping of which had been accidental at first Afterward he had gaily regarded its possession as a gift from Providence The way to Ruthven Smith s house was made clear by it and better still through it the dragon could be punished for years of cruelty to the captive princess Char had been the man to whom fell the honour of bestowing the punishment and leaving a missive from the princess s rescuer Knight writhed in spirit as he wondered whether the princess guessed the fate of the key He wondered also if she asked herself what part he had had in the disappearance of the Valley House heirlooms She would loathe him more intensely if possible could she know how her presence with him on that public show day had helped to cloak with respectability his secret mission How mean he had been in distracting her attention from the two Fragonards and from the cabinets containing the miniatures and the carved Chinese gods of jade while he marked the prizes for the eyes of his two assistants How unsuspicious and happy the girl had been trusting him utterly while behind her back he manipulated the diamond the useful diamond he always carried for such purposes Even then he had the grace to be ashamed of himself for disloyalty though not for dishonesty as deftly the diamond cut the glass faces of the cabinets directly opposite the miniatures and the Buddha meant to enrich Paul Van Vreck s secret collection He had been glad to hurry his wife away and let the eager pair of tourists crowding on his heels finish the work he had begun It seemed to Knight as his thoughts travelled heavily along the past that no other woman but Annesley Grayle this fragile white rose that had freely given its sweetness could have turned him from the vow of vengeance for his parents fate which as a boy he had sworn against the world Day by day week by week month by month the fragrance of the white rose had so changed him that looking back at himself he saw a stranger Had it not been for certain engagements made with Paul Van Vreck and others engagements which had to be kept because there is honour among thieves that den of his in Portman Square would long ago have been shut to his at home day visitors No more business would have been done on those or any premises this party of Easter guests would not have been invited to Valley House and the Malindore diamond sleeping away its secret on Annesley s breast would still be guarding his secret too While the others were at church she had sent him the diamond by Parker the blue diamond and the rose sapphire her engagement ring also the pearls he had given her the day before their marriage and all his other gifts except the wedding ring which had not been stolen on the night when the Annesley Setons silver went It had been a blow to open the box brought to his room by the maid without a word of explanation no lighter because it was deserved It was only less severe than had the wedding ring been with the rest And perhaps Knight reflected it would have been there had Annesley known of another trick played upon her those cleverly reconstructed pearls gleaming ropes of them and paste diamonds added to her collection only for the purpose of disappearing in the burglary A hateful trick but he had believed it necessary at the time while despising it Well he was punished for everything at last everything vile he had done and thought in his whole life even those things the White Rose did not know He was young still but he felt old old in sin and old in hopelessness for youth cannot exist in a heart deprived of hope It seemed to Knight that his heart had been deprived of hope for years yet suddenly he recalled the fact that a few moments before up to the time when he had begun counting his sins one by one like the devil s rosary he had been thinking with something akin to hope of the future What if after all he began to ask himself But stumbling unseeingly from avenue to path and path to lawn he had wandered near the house By what seemed to him a strange coincidence he had come to a standstill almost on the spot where he had stood last night when Annesley at her window called him in She had loved him then She had called him in to be forgiven But her forgiveness divine as it was white and wide winged as the flight of a dove had not been wide enough to cover his guilt What a ghastly difference between last night and this It was right that the face of the moon so bright then should be veiled with ragged black clouds And yet what if The man s eyes strained through the darkness of that dark hour before the dawn If her window is uncurtained I ll take it as a good omen he said Noiselessly his feet trod the short wet grass going nearer to the shadowed loggia to make sure The curtains were drawn closely and the window was shut CHAPTER XXII DESTINY AND THE WALDOS After the cablegram came calling them to America it took the Nelson Smiths an incredibly short time to wind up their affairs and to break the ties many and intricate as the clinging tendrils of a vine which attached them to England Of course as their friends pointed out it wasn t as if they had had a home of their own Luckily for them unluckily for the Annesley Setons they had taken the Portman Square house only month by month And in Devonshire they had been but paying dearly paying guests as the world surmised Everyone protested that they would be dreadfully missed and begged to know their plans and whether mister Nelson Smith s business on the other side something to do with mines wasn t it would not be finished so that they might come back in time for Henley and Cowes But the American millionaire s answers were vague He couldn t tell He could only hope And his manner unflatteringly was indifferent It was missus Nelson Smith who seemed depressed a changed girl Constance said from the moment that cable message arrived at Valley House Connie thought and mentioned her thought to others very likely the truth was that Nelson Smith had lost money In contradiction to this theory he was known to have given generously to charities just before starting not those queer new fangled societies he had tried to bolster up while he was in London but hospitals and orphan asylums and organizations of that sort which opened their mouths wide Still nobody could say for a certainty how much he gave and it was argued that Lady Annesley Seton was sure to know more than most people about Nelson Smith s private affairs The story of possible money losses ran about and grew rapidly healing regrets for his absence Soon the pair dropped out of their late friends conversation as a subject of living interest It was much the same with the Countess de Santiago Whether her plans were affected by those of the Nelson Smiths nobody knew and she said that they were not But about the time that their departure for America was decided upon Madalena had a sharp illness It was she wrote Constance who made inquiries fearing something contagious an unusual form of neuralgia from which she had suffered before The only doctor who had ever been able to relieve her pain lived in San Francisco and in San Francisco she must seek him She had at first an idea of sailing on the same ship with the Nelson Smiths but for a reason which she did not explain she changed her mind the day after making it up and engaged a cabin on a boat which started a week earlier She was missed also for a while But then it was remembered that the crystal visions had been mysteriously more favourable for those who included the Countess in their nicest parties than for those who asked her to their second best Little malicious digs which she had given were recalled and those who had thought her wonderful when in their midst began to doubt her powers Rather theatrical don t you think said the Duchess of Peebles It s more satisfactory to go to a woman you can pay with money and not invitations So Madalena was not mourned for long and the Annesley Setons were fortunate enough to replace their lost American millionaire with one from Australia He was old and his wife was fat but you can t have everything The Nelson Smiths took passage not on one of the great floating palaces patronized by millionaires but on an obscure cheap little ship which bore out the gossip about the man s losses As a matter of fact however they chose that way of going by Annesley s desire It would have been Knight s way to vanish in a blaze of glory as the setting sun plunges behind the horizon after a gorgeous day I want to go on a ship she said which none of the people we know have ever heard of I couldn t bear to come across anyone I ever met before But as it turned out she was forced to bear what she had thought unbearable At the top of the gangway as she went on board a slightly shrill voice called out Why how do you do Who would ever have thought of meeting you two expensive creatures on board this tub With a sinking heart Annesley recognized a missus Waldo an American woman there was a husband in attendance whom she and Knight had met during their honeymoon at the Knowle Hotel The pair had been so friendly and kind that the Nelson Smiths had asked them to Portman Square more than once during the three gay months which followed But it was cruel thought Annesley that fate should bring them together again now just when she and the man she had married were at the parting of the ways Little had the girl dreamed when she first conceived a mild fancy for the pretty smiling woman and her silent humorous husband that the pair were destined to decide her future decide it in a way precisely opposite to that in which she had decided it herself But so it was to be mister and missus Waldo were returning to New York in its waning season because the decorating of a house they had bought was just completed They begged Annesley and Knight to be their first visitors and the invitation was given so unexpectedly that Annesley taken unawares found herself at a loss But I I mean my husband is going straight to Texas she stammered All the more reason if he has to run off so far on business and leaves you in New York that you should stay with us instead of in a hotel argued missus Waldo Annesley blushed and for the first time since Easter eve looked for help to Knight But he was silent and she blundered on not daring to pause lest the firm willed little lady should seal her to a promise in spite of herself You re very kind and it would be delightful she hurried along but I didn t mean that I was to stop in New York I Oh you are going together missus Waldo caught her up I didn t understand Well I m sorry for our sakes But couldn t you spare us two or three days before you start I am afraid we must wait for another time said Annesley My husband has business He can t waste a day Surely you won t turn your back on New York the day you arrive the first time you ve ever seen it cried the New York woman Why it s sacrilege You must stay with us one night If you could see the darling new room we ll put you in old rose and pearl gray and Cupids holding up the bed curtains In desperation the girl stuck to her point no longer daring to look at Knight Indeed we mustn t stay even for one night If there s a train the same afternoon There s a lovely train missus Waldo admitted unable to resist praising the American railway system We call it the Limited You can have a beautiful stateroom and run right through to Chicago without changing If they must go we ll see them off won t we Steve with a glance for the silent husband and bring them books and chocolates and flowers What was left for Annesley to say Short of informing the kindly couple that they were not wanted and had better mind their own business and refusing to decide upon a train she could do nothing except thank missus Waldo Perhaps she thought they will forget and things will settle themselves between now and then Or else I shall patch up some excuse When the invitation was given the Minnewanda was still four days distant from New York but the four days though seeming long were not long enough to produce the prayed for inspiration missus Waldo referred to the journey whenever she saw Annesley so there was no hope of her scheme being forgotten and the nearer loomed the new world the more clearly the girl was forced to see the thing to which a few hasty words had committed her She and Knight had staterooms adjoining with a door between That was to save appearances and it was no one s business that the door was never opened In reality they might as well have had the length of the ship between their cabins Annesley kept to her own quarters as constantly as her jangled nerves would allow but the sea was provokingly smooth and she proved to be a good sailor She felt as if she might become hysterical and perhaps do something foolish if she tried the experiment of shutting herself up from morning to night She paced the deck therefore and was dimly grateful to Knight because he seemed always to be in the smoking room when she took her walks At meals however unless she ate in her stateroom they could not avoid each other and again she felt cause for gratitude because Knight had accepted the Waldos suggestion that they should take a table for four In spite of the Waldos unwelcome attentions their society was preferable infinitely preferable to a duet with Knight They talked on such occasions and the sharpest eared scandal mongers could have guessed at nothing strange from their manner But save at these luncheons and these dinners they scarcely spoke to each other Knight took his cue from Annesley After the night when he had knelt at her feet and begged her forgiveness he had never forced himself upon his wife He seemed to have a dread of being thought an intruder and even withdrew his eyes guiltily if the girl caught him looking at her with the old wistful gaze to whose mystery she had now a tragic clue Annesley hoped that before they landed Knight might make some opportunity to discuss ways and means of getting out of the dilemma created by the Waldos But he never attempted to begin a conversation with her and she put off the evil moment from day to day telling herself that there was time yet and he had probably solved the problem he who was a specialist in solving problems Loving the man no longer her heart seeming to die anew whenever she even thought of him there remained still a ghost of her old trust an almost resentful confidence that he who was so clever so hideously clever would be capable of overcoming any difficulty I told him that I d go with him on the ship and that then we must part she assured herself lying awake at night wondering feverishly what was to happen in New York He said we d see about all that later but he must know by the way I act that I haven t changed my mind He will have to get me out of the trouble about the train The girl in mapping the future had thought of herself as being a governess for American children She did not know many things which governesses ought to know but if the children were small enough she did not see why she mightn t do very well She could sing and play as nine girls out of ten could She had been told that she had quite a Parisian accent in French and as for arithmetic and geography and other alarming things which children ought to know and grown up people forget one could teach them with the proper books Besides she had heard that Americans liked to have English governesses for their children it was considered smart She would go to an agent and it ought to be easy to find a place in the country or suburbs It must not be New York for fear of some chance meeting with the Waldos But if worst came to worst and because of those everlasting Waldos she had to get into the train with Knight she would get out again at the first good sized place where it stopped There must be agencies for governesses and companions in every large town One would serve as well as another As for money she knew that she must have some to go on with until she could begin to earn So far she had been forced to let Knight pay her way as he said out of the good fund Her coming with him had been for his sake and to spare him from gossip For herself she was in no mood to care what people said But now in sailing to America as his wife she had done all that she had ever promised to do He would have to arrange things as best he could Somehow the right time did not come to ask him what he intended to do for at the table or if occasionally they were on deck together they were never alone The ship docked late in the morning and Knight was busy with the custom house men It was noon when their luggage had been examined and could be sent away and the Waldos under letter W were released at the same moment that the Nelson Smiths under S were able to escape Let s have lunch at the dear old Waldorf our pet place and almost namesake proposed missus Waldo You owe us that after all the times you entertained us in London and you really see New York in the restaurant You ve nothing to do till your train goes this afternoon and your husband can get your reservations right there in the hotel Annesley s eyes went doubtfully to Knight s and met a steady look which seemed to say that he had made up his mind to some course Very well we shall be delighted she said resignedly Shall we meet at the Waldorf is it at luncheon time Oh my no exclaimed the older woman radiant in the joy of home coming It ll be lunch time in an hour You must taxi up to Sixty first Street with us and just glance at the house or we shall be so hurt Then we ll spin you down to the hotel again in no time I wish we could feed you at home but nothing will be in shape there till to night There was still no chance for Annesley to ask Knight the long delayed question They saw and duly admired the Waldos house and took another taxi to the hotel the Nelson Smiths luggage having been expressed to the Grand Central to await them Steve Waldo tried to engage his favourite table and missus Waldo suggested that it would be a good moment to get the reservations Again Annesley s startled glance turned to Knight Again his eyes answered with decision This time there was no longer any doubt in the girl s mind The Waldos persistent to the last would compel her to leave New York with her husband But whatever happened she would part with him forever before darkness fell At the first big town she told herself once more They were at the desired table which Steve had secured when Knight rejoined them announcing that he had his tickets I hope you were able to get a nice stateroom fussed missus Waldo Such a long journey and missus Smith s first day in our country Yes Everything satisfactory said Knight in the calm way which Annesley had once admired missus Waldo would have asked more questions if at that moment her eyes had not lighted upon a couple at an adjacent table Well of all things she cried jumping up to meet a pretty girl and a spruce young man who had also jumped up George and Kitty Mason What a coincidence There were kissings and handshakings Then mister and missus Mason were introduced to mister and missus Nelson Smith They it seemed had been married in the early winter just as Knight and Annesley had been And to add to the strangeness of the coincidence which drew birdlike exclamations from Jean Waldo George and Kitty were starting for Kansas City that afternoon They were going by the same train in which the Nelson Smiths would travel Why you ll be together for two days shrieked Jean For goodness sake look at your reservations and see if you re in the same car George Mason pulled out his tickets We re in a boudoir car all the way he said We start in one called Elena After Chicago we re in Alvarado Knight followed suit not ungraciously though without enthusiasm Annesley s heart was tapping like a hammer in her breast She felt giddy There was a mist before her eyes yet she saw clearly enough to see that there were two railway tickets alike in every way even to what seemed their extraordinary length A flashing glance gave her the name of the last station at the end It was in Texas And their two staterooms were also in Elena and Alvarado CHAPTER XXIII THE THIN WALL How dared he buy a ticket for me all the way to Texas Annesley asked herself But I might have known how it would be she thought Why expect a man like him to keep a promise Yet she had expected it She constantly found herself expecting to find truth and greatness in the man who was a thief who had been a thief for half his life It was strange But everything about him was strange and stranger than the rest was his silent power over all who came near him even over herself who knew now what he was It would have seemed that after his confession there would be no further room for disappointment concerning his character yet she was disappointed that his plan on which she had been counting had been nothing more original than to break his word and see what she would do After luncheon when the Waldos and Masons became absorbed for a few minutes in talk she turned a look on her husband I saw the tickets she said Did you he returned pretending as she thought not to understand You bought one for me to Texas Of course Did you think I wouldn t That would have been poor economy in the game we ve been playing It was her turn to show that she was puzzled What do you mean You never cared to talk things over I saw you didn t want to so I didn t press And when this complication about the Waldos came up I thought perhaps I was mistaken that you trusted me to do the best I could Yes That s why I expected you not to get me a ticket to Texas How far did you expect me to get it I don t know That s just it Neither did I know I got the whole ticket so you might choose your stopping place Oh Annesley was ashamed though she was sure she had no need to be That was why That was why Things being as they are it was well I had your ticket to show with mine wasn t it I suppose so But what am I to do We ll talk of that in the train There won t be time before because of these people and because I must leave you for two hours before the train goes Leave me Annesley echoed the words blankly then hoped that he had not noticed the dismay in her tone You will be all right with the Waldos and their friends I ll explain to them There s no time to lose I must go off at once Annesley was pricked with curiosity to know why and where he must go She would not ask But while he was away and she was being whirled through the park and along Riverside Drive at lightning speed to see New York in a hurry her thoughts were with her husband imagining fantastic things My mind is like a ghost she thought bitterly haunting what once it loved It seems doomed to follow wherever he goes whatever he does But it will be different when we re parted I shall escape in soul and body I shall have my own life to live That wonderful Italian house missus Waldo was saying as the taxi slowed down for one of her lectures is Paul Van Vreck s New York home They say it s a museum from garret to cellar not that there is a garret and I believe it s a copy of some palazzo in Venice It s shut up now perhaps he s in Florida or Egypt where he but look somebody s coming out why missus Nelson Smith it s your husband Shall we stop No let s drive on Annesley begged anxiously My husband knows mister Van Vreck They have business together He won t want us The taxi was allowed to go on to the next place of interest Annesley had flung herself back in the seat but she was not sure that Knight hadn t seen her She knew what powers of observation his quiet almost lazy manner could hide This chance meeting took place on the way to the Grand Central Station where they met the Masons and were joined almost at the last moment by Knight just as Annesley had begun to wonder if after all he were not coming He was as calm as though there were no haste and said he had been delayed in collecting the luggage from the ship He had a good deal to say about that luggage and what with thanks to the Waldos for books and flowers and chocolates and their kindness to Annesley missus Waldo with the best intentions found no chance to mention Paul Van Vreck Annesley had not meant to refer to him though seeing Knight come out of his shut up house had given her a shivering sense of mystery but when the train had started Knight came to the door of her stateroom There are one or two things I should like to speak to you about if you don t mind he said in the kind yet distant manner which had replaced the old lover like way when they were alone together Come in she replied and added lowering her voice mister and missus Mason are next door They are too much in love to be thinking about us or listening he answered and Annesley imagined a ring of bitterness in his tone I ve come to talk over plans but before we begin I want to explain something Once you made a guess in connection with Paul Van Vreck Probably you think that what you saw confirms it Of course the Waldos were telling you whose house it was and as luck would have it I came out at that instant Whether there was anything in your guess or not doesn t matter You re too sensible to mention it to any one except me But I can t have you torturing yourself with the idea that such dealings as you imagine with Van Vreck are still going on if they ever did go on Because I have faith in your discretion and because I owe it to you I m going to explain why I went to Van Vreck s house this afternoon why I was obliged to go I knew he would have got back from Florida I hear from him sometimes and I had to tell him that any business I d ever done for him was done for the last time because I was going to settle down to ranch life in Texas Also I handed to him the Malindore diamond His firm lost it His firm has by this time been paid the insurance It s up to him how to dispose of the property That s all I have to say about Van Vreck I thought in fairness you ought to know that I didn t keep the diamond And I thought I might tell you that my call at Van Vreck s didn t mean entering any new deal Thank you Annesley said stiffly I am glad She was glad yet she wished the man to understand how impersonal was her gladness how impossible it was that any atonement could bring them together again in spirit how dead was the past which he had slain And he did understand as clearly from her few words as if she had preached him an hour s sermon Now for what you are to do he went on crisply Although you and I never discussed the situation on board ship I realized what the Waldos were letting you in for I supposed you d feel that your staying in New York was out of the question I bought our tickets to Texas At the same time I got a map and a guide book which gives information about places on the way and beyond The Masons being on the train to Kansas City was a new complication But it wasn t my fault And it only means that the game of keeping up appearances must be played a little farther Would you like to go to California If you want to take back your maiden name and be Miss Grayle or if you care to have a new name to begin a new life with a quite respectable fellow called Michael Donaldson could introduce you to a few influential people in Los Angeles No danger of meeting Madalena de Santiago there though it s only a day s journey from San Francisco where she s very likely arrived by this time She has reasons for not liking Los Angeles In her early days she had some er financial troubles there and she wouldn t enjoy being reminded of them Is Los Angeles farther than El Paso Annesley inquired keeping her voice steady though there was a sickly chill in her heart A good way farther Knight went on in the same businesslike tone which separated him thousands of miles from the Knight she used to know Here I ll show you how the land lies Opening a map of a western railroad he drew a little closer to her on the seat and pointed out place after place along the black line told her when they would arrive at Kansas City and how they would go on without change to Albuquerque There he said he must take another train for El Paso and from El Paso he must go a distance of twenty miles to the ranch which lay close to the border of Mexico on the Rio Grande But you he said quietly you can keep straight along in the train we ll get into at Chicago till you come to Los Angeles There ll be time in Chicago to buy your ticket to California and I can write letters of introduction They ll be to good people You needn t be afraid Yet Annesley was afraid deathly afraid Not that Knight s friends would not be good people but of going on alone to an unknown place in an unknown country It would not have been so terrible she thought to have stayed in New York if only the Waldos hadn t interfered But to have this man who after all was her one link with the old world get out of the train which was hurling them through space and leave her to go on alone That was a fearful thing She could not face the thought at least not yet Perhaps she would feel more courageous to morrow On the ship she had slept little Her nerves felt like violin strings stretched too tight stretched to the point of breaking Does that plan suit you as well as any other Knight was asking I can t decide yet the girl answered and to keep tears back seemed the most important thing just then It doesn t matter does it as I must go on past Kansas City No it doesn t matter Knight agreed You ve plenty of time I suppose you d like me to leave you now to rest till dinner time Here s the guide book You might care to look it over But when he had gone Annesley let the book lie unopened on the seat She was very tired She could not think far ahead Her mind would occupy itself with the features of the journey not with her own affairs Everything was strange and new Even the train was wonderful She had thought in the immense station that the cars looked like a procession of splendidly built bungalows each painted a different colour and having brightly polished metal balconies at the end And inside the car was still like a bungalow or perhaps a houseboat with neat little panelled rooms opening all the way down a long aisle The coffee coloured porter and maid were delightful They smiled at her kindly and when they smiled it seemed sadder than ever not to be happy The Masons talk at dinner was disconcerting They took it for granted that she and Knight were an adoring newly married couple like themselves Annesley was thankful to escape and to go to bed in her little panelled room To morrow when I m rested things will be easier she told herself But to morrow came and she was not rested for again she had not slept In Chicago there were hours to wait before train time The Masons proposed taking a motor car to see the sights and lunching together at a famous Chinese restaurant At a sign from her Knight consented It was better to be with the Masons than with him alone After luncheon however Knight drew her aside What about Los Angeles he inquired Have you decided Annesley felt incapable of deciding anything and her unhappy face betrayed her state of mind If you d rather think it over longer he said I can buy your ticket at Albuquerque Very well Annesley replied She did not remember where Albuquerque was though Knight had pointed it out on the map and she did not care to remember All she wanted was not to decide then Knight turned away without speaking But there was a look almost of hope in his eyes Things could not be what they had been yet they were better than they might be At Kansas City the Masons bade the Nelson Smiths good bye And from that moment the Nelson Smiths ceased to exist There were no initials on their luggage The man kept to his own stateroom Annesley alone next door had plenty of books to read parting gifts from the Waldos but the most engrossing novel ever written could not have held her attention The landscape changed kaleidoscopically She wondered when they would arrive at Albuquerque wondered yet did not want to know Would you rather go to the dining car alone or have me take you Knight came to ask It s better to go together or people may think it strange she said Even as she spoke she wondered at herself The Masons having gone the other travellers strangers whom they would not meet again were not of much importance Yet she let her words pass And at dinner that evening she forced herself to ask Do we get to Albuquerque to night Not till to morrow forenoon Knight informed her casually He feared for a moment that she might say she could not wait so long before making up her mind but she only looked startled opened her lips as if to speak and closed them again Next day there were no more apple orchards and flat or rolling meadow lands The train had brought them into another world a world unlike anything that Annesley had seen before At the stations were flat faced half breed Indians and Mexicans some poorly clad others gaily dressed with big straw hats painted with flowers and green leggings laced with faded gold In the distance were hills and mountains and the train ran through stretches of red desert sprinkled with rough grass or cleft with river beds where golden sands played over by winds were ruffled into little waves Toward noon Knight showed himself at the open door of the stateroom We ll be in Albuquerque before long now he announced That s where I change you know for Texas The train stops for a while and I can get your ticket for Los Angeles Those letters of introduction I told you about are ready I ve left a blank for your name I suppose you ve made up your mind what you want to do Some people with handbags pushed past and Knight had to step into the room to avoid them The moment long delayed was upon her Annesley remembered how she had put off deciding whether or not to sail for America with Knight Now a still more formidable decision was before her and had to be faced She glanced up at the tall standing figure Knight was not looking at her His eyes were on the desert landscape flying past the windows What I want to do she echoed There s nothing in this world that I want to do Then and Knight did not take his eyes from the window why not drift Drift Yes To Texas Oh I know I asked you that before and you said you wouldn t But hasn t destiny decided Would it have sent you these thousands of miles with me unless it meant you to fight it out on those lines You ve travelled far enough side by side with me to learn that a man and a woman with only a thin wall between them can be as far apart as if they were separated by a continent Now this minute you ve got to decide It isn t I who tell you so It s fate Will you go on alone from the place we re coming to or will you try the thin wall CHAPTER XXIV THE ANNIVERSARY The girl felt as if some great flood were sweeping her off her feet She clutched mechanically at anything to save herself Knight was there He stood between her and desolation but if he had spoken then if he had said he wanted her and begged her to stay she would have chosen desolation Instead he was silent his eyes not on her but on the desert You swear you will let me live my own life she faltered I swear I will let you live your own life He repeated her words as he had repeated the words of the clergyman who had according to the law of God given this woman to this man The train was stopping Annesley knew that she could not go on alone I will try Texas she said in final decision Las Cruces Ranch was named not after the New Mexico town thirty or forty miles away but in honour of the Holy Crosses which had rested there one night centuries ago while on a sacred pilgrimage It was a lonely ranch as far from El Paso in Texas as it was from the namesake town in New Mexico Even the nearest village a huddled collection of low adobe houses and wooden shacks on the Rio Grande Furious River as the Indians called it was ten miles distant Only the river was near as the word near is used in that land of vast spaces At night if a great wind blew Annesley fancied she could hear the voice of the rushing water When she first saw the place where she had bound herself to live her heart sank It seemed that she would not be able to support the loneliness for it would be desperately lonely to live there lacking the companionship of someone dearly loved But afterward afterward she could no more analyze her feeling for the country than for the man who had brought her to it Lonely as she was she was never homesick Indeed she had no home to long for no one whose love called her back to the old world And she was glad that there were no neighbours to come to call her missus Donaldson and ask questions about England She had nobody except the Mexican servant woman and the cowboys who stayed with the new rancher when the old one went away Knight had suggested that she should wait in El Paso until he had seen whether the house was habitable for her and had made it so if it were not already But Annesley had chosen to begin her new life without delay for she was in a mood where hardships seemed of no importance It was only when she had to face them in their sordid nakedness that she shrank Yet after all what did it matter If she had stepped into the most luxurious surroundings she would have been no less unhappy The low house was of adobe plastered white but stained and battered where the walls were not hidden by rank growing creepers convolvulus and Madeira vines If the girl had read its description in some book the veranda formed by the steep sloping roof of the one story building the patio walled mysteriously in with a high flower draped barrier the long windows with green shutters she would have imagined it to be picturesque But it was not picturesque It was only shabby and uninviting at least that was her impression when she arrived toward evening after a long jolting drive in a hired motor car The paintless wooden balustrade and flooring of the veranda were broken So also were the faded green shutters The patio was but a little square of dust and stringy grass A few dilapidated chairs stood about homemade looking chairs with concave seats of worn cowskin Inside the house there was little furniture and what there was struck Annesley as hideous Nothing was whole Everything was falling to pieces Illustrations cut out of newspapers were pasted on the dirty whitewashed walls The slatternly servant who could speak only Mex had got no supper ready Knight would let Annesley do nothing but he deftly helped the woman to fry some eggs and make coffee He tried to find dishes which were not cracked or broken and could not If he and Annesley had loved each other or had even been friends they would have laughed and enjoyed the adventure But Annesley had no heart for laughter She could only smile a frozen polite little smile and say that it did not matter Everything would do very well She would soon get used to the place and learn how to get on When she had to speak to Knight she called him you There was no other name which she could bear to use He had had too many names in the past As time went on however the girl surprised herself by not being able to hate her home She found mysteriously lovely colours in the yellow gray desert shadows blue as lupines and purple as Russian violets high lights of shimmering pale gold Spanish bayonets straight and sharp as enchanted swords which had magically flowered lilied the desert stretches and there were strange red blossoms like drops of blood clinging to the points of long daggers Bird of Paradise plants were there too well named for their plumy splendour of crimson white and yellow and as the spring advanced the China trees brought memories of English lilacs The air was sweet with the scent of locust blossoms and along the clear horizon fantastically formed mountains seemed to float like changing cloud shapes The cattle which Knight had bought from the departing rancher had their corrals and scanty pastures far from the house but the cowboys quarters were near and Annesley never tired of seeing the laughing young men mount and ride their slim nervous horses This fact they got to know and performed incredible antics to excite her admiration They thought her beautiful and wondered if she had lost someone whom she loved that she should look so cold and sad These men though she seldom spoke to any were a comfort to Annesley Without their shouts and rough jokes and laughter the place would have been gloomy as a grave There was a colony of prairie dogs which she could visit by taking a long walk and they too were comforting It was Knight who told her of the creatures and where to seek them but he did not show her the way If things had been well between them the man s anxiety to please her would have been adorable to Annesley As soon as he saw the deficiencies of the house he went himself to El Paso to choose furniture and pretty simple chintzes old fashioned china and delicate glass bedroom and table damask He ordered books also and subscribed for magazines and papers Returning he said nothing of what he had done for he hoped that the surprise might prick the girl to interest rousing her from the lethargy which had settled over her like a fog But her gratitude was perfunctory She was always polite but the pretty things seemed to give her no real pleasure Knight had to realize that she was one of those people who when inwardly unhappy are almost incapable of feeling small joys Such as she had were found in getting away from him as far as possible She practically lived out of doors in the summertime taking pains to go where he would not pass on his rounds of the ranch and even after the sitting room had been made liveable with the new carpet laid by Knight and the chintz curtains he put up with his own hands she fled to her room for sanctuary Knight s search for capable servants was vain until he picked up a Chinaman from over the Mexican border illegal but valuable as a household asset Under the new regime there was good food and Annesley had no work save the hopeless task of finding happiness It was easy to see from the white set look of her face as the monotonous months dragged on that she was no nearer to accomplishing that task than on the day of her arrival Nothing that Knight could do made any difference When an upright cottage piano appeared one day the girl seemed distressed rather than pleased You shouldn t spend money on me she said in the gentle weary way that was becoming habitual It s the good fund money Knight explained hastily and almost humbly It s growing you know I ve struck some fine investments And I m going to do well with this ranch We don t need to economize I thought you d enjoy a piano Thank you You re very kind she answered as if he had been a stranger But I m out of practice I hardly feel energy to take it up again His hopes of what Texas might do for her faded slowly and even when their fire had died under cooling ashes his silent unobtrusive care never relaxed Only the deepest love such love as can remake a man s whole nature could have been strong enough to bear the strain But Annesley blinded by the anguish which never ceased to ache did not see that it was possible for such a nature to change She who had believed passionately in her hero of romance was stripped of all belief in him now as a young tree in blossom is stripped of its delicate bloom by an icy wind Not believing in him neither did she believe in his love She thought that he was sorry for her that he was grateful for what she had done to help him that perhaps for the time being he intended to turn over a new leaf not really for her sake but because he had been in danger of being found out Scornfully she told herself that this pretence at ranching was one of the many adventures dotted along his career one act in the melodrama of which he delighted to be the leading actor His own love of luxury and charming surroundings was enough to account for the improvements he hastened to make at the ranchhouse Anxiously she put away the thought that all he did was for her She did not wish to accept it She did not want the obligation of gratitude It even seemed puerile that he should attempt to make up for spoiling her life by supplying a few easy chairs and pictures and a Chinese cook He likes the things himself and can t live without them she insisted And it was to show him that he could not atone in such childish ways that she lived out of doors or hid in her own room At first she locked the door of that room when she entered thinking of it defiantly as her fortress which must be defended But when weeks grew into months and the enemy never attacked the fortress her vigilance relaxed She forgot to lock the door Summer passed Autumn and then winter came Knight was a good deal away for he had bought an interest in a newly opened copper mine in the Organ Mountains and was interested in the development which might mean fortune At night however he came back in the second hand motor car which he had got at a bargain price in El Paso and drove himself Annesley never failed to hear him return though she gave no sign And sometimes she would peep through the slats of her green shutters on one side of the patio at the windows of his bedroom and office which were opposite It was seldom that his light did not burn late and Annesley went to bed thinking hard thoughts asking herself what schemes of new adventure he might be plotting for the day when he should tire of the ranch Often she wondered that her life was not more hateful than it was for somehow it was not hateful Texas with its vast spaces and blowing gusts of ozone had begun to mean more for her than her cold reserve let Knight guess more than she herself could understand On Christmas morning when she opened her bedroom door she almost stumbled over a covered Mexican basket of woven coloured straws Something inside it moved and sighed She stooped lifted the cover and saw curled up on a bit of red blanketing a miniature Chihuahua dog It had a body as slight and shivering as a tendril of grapevine a tiny pointed face with a high forehead and immense almost human eyes At sight of her a thread of tail wagged and Annesley felt a warm impulse of affection toward the little creature Of course it was a present from Knight though there was no word to tell her so and if the dog had not looked at her with an offer of all its love and self she would perhaps have refused to accept it rather than encourage the giving of gifts But after that look she could not let the animal go Its possession made life warmer and it was good to see it lying in front of her open fire of mesquite roots She had no Christmas gift for Knight He had made soon after their coming to the ranch a cactus fence round the house enclosure and seeing the dry ugliness of the long straight sticks placed close together Annesley disliked and wondered at it At last she questioned Knight and complained that the bristly barrier was an eyesore She wished it might be taken down Wait till spring he answered It isn t a barrier it s an allegory Maybe when you see what happens you ll understand Maybe you won t It depends on your own feelings Annesley said no more but she did not forget She thought if her understanding of the allegory meant any change of feeling which the man might be looking for in her she would never understand She hated to look at the line of stark naked sticks but they and the allegory they represented constantly recurred to her mind One day in spring she noticed that the sticks looked less dry Knob like buds had broken out upon them the first sign that they were living things It happened to be Easter eve and she was restless full of strange thoughts as the yellow flowering grease wood bushes were full of rushing sap A year ago that night her love for her husband had died its sudden tragic death In the very act of forgiveness forgiveness had been killed Knight had gone off early that morning in his motor car the poor car which was a pathetic contrast to the glories of last year in England He had gone before she was up and had mentioned to the Chinese cook that he might not be back until late That means after midnight she told herself and since she was free as air she decided to take a long walk in the afternoon as far as the river It seemed that if she stayed in the house the thought of life as it might have been and life as it was would kill her on this day of all other days I wish I could die she said But not here Somewhere a long way off from everyone and from him As she passed the cactus fence the buds were big Across the river where the water flowed high and wide just then lay Mexico Annesley had never been there though she could easily have gone had she wished from the ranch to El Paso and from El Paso to the queer old historic town of Juarez But she could not have gone without Knight and there was no pleasure in travelling with him Besides there was trouble across the border and fierce fighting now and then There had been some thievish raids made by Mexicans upon ranches along the river not many miles away and that reminded her how Knight had remarked some weeks ago that she had better not go alone as far as the river bank It isn t likely that anything would happen by day he said but you might be shot at from the other side Annesley was not afraid and there was a faint stirring of pleasure in the thought that she was doing something against his wish on this anniversary Deliberately she sat alone by the river waiting for the pageant of sunset to pass and when she reached home the moon was up a great white moon that turned the waving waste of pale sparse grasses to a silver sea She had taken sandwiches and fruit with her telling the cook that she would want no dinner when she came back Away in the cow punchers quarters there was music and she flung herself into a hammock on the veranda to rest and listen There was a soft yet cool wind from the south bringing the fragrance of creosote blossoms and it seemed to the girl that never had she seen such white floods of moonlight not even that night a year ago at Valley House Even the sky was milk white There were no black shadows anywhere only dove gray ones except under the veranda roof Her hammock was screened from the light by one dark shadow like a straight hung curtain Save for the music of a fiddle and men s voices the silver white world lay silent in enchanted sleep Then suddenly something moved A tall dark figure was coming to the veranda It paused at the cactus fence Could it be Knight home already and on foot No it was a woman She walked straight and fast and unhesitating to the veranda where she sat down on the steps Annesley raised herself on her elbow and peered out of the concealing shadow Who could the woman be It was on the tip of her tongue to call Who are you when a sudden lifting of the bent face under a drooping hat brought it beneath the searchlight of the moon The woman was the Countess de Santiago and the moon s radiance so lit her dark eyes that she seemed to look straight at Annesley in her hammock The girl s heart gave a leap of some emotion like fear yet not fear She did not stop to analyze it but she knew that she wished to escape from the woman and an instant s reflection told her that she could not be seen if she kept still She began to think quickly and her thoughts confused at first straightened themselves out like threads disentangled from a knot The woman had marched up to the veranda with such unfaltering certainty that it seemed she must have been there before Perhaps she had arrived while the mistress of the house was out and had been walking about the place to pass away the time But she hasn t come to see me the girl in the hammock thought She has come to see Knight It s for him she is waiting Anger stirred in Annesley s heart anger against Knight as well as against Madalena Has he written and told her to come she asked herself Does she think she can stay in this house No she shall not I won t have her here She was half minded to rise abruptly and surprise the Countess as the Countess had surprised her to ask why she had come and to show that she was not welcome But if Madalena were here at Knight s invitation she would stay There would be a scene perhaps The thought was revolting Annesley lay still and in the distance she heard the throbbing of a motor CHAPTER XXV THE ALLEGORY Annesley knew that Knight was in the habit of coming home that way in order not to disturb her with the noise of the car if she had gone to bed If he were bringing parcels from the little mining town he drove to the house left the packets and ran the auto to a shanty he had rigged up for a garage A few seconds later the small open car came into sight and Madalena sprang up waving a dark veil she had snatched off her hat She feared no doubt that the man might take another direction and perhaps get into the house by some door she did not know before she could intercept him From a little distance the tall figure standing on the veranda steps must have been silhouetted black against the white wall of the house clearly to be seen from the advancing motor Quick as a bird in flight the car sped along the road wheeled on to the stiff grass and drew up close to the veranda steps Good heavens Madalena Annesley heard her husband exclaim I thought it was my wife and that something had gone wrong The surprise sharpening his tone did away with the doubt in the mind of the hidden listener She had said to herself that the woman was here by appointment and that this hour had been chosen because the meeting was to be secret I wanted you to think so and to come straight to this place returned the once familiar voice Don I ve travelled from San Francisco to see you Do say you are glad I can t the man answered I m not glad You tried to ruin me You tried in a coward s way You struck me in the back I hoped never to see you again How did you find me I ve known for a long time that you were in Texas said Madalena Lady Annesley Seton and I kept up a correspondence for months after you sent me away so cruelly in such a hurry believing hateful things though you had no proof She wrote that mister and missus Nelson Smith would probably never come back to England to settle as she d heard from a missus Waldo that they d gone to live in Texas She asked if I knew whether Nelson Smith had lost his money I forgot to answer that question when I answered the letter But when she said Texas I felt sure you must be somewhere in this part I remembered your telling me about the ranch that consumptive gambler left to you on the Mexican frontier What a fool I was to tell you Knight exclaimed roughly The words and his way of flinging them at her were like a box on the ear and Annesley lying in her hammock heard with a thrill of pleasure She was ashamed of the thrill and ashamed because suddenly awakened to the realization that she was eavesdropping But it seemed impossible that she should break in upon this talk and reveal her presence She felt that she could not do it though searching her conscience she was not sure whether she clung to silence because it was the lesser of two evils or because she longed with a terrible longing to know whether these two would patch up their old partnership If you knew why I have come all these miles maybe you would not be so hard Madalena pleaded That I can t tell until I do hear said Knight dryly I am going to explain she tried to soothe him A great thing has happened I can be rich and live easily all the rest of my years if I choose But I wanted to see you before deciding I arrived in El Paso yesterday and went to the Paso del Norte Hotel to inquire about you I was almost certain you would have taken back your own name because I knew you used to be known by it when you stayed in Texas I soon found out that I d guessed right I heard you d stopped at that hotel last year on the way to your ranch I hired a motor car and came here to day but I didn t let the man bring me to the house I didn t want to dash up and advertise myself I questioned some of your cowmen They said you d gone off and would be getting back at night in your automobile not earlier than ten and maybe a good deal later So I waited The car I hired is a covered one and I sat in it a long way from the house out of sight behind a little rising of the land Perhaps you call it a hill We do said Knight I brought some food and wine The chauffeur s there with the car now He has cigarettes and doesn t mind if we stay all night I mind Knight cut her short You can t stay all night The road s good enough with such a moon for you to get back to El Paso You d better start so as to reach there before she sets Wait till you hear why I ve come before you advise me to hurry the Countess protested There s no danger of our being disturbed is there Where is your wife In bed and asleep I trust I m glad Then will you sit on the top of these steps in this heavenly moonlight and let me tell you things that are important to me Perhaps you may think they are important to you as well Who knows I know Nothing you can have to say will be important to me I won t sit down thank you I ve been sitting in my car for hours I prefer to stand Very well But how hard you are Even now you won t believe I was innocent of that thing you accused me of doing I think now what I thought then You were not innocent but guilty You were just a plain ordinary sneak Madalena because you were jealous and spiteful It is not true Spiteful against you It was never in my heart to lie Jealous perhaps But that is not to say I wrote the letter you believe I wrote You didn t give me time to try and prove I did not write the letter You accused me brutally You ordered me out of England with threats I obeyed because I was heartbroken not because I was afraid Why trouble to excuse yourself he asked It s not worth the time it takes If you ve come to tell me anything in particular tell it and let s make an end I have an offer of marriage from a millionaire the Countess announced in a clear triumphant tone Which no doubt you accepted not to say snapped at Not yet I put him off because I wanted to see you before I answered You flatter me Knight laughed not pleasantly If you ve come from San Francisco to get my advice on that subject I can give it while you count three Make sure of the unfortunate wretch before he changes his mind Ah if I could think that your harshness comes from just a little ever so little jealousy Madalena sighed He won t change his mind There is no danger He is old and I seem a young girl to him He adores me He is on his knees Bad for rheumatism He thinks I am the most wonderful creature who ever lived I met him through my work He came from a friend of his who told him about my crystal and about me too You are still working the crystal But of course It has always given me the path to success If I marry this man I shall be able to rest On your laurels such as they are On his money He can t live many years You are an affectionate fiancee I am not a fiancee yet Not till I give my answer And that depends on you Oh Don surely you must be sick of this this existence for it is not life I know you are angry with me but you can t hate me really It is not possible for a man with blood in his body to hate a woman who loves him as I love you I have tried to get over it At first I thought I was succeeding But no when the reaction came I found that I cared more than ever We were born for each other It must be so for without you I am only half alive I haven t come for your advice Don but to make you an offer Oh not an offer of myself I should not dare as you feel now And it is not an offer from me only it is from a great person who has something to give which is worth your accepting even if my love is not You ve got in touch with him have you Knight broke into the rushing torrent of her words as a man might take a plunge into a cataract Why not she answered I didn t seek him out It was he who sought me You don t know how to speak the truth Madalena You said you found me through Lady Annesley Seton hearing from missus Waldo whereas you wrote to Paul Van Vreck You do me injustice always I did hear from Constance Then I merely ventured to write and ask mister Van Vreck if he kept up communication with you and You said in your letter to him that you knew where I was and gave him to understand that we were in touch with each other or he would have let out nothing He has written and told you this She spoke breathlessly as if in fear Ah you give yourself away No I haven t heard from Van Vreck since I saw him in New York and thought I convinced him that my working days for him were over I simply guessed knowing you what you would do I may have mentioned Texas Madalena admitted I supposed he knew where you were I couldn t have told him because I didn t know But he wrote and suggested I should use my influence with you to reconsider your decision Those were his words How much has he paid you for coming here Nothing As if I would take money for coming to you You have taken it for some queer things and will again if you don t settle down to private life with your millionaire It s no use Madalena Go back to San Francisco Send in your bill to Van Vreck Tell him there s nothing doing And make up your mind to marriage But Don you haven t heard what he offers It can t be more than he offered me himself when I saw him in New York It is more He says that particularly He raises the offer from last time It is three times higher Think what that means Oh Don it means life real life not stagnation I would give up safety and a million to be with you as your partner again your humble partner Here on this bleak ranch it is like death a death of dullness I know what you must be suffering because you are obstinate because you have taken a resolve and are determined not to break it You are afraid it will be weakness to break it There can be no other reason I have asked questions about your life here I have learned things I know she is cold as ice If you stay you will degenerate You will become a clod Leave this hideous gray place Leave that woman who treats you like a dog Let the ranch be hers Send her money You will have it to spare She can divorce you and you will be freed forever from the one great mistake you ever made As for me As for you be silent The command struck like a whiplash You are not worthy to speak of that woman as you call her If I did what you deserve I d send you off without another word turn my back on you and let you go But he drew in his breath sharply then went on as if he had taken some tonic decision I want you to understand why if Paul Van Vreck offered me all his money and you offered me the love of all the women on earth with your own I shouldn t be tempted to accept It s because of that woman who is my wife It may be true that she treats me like a dog for she wouldn t be cruel to the meanest cur But I d rather be her dog than any other woman s master So you see now It s come to that with me I won her love and married her for my own advantage I lost her love because she found me out through you Mild justice that perhaps But all the same getting her for mine has been for my advantage In a different way from what I planned but ten thousand times greater Though she s taken her love from me she s given me back my soul Nothing can rob me of that so long as I run straight And I tell you Madalena this ranch where I m working out some kind of expiation and maybe redemption is God s earth for me Now do you understand For an instant the woman was silent Then she broke into loud sobbing which she did not try to check You are a fool Don she wept A fool Maybe But I m not the devil s fool as I used to be Don t cry You might be heard Come It s time to go We ve said all we have to say to each other except good bye if that s not mockery Madalena dried her tears still sobbing under her breath At least take me to the automobile she said Don t send me off alone in the night I am afraid There s nothing to be afraid of Knight answered the flame of his fierceness burnt down But I ll go with you and put you on the way back to El Paso Come along As he spoke he started and Madalena was forced to go with him forced to keep up with his long strides if she would not be left behind When they had gone Annesley lay motionless as though she were under a spell The man s words to the other woman wove the spell which bound her listening as they repeated themselves in her mind Again and again she heard them as they had fallen from his lips His expiation perhaps his redemption here on his bit of God s earth It may be true that she treats me like a dog But I d rather be her dog than any other woman s master And this was Easter eve a year to the night since his martyrdom began Something seemed to seize Annesley by the hand and break the bonds that had held her something strong although invisible She sat up with a faint cry as of one awakened from a dream and slipped out of the hammock There was a dim idea in her mind that she must go along the road where they had gone so as to meet Knight on his way back She did not know what she should say to him or whether she could say anything at all but the something which had taken her hand and snatched her out of the hammock dragged her on and on At first she obeyed the force blindly I must see him I must see him The words spoke themselves in her head But when she had hurried out of the enclosure walled in by the cactus hedge the brilliant moonlight seemed to pierce her brain and make a cold calm appeal to her reason You can t tell him what you have heard it said He would be humiliated Or the thought was sharp as a gimlet what if he saw you and knew you were listening What if he talked just for effect He is so clever He is subtle enough for that And wouldn t it be more like the man than to say what he said sincerely She stopped and was thankful not to see her husband returning There was time to go back if she hurried And she must hurry If he had seen her in her hammock and made that theatrical attempt to play upon her feelings he would laugh at his own success if she followed him And if he had not seen her and were in earnest it would be best indeed the only right way not to let him guess that the scene on the veranda steps had had a witness Annesley turned to fly back faster than she had come But passing the cactus hedge her dress caught It was as if the hedge sentiently took hold of her She bent down to free the thin white material and suddenly colour blazed up to her eyes in the rain of silver moonlight The buds had opened since she noticed them last No longer was the hedge a grim barricade of stiff dark sticks Each stalk had turned into a tall straight flame of lambent rose From a dead thing of dreary ugliness it had become a thing of living beauty Knight s allegory He had said perhaps she might understand when the time came and perhaps not She did understand But she had not faith to believe that the miracle could repeat itself in life her life and Knight s She shut her eyes to the thought and when she had freed her dress ran very fast to the house CHAPTER XXVI THE THREE WORDS Knight was generally far away long before Annesley was up in the morning and often he did not come in till evening She thought that on Easter Day however he would perhaps not go far She half expected that he would linger about the house or sit reading on the veranda and she could not resist the temptation to put on one of the dresses he had liked in England It was a little passe and old fashioned but he would not know this What he might remember was that she had worn it at Valley House And the wish to say something as if accidentally about the flaming miracle of the cactus hedge was as persistent in her heart as the desire of a crocus to push through the earth to the sunshine on a spring morning She did not know whether the wish would survive the meeting with her husband She thought that would depend as much upon him as upon her mood But luncheon time came and Knight did not appear Annesley lunched alone in her gray frock Even on days when Knight was with her and they sat through their meals formally it was the same as if she were alone for they spoke little and each was in the habit of bringing a book to the table But she had not meant it to be so on this Easter Day Even if she did not speak of the blossoming of the cactus she had planned to show Knight that she was willing to begin a conversation To talk at meals would be a way out of treating him like a dog The pretty frock and the good intention were wasted Late in the afternoon she heard from one of the line riders whom she happened to see that something had gone wrong with a windmill which gave water to the pumps for the cattle and that her husband was attending to it He s a natural born engineer said the man whose business as line rider was to keep up the wire fencing from one end of the ranch to the other I don t know how much he knows but I know what he can do Queer thing ma am There don t seem to be much that Mike Donaldson can t do Annesley smiled to hear Knight called Mike by one of his employees She knew that he was popular but never before had she felt personal pleasure in the men s tributes of affection To day she felt a thrill Her heart was warm with the spring and the miracle of the cactus hedge and memories of impetuous seemingly impetuous words of last night If she could have seen Knight she would have spoken of his allegory and that small opening might have let sunlight into their darkness But he did not come even to dinner and tired of waiting and weary from a sleepless night she went to bed Next morning a man arrived who wished to buy a bunch of Donaldson s cattle which were beginning to be famous He stayed several days and when he left Knight had business at the copper mine business that concerned the sinking of a new shaft which took him back and forth nearly every day for a week By and by the cactus flowers began to fade and Annesley had never found an opportunity of mentioning them or what they might signify When she met Knight his manner was as usual kind unobtrusive slightly stiff as though he were embarrassed though he never showed signs of embarrassment with any one else She could hardly believe that she had not dreamed those words overheard in the moonlight Week after week slipped away The one excitement at Las Cruces Ranch was the fighting across the border the great scare at El Paso and the stories of small yet sometimes tragic raids made by bands of cattle stealers upon American ranches which touched the Rio Grande The water was low This made private marauding expeditions easier and the men of Las Cruces Ranch were prepared for anything One night in May there was a sandstorm which as usual played strange tricks with Annesley s nerves She could never grow used to these storms and the moaning of the hot wind seemed to her a voice that wailed for coming trouble Knight had been away on one of his motoring expeditions to the Organ Mountains and though he had told the Chinese boy that he would be back for dinner he did not come Doors and windows were closed against the blowing sand but they could not shut out the voice of the wind After dinner Annesley tried to read a new book from the library at El Paso but between her eyes and the printed page would float the picture of a small open automobile and its driver lost in clouds of yellow sand Why should she care The man was used to roughing it He liked adventures He was afraid of nothing and nothing ever hurt him But she did care She seemed to feel the sting of the sharp grains of sand on cheeks and eyes She was sitting in her own room as she was accustomed to do in the evening if she were not out on the veranda the pretty room which Knight had extravagantly made possible for her with chintzes and furnishings from the best shops in El Paso On this evening however she set both doors wide open one which led into the living room another leading into a corridor or hall She could not fail to hear her husband when he came even if he left his noisy car at the garage and walked to the house A travelling clock on the mantelpiece Constance Annesley Seton s gift struck nine The girl looked up at the first stroke wondering if serious accidents were likely to happen in sandstorms and before the last note had ended she heard steps in the patio He has come she thought with a throb of relief which shamed her But the step was not like Knight s It was hurried and nervous and as she told herself this there sounded a loud knock at the door There was an electric bell which Knight had fitted up with his own hands but it was not visible at night No one except herself could hear this knocking for the servants quarters were at the far end of the bungalow A little frightened recalling stories of cattle thieves and things they had done Annesley went into the hall Who is there she cried her face near the closed door which locked itself in shutting If a man s voice the voice of a stranger should reply in Mex or with a foreign accent the girl did not intend to let him in A man s voice did reply but neither in Mex nor with a foreign accent It said My name is Paul Van Vreck Open quickly please I may be followed Annesley s heart jumped but without hesitation she pulled back the latch and as she opened the door a rush of sand laden wind wrenched it from her hand She staggered away as the door swung free and there was just time to see a tall thin figure slip in like a shadow before the light of the hanging lamp blew out The girl and the newcomer were in the dark save for a yellow ray that filtered into the hall from her room but she saw him stoop to place a bag or bundle on the floor and then pulling the door to against the wind slammed it shut with a click Having done this the tall shadow bent to pick up what it had laid down Thank you missus Donaldson for letting me in said the most charming voice Annesley had ever heard more charming even than Knight s Evidently you ve heard your husband mention me or you might have kept me out there parleying if you re alone for these are stirring times Yes I I ve heard you mentioned by many people the girl answered stammering like a nervous child Won t you come in into the living room Not the room with the open door That s mine It s another farther along the hall I m sorry my husband s out As she talked she wondered at herself She knew Van Vreck for a super thief He did not steal with his own hands but he commanded other hands to steal and that was even worse Or she had thought it worse in her husband s case and for more than a year she had punished him for his sins Yet here she was almost welcoming this man She did not understand why she felt even without seeing him except as a shadow that she would find herself wishing to do whatever he might ask It must be she thought the influence of his voice She had heard Paul Van Vreck spoken of as an old man but the voice was the voice of magnetic youth He opened the door of the living room and carrying his bundle followed her as she entered There was only one lamp in this room a tall reading lamp with a green silk shade which stood on a table its heavy base surrounded by books and magazines A good light for reading was thrown from under the green shade on to the table but the rest of the room was of a cool green dimness and looking up with irresistible curiosity at the face of her night visitor it floated pale on a vague background like a portrait by Whistler It was unnaturally white the girl thought and yes it was old But it was a wonderful face and the eyes illumined it immense eyes though deepset and looking out of shadowed hollows under level brows black as ink Annesley had never seen eyes so like strange jewels lit from behind That simile came to her and she smiled for it was appropriate that this jewel expert should have jewels for eyes They were dark topazes and from them gazed the spirit of the man with a compelling charm Under a rolled back wave of iron gray hair he had a broad forehead high cheekbones a pointed prominent chin a mouth both sweet and humorous like that of some enchanting woman but its sweetness was contradicted by a hawk nose Had it not been for that nose he would have been handsome I guessed by the startled tone of your voice when you asked Who is there that your husband was out explained the shadow now transformed by the light into an extremely tall extremely thin man in gray travelling clothes I had a moment of repentance at troubling a lady alone but you see the case was urgent He had carelessly tossed his Panama hat on to the table but kept the black bag which he now held out with a smile Not a big bag is it And so common it wouldn t be likely to tempt a thief But it holds what is worth if it has a price about half a million dollars Oh exclaimed Annesley She looked horrified and through the green gloom the old man read her face I see he said with a laugh in his young voice You have heard the great secret That makes another who knows But I m not afraid you ll throw me to the dogs You wouldn t do that even if you weren t Donaldson s wife Being his wife you could not My husband has told me no secret about you none at all the girl protested defending Knight involuntarily I beg you to believe that mister Van Vreck I do believe it If there s one thing I pride myself on it s being a judge of character That s why I ve made a success of life You wouldn t lie perhaps not even to save the one you love best I believe that he did not tell you the secret Yet I m certain you know it I suppose other discoveries you must have made gave you supernatural intuition You guessed Annesley did not answer Yet she could not take her eyes from his You needn t mind confessing But I won t catechize you I ll take it for granted that what Donaldson knows you know not in detail in the rough In this bag are six gold images set with precious stones They are of the time of the Incas and they ve been up till now the most precious things in Mexico From now on they will be among the most precious things in Paul Van Vreck s secret collection Some weeks ago I hoped that Donaldson would get them for me He refused so I had to go myself I couldn t trust any one else though the only difficulty was getting to Central Mexico with Constitutionals raging on one side and Federals on the other A man promised to deliver the goods to my messenger I ve been bargaining over these things for years But as I said Don wouldn t go so I had to do the job myself You see missus Donaldson your husband is the only honest man I ever came across Honest The exclamation burst from Annesley s lips Yes Honest is the word I might add two others true and loyal Paul Van Vreck held her with his strange straight look commanding yet amused That is the opinion he added after a pause of a very old friend It s worth its weight in gold images The girl gave him no answer But the effort of keeping her face under control made lips and eyelids quiver May I sit down missus Donaldson Van Vreck asked in a tone which changed to commonplaceness if his voice could ever be commonplace I m a fugitive and have had a run for my money so to speak I m seeking sanctuary Also I came in the hope of trying my eloquence on Donaldson But now I ve seen you I will not do that In future he s safe from me I promise you Oh Annesley faltered And then Thank you came out grudgingly How astonishing that she should thank Paul Van Vreck the monster of wickedness and secrecy she had pictured for sparing her husband her husband whom he called loyal true and honest whom she had called in her heart a thief Do sit down she hurried on hypnotized Forgive my not asking you I I understand he soothed her I ve taken advantage of you sprung a surprise as Don would say and then turned on the tortures of the Inquisition Aren t you going to sit I can t you know if you don t I thought you might like something to eat the girl stammered I could call our cook No thank you replied Van Vreck I m peculiar in more ways than one I never eat at night I live mostly on milk water fruit and nuts That s why I feel forty at seventy two I give out that I m frail an invalid that I spend much time in nursing homes This is my joke on a public which has no business to be curious about my habits While it thinks I m recuperating in a nursing home I but no matter That won t interest you When she had obediently sat down her knees trembling a little Van Vreck drew up a chair for himself and resting his arms on the table leaned across it gazing at the girl with a queer humorous benevolence How soon do you think your husband will come he asked abruptly I don t know Annesley replied He told our Chinese boy he d be early I suppose the sandstorm has delayed him No doubt And you re worried No o she answered looking sidewise at Van Vreck her face half turned from him I don t think that I m worried May I talk to you frankly till Don does come the old man asked Certainly I ll take you at your word missus Donaldson when your husband called on me a year ago last spring in New York he said nothing about you I knew he d married an English girl of good connections isn t that what you say on your side and why he thought it would be wise to marry But when he informed me that our association was to be ended that nothing would induce him to continue it I read between the lines I m sharp at that I knew as well as if he d told me that he d fallen in love with the girl that she d unexpectedly become the important factor in his life and that she d found out a secret she d never been meant to find out his secret and maybe mine I realized by his face the look in the eyes the tone of the voice or rather the tonelessness of the voice what her finding out meant for Don I read by all signs that she was making him suffer atrociously and I owed that girl a grudge She d taken him from me For the first time a power stronger than mine was at work and yet things being as they were my hope of getting him back lay in her What do you mean The question spoke itself Annesley s lips felt cold and stiff Her hands nervously clasped in her lap were cold too though the shut up room had but lately seemed hot as a furnace I mean if the girl behaved as I thought she would behave as I think you have behaved he might grow tired of her and the cast iron coat of virtue he d put on to please her He might grow tired of life on a ranch if his wife made him eat ashes and wear sack cloth That was my hope Well I sent a messenger to find out how the land lay a few weeks ago The Countess de Santiago Annesley exclaimed He told you No I saw her I by accident it really was by accident I heard things He doesn t know I believe he doesn t know I was there Perhaps that s just as well Perhaps not But if I were you I d tell him when the right time comes The Countess wrote me she d had her journey in vain and why She said spitefully it struck me that Don was bewitched by his wife a cold cruel creature with ice in her veins who treated him like a dog She said that to you too Yes she said that She seemed to gather the impression But the dog stuck to his kennel Nothing she could do would tempt him to budge So I decided to call here myself on the way back from Mexico I couldn t delay the trip A man was waiting for me And waiting quietly is difficult in Mexico just now I got what I wanted and crammed the lot into this bag which cost me at the outside if I remember five dollars A good idea of mine for putting thieves off the track They expect sane men to carry nightgowns and newspapers in such bags I thought I d managed so well that I d put the gang who follow me about generally on spec off the track I speak Spanish well I ve been passing for a Mexican lawyer from Chihuahua But to day I caught a look from a pair of eyes in a train I fancied I d seen those eyes before and the rest of the features Perhaps I imagined it But I don t think so I trust my instinct I advise you to It s a tip At El Paso I bought a ticket for Albuquerque The eyes were behind me I got into the train So did Eyes and a friend with a long nose Not into my car however so I was able to skip out again as the train was starting Not a bad feat for a man of my age I hope Eyes and Nose and any other features that may have been with them travelled on unsuspectingly But I can t be sure Instinct says they saw my trick and trumped it I oughtn t to have come here bringing danger to your house missus Donaldson But I want to see Don and I know he is afraid neither of man nor devil afraid of nothing in the world except one woman As for her well what I d heard hadn t prepossessed me in her favour I sacrificed her for the safety of my golden images and my talk with Don But the sound of your voice behind the shut door broke the picture I d made of that young woman And when I saw you well missus Donaldson I ve already told you I don t intend to exert my influence over your husband though to do so was my principal object in coming Even if I did I believe yours would prove stronger But if I could count on all my old power over him I wouldn t use it now I have seen you I adore myself and my specialties But there must be an unselfish streak in me which shows in moments like this I respect and admire it You may treat Don like a dog but he d never be happy away from you And I am fool enough to want him to be happy This kicked dog of yours madame happens to be the finest fellow I ever knew or expect to know You say I treat him like a dog cried Annesley roused to anger But how ought I to treat him He came into my life in a way I thought romantic as a fairy tale It was a trick a play got up to deceive me I knew nothing of his life but because of the faith he inspired I believed in him No one except himself could have broken that belief I would not have listened to a word against him But when he thought I d discovered something the whole story came out If I hadn t loved him so much to begin with and put him on such a high pedestal the fall wouldn t have been so great wouldn t have broken my heart in pieces But Don gave up everything pleasant in his life and came down here to this God forsaken ranch a man like Michael Donaldson with a few hundred dollars where he d had thousands all for you said Van Vreck and he s had no thought except for you and the ranch for more than a year Yet apparently you haven t changed your opinion By Jove madame you must somehow through your personality and God knows what besides have got a mighty hold on his heart in the days when you loved him or he wouldn t have stood this dog s life this punishment too harsh for human nature to bear Good Lord how were you brought up Evidently not as a Christian My father was a clergyman said Annesley There are many clergymen who have got as far from the light as the moon from the earth I know more about Christianity myself than some of those narrow men with their cold Christs and tangled Trinities That is I know all this on principle I don t practise what I know but that s my affair Did Don ever excuse himself by mentioning the influence I brought to bear on him when he was almost a boy No breathed Annesley He didn t excuse himself at all except to tell me about his father and mother and a vow he d made to revenge them on society It was like him not to whine for your forgiveness He would never whine the girl agreed But she remembered that night of confession when on his knees he had begged her to forgive to grant him another chance and she had refused He had never asked again And he had struggled alone for redemption I haven t forgotten some early teachings which impressed me said Paul Van Vreck Christ made a remark about forgiving till seventy times seven Did you forgive Donaldson four hundred and eighty nine times and draw the line at the four hundred and ninetieth No I never had anything to forgive him till that one thing came out But it was a very big thing Too big Too big eh There was another saying of Christ s about those without sin throwing the first stone Of course I m sure you were without sin But you look as if you might have had a heart once Oh I had I had Tears streamed down Annesley s pale face and she did not wipe them away It s dead now I think Think again Think of what the man is what he s proved himself to be He s twice as good now as one of your best saints of the Church He s purified by fire You ve got the face of an angel missus Donaldson but in my opinion you re a wicked woman unworthy of the love you ve inspired You speak to me cruelly the girl said through her tears I ve been very unhappy Not as unhappy as you ve made Don by your cruelty Good heavens these tender girls can be more cruel when they set about punishing us than the hardest man And to punish a fellow like that by making him live in an ice house when you could have done anything with him by a little kindness Don t I know that I m the sponsor for such sins as Don s committed He was meant to be straight But I got hold of him through an agent and caught his imagination when that wild vow was freshly branded on his heart or brain I have the gift of fascination missus Donaldson I know that better than I know most things You feel it to night or you wouldn t sit there letting me tear your heart to pieces what s left of your heart And I have an idea there s a good deal more than you think if you have the sense to patch the bits together I have fascination and I ve cultivated it Napoleon himself didn t study more ardently than I the art of winning men I won Don I appealed to the romance in him I became his hero and slowly I was able to make him my servant Not much of my money or anything else has ever stuck to his hands He s too generous too impulsive though I taught him it was necessary to control his impulses What he did he did for love of me till you came along and lit another sort of fire in his blood I saw in one minute when he called on me what had happened to his soul It s taken you more than a year to see though he s lived for you and would have died for you Great Heaven young woman you ought to be on your knees before a miracle of God Instead you ve mounted a marble pedestal and worshipped your own purity Annesley bowed her head under a wave of shame This man of all others had shown her a vision of herself as she was It seemed that she could never lift her eyes But suddenly into the crying of the wind a shot broke sharply then another and another till the sobbing wail was lost in a crackling fusillade The girl leaped to her feet Raiders she gasped Or else Paul Van Vreck sprang up also his face paler his eyes brighter than before They ve come after me he said Clever trick if they ve bribed ruffians from over the border to cover their ends The real errand s here inside this house Annesley s heart faltered You must hide she breathed I must save you somehow Why should you save me Van Vreck asked sharply Why not think about saving yourself Because I know Knight would wish to save you she answered I want to do what he would do God help us they re coming nearer Take your bag and I ll hide you in the cellar There s a corner there behind some barrels If they break in I ll say Brave girl But they won t break in How do you know Your husband won t let them Trust him as I do He s not here Do you think I told you a lie Thank Heaven he isn t here or they d kill him and I could never beg him to forgive She covered her face with her hands The old man looked at her gravely You don t understand what s happening he said with a new gentleness Don s out there now defending you and his home That s what the shooting means Do you think those brutes would advertise themselves with their guns if they hadn t been attacked With a cry the girl rushed to the long window and began to unfasten it but Van Vreck caught her hands Stop he commanded Don t play the robbers own game for them How do you know which is nearer the house Don and his men or the others She stared at him panting Don and his men she echoed Yes Even if he were alone to begin with I ll bet all I ve got he roused every cowpuncher on the ranch with his first shot and they d be out with their guns like a streak of greased lightning If you open that window with a light in the room the wrong lot may get in and barricade themselves against Don and his bunch to say nothing of what would happen to us But Annesley waited for no more She ran to the table and blew out the flame of the green shaded lamp Black darkness shut down like the lid of a box But she knew the room as she knew her own features Straight and unerring she found her way back to the window This time Van Vreck stood still while she opened it and began noiselessly to undo the outside wooden shutters As she pushed them apart against the wind a spray of sand dashed into her face and Van Vreck s stinging their eyelids But disregarding the pain the two passed out into the night Clouds of blowing sand hid the stars yet there was a faint glimmer of light which showed moving figures on horseback Men were shouting and with the bark of their guns fire spouted Annesley rushed on to the veranda but Van Vreck caught her dress Stay where you are he ordered Our side is winning Don t you see don t you hear the fight s going farther away That means the raid s failed the skunks have got the worst of it They re trying to get back to the river and across to their own country There ll be some I bet who ll never see Mexico again But Knight the girl faltered He may be shot He may We ve got to take the chances and hope for the best He wouldn t leave the chase now if every door and window were open and lit for him Wait Watch That s the only thing to do She yielded to the detaining hand All strength had gone out of her She staggered a little and fell back against Van Vreck s shoulder He held her up strongly as though he had been a young man How can I live through it she moaned You care for him after all then she heard the calm voice asking in her ear And she heard her own voice answer I love him more than ever She knew that it was true true in spite of everything and that she had never ceased to love him It would be joy to give her life to save Knight s with just one moment of breath to tell him that his atonement had not been vain Away out of sight the chase went but the watching eyes had time to see that not all the figures were on horseback Some ran on foot and some horses were riderless As Van Vreck had said there was nothing for him and for Annesley to do except to wait They stood silent in the rain of sand listening when there was nothing more to see The shots were scattered and blurred by distance Annesley realized how a heart may stop beating in the anguish of suspense But at last when the fierce wind purring like a tiger was the only sound in the night there came a sudden padding of feet A form stumbled up the veranda steps and before she could cry out in her surprise the girl recognized their Chinese servant She had fancied him in bed But she might have known he would be out He had been running so fast that his breath came chokingly What is it Annesley implored The boy pointed trying to speak Bling Mist Donal back he gulped Me come tell Annesley pushed past him and springing down the steps ran blindly through the sand cloud taking the way by which the Chinese boy must have come home Her mind pictured a procession carrying a dead man or one grievously wounded but at the cactus hedge she came upon three men one in the centre who limped two who supported him on either side Why Anita exclaimed her husband s voice Knight she sobbed It was the first time since Easter a year ago that she had given him the old name Thank God you re alive If you thank Him so do I he answered whether lightly or gravely she could not tell His tone was controlled as if to hide pain It s all right You mustn t worry any more Wish I could have sent you news sooner I hoped you d guess we were getting the upper hand when the shots died away Coming home I spotted the sneaks fording the river I turned the car and stirred up the boys Then we had a shindy and scared the dogs cold bagged a few but I guess nobody croaked anyhow none of our crowd Half a dozen are after the curs As for me I feel as if I d got a dum dum in my ankle but I ll be fit as a fiddle in a week or two I m afraid you had a fright How strange it was to hear him speak so coolly after what she had endured But his calmness quieted her mister Van Vreck was with me she said Van Vreck Great Scott then the raid was a frameup I see Boys let s get along to the house quick Wait an instant the girl intervened Knight I never had a chance to tell you about the cactus blossoms I understood I understand even better now mister Van Vreck has made me understand That is all I can tell you Let them help you to the house I ll follow Some other time I ll explain No now he said Let go a minute boys I can stand by myself Three words with my wife As the two men moved off hastily Annesley sprang forward giving her shoulder for her husband s support Lean on me she said Oh Knight you don t need an explanation for the three words are love love and forgiveness Forgiveness from you to me He held out his arms and caught her to him fiercely Neither could speak The past was forgotten Only the present and future counted Both the man and woman had
