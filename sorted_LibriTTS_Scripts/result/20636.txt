in the establishment of a Museum in Poughkeepsie I have by extensive travel and research and by the kindness of many of my fellow citizens in Dutchess county and elsewhere obtained numerous objects not only curious in themselves but valuable as materials for history Among these are two manuscript Journals kept by common soldiers each during a single campaign and written at periods seventeen years apart One of these soldiers served in a campaign of the conflict known as the FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR which commenced a hundred years ago the other soldier assisted in the siege of Boston by the American army in seventeen seventy five and seventeen seventy six Believing that a faithful transcript of those Journals given verbatim et literatim as recorded by the actors themselves might have an interest for American readers as exhibiting the every day life of a common soldier in those wars which led to the founding of our republic I have yielded to the solicitations of friends and the dictates of my own judgment and feelings and in the following pages present to the public faithful copies of those diaries Perceiving that much of the intrinsic value of these Journals would consist in a proper understanding of the historical facts to which allusions are made in them I prevailed upon mister LOSSING the well known author of the Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution to illustrate and elucidate these diaries by explanatory notes His name is a sufficient guaranty for their accuracy and general usefulness and I flatter myself that this little volume will not only amuse but edify and that the useful objects aimed at in its publication will be fully attained With this hope it is submitted to my fellow citizens ABRAHAM TOMLINSON POUGHKEEPSIE MUSEUM December eighteen fifty four INTRODUCTORY REMARKS The conflict known in America as the French and Indian War and in Europe as the Seven Years War originated in disputes between the French and English colonists in the New World concerning territorial limits For a century the colonies of the two nations had been gradually expanding and increasing in importance The English more than a million in number occupied the seaboard from the Penobscot to the saint Mary s a thousand miles in extent all eastward of the great ranges of the Alleganies and far northward toward the saint Lawrence The French not more than a hundred thousand strong made settlements along the saint Lawrence the shores of the great lakes on the Mississippi and its tributaries and upon the borders of the gulf of Mexico They early founded Detroit Kaskaskia Vincennes and New Orleans The English planted agricultural colonies the French were chiefly engaged in traffic with the Indians This trade and the operations of the Jesuit missionaries who were usually the self denying pioneers of commerce in its penetration of the wilderness gave the French great influence over the tribes of a vast extent of country lying in the rear of the English settlements The ancient quarrel between the two nations originating far back in the feudal ages and kept alive by subsequent collisions burned vigorously in the bosoms of the respective colonists in America where it was continually fed by frequent hostilities on frontier ground They had ever regarded each other with extreme jealousy for the prize before them was supreme rule in the New World The trading posts and missionary stations of the French in the far Northwest and in the bosom of the dark wilderness several hundred miles distant from the most remote settlements on the English frontier attracted very little attention until they formed a part of more extensive operations But when after the capture of Louisburg by the English in seventeen forty five the French adopted vigorous measures for opposing the extension of British power in America when they built strong vessels at the foot of Lake Ontario made treaties of friendship with powerful Indian tribes strengthened their fort at the mouth of the Niagara river and erected a cordon of fortifications more than sixty in number between Montreal and New Orleans the English were aroused to immediate and effective action in defence of the territorial limits given them in their ancient charters By virtue of these they claimed dominion westward to the Pacific ocean south of the latitude of the north shore of Lake Erie while the French claimed a title to all the territory watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries under the more plausible plea that they had made the first explorations and settlements in that region The claims of the real owner the Indian were lost sight of in the discussion and it was a significant question asked by an Indian messenger of the agent of the English Ohio Company Where is the Indian s land The English claim it all on one side of the river and the French on the other where does the Indian s land lie The territorial question was brought to an issue when in seventeen fifty three a company of English traders and settlers commenced exploring the head waters of the Ohio The French opposed their operations by force George Washington was sent by the Virginia authorities to remonstrate with the French It was of no avail The English determined to oppose force to force and in the vicinity of the now flourishing city of Pittsburg in western Pennsylvania the French and Indian War began Provincial troops were raised and armies came from England Extensive campaigns were planned and attempts were made to expel the French from Lake Champlain and the southern shore of Lake Ontario Finally in seventeen fifty eight three armies were in motion at one time against French posts remote from each other Louisburg in the extreme east Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain and Fort Du Quesne where Pittsburg now stands General Sir James Abercrombie commanded the expedition against Ticonderoga accompanied by young Lord Howe as his lieutenant The French were under the command of the marquis Montcalm who was killed at Quebec the following year The English and provincial troops rendezvoused at the head of Lake George went down that sheet of water attacked Ticonderoga and were repulsed with great loss It was this portion of that campaign in which the soldier served who kept the Journal given in the succeeding pages It is a graphic outline picture in few and simple words of the daily life of a common soldier at that time During the campaign of seventeen fifty nine Quebec was captured by the army under Wolfe Lord Amherst more successful than Abercrombie drove the French from Lake Champlain Sir William Johnson captured Fort Niagara and all Canada was in virtual possession of the English except Montreal That fell early in the Autumn of seventeen sixty and the struggle for supremacy in America between the French and English was ended for ever L MILITARY JOURNAL FOR seventeen fifty eight Illustration Lemuel Lyon FAC SIMILE OF A PORTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT JOURNAL April

to the command of some of the first troops raised in Connecticut for the French and Indian war in seventeen fifty five and was an active officer during the entire period of that conflict especially while in command of a corps of rangers He was ploughing in his field when the news of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord reached him He immediately started for Boston and at the head of

midnight then Marched again to the first narrows Landed their and went down Footnote thirty six Sabbath day Point This is a fertile little promontory jutting out into Lake George from the western shore a few miles from the little village of Hague and surrounded by the most picturesque scenery imaginable It was so named at this time because it was early on Sunday morning that Abercrombie and his army left this place and proceeded down the lake There a small provincial force had a desperate fight with a party of French and Indians in seventeen fifty six and defeated them Abercrombie s army went down the lake in batteaux and whaleboats and reached the Point just at dark Captain afterward General Stark relates that he supped with the young lord Howe that evening at the Point and that the nobleman made many anxious inquiries about the strength of Ticonderoga the country to be traversed c and by his serious demeanor evinced a presentiment of his sad fate He was killed in a skirmish with a French scout two days afterward His body was conveyed to Albany in charge of Captain afterward General Philip Schuyler and buried there He was a brother of the admiral and general of that name who commanded the British naval and land forces in America in seventeen seventy six Thursday sixth twelve A Clock at night we marched of again thirty seven landed at the first narrows then we Marched on to the falls thirty eight within two miles of the fort and there we was attackt by the Enemy thirty nine and the Engagement held one hour and we kiled and took upwards of two fifty of Captain Holmes Company we had three Men wounded Sergent Cada Sergent Armsba and Ensign Robbins at Sondown the French come out again five thousand strong and our men came back again to the Landing place Lodged their Footnote thirty seven The order of march says Major Rogers exhibited a splendid military show There were sixteen thousand well armed troops Lord Howe in a large boat led the van of the flotilla accompanied by a guard of rangers and expert boatmen The regular troops occupied the centre and the provincials the wings The sky was clear and starry and not a breeze ruffled the dark waters as they slept quietly in the shadows of the mountains Their oars were muffled and so silently did they move on that not a scout upon the hills observed them and the first intimation that the outposts of the enemy received of their approach was the full blaze of their scarlet uniforms when soon after sunrise they landed and pushed on toward Ticonderoga Footnote thirty eight Rapids in the stream which forms the outlet of Lake George into Lake Champlain Here are now extensive saw and grist mills The distance from the foot of Lake George to Fort Ticonderoga is about four miles Footnote thirty nine The English lacked suitable guides and became bewildered in the dense forest that covered the land Lord Howe was second in command and led the van preceded by Major Putnam and a scout of one hundred men to reconnoitre The French set fire to their own outpost and retreated Howe and Putnam dashed on through the woods and in a few minutes fell in with the French advanced guard who were also bewildered and were trying to find their way to the fort A smart skirmish ensued and at the first fire Lord Howe another officer and several privates were killed The French were repulsed with a loss of about three hundred killed and one hundred and forty made prisoners The English battalions were so much broken confused and fatigued that Abercrombie ordered them back to the landing place where they bivouacked for the night Friday seventh Majer Rogers went down to the mils and drove them of there from kild and took upwards of one hundred fifty at Son down the last of the Army marched down to the Mils and Majer putnom made a Bridge over by the Landing place this night we lodged by the Mils Saturday eighth Then marched back two or three rigiments to the Landing place to guard help Get up

a coming upon us and we stove them all and come of us as soon as we could and about ten Ock we sot sail and by Son down we arrived at Lake George forty one according to all accounts the Engagement began about ten clock and held ten Hours steady and we lost three Thousand rigulars Footnote forty This was Abercrombie s fatal mistake He sent an engineer to reconnoitre the fort and outworks The engineer reported the latter to be so weak in an unfinished state as to be easily carried without artillery by the force of English bayonets The difficulties in the way of heavy cannons in that dense forest were very formidable and Abercrombie was willing to rely upon sword and bayonet on the strength of his engineer s report That functionary was mistaken and when the English approached the French lines they found an embankment of earth and stones eight feet in height strongly guarded by abatis or felled trees with their tops outward The English made a furious attack cut pathways through these prostrate trees and mounted the parapet They were instantly slain and thus scores of Britons were sacrificed by discharges of heavy cannons When two thousand men had fallen Abercrombie sounded a retreat and the whole British army made its way to the landing place at the foot of Lake George with a loss of twenty five hundred muskets They went up the lake to Fort William Henry and the wounded were sent to Fort Edward and to Albany At his own solicitation Colonel Bradstreet was sent to attack the French fort Frontenac where Kingston now stands at the foot of Lake Ontario and General Stanwix proceeded to erect a fort toward the head waters of the Mohawk where the village of Rome now flourishes Footnote forty one The head of the lake was especially designated as Lake George There was the dilapidated fort William Henry built by Sir William Johnson in the autumn of seventeen fifty five and about half a mile southeast from it Fort George was afterward erected The ruins of its citadel may

of a Journal kept by a common soldier named SAMUEL HAWS of Wrentham Massachusetts who appears to have been one of the minute men organized toward the close of seventeen seventy four and early in seventeen seventy five At that time there were about three thousand British troops in Boston under General Thomas Gage who was also governor of the colony of Massachusetts He was popularly regarded as an oppressor and act after act of the British government during a year preceding had convinced the American people that they must choose the alternative to submit or fight They resolved to fight if necessary During the summer of seventeen seventy four the people commenced arming and training themselves in military exercises the manufacture of arms and gunpowder was encouraged and throughout Massachusetts in particular the people were enrolled in companies and prepared to take up arms at a moment s warning From this circumstance they were called MINUTE MEN With his strong force Gage felt quite certain that he could suppress the threatened insurrection and keep the people quiet Yet he felt uneasy concerning the gathering of ammunition and stores by the patriots at Concord sixteen miles from Boston and on the night of the eighteenth of April seventeen seventy five he sent a detachment of soldiers to seize them They proceeded by the way of Lexington where they arrived at dawn of the nineteenth The expedition became known and the country was aroused When the British approached Lexington they were confronted by about seventy minute men A skirmish ensued eight patriots were killed and several were wounded That was the first bloodshed of the Revolution The British then went on to Concord to seize the stores where they were again confronted by minute men Indeed they had been annoyed all the way by them as they fired from behind buildings stone walls and trees They destroyed the stores and in a skirmish killed several more American citizens The country was now thoroughly aroused and the minute men hastened toward Lexington and Concord from all directions The British found it necessary to retreat and nothing saved the whole troop sent out the night before from utter destruction but a strong reinforcement under Lord Percy The whole body retreated hastily to Charlestown and across to Boston with a loss in killed and wounded of two hundred and seventy three men Intelligence of the tragedy soon spread over the country and from the hills and valleys of New England thousands of men armed and unarmed hastened toward Boston and formed that force of which our Journalist was one that for nine months kept the British army prisoners upon the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown By common consent Artemas Ward a soldier of the French and Indian war was made commander in chief and he performed the duties of that office with zeal until he was superseded by Washington early in July seventeen seventy five A JOURNAL FOR seventeen seventy five Illustration A

hands struggled in the field for the liberties of their country lie in unhonored graves and have had no biographers If he lived until the conflict ended and died in his native town no doubt his grave

Journal of a Soldier in seventeen seventy five his narrative commences on the day of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord the opening conflicts of the Revolution Some official matters relating to

seventeen seventy five On the twenty twod the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts assembled and deeming it important to have the whole truth known appointed a committee to take depositions in relation to the transactions of the British troops in their route to and from Concord Another committee was appointed the following day consisting of doctor Church Elbridge Gerry and Thomas Cushing to draw up a narrative of the massacre The committee to take depositions held their sessions at Concord and Lexington on the twenty threed and twenty fifth of April Feeling it to be expedient to send an account immediately to England a committee consisting of doctor Warren mister Freeman mister Gardiner and Colonel Stone was chosen to prepare a letter to doctor Franklin the colonial agent in London They reported a letter and also an Address to the Inhabitants of Great Britain on the same day Captain Richard Derby of Salem was employed to proceed immediately with the despatches He placed them in the hands of Doctor Franklin on the twenty ninth of May and on the following day the address was printed and circulated It gave the first intelligence of the skirmishes at Lexington and Concord to the British public The following copied from the Journals of the Continental Congress are the several papers referred to To the honorable Benjamin Franklin esquire at London IN PROVINCIAL CONGRESS WATERTOWN April twenty six seventeen seventy five SIR From the entire confidence we repose in your faithfulness and abilities we consider it the happiness of this colony that the important trust of agency for it in this day of unequalled distress is devolved on your hands and we doubt not your attachment to the cause and liberties of mankind will make every possible exertion in our behalf a pleasure to you although our circumstances will compel us often to interrupt your repose by matters that will surely give you pain A singular instance hereof is the occasion of the present letter The contents of this packet will be our apology for troubling you with it From these you will see how and by whom we are at last plunged into the horrors of a most unnatural war Our enemies we are told have despatched to Great Britain a fallacious account of the tragedy they have begun to prevent the operation of which to the public injury we have engaged the vessel that conveys this to you as a packet in the service of this colony and we request your assistance in supplying Captain Derby who commands her with such necessaries as he shall want on the credit of your constituents in Massachusetts Bay But we most ardently wish that the several papers herewith enclosed may be immediately printed and dispersed through every town in England and especially communicated to the lord mayor aldermen and council of the city of London that they may take such order thereon as they may think proper And we are confident your fidelity will make such improvement of them as shall convince all who are not determined to be in everlasting blindness that it is the united efforts of both Englands that can save either but that whatever price our brethren in the one may be pleased to put on their constitutional liberties we are authorized to assure you that the inhabitants of the other with the greatest unanimity are inflexibly resolved to sell theirs only at the price of their lives

hill near the meeting house in Concord aforesaid in consequence of an information that a number of regular troops had killed six of our countrymen at Lexington and were on their march to said Concord and about an hour afterward we saw them approaching to the number as we imagine of about twelve hundred on which we retreated to a hill about eighty rods back and the aforesaid troops then took possession of a hill where we were first posted Presently after this we saw them moving toward the north bridge about one mile from said meeting house we then immediately went before them and passed the bridge just before a party of them to the number of about two hundred arrived They there left about one half of these two hundred at the bridge and proceeded with the rest toward Colonel Barret s about two miles from the said bridge We then seeing several fires in the town thought our houses were in danger and immediately marched back toward said bridge and the troops who were stationed there observing our approach marched back over the bridge and then took up some of the planks We then hastened our steps toward the bridge and when we had got near the bridge they fired on our men first three guns one after the other and then a considerable number more upon which and not before having orders from our commanding officer not to fire till we were fired upon we fired upon the regulars and they retreated At Concord and on their retreat through Lexington they plundered many houses burnt three at Lexington together with a shop and barn and committed damage more or less to almost every house from Concord to Charlestown Signed by the above deponents We Joseph Butler and Ephraim Melvin do testify and declare that when the regular troops fired upon our people at the north bridge in

Lexington men and fearing that hostilities might be committed at Concord thought it my incumbent duty to secure my family After I had secured my family some time after that returning toward my own dwelling and finding that the bridge on the north part of said Concord was guarded by regular troops being a spectator of what had happened at said bridge declare that the regular troops stationed on said bridge after they saw the men that were collected on the westerly side of said bridge marched toward said bridge then the troops returned toward the easterly side of said bridge and formed themselves as I thought for regular fight after that they fired one gun then two or three more before the men that were stationed on the westerly part of said bridge fired upon them TIMOTHY MINOT JUN

daybreak I was informed of the approach of a number of the regular troops to the town of Concord where were some magazines belonging to this province when there was assembled some of the militia of this and the neighboring towns I ordered them to march to the north bridge so called which they had passed and were taking up I ordered said militia to march to said bridge and pass the same but not to fire on the king s troops unless they were first fired upon We advanced near said bridge when the said troops fired upon our militia and killed two men dead on the spot and wounded several others which was the first firing of guns in the town of Concord My detachment then returned the fire which killed and wounded several of the king s troops JAMES BARRET LEXINGTON April twenty three seventeen

rei memoriam THOMAS STEEL TIMOTHY PAINE CONCORD April twenty three seventeen seventy five I James Marr of lawful age testify and say that in the evening of the eighteenth instant I received orders from George Hutchinson adjutant of the fourth regiment of the regular troops stationed at Boston to prepare and march to which orders I attended and marched to Concord where I was ordered by an officer with about one hundred men to guard a certain bridge there While attending that service a number of people came along in order as I suppose to cross said bridge at which time a number of the regular troops first fired upon them JAMES MARR MEDFORD April twenty five seventeen seventy five I Edward Thoroton Gould of his majesty s own regiment of foot being of lawful age do testify and declare that on the evening of the eighteenth instant under the orders of General Gage I embarked with the light infantry and grenadiers of the line commanded by Colonel Smith and landed on the marshes of Cambridge from whence we proceeded to Lexington On our arrival at that place we saw a body of provincial troops armed to the number of about sixty or seventy men On our approach they dispersed and soon after firing began but which party fired first I can not exactly say as our troops rushed on shouting and huzzaing previous to the firing which was continued by our troops so long as any of the provincials were to be seen From thence we marched to Concord On a hill near the entrance of the town we saw another body of provincials assembled the light infantry companies were ordered up the hill to disperse them on our approach they retreated toward Concord The grenadiers continued the road under the hill toward the town Six companies of light infantry were ordered down to take possession of the bridge which the provincials retreated over the company I commanded was one Three companies of the above detachment went forward about two miles In the meantime the provincial troops returned to the number of about three or four hundred We drew up on the Concord side of the bridge the provincials came down upon us upon which we engaged and gave the first fire This was the first engagement after the one at Lexington A continued firing from both parties lasted through the whole day I myself was wounded at the attack of the bridge and am now treated with the greatest humanity and taken all possible care of by the provincials at Medford EDWARD THOROTON GOULD Lieut King s Own Regiment PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY Middlesex County April twenty five seventeen seventy

the county aforesaid quorum unus PROVINCE OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY CHARLESTOWN SS I Nathaniel Gorham notary and tabellion public by lawful authority duly admitted and sworn hereby certify to all whom it may or doth concern that Thaddeus Masson Josiah Johnson and Simon Tufts Esqrs are three of his majesty s justices of the peace quorum unus for the county of Middlesex and that full faith and credit is and ought to be given to their transactions as such both in court and out In witness whereof I have hereunto affixed my name and seal this twenty sixth day of April Anno Domini one thousand seven hundred and seventy five NATHANIEL GORHAM Notary Public L S All the above depositions are sworn to before justices of the peace and duly attested by notaries public in manner of the last one IN PROVINCIAL CONGRESS WATERTOWN April twenty six seventeen seventy five To the Inhabitants of Great Britain FRIENDS AND FELLOW SUBJECTS Hostilities are at length commenced in this colony by the troops under the command of General Gage and it being of the greatest importance that an early true and authentic account of this inhuman proceeding should be known to you the Congress of this colony have transmitted the same and from want of a session of the honorable Continental Congress think it proper to address you on the alarming occasion By the clearest depositions relative to this transaction it will appear that on the night preceding the nineteenth of April instant a body of the king s troops under the command of Colonel Smith were secretly landed at Cambridge with an apparent design to take or destroy the military and other stores provided for the defence of this colony and deposited at Concord that some inhabitants of the colony on the night aforesaid while travelling peaceably on the road between Boston and Concord were seized and greatly abused by armed men who appeared to be officers of General Gage s army that the town of Lexington by these means was alarmed and a company of the inhabitants mustered on the occasion that the regular troops on their way to Concord marched into the said town of Lexington and the said company on their approach began to disperse that notwithstanding this the regulars rushed on with great violence and first began hostilities by firing on said Lexington company whereby they killed eight and wounded several others that the regulars continued their fire until those of said company who were neither killed nor wounded had made their escape that Colonel Smith with the detachment then marched to Concord where a number of provincials were again fired on by the troops two of them killed and several wounded before the provincials fired on them and that these hostile measures of the troops produced an engagement that lasted through the day in which many of the provincials and more of the regular troops were killed and wounded To give a particular account of the ravages of the troops as they retreated from Concord to Charlestown would be very difficult if not impracticable Let it suffice to say that a great number of the houses on the road were plundered and rendered unfit for use several were burnt women in childbed were driven by the soldiery naked into the streets old men peaceably in their houses were shot dead and such scenes exhibited as would disgrace the annals of the most uncivilized nations These brethren are marks of ministerial vengeance against this colony for refusing with her sister colonies a submission to slavery but they have not yet detached us from our royal sovereign We profess to be his loyal and dutiful subjects and so hardly dealt with as we have been are still ready with our lives and fortunes to defend his person family crown and dignity Nevertheless to the persecution and tyranny of his cruel ministry we will not tamely submit appealing to Heaven for the justice of our cause we determine to die or be free We can not think that the honor wisdom and valor of Britons will suffer them to be long inactive spectators of measures in which they themselves are so deeply interested measures pursued in opposition to the solemn protests of many noble lords and expressed sense of conspicuous commoners whose knowledge and virtue have long characterized them as some of the greatest men in the nation measures executing contrary to the interest petitions and resolves of many large respectable and opulent counties cities and boroughs in Great Britain measures highly incompatible with justice but still pursued with a specious pretence of easing the nation of its burdens measures which if successful must end in the ruin and slavery of Britain as well as the persecuted American colonies We sincerely hope that the great Sovereign of the universe who hath so often appeared for the English nation will support you in every rational and manly exertion with these colonies for saving it from ruin and that in a constitutional connection with the mother country we shall soon be altogether a free and happy people Per order JOSEPH WARREN President P T NAMES OF THE KILLED AND WOUNDED AT LEXINGTON AND CONCORD The following list of the names of those first martyrs in the cause of
