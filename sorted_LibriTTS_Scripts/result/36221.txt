this provoking storm Didn t mind it yesterday because we could eat all the time but here we are cooped up for a week perhaps and I d like to know what we are to do growled Geoff as he stood at the window looking gloomily at the bleak scene without It certainly was discouraging for the north wind howled the air was dark with falling snow and drifts were rising over fences roads and fields as if to barricade the Christmas party in the great country house We can bear it pleasantly since it can t be helped said gentle sister Mary with a kind hand on his shoulder and a face full of sympathy for his disappointment I m sorry for the coasting skating and sleighing frolics we have lost but if we must be shut up I m sure we couldn t have a pleasanter prison or a kinder jailer Don t let grandma hear us complain for she has made great exertions to have our visit a merry one and it will trouble her if we are not gay and contented That s easy for a parcel of girls who only want to mull over the fire and chatter and drink tea but it s rough on us fellows who come for the outside fun House is well enough but when you ve seen it once there s an end Eating is jolly but you can t stuff forever We might dig or snowball if it didn t blow a gale Never saw such a beast of a storm and Geoff flattened his nose against the window pane and scowled at the elements A laugh made him turn around and forget his woes to stare at the quaint little figure that stood curtseying in the door way of the keeping room where a dozen young people were penned while the maids cleared up the remains of yesterday s feast in the kitchen the mothers were busy with the babies upstairs and the fathers read papers in the best parlor for this was a family gathering under the roof of the old homestead A rosy dark eyed face looked out from the faded green calash a gayly flowered gown was looped up over a blue quilted petticoat and a red camlet cloak hung down behind A big reticule and a funny umbrella were held in either hand and red hose and very high heeled pointed shoes covered a trim pair of feet God bless you merry gentlemen May nothing you dismay Here s your ancient granny come To call this Christmas day sang Minnie the lively member of the flock as she bobbed little curtseys and smiled so infectiously that even cross Geoff cheered up Where did you get that rigging Isn t it becoming What queer stuff Did grandma ever look so I wonder These and many other questions rained upon the wearer of the old costume and she answered them as fast as she could I went rummaging up garret for something to read and found two chests of old duds Thought I d dress up and see how you liked me Grandma said I might and told me I looked like her when she was young She was a beauty you know so I feel as proud as a peacock And Min danced away to stand before the portrait of a blooming girl in a short waisted white satin gown and a pearl necklace which hung opposite the companion portrait of an officer in an old fashioned uniform So you do Wonder if I should look like grandpa if I got into his old toggery said Geoff looking up at the handsome man with the queue and the high coat collar Go and try the uniform is in the chest and not much moth eaten Let s have a jolly rummage and see what we can find We didn t eat ourselves sick so we will amuse these lazy invalids and Min glanced pityingly at several cousins who lay about on sofas or in easy chairs pretending to read but evidently suffering from too great devotion to the bountiful dinner and evening feast of yesterday Away went Min and Lotty Geoff and Walt glad of anything to beguile the stormy afternoon Grandma smiled as she heard the tramp of feet overhead the peals of laughter and the bang of chest lids well knowing that a scene of dire confusion awaited her when the noisy frolic was done but thankful for the stores of ancient finery which would keep the restless children happy for a day It was truly a noble garret for it extended the whole length of the great square house with windows at either end and divided in the middle by a solid chimney All around stood rows of chests dilapidated furniture and wardrobes full of old relics while the walls were hung with many things for which modern tongues can find no names In one corner was a book case full of musty books and papers in another kitchen utensils and rusty weapons the third was devoted to quilts hung on lines and in the fourth stood a loom with a spinning wheel beside it both seemingly well cared for as the dust lay lightly on them and flax was still upon the distaff A glorious rummage followed the irruption of the Goths and Vandals into this quiet spot and soon Geoff quite forgot the storm as he pranced about in the buff and blue coat with a cocked hat on his head and grandfather s sword at his side Lotty arrayed herself in a pumpkin hood and quilted cloak for warmth while Walt the book worm went straight to the ancient library and became absorbed in faded souvenirs yellow newspapers and almanacs of a century ago Having displayed themselves below and romped all over the house the masqueraders grew tired at last and early twilight warned them to leave before ghostly shadows began to haunt the garret I mean to take this down and ask grandma to show me how it s done I ve heard her tell about spinning and weaving when she was a girl and I know I can learn said Minnie who had fallen in love with the little wheel and vainly tried to twist the flax into as smooth a thread as the one hanging from the distaff as if shadowy fingers had lately spun it Queen Victoria set the fashion in England and we might do it here Wouldn t it be fun to have a wheel in the parlor at home and really use it not keep it tied up with blue ribbons as the other girls do cried Lotty charmed with the new idea Come Geoff take it down for us You ought to do it out of gratitude for my cheering you up so nicely said Min leading the way So I will Here Walt give it a hoist and come behind to pick up the pieces for the old machine must be about a hundred I guess Shouldering the wheel Geoff carried it down but no bits fell by the way for the stout little wheel was all in order kept so by loving hands that for more than eighty years had been spinning the mingled thread of a long and useful life Glorious fires were roaring up the wide chimneys in parlor and keeping room and old and young were gathering around them while the storm beat on the window panes and the wintry wind howled as if angry at being shut out See what we ve stolen grandma cried Min as the procession came in rosy dusty gay and eager Bless the child What possessed you to lug that old thing down asked Madam Shirley much amused as the prize was placed before her where she sat in her high backed chair a right splendid old lady in her stately cap black silk gown and muslin apron with a bunch of keys at her side like a model housekeeper as she was You don t mind our playing with it do you And will you teach me to spin I think it s such a pretty little thing and I want to be like you in all ways grandma dear answered Min sitting on the arm of the great chair with her fresh cheek close to the wrinkled one where winter roses still bloomed You wheedling gypsy I ll teach you with all my heart for it is pretty work and I often wonder ladies don t keep it up I did till I was too busy and now I often take a turn at it when I m tired of knitting The hum is very soothing and the thread much stronger than any we get nowadays As she spoke the old lady dusted the wheel and gave it a skilful turn or two till the soft whir made pleasant music in the room Is it really a hundred years old asked Geoff drawing nearer with the others to watch the new work Just about It was one of my mother s wedding presents and she gave it to me when I was fifteen Deary me how well I remember that day and grandma seemed to fall a dreaming as her eyes rested on the letters E R M rudely cut in the wood and below these were three others with something meant for a true lover s knot between Whose initials are these asked Min scenting a romance with girlish quickness for grandma was smiling as if her eyes read the title to some little story in those worn letters Elizabeth Rachel Morgan and Joel Manlius Shirley Your blessed grandfather cut our names there the day I was sixteen and put the flourish between to show what he wanted added the old lady laughing as she made the wheel hum again Tell about it please do begged Min remembering that grandma had been a beauty and a belle It s a long tale my darling and I couldn t tell it now Sometime when I m teaching you to spin I ll do it maybe But the girl was determined to have her story and after tea when the little ones were in bed the elders playing whist in the parlor and the young folks deciding what game to begin Minnie sat down and tried to spin sure that the familiar sound would lure grandma to give the lesson and tell the tale She was right for the wheel had not gone around many times when the tap of the cane was heard and the old lady came rustling in quite ready for a chat now that three cups of her own good tea and a nap in the chimney corner had refreshed her No dear that s not the way you need a dish of water to wet your fingers in and you must draw the flax out slow and steady else it runs to waste and makes a poor thread Fetch me that chair and I ll show you how since you are bent on learning Establishing herself in the straight backed seat a skilful tap of the foot set the wheel in swift and easy motion and the gray thread twisted fine and evenly from the distaff Isn t it a pretty picture said Min to Lotty as they watched the old lady work Not so pretty as the one I used to see when my dear mother sat here and I a little child at her knee Ah my dears she could have told you stories all night long and well worth hearing I was never tired of them Please tell one now grandma We don t know what to play and it would be so nice to sit around the fire and hear it this stormy night suggested Min artfully seizing the hint Do Do We all love stories and we ll be as still as mice added Geoff beckoning to the others as he took the big arm chair being the oldest grandson and leader of the flock Camping on the rug or nestling in the sofa corner the boys and girls all turned expectant faces toward grandma who settled her cap strings and smoothed her spotless apron with an indulgent smile at her little audience I don t know which one to tell first The ghost story that s a splendid one and most of the children never heard it said Walt Have Indians and fighting in it I like that kind added Geoff No tell a love story They are so interesting said Lotty I want the story about the initials first I know it is very sentimental So do begin with that grandma begged Min Well dears perhaps I d better choose that one for it has the battle of New Orleans and wolves and spinning and sweethearts in it so it will suit you all I hope Oh lovely Do begin right away cried Minnie as the clapping of hands showed how satisfactory the prospect was Grandma gave a loud hem and began at once while the little wheel hummed a soft accompaniment to her words GRANDMA S STORY When I was fifteen my mother gave me this wheel and said Now daughter Betsey it is time for you to begin your wedding outfit for I mistrust you ll marry young In those days girls spun and wove webs of fine linen and laid em up in chests with lavender and rosemary for sheets and table linen after they married So I spun away making all manner of fine plans in my silly head for I was a pretty piece they all said and young as I was two or three fine lads used to come evenings and sit staring at me while I worked Among these was my neighbor Joel Manlius Shirley and I was fond of him but he hadn t much money so I put on airs and tried his patience very much One day he came in and said Betsey I m going a soldiering they need men and I m off Will you think of poor Joe when I m gone I don t know how I looked but I felt as if I couldn t bear it Only I was too proud to show my trouble so I laughed and gave my wheel a twist and said I was glad of it since anything was better than hanging round at home That hurt him but he was always gentle to saucy Betsey and taking out his knife he cut those letters under mine saying with a look I never could forget That will remind you of me if you are likely to forget Good by I m going right away and may never come back He kissed me and was off before I could say a word and then I cried till my flax was wet and my thread tangled and my heart most broken Deary me how well I remember that heavy day Grandma smiled but something shone in her old eyes very like a tear and sentimental Lotty felt deeply interested at this point Where does the fighting come in asked Geoff who was of a military turn as became the descendant of a soldier I didn t know or care much about the War of eighteen twelve except as far as the safety of one man was concerned Joe got on without any harm till the battle of New Orleans when he was nearly killed behind the cotton bale breastworks General Jackson built Yes I know all about it Jackson fought against twelve thousand and lost only seven men That was the last battle of the war January eight eighteen fifteen Three cheers for grandpa shouted Geoff waving a tidy as no hat was at hand The others echoed the hurrah and grandma beamed with pride as she went on We couldn t get news from the army very often in those troublous times and Joe was gone two years before the war ended After the great battle we had no news for a long spell and we feared he was one of the seven men killed Those were dreadful days for all of us My honored mother was a pious soul and so was missus Shirley and they kept up their hearts with hope and prayer but I poor thing was young and weak and I cried myself half blind remembering how naughty I had been I would spin no more but set the wheel away saying I should have no need of wedding gear as I should never marry and I wore black ribbon on my caps and one of Joe s buttons strung about my neck mourning dismally for my lost dear So the winter ended and the summer went and no news came of Joe All said he was dead and we had prayers at church and talked of setting up a stone in the grave yard and I thought my life was done for I pined sadly and felt as if I could never laugh again But I did for the Lord was very good to us and out of danger and captivity delivered that dear boy Grandma spoke solemnly and folded her hands in thanksgiving as she looked up at the picture of the handsome officer hanging on the wall before her The elder children could just remember grandpa as a very old and feeble man and it struck them as funny to speak of him as a dear boy but they never smiled and dutifully lifted their eyes to the queue and the high collared coat wondering if Joe was as rosy in real life as in the portrait Well that s the sentimental part now comes the merry part and that will suit the boys said the old lady briskly as she spun away and went on in a lively tone One December day as I sat by that very window dreaming sorrowfully at my sewing work while old Sally nodded over her knitting by the fire I saw a man come creeping along by the fence and dodge behind the wood pile There were many bad folks round in those times for war always leaves a sight of lazy rascals afloat as well as poor fellows maimed and homeless Mother had gone over to the sewing society at missus Shirley s and I was all alone for Sally was so stiff with rheumatics she could scarce stir and that was why I stayed to take care of her The old musket always hung over the kitchen chimney piece loaded and I knew how to fire it for Joe had taught me So away I went and got it down for I saw the man popping up his head now and then to spy the land and I felt sure he meant mischief I knew Sally would only scream like a scared hen so I let her sleep and getting behind the shutter I pointed my gun and waited to blaze away as soon as the enemy showed signs of attacking Presently he came creeping up to the back door and I heard him try the latch All was fast so I just slipped into the kitchen and stood behind the settle for I was surer than ever he was a rascal since I d seen him nearer He was a tall man dreadful shabby in an old coat and boots a ragged hat over his eyes and a great beard hiding the lower part of his face He had a little bundle and a big stick in his hands and limped as if foot sore or lame I was much afeard but those were times that made heroes of men and taught women to be brave for love of home and country So I kept steady with my eye on the window and my finger on the trigger of the old gun that hadn t been fired for years Presently the man looked in and I saw what a strange roll his great eyes had for he was thin faced and looked half starved If mother had been there she d have called him in and fed him well but I dared not and when he tried the window I aimed but did not fire for finding the button down he went away and I dropped on the settle shaking like a leaf All was still and in a minute I plucked up courage to go to look out a bit but just as I reached the middle of the kitchen the buttery door opened and there stood the robber with a carving knife in one hand and my best loaf of spice bread in the other He said something and made a rush at me but I pulled the trigger saw a flash felt a blow and fell somewhere thinking Now I m dead Here grandma paused for breath having spoken rapidly and acted out the scene dramatically to the intense delight of the children who sat like images of interest staring at her with round eyes But you weren t dead What next cried Walt eagerly Bless you no I only fell into Joe s arms and when I came to there the dear fellow was crying over me like a baby while old Sally danced round us like a bedlamite in spite of her rheumatics shouting Hosanna Thanks and praise He s come he s come Was he shot asked Geoff anxious for a little bloodshed No dear the old gun burst and hurt my hands but not a mite of harm was done to Joe I don t think I could tell all that happened for a spell being quite dazed with joy and surprise but by the time mother came home I was as peart as a wren and Joe was at the table eating and drinking every mortal thing I could find in the house He d been kept a prisoner till exchanged and had had a hard time getting home with little money and a bad wound in the leg besides being feeble with jail fever But we didn t fret over past troubles being so glad to get him back How my blessed mother did laugh when we told her the reception I gave the poor lad But I said it served him right since he came sneaking home like a thief instead of marching in like a hero Then he owned that he came there to get something to eat being ashamed to go in upon his mother with all her company about her So we fed and comforted him and when we d got our wits about us I whipped away to missus Shirley s and told my news and every one of those twenty five women went straight over to our house and burst in upon poor Joe as he lay resting on the settle That was my revenge for the scare he gave me and a fine one it was for the women chattered over him like a flock of magpies and I sat in the corner and laughed at him Ah I was a sad puss in those days The old lady s black eyes twinkled with fun and the children laughed with her till Walt caused a lull by asking Where do the wolves come in grandma Right along dear I m not likely to forget em for they most cost me my life to say nothing of my new slippers There was great rejoicing over Joe and every one wanted to do something to honor our hero for he had done well we found out when the General heard his story We had a great dinner and Judge Mullikin gave a supper but Major Belknap was bound to outshine the rest so he invited all the young folks over to his house nigh ten miles away to a ball and we all went I made myself fine you may believe and wore a pair of blue kid slippers with mother s best buckles to set em off Joe had a new uniform and was an elegant figure of a man I do assure you He couldn t dance poor dear being still very lame but I was a proud girl when I marched into that ball room on the arm of my limping beau The men cheered and the ladies stood up in chairs to see him and he was as red as my ribbons and I could hardly keep from crying as I held him up the floor being slippery as glass with the extra waxing it had got I declared I wouldn t dance because Joe couldn t but he made me saying he could see me better so I footed it till two o clock soon forgetting all my sorrow and my good resolutions as well I wanted to show Joe that I was as much a favorite as ever though I d lived like a widow for a year Young folks will be giddy and I hope these girls will take warning by me and behave better when their time comes There mayn t be any wolves to sober em but trouble of some sort always follows foolish actions so be careful my dears and behave with propriety when you come out as you call it nowadays Grandma held up a warning forefinger at the girls and shook her head impressively feeling that the moral of her tale must be made clear before she went on But the lassies blushed a little and the lads looked all impatience so the dear old lady introduced the wolves as quickly as she could About half past two Joe and I drove off home with four fine hams in the bottom of the sleigh sent by the Major to our mothers It was a bitter cold February night with just light enough to see the road and splendid sleighing so we went along at a good pace till we came to the great woods They are all gone now and the woollen mills stand there but then they were a thick forest of pines and for more than three miles the road led through them In former days Indians had lurked there bears and foxes were still shot and occasionally wolves were seen when cold weather drove them to seek food near the sheep folds and barn yards Well we were skimming along pleasantly enough I rather sleepy and Joe very careful of me when just as I was beginning to doze a bit with my head on his arm I felt him start Old Buck the horse gave a jump that woke me up and in a minute I knew what the trouble was for from behind us came the howl of a wolf Just the night to bring em out muttered Joe using the whip till Buck went at his quickest trot with his ears down and every sign of hurry and worry about him Are you afraid of them I asked for I d never had a scare of this sort though I d heard other people tell of the fierceness of the brutes when hunger made them bold Not a bit only I wish I had my gun along said Joe looking over his shoulder anxiously Pity I hadn t brought mine I do so well with it I said and I laughed as I remembered how I aimed at Joe and hurt myself Are they chasing us I asked standing up to look back along the white road for we were just on the edge of the woods now Shouldn t wonder If I had a better horse it would be a lively race but Buck can t keep this pace long and if he founders we are in a fix for I can t run and you can t fight Betsey there s more than one hold tight and try to count em Something in Joe s voice told me plainer than words that we were in danger and I wished we d waited till the rest of our party came but I was tired and so we had started alone Straining my eyes I could see three black spots on the snow and hear three howls as the wolves came galloping after us I was a brave girl but I d never tried this kind of thing before and in a minute all the wolf stories I d ever heard came flying through my mind I was mortally afeard but I wouldn t show it and turned to Joe trying to laugh as I said Only three as yet Tell me just what to do and I ll do it Brave lass I must see to Buck or he ll be down for he s badly scared You wait till the rascals are pretty close then heave over one of these confounded hams to amuse em while we make the most of their halt They smell this meat and that s what they are after said Joe driving his best for the poor old horse began to pant and limp on his stiff legs Lucky for us we ve got em says I bound to be cool and gay if we hadn t they d get fresh meat instead of smoked Joe laughed but a long howl close by made me dive for a ham for in the darkness of the woods the beasts had got closer and now all I could see were several balls of fire not many yards away Out went the ham and a snarling sound showed that the wolves were busy eating it

none	none	said Joe Rest a bit and have another ready They ll soon finish that and want more We must go easy for Buck is nearly blown I prepared my ammunition and in what seemed five minutes I heard the patter of feet behind us and the fiery eyes were close by Over went the second mouthful and then the third and the fourth but they seemed more ravenous than ever and each time were back sooner in greater numbers We were nearly out of the woods when the last was gone and if Buck had only had strength we should have been safe But it was plain to see that he couldn t keep up much longer for he was very old though he d been a fine horse in his prime This looks bad little Betsey Cover up in the robes and hold fast to me The beasts will begin to snatch presently and I ll have to fight em off Thank the powers I ve my arms left As he spoke Joe pulled me close and wrapped me up then took the whip ready to rap the first wolf that dared come near enough to be hit We didn t wait long up they raced and began to leap and snarl in a way that made my heart stand still at first Then my temper rose and catching up the hot brick I had for my feet I fired it with such good aim that one sharp black nose disappeared with a yelp of pain Hit em again Betsey Take the demijohn and bang em well We are nearing Beaman s and the brutes will soon drop off It was a lively scrimmage for a few minutes as we both warmed to our work Joe thrashing away with his whip on one side and I on the other flourishing the demijohn in which we had carried some cider for the supper But it was soon over for in the fury of the fight Joe forgot the horse poor Buck made a sudden bolt upset the sleigh down a bank and breaking loose tore back along the road with the wolves after him Run Betsey run for your life and send Beaman s folks back I m done for my leg s broken Never mind I ll crawl under the sleigh and be all right till you come The wolves will take a good while to pick poor Buck s bones Just waiting to see Joe safe I ran as I never ran before and I was always light of foot How I did it I don t know for I d forgot to put on my moccasins we didn t have snow boots you know in my young days and there I was tearing along that snowy road in my blue kid slippers like a crazy thing It was nigh a mile and my heart was most broke before I got there but I kept my eye on the light in Hetty s winder and tugged along blessing her for the guide and comfort that candle was The last bit was down hill or I couldn t have done it for when I fell on the doorstep my voice was clean gone and I could only lie and rap rap rap till they came flying I just got breath enough to gasp out and point Joe wolves the big woods go when my senses failed me and I was carried in Here Madam Shirley leaned back in her chair quite used up for she had been acting the scene to a breathless audience and laying about her with her handkerchief so vigorously that her eyes snapped her cheeks were red and her dear old cap all awry But Joe did they eat him cried the boys in great excitement while the girls held to one another and the poor little wheel lay flat upset by the blows of the imaginary demijohn dealt to an equally imaginary wolf Hardly since he lived to be your grandfather laughed the old lady in high feather at the success of her story No no we mean the horse shouted Geoff while the others roared at the mistake Yes they did Poor old Buck saved us at the cost of his own life His troubles were over but mine were not for when I came to I saw mister Beaman and my first thought and word was Joe Too late they d got him so we turned back to tell you said that stupid man I gave one cry and was going off again when his wife shook me and says laughing You little goose He means the folks from the Major s A lot came along and found Joe and took him home and soon s ever you re fit we ll send you along too I m ready now says I jumping up in a hurry But I had to sit down again for my feet were all cut and bleeding and my slippers just rags They fixed me up and off I went to find mother in a sad taking But Joe was all right he hadn t broken his leg but only sprained it badly and being the wounded one he was laid up longer than I We both got well however and the first time Joe went out he hobbled over to our house I was spinning again then and thought I might need my wedding outfit after all On the whole I guess we ll end the story here young folks wouldn t care for that part As grandma paused the girls cried out with one voice Yes we do we like it best You said you would Tell about the wedding and all Well well it isn t much Joe came and sat by me and as we talked over our adventure he cut that true lover s knot between the letters I didn t seem to mind and spun away till he pointed to it saying with the look that always made me meek as a lamb May it stand so my little Betsey I said Yes Joe and then well never mind that bit we were married in June and I spun and wove my wedding things afterward Dreadful slack my mother thought but I didn t care My wedding gown was white lutestring full trimmed with old lace Hair over a cushion with white roses and the pearl necklace just as you see up there Joe wore his uniform and I tied up his hair with a white satin ribbon He looked beautiful and so did I At this artless bit of vanity the girls smiled but all agreed that grandma was right as they looked at the portraits with fresh interest I call that a pretty good story said Walt with the air of an accomplished critic Specially the wolf part I wanted that longer added Geoff It was quite long enough for me my dear and I didn t hear the last of it for years Why one of my wedding presents was four hams done up elegantly in white paper with posies on em from the Major He loved a joke and never forgot how well we fought with the pigs legs that night Joe gave me a new sleigh the next Christmas with two wolf skin robes for it shot the beasts himself and I kept those rugs till the moths ate the last bit He kept the leavings of my slippers and I have them still Fetch em Minnie you know where they are Grandma pointed to the tall secretary that stood in a corner and Minnie quickly took a box from one of the many drawers All the heads clustered around grandma and the faded ragged shoes went from hand to hand while questions rained upon the story teller till she bade them go to bed Nothing but the promise of more tales would appease them then with thanks and kisses the young folks trooped away leaving the old lady to put the little wheel to rights and sit thinking over her girlhood in the fire light Illustration TABBY S TABLE CLOTH The storm kept on all night and next morning the drifts were higher the wind stronger and the snow falling faster than ever Through the day the children roved about the great house amusing themselves as best they could and when evening came they gathered around the fire again eager for the promised story from grandmamma I ve a little cold said the old lady and am too hoarse for talking my dears but Aunt Elinor has looked up a parcel of old tales that I ve told her at different times and which she has written down You will like to hear her reading better than my dull way of telling them and I can help Minnie and Lotty with their work for I see they are bent on learning to spin The young folk were well pleased with grandma s proposal for Aunt Nell was a favorite with all being lively and kind and fond of children and the only maiden aunt in the family Now she smilingly produced a faded old portfolio and turning over a little pile of manuscripts said in her pleasant way Here are all sorts picked up in my travels at home and abroad and in order to suit all of you I have put the names on slips of paper into this basket and each can draw one in turn Does that please my distinguished audience Yes yes Geoff s the oldest let him draw first cried the flock fluttering like a flight of birds before they settle Girls come first answered the boy with a nod toward the eldest girl cousin Lotty put in her hand and after some fumbling drew out a paper on which was written Tabby s Table cloth Is that a good one she asked for Geoff looked disappointed More fighting though a girl is still the heroine answered Aunt Nell searching for the manuscript I think two revolutions will be enough for you General added grandmamma laughing Do we beat in both asked the boy brightening up at once Yes All right then I vote for Dolly s Dish cloth or whatever it is though I don t see what it can possibly have to do with war he added Ah my dear women have their part to play as well as men at such times and do it bravely though one does not hear so much about their courage I ve often wished some one would collect all that can be found about these neglected heroines and put it in a book for us to read admire and emulate when our turn comes Grandma looked thoughtfully at the fire as she spoke and Lotty said with her eye on the portfolio Perhaps Aunt Nell will do it for us Then history won t be so dry and we can glorify our fore mothers as well as fathers I ll see what I can find Now spin away Minnie and sit still boys if you can Then having settled grandma s foot stool and turned up the lamp Aunt Nell read the tale of TABBY S TABLE CLOTH On the twentieth day of March seventeen seventy five a little girl was trudging along a country road with a basket of eggs on her arm She seemed in a great hurry and looked anxiously about her as she went for those were stirring times and Tabitha Tarbell lived in a town that took a famous part in the Revolution She was a rosy faced bright eyed lass of fourteen full of vigor courage and patriotism and just then much excited by the frequent rumors which reached Concord that the British were coming to destroy the stores sent there for safe keeping while the enemy occupied Boston Tabby glowed with wrath at the idea and metaphorically speaking shook her fist at august King George being a stanch little Rebel ready to fight and die for her country rather than submit to tyranny of any kind In nearly every house something valuable was hidden Colonel Barrett had six barrels of powder Ebenezer Hubbard sixty eight barrels of flour axes tents and spades were at Daniel Cray s and Captain David Brown had guns cartridges and musket balls Cannon were hidden in the woods fire arms were being manufactured at Barrett s Mills cartouch boxes belts and holsters at Reuben Brown s saltpetre at Josiah Melvin s and much oatmeal was prepared at Captain Timothy Wheeler s A morning gun was fired a guard of ten men patrolled the town at night and the brave farmers were making ready for what they felt must come There were Tories in the town who gave the enemy all the information they could gather therefore much caution was necessary in making plans lest these enemies should betray them Pass words were adopted secret signals used and messages sent from house to house in all sorts of queer ways Such a message lay hidden under the eggs in Tabby s basket and the brave little girl was going on an important errand from her uncle Captain David Brown to Deacon Cyrus Hosmer who lived at the other end of the town by the South Bridge She had been employed several times before in the same way and had proved herself quick witted stout hearted and light footed Now as she trotted along in her scarlet cloak and hood she was wishing she could still further distinguish herself by some great act of heroism for good Parson Emerson had patted her on the head and said Well done child when he heard how she ran all the way to Captain Barrett s in the night to warn him that Doctor Lee the Tory had been detected sending information of certain secret plans to the enemy I would do more than that though it was a fearsome run through the dark woods Wouldn t those two like to know all I know about the stores But I wouldn t tell em not if they drove a bayonet through me I m not afeard of em and Tabby tossed her head defiantly as she paused to shift her basket from one arm to the other But she evidently was afeard of something for her ruddy cheeks turned pale and her heart gave a thump as two men came in sight and stopped suddenly on seeing her They were strangers and though nothing in their dress indicated it the girl s quick eye saw that they were soldiers step and carriage betrayed it and the rapidity with which these martial gentlemen changed into quiet travellers roused her suspicions at once They exchanged a few whispered words then they came on swinging their stout sticks one whistling the other keeping a keen lookout along the lonely road before and behind them My pretty lass can you tell me where mister Daniel Bliss lives asked the younger with a smile and a salute Tabby was sure now that they were British for the voice was deep and full the face a ruddy English face and the man they wanted was a well known Tory But she showed no sign of alarm beyond the modest color in her cheeks and answered civilly Yes sir over yonder a piece Thanks and a kiss for that said the young man stooping to bestow his gift But he got a smart box on the ear and Tabby ran off in a fury of indignation With a laugh they went on never dreaming that the little Rebel was going to turn spy herself and get the better of them She hurried away to Deacon Hosmer s and did her errand adding thereto the news that strangers were in town We must know more of them said the Deacon Clap a different suit on her wife and send her with the eggs to missus Bliss We have all we want of them and Tabby can look well about her while she rests and gossips over there Bliss must be looked after smartly for he is a knave and will do us harm Away went Tabby in a blue cloak and hood much pleased with her mission and coming to the Tory s house about noon smelt afar off a savory odor of roasting meat and baking pies Stepping softly to the back door she peeped through a small window and saw missus Bliss and her handmaid cooking away in the big kitchen too busy to heed the little spy who slipped around to the front of the house to take a general survey before she went in All she saw confirmed her suspicions for in the keeping room a table was set forth in great style with the silver tankards best china and the fine damask table cloth which the housewife kept for holidays Still another peep through the lilac bushes before the parlor windows showed her the two strangers closeted with mister Bliss all talking earnestly but in too low a tone for a word to reach even her sharp ears I will know what they are at I m sure it is mischief and I won t go back with only my walk for my pains thought Tabby and marching into the kitchen she presented her eggs with a civil message from Madam Hosmer They are mighty welcome child I ve used a sight for my custards and need more for the flip We ve company to dinner unexpected and I m much put about said missus Bliss who seemed to be concerned about something besides the dinner and in her flurry forgot to be surprised at the unusual gift for the neighbors shunned them and the poor woman had many anxieties on her husband s account the family being divided one brother a Tory and one a Rebel Can I help ma am I m a master hand at beating eggs Aunt Hitty says I m tired and wouldn t mind sitting a bit if I m not in the way said Tabby bound to discover something more before she left But you be in the way We don t want any help so you d better be steppin along home else suthin besides eggs may git whipped Tale bearers ain t welcome here said old Puah the maid a sour spinster who sympathized with her master and openly declared she hoped the British would put down the Yankee Rebels soon and sharply missus Bliss was in the pantry and heard nothing of this little passage of arms for Tabby hotly resented the epithet of tale bearer though she knew that the men in the parlor were not the only spies on the premises When you are all drummed out of town and this house burnt to the ground you may be glad of my help and I wish you may get it Good day old crab apple answered saucy Tabby and catching up her basket she marched out of the kitchen with her nose in the air But as she passed the front of the house she could not resist another look at the fine dinner table for in those days few had time or heart for feasting and the best napery and china seldom appeared One window stood open and as the girl leaned in something moved under the long cloth that swept the floor It was not the wind for the March day was still and sunny and in a minute out popped a gray cat s head and puss came purring to meet the new comer whose step had roused her from a nap Where one tabby hides another can Can I dare to do it What would become of me if found out How wonderful it would be if I could hear what these men are plotting I will A sound in the next room decided her and thrusting the basket among the bushes she leaped lightly in and vanished under the table leaving puss calmly washing her face on the window sill As soon as it was done Tabby s heart began to flutter but it was too late to retreat for at that moment in bustled missus Bliss and the poor girl could only make herself as small as possible quite hidden under the long folds that fell on all sides from the wide old fashioned table She discovered nothing from the women s chat for it ran on sage cheese egg nog roast pork and lamentations over a burnt pie By the time dinner was served and the guests called in to eat it Tabby was calm enough to have all her wits about her and pride gave her courage to be ready for the consequences whatever they might be For a time the hungry gentlemen were too busy eating to talk much but when missus Bliss went out and the flip came in they were ready for business The window was shut whereat Tabby exulted that she was inside the talkers drew closer together and spoke so low that she could only catch a sentence now and then which caused her to pull her hair with vexation and they swore a good deal to the great horror of the pious little maiden curled up at their feet But she heard enough to prove that she was right for these men were Captain Brown and Ensign De Bernicre of the British army come to learn where the supplies were stored and how well the town was defended She heard mister Bliss tell them that some of the Rebels as he called his neighbors had sent him word that he should not leave the town alive and he was in much fear for his life and property She heard the Englishmen tell him that if he came with them they would protect him for they were armed and three of them together could surely get safely off as no one knew the strangers had arrived but the slip of a girl who showed them the way Here the slip of a girl nodded her head savagely and hoped the speaker s ear still tingled with the buffet she gave it mister Bliss gladly consented to this plan and told them he would show them the road to Lexington which was a shorter way to Boston than through Weston and Sudbury the road they came These people won t fight will they asked Ensign De Bernicre There goes a man who will fight you to the death answered mister Bliss pointing to his brother Tom busy in a distant field The Ensign swore again and gave a stamp that brought his heavy heel down on poor Tabby s hand as she leaned forward to catch every word The cruel blow nearly forced a cry from her but she bit her lips and never stirred though faint with pain When she could listen again mister Bliss was telling all he knew about the hiding places of the powder grain and cannon the enemy wished to capture and destroy He could not tell much for the secrets had been well kept but if he had known that our young Rebel was taking notes of his words under his own table he might have been less ready to betray his neighbors No one suspected a listener however and all Tabby could do was to scowl at three pairs of muddy boots and wish she were a man that she might fight the wearers of them She very nearly had a chance to fight or fly for just as they were preparing to leave the table a sudden sneeze nearly undid her She thought she was lost and hid her face expecting to be dragged out to instant death perhaps by the wrathful men of war What s that exclaimed the Ensign as a sudden pause followed that fatal sound It came from under the table added Captain Brown and a hand lifted a corner of the cloth A shiver went through Tabby and she held her breath with her eye upon that big brown hand but the next moment she could have laughed with joy for pussy saved her The cat had come to doze on her warm skirts and when the cloth was raised fancying she was to be fed by her master puss rose and walked out purring loudly tail erect with its white tip waving like a flag of truce Tis but the old cat gentlemen A good beast and fortunately for us unable to report our conference said mister Bliss with an air of relief for he had started guiltily at the bare idea of an eavesdropper She sneezed as if she were as great a snuff taker as an old woman of whom we asked our way above here laughed the Ensign as they all rose And there she is now coming along as if our grenadiers were after her exclaimed the Captain as the sound of steps and a wailing voice came nearer and nearer Tabby took a long breath and vowed that she would beg or buy the dear old cat that had saved her from destruction Then she forgot her own danger in listening to the poor woman who came in crying that her neighbors said she must leave town at once or they would tar and feather her for showing spies the road to a Tory s house Well for me I came and heard their plots or I might be sent off in like case thought the girl feeling that the more perils she encountered the greater heroine she would be mister Bliss comforted the old soul bidding her stay there till the neighbors forgot her and the officers gave her some money to pay for the costly service she had done them Then they left the room and after some delay the three men set off but Tabby was compelled to stay in her hiding place till the table was cleared and the women deep in gossip as they washed dishes in the kitchen Then the little spy crept out softly and raising the window with great care ran away as fast as her stiff limbs would carry her By the time she reached the Deacon s however and told her tale the Tories were well on their way mister Bliss having provided them with horses that his own flight might be the speedier So they escaped but the warning was given and Tabby received great praise for her hour under the table The town s people hastened their preparations and had time to remove the most valuable stores to neighboring towns to mount their cannon and drill their minute men for these resolute farmers meant to resist oppression and the world knows how well they did it when the hour came Such an early spring had not been known for years and by the nineteenth of April fruit trees were in bloom winter grain was up and the stately elms that fringed the river and overarched the village streets were budding fast It seemed a pity that such a lovely world should be disturbed by strife but liberty was dearer than prosperity or peace and the people leaped from their beds when young doctor Prescott came riding for his life with the message Paul Revere brought from Boston in the night Arm arm the British are coming Like an electric spark the news ran from house to house and men made ready to fight while the brave women bade them go and did their best to guard the treasure confided to their keeping A little later word came that the British were at Lexington and blood had been shed Then the farmers shouldered their guns with few words but stern faces and by sunrise a hundred men stood ready with good Parson Emerson at their head More men were coming in from the neighboring towns and all felt that the hour had arrived when patience ceased to be a virtue and rebellion was just Great was the excitement everywhere but at Captain David Brown s one little heart beat high with hope and fear as Tabby stood at the door looking across the river to the town where drums were beating bells ringing and people hurrying to and fro I can t fight but I must see she said and catching up her cloak she ran over the North Bridge promising her aunt to return and bring her word as soon as the enemy appeared What news Are they coming called the people from the Manse and the few houses that then stood along that road But Tabby could only shake her head and run the faster in her eagerness to see what was happening on that memorable day When she reached the middle of the town she found that the little company had gone along the Lexington road to meet the enemy Nothing daunted she hurried in that direction and climbing a high bank waited to catch a glimpse of the British grenadiers of whom she had heard so much About seven o clock they came the sun glittering on the arms of eight hundred English soldiers marching toward the hundred stout hearted farmers who waited till they were within a few rods of them Let us stand our ground and if we die let us die here said brave Parson Emerson still among his people ready for anything but surrender Nay said a cautious Lincoln man it will not do for us to begin the war So they reluctantly fell back to the town the British following slowly being weary with their seven mile march over the hills from Lexington Coming to a little brown house perched on the hillside one of the thirsty officers spied a well with the bucket swinging at the end of the long pole Running up the bank he was about to drink when a girl who was crouching behind the well sprang up and with an energetic gesture flung the water in his face crying That s the way we serve spies Before Ensign De Bernicre for it was he acting as guide to the enemy could clear his eyes and dry his drenched face Tabby was gone over the hill with a laugh and a defiant gesture toward the red coats below In high feather at this exploit she darted about the town watching the British at their work of destruction They cut down and burnt the liberty pole broke open sixty barrels of flour flung five hundred pounds of balls into the mill pond and wells and set the court house on fire Other parties were ordered to different quarters of the town to ransack houses and destroy all the stores they found Captain Parsons was sent to take possession of the North Bridge and De Bernicre led the way for he had taken notes on his former visit and was a good guide As they marched a little scarlet figure went flying on before them and vanished at the turn of the road It was Tabby hastening home to warn her aunt Quick child whip on this gown and cap and hurry into bed These prying fellows will surely have pity on a sick girl and respect this room if no other said missus Brown briskly helping Tabby into a short night gown and round cap and tucking her well up when she was laid down for between the plump feather beds were hidden many muskets the most precious of their stores This had been planned beforehand and Tabby was glad to rest and tell her tale while Aunty Brown put physic bottles and glasses on the table set some evil smelling herbs to simmer on the hearth and compromising with her conscience concocted a nice little story to tell the invaders Presently they came and it was well for Tabby that the ensign remained below to guard the doors while the men ransacked the house from garret to cellar for he might have recognized the saucy girl who had twice maltreated him These are feathers lift the covers carefully or you ll be half smothered they fly about so said missus Brown as the men came to some casks of cartridges and flints which she had artfully ripped up several pillows to conceal Quite deceived the men gladly passed on leaving the very things they most wanted to destroy Coming to the bed room where more treasures of the same valuable sort were hidden in various nooks and corners the dame held up her finger saying with an anxious glance toward Tabby Step softly please You wouldn t harm a poor sick girl The doctor thinks it is small pox and a fright might kill her I keep the chamber as fresh as I can with yarbs so I guess there isn t much danger of catching it The men reluctantly looked in saw a flushed face on the pillow for Tabby was red with running and her black eyes wild with excitement took a sniff at the wormwood and motherwort and with a hasty glance into a closet or two where sundry clothes concealed hidden doors hastily retired to report the danger and get away as soon as possible They would have been much disgusted at the trick played upon them if they had seen the sick girl fly out of bed and dance a jig of joy as they tramped away to Barrett s Mills But soon Tabby had no heart for merriment as she watched the minute men gather by the bridge saw the British march down on the other side and when their first volley killed brave Isaac Davis and Abner Hosmer of Acton she heard Major Buttrick give the order Fire fellow soldiers for God s sake fire For a little while shots rang smoke rose shouts were heard and red and blue coats mingled in the struggle on the bridge Then the British fell back leaving two dead soldiers behind them These were buried where they fell and the bodies of the Acton men were sent home to their poor wives Concord s first martyrs for liberty No need to tell more of the story of that day all children know it and many have made a pilgrimage to see the old monument set up where the English fell and the bronze Minute Man standing on his granite pedestal to mark the spot where the brave Concord farmers fired the shot that made the old North Bridge immortal We must follow Tabby and tell how she got her table cloth When the fight was over the dead buried the wounded cared for and the prisoners exchanged the Tories were punished doctor Lee was confined to his own farm on penalty of being shot if he left it and the property of Daniel Bliss was confiscated by government Some things were sold at auction and Captain Brown bought the fine cloth and gave it to Tabby saying heartily There my girl that belongs to you and you may well be proud of it for thanks to your quick wits and eyes and ears we were not taken unawares but sent the red coats back faster than they came And Tabby was proud of it keeping it carefully displaying it with immense satisfaction whenever she told the story and spinning busily to make a set of napkins to go with it It covered the table when her wedding supper was spread was used at the christening of her first boy and for many a Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner through the happy years of her married life Then it was preserved by her daughters as a relic of their mother s youth and long after the old woman was gone the well worn cloth still appeared on great occasions till it grew too thin for anything but careful keeping to illustrate the story so proudly told by the grandchildren who found it hard to believe that the feeble old lady of ninety could be the lively lass who played her little part in the Revolution with such spirit In eighteen sixty one Tabby s table cloth saw another war and made an honorable end When men were called for Concord responded Here and sent a goodly number led by another brave Colonel Prescott Barretts Hosmers Melvins Browns and Wheelers stood shoulder to shoulder as their grandfathers stood that day to meet the British by the bridge Mothers said Go my son as bravely as before and sisters and sweethearts smiled with wet eyes as the boys in blue marched away again cheered on by another noble Emerson More than one of Tabby s descendants went some to fight some to nurse and for four long years the old town worked and waited hoped and prayed burying the dear dead boys sent home nursing those who brought back honorable wounds and sending more to man the breaches made by the awful battles that filled both North and South with a wilderness of graves The women knit and sewed Sundays as well as weekdays to supply the call for clothes the men emptied their pockets freely glad to give and the minister after preaching like a Christian soldier took off his coat and packed boxes of comforts like a tender father More lint and bandages called for and I do believe we ve torn and picked up every old rag in the town said one busy lady to another as several sat together making comfort bags in the third year of the long struggle I have cleared my garret of nearly everything in it and only wish I had more to give answered one of the patriotic Barrett mothers We can t buy anything so soft and good as worn out sheets and table cloths New ones wont do or I d cut up every one of mine said a newly married Wheeler sewing for dear life as she remembered the many cousins gone to the war I think I shall have to give our Revolutionary table cloth It s old enough and soft as silk and I m sure my blessed grandmother would think that it couldn t make a better end spoke up white headed Madam Hubbard for Tabby Tarbell had married one of that numerous and worthy race Oh you wouldn t cut up that famous cloth would you cried the younger woman Yes I will It s in rags and when I m gone no one will care for it Folks don t seem to remember what the women did in those days so it s no use keeping relics of em answered the old lady who would have owned herself mistaken if she could have looked forward to eighteen seventy six when the town celebrated its centennial and proudly exhibited the little scissors with which missus Barrett cut paper for cartridges among other ancient trophies of that earlier day So the ancient cloth was carefully made into a boxful of the finest lint and softest squares to lay on wounds and sent to one of the Concord women who had gone as a nurse Here s a treasure she said as she came to it among other comforts newly arrived from home Just what I want for my brave Rebel and poor little Johnny Bullard The brave Rebel was a Southern man who had fought well and was badly wounded in many ways yet never complained and in the midst of great suffering was always so courteous patient and courageous that the men called him our gentleman and tried to show how much they respected so gallant a foe John Bullard was an English drummer boy who had been through several battles stoutly drumming away in spite of bullets and cannon balls cheering many a camp fire with his voice for he sang like a blackbird and was always merry always plucky and so great a favorite in his regiment that all mourned for little Johnny when his right arm was shot off at Gettysburg It was thought he would die but he pulled through the worst of it and was slowly struggling back to health still trying to be gay and beginning to chirp feebly now and then like a convalescent bird Here Johnny is some splendid lint for this poor arm and some of the softest compresses for Carrol s wound He is asleep so I ll begin with you and while I work I ll amuse you with the story of the old table cloth this lint came from said Nurse Hunt as she stood by the bed where the thin white face smiled at her though the boy dreaded the hard quarter of an hour he had to endure every day Thanky mum We aven t ad a story for a good bit I m arty this mornin and think I ll be hup by this day week won t I I hope so Now shut your eyes and listen then you wont mind the twinges I give you gentle as I try to be answered the nurse beginning her painful task Then she told the story of Tabby s table cloth and the boy enjoyed it immensely laughing out at the slapping and the throwing water in the ensign s face and openly rejoicing when the red coats got the worst of it As we ve beaten all the rest of the world I don t mind our aving bad luck that time We har friends now and I ll fight for you mum like a British bull dog if I hever get the chance said Johnny when the tale and dressing were ended So you shall I like to turn a brave enemy into a faithful friend as I hope we shall yet be able to do with our Southern brothers I admire their courage and their loyalty to what they believe to be right and we are all suffering the punishment we deserve for waiting till this sad war came instead of settling the trouble years ago as we might have done if we had loved honesty and honor more than money and power As she spoke Miss Hunt turned to her other patient and saw by the expression of his face that he had heard both the tale and the talk He smiled and said Good morning as usual but when she stooped to lay a compress of the soft wet damask on the angry wound in his breast he whispered with a grateful look You have changed one Southern brother from an enemy into a friend Whether I live or die I never can forget how generous and kind you have all been to me Thank you It is worth months of anxiety and care to hear such words Let us shake hands and do our best to make North and South as good friends as England and America now are said the nurse offering her hand Me too I ve got one and left and I give it ye with all me art God bless ye sir and a lively getting hup for the two of us cried Johnny stretching across the narrow space that divided the beds with a beaming face and true English readiness to forgive a fallen foe when he had proved a brave one The three hands met in a warm shake and the act was a little lesson more eloquent than words to the lookers on for the spirit of brotherhood that should bind us all together worked the miracle of linking these three by the frail threads spun a century ago So Tabby s table cloth did make a beautiful and useful end at last Illustration ELI S EDUCATION My turn now said Walt as they assembled again after a busy day spent in snow balling statue making and tumbling in the drifts that still continued to rise on all sides Here is just the story for you and Geoff You are getting ready for college after years of the best schooling and it will do you good to hear how hard some boys have had to work to get a little learning said Grandma glancing at the slip that Walt drew from the basket which Aunt Elinor held out to him and from which Lotty had drawn the story of Tabby s Table Cloth This is a true tale and the man became famous for his wisdom as well as much loved and honored for his virtue and interest in all good things added Aunt Elinor as she began to read the story of ELI S EDUCATION Many years ago a boy of sixteen sat in a little room in an old farm house up among the Connecticut hills writing busily in a book made of odd bits of paper stitched together with a cover formed of two thin boards The lid of a blue chest was his desk the end of a tallow candle stuck into a potato was his lamp a mixture of soot and vinegar his ink and a quill from the gray goose his pen A Webster s Spelling book Dilworth s New Guide to the English Tongue Daboll s Arithmetic and the American Preceptor stood on the chimney piece over his head with the Assembly Catechism and New Testament in the place of honor This was his library and now and then a borrowed Pilgrim s Progress Fox s Book of Martyrs or some stray volume gladdened his heart for he passionately loved books and scoured the neighborhood for miles around to feed this steadily increasing hunger Every penny he could earn or save went to buy a song or a story from the peddlers who occasionally climbed the hill to the solitary farm house When others took a noon spell he read under the trees or by the fire He carried a book in his pocket and studied as he went with the cows to and from the pasture and sat late in his little room ciphering on an old slate or puzzling his young brain over some question which no one could answer for him His father had no patience with him called him a shiftless dreamer and threatened to burn the beloved books But his mother defended him for he was her youngest and the pride of her heart so she let him scribble all over her floors before she scrubbed them up dipped extra thick candles for his use saved every scrap of paper to swell his little store and firmly believed that he would turn out the great man of the family His brothers joked about his queer ways but in his sisters he found firm friends and tender comforters for all his woes So he struggled along working on the farm in summer and in a clock shop during the winter with such brief spells of schooling as he could get between whiles improving even these poor opportunities so well that he was letter writer for all the young people in the neighborhood Now he was writing in his journal very slowly but very well shaping his letters with unusual grace and freedom for the wide snow banks were his copy books in winter and on their white pages he had learned to sweep splendid capitals or link syllables handsomely together This is what he wrote that night with a sparkle in the blue eyes and a firm folding of the lips that made the boyish face resolute and manly I am set in my own mind that I get learning I see not how but my will is strong and mother hopes for to make a scholar of me So please God we shall do it Then he shut the little book and put it carefully away in the blue chest with pen and ink as if they were very precious things piously said his prayers and was soon asleep under the homespun coverlet dreaming splendid dreams while a great bright star looked in at the low window as if waiting to show him the road to fortune And God did please to help the patient lad only the next evening came an opportunity he had never imagined As he sat playing Over the Hills and Far Away on the fiddle that he had himself made out of maple wood with a bow strung from the tail of the old farm horse a neighbor came in to talk over the fall pork and cider and tell the news Ef you want ter go over the hills and far away Eli here s the chance I see a man down to Woodtick who was askin ef I knew any likely young chap who d like to git scribers for a pious book he wants to sell He d pay for the job when the names is got and the books give out That s ruther in your line boy so I calk lated your daddy would spare you as you ain t much of a hand at shuckin corn nor cartin pummace Haw haw laughed the big brothers Ambrose Vitruvius and Junius Solomon as neighbor Terry spoke with a sly twinkle in his eye But the sisters Miranda and Pamela smiled for joy while the good mother stopped her busy wheel to listen eagerly Eli laid down his fiddle and came to the hearth where the others sat with such a wide awake expression on his usually thoughtful face that it was plain that he liked the idea I ll do it if father ll let me he said looking wistfully at the industrious man who was shaving axe handles for the winter wood chopping after his day s work was over Wal I can spare you for a week mebby It s not time for the clock shop yet and sence you ve heerd o this you won t do your chores right so you may as wal see what you can make of peddlin Thank you sir I ll give you all I get to pay for my time began Eli glowing with pleasure at the prospect of seeing a little of the world for one of his most cherished dreams was to cross the blue hills that hemmed him in and find what lay beyond Guess I can afford to give you all you ll make this trip answered his father in a tone that made the brothers laugh again Boys don t pester Eli Every one hasn t a call to farmin and it s wal to foller the leadin s of Providence when they come along said the mother stroking the smooth brown head at her knee for Eli always went to her footstool with his sorrows and his joys So it was settled and next day the boy in his home spun and home made Sunday best set off to see his employer and secure the job He got it and for three days trudged up and down the steep roads calling at every house with a sample of his book the reverend John Flavel s treatise on Keeping the Heart Eli s winning face modest manner and earnest voice served him well and he got many names for books were scarce in those days and a pious work was a treasure to many a good soul who found it difficult to keep the heart strong and cheerful in troublous times Then the books were to be delivered and anxious to save his small earnings Eli hired no horse to transport his load but borrowed a stout green shawl from his mother and with his pack on his back marched bravely away to finish his task His wages were spent in a new prayer book for his mother smart handkerchief pins for the faithful sisters and a good store of paper for himself This trip was so successful that he was seized with a strong desire to try a more ambitious and extended one for these glimpses of the world showed him how much he had to learn and how pleasantly he could pick up knowledge in these flights What be you a brewdin over now boy Gettin ready for the clock shop It s most time for winter work and Terry says you do pretty wal at puttin together said the farmer a day or two after the boy s return as they sat at dinner all helping themselves from the large pewter platter heaped with pork and vegetables I was wishin I could go South with Gad Upson He s been twice with clocks and notions and wants a mate Hoadley fits him out and pays him a good share if he does well Couldn t I go along I hate that old shop and I know I can do something better than put together the insides of cheap clocks Eli spoke eagerly and gave his mother an imploring look which brought her to second the motion at once her consent having been already won The brothers stared as if Eli had proposed to go up in a balloon for to them the South seemed farther off than Africa does nowadays The father had evidently been secretly prepared for he showed no surprise and merely paused a moment to look at his ambitious son with a glance in which amusement and reproach were mingled When a hen finds she s hatched a duck s egg it s no use for her to cackle that ducklin will take to the water in spite on her and paddle off nobody knows where Go ahead boy and when you get enough of junketin round the world come home and fall to work Then I may go cried Eli upsetting his mug of cider in his excitement His father nodded being too busy eating cabbage with a wide bladed green handled knife to speak just then Eli red and speechless with delight and gratitude could only sit and beam at his family till a sob drew his attention to sister Pamela whose pet he was Don t Pam don t I ll come back all right and bring you news and all the pretty things I can I must go I feel as if I couldn t breathe shut up here winters I s pose it s wicked but I can t help it whispered Eli with his arm around his buxom eighteen year old sister who laid her head on his shoulder and held him tight Daughter it s sinful to repine at the ways of Providence I see a leadin plain in this and ef I can be chirk when my dear boy is goin pears to me you ought to keep a taut rein on your feelin s and not spile his pleasure The good mother s eyes were full of tears as she spoke but she caught up the end of her short gown and wiped them quickly away to smile on Eli who thanked her with a loving look It s so lonesome when he s not here What will we do evenings without the fiddle or Eli to read a piece in some of his books while we spin said poor Pam ashamed of her grief yet glad to hide her tears by affecting to settle the long wooden bodkin that held up her coils of brown hair Obed Finch will be comin along I guess likely and he ll read to you out uv Eli s book about keepin the heart and you ll find your n gone fore you know it said Junius Solomon in a tone that made pretty Pam blush and run away while the rest laughed at her confusion So it was settled and when all was ready the boy came home to show his equipment before he started A very modest outfit only two tin trunks slung across the shoulders filled with jewelry combs lace essences and small wares I hate to have ye go son but it s better than to be mopin to hum gettin desperut for books and rilin father We ll all be workin for ye so be chipper and do wal Keep steddy and don t disgrace your folks The Lord bless ye my dear boy and hold ye in the holler of his hand Her own rough hand was on his head as his mother spoke with wet eyes and the tall lad kissed her tenderly whispering with a choke in his throat Good by mammy dear I ll remember Then he tramped away to join his mate turning now and then to nod and smile and show a ruddy face full of happiness while the family watched him out of sight with mingled hopes and doubts and fears Mails were slow in those days but at length a letter came and here it is a true copy of one written by a boy in eighteen twenty NORFOLK VA December fourth HONORED PARENTS I write to inform you I am safe here and to work Our business is profitable and I am fast learning the Quirks and Turns of trade We are going to the eastern shore of Va calculating to be gone six weeks The inhabitants are sociable and hospitable and you need not fear I shall suffer for I find many almost fathers and mothers among these good folks Taking our trunks we travel through the country entering the houses of the rich and poor offering our goods and earning our wages by the sweat of our brows How do you think we look Like two Awkward Homespun Tugging Yankee peddlers No that is not the case By people of breeding we are treated with politeness and gentility and the low and vulgar we do not seek For my part I enjoy travelling more than I expected Conversation with new folks observing manners and customs and seeing the world does me great good I never met a real gentleman till I came here Their hospitality allows me to see and copy their fine ways of acting and speaking and they put the most Bashful at ease Gad likes the maids and stays in the kitchen most times I get into the libraries and read when we put up nights and the ladies are most kind to me everywhere I m so tall they can t believe I m only sixteen They aren t as

Many such letters went to and fro that winter and Eli faithfully reported all his adventures For he had many and once or twice was in danger of losing his life On one occasion having parted from his mate for a day or two wishing to try his luck alone our young peddler found himself late in the afternoon approaching the Dismal Swamp A tempest arose adding to the loneliness and terror of the hour The cypresses uprooted by the blast fell now and then across the road endangering the poor boy s head A sluggish stream rolled through tangled junipers and beds of reeds and the fen on either side was full of ugly creatures lizards snakes and toads while owls scared by the storm flew wildly about and hooted dismally Just at the height of the tumult Eli saw three men coming toward him and gladly hastened to meet them hoping to have their company or learn of them where he could find a shelter But their bad faces daunted him and he would have hurried by without speaking if they had not stopped him roughly demanding his name and business The tall stripling was brave but his youthful face showed him to be but a boy and the consciousness of a well filled purse in his pocket made him anxious to escape So he answered briefly and tried to go on But two men held him in spite of his struggles while the third rifled his pockets broke open his trunks and took all that was of any value in the way of watches and jewelry Then they left him with a cruel joke about a good journey and made off with their booty It was the first time poor Eli had met with such a mishap and as he stood in the rain looking at his wares scattered about the road he felt inclined to throw himself into the creek and forget his woes there among the frogs and snakes But he had a stout heart and soon decided to make the best of it since nothing could be done to mend the matter Gathering up his bedraggled laces scattered scent bottles and dirty buttons pins and needles he trudged sadly on feeling that for him this was indeed a Dismal Swamp I told you we d better stick together but you wanted to be so dre dful smart and go travellin off alone in them out n the way places Might a known you d get overhauled somers I always did think you was a gump Eli and now I m sure on t was all the comfort Gad gave him when they met and the direful tale was told What shall I do now asked the poor lad My notions aren t worth selling and my money s gone I ll have to pay Hoadley somehow You d better foot it home and go to choppin punkins for the cows or help your marm spin I vow I never did see such a chap for gettin into a mess scolded Gad who was a true Yankee and made a successful trader even in a small way We ll sleep on it said Eli gently and went to bed very low in his mind Perhaps a few tears wet his pillow as he lay awake and the prayers his mother taught him were whispered in the silence of the night for hope revived comfort came and in the morning his serene face and sensible plan proved to his irate friend that the gump had a wise head and a manly heart after all Gad it is just the time for the new almanacs and Allen wants men to sell em I thought it was small business before but beggars mustn t be choosers so I m going right off to offer for the job round here It will do for a start and if I m smart Allen will give me a better chance maybe That s a fust rate plan Go ahead and I ll say a good word for you Allen knows me and books is in your line so I guess you ll do wal if you keep out n the mashes answered Gad with great good will having slept off his vexation The plan did go well and for weeks the rosy faced gentle voiced youth might have been seen mildly offering the new almanacs at doors and shops and at street corners with a wistful look in his blue eyes and a courtesy of manner that attracted many customers and earned many a dollar Several mates envying his fine handwriting and pitying his hard luck took lessons in penmanship of him and paid him fairly whereat he rejoiced over the hours spent at home flat on the kitchen floor or flourishing splendid capitals on the snow banks when his nose was blue with cold and his hands half frozen When the season for the yellow covered almanacs was over Eli having won the confidence of his employer was fitted out with more notions and again set forth on his travels armed this time and in company with his townsman He prospered well and all winter trudged to and fro seemingly a common peddler but really a student making the world his book and bent on learning all he could Travel taught him geography and history for he soon knew every corner of Virginia looked longingly at the ancient walls of William and Mary College where Jefferson and Monroe studied where young George Washington received his surveyor s commission and in his later years served as Chancellor In Yorktown he heard all about the siege of seventeen eighty one saw Lord Cornwallis s lodgings and the cave named for him met pleasant people whose fine speech and manners he carefully copied read excellent books wherever he could find them and observed remembered and stored away all that he saw heard and learned to help and adorn his later life By spring he set out for home having slowly saved enough to repay Hoadley for the lost goods But as if Providence meant to teach him another lesson and make him still more prudent humble and manly a sad adventure befell him on his way While waiting for the coaster that was to take them home he one day went in swimming with Gad for this was one of the favorite pastimes of the Connecticut boys who on Saturday nights congregated by the score at a pond called Benson s Pot and leaped from the spring board like circus tumblers turning somersaults into the deep water below It was too early for such sport now the water was very cold and poor Gad taken with cramp nearly drowned Eli by clinging to his legs as he went down Freeing himself with difficulty Eli tried to save his friend but the current swept the helpless man away and he was lost Hurriedly dressing Eli ran for aid but found himself regarded with suspicion by those to whom he told his story for he was a stranger in the place and certain peddlers who had gone before had left a bad name behind them To his horror he was arrested accused of murder and would have been tried for his life if mister Allen of Norfolk had not come to testify to his good character and set him free Poor Gad s body was found and buried and after a month s delay Eli set out again alone heavy hearted and very poor for all his own little savings had been consumed by various expenses mister Hoadley s money was untouched but not increased as he hoped to have it and rather than borrow a penny of it Eli landed barefooted His boots were so old he threw them overboard and spent his last dollar for a cheap pair of shoes to wear when he appeared at home for they were not stout enough to stand travel So like Franklin with his rolls the lad ate crackers and cheese as he trudged through the city and set out for the far away farm house among the hills A long journey but a pleasant one in spite of his troubles for spring made the world lovely habit made walking no hardship and all he had seen in his wanderings passed before him at will like a panorama full of color and variety Letters had gone before but it was a sad homecoming and when all was told Eli said Now father I ll go to work I ve had my wish and enjoyed it a sight and would go again but I feel as if I ought to work as long as I can t pay for my time That s hearty son and I m obleeged to ye Hear what mother s got to say and then do whichever you prefer answered the farmer with a nod toward his wife who with the girls seemed full of some pleasant news which they longed to tell I ve sold all the cloth we made last winter for a good sum and father says you may hev the spendin on t It will be enough to pay your board down to Uncle Tillotson s while you study with him so s t you kin be gettin ready for college next year I ve sot my heart on t and you musn t disapp int me and the girls said the good woman with a face full of faith and pride in her boy in spite of all mishaps Oh mammy how good you be It don t seem as if I ought to take it But I do want to go cried Eli catching her round the neck in an ecstasy of boyish delight and gratitude Here Miranda and Pamela appeared bringing their homely gifts of warm hose and new shirts made from wool and flax grown by the father and spun and woven by the accomplished housewife A very happy youth was Eli when he again set off to the city with his humble outfit and slender purse though father still looked doubtful and the brothers were more sure than ever that Eli was a fool to prefer dry books to country work and fun A busy year followed Eli studying as never boy studied before with the excellent minister who soon grew proud of his best pupil Less preparation was needed in those days and perhaps more love and industry went to the work for necessity is a stern master and poor boys often work wonders if the spark of greatness is there Eli had his wish in time and went to college mother and sisters making it possible by the sale of their handiwork for the girls were famous spinners and the mother the best weaver in the country around How willingly they toiled for Eli rising early and sitting late cheering their labor with loving talk of the dear lad s progress and an unfailing faith in his future success Many a long ride did that good mother take to the city miles away with a great roll of cloth on the pillion behind her to sell that she might pay her son s college bills Many a coveted pleasure did the faithful sisters give up that they might keep Eli well clothed or send him some country dainty to cheer the studies which seemed to them painfully hard and mysteriously precious Father began to take pride in the ugly duckling now and brothers to brag of his great learning Neighbors came in to hear his letters and when vacation brought him home the lads and lasses regarded him with a certain awe for his manners were better his language purer than theirs and the new life he led refined the country boy till he seemed a gentleman The second year he yielded to temptation and got into debt Being anxious to do credit to his family of whom he was secretly a little ashamed about this time he spent money on his clothes conscious that he was a comely youth with a great love of beauty and a longing for all that cultivates and embellishes character and life An elegant gentleman astonished the hill folk that season by appearing at the little church in a suit such as the greatest rustic dandy never imagined in his wildest dreams the tall white hat with rolling brim Marseilles vest with watch chain and seals festooned across it the fine blue coat with its brass buttons and the nankeen trousers strapped over boots so tight that it was torture to walk in them Armed with a cane in the well gloved hand an imposing brooch in the frills of the linen shirt Eli sauntered across the green the observed of all observers proudly hoping that the blue eyes of a certain sweet Lucinda were fixed admiringly upon him The boys were the first to recover from the shock and promptly resented the transformation of their former butt into a city beau by jeering openly and affecting great scorn of the envied splendor The poor jackdaw somewhat abashed at the effect of his plumes tried to prove that he felt no superiority by being very affable which won the lasses but failed to soften the hearts of the boys and when he secured the belle of the village for the Thanksgiving drive and dance the young men resolved that pride should have a fall Arrayed in all his finery Eli drove pretty Lucinda in a smart borrowed wagon to the tavern where the dance was held Full of the airs and graces he had learned at college the once bashful awkward Eli was the admired of all eyes as he pranced down the long contra dance in the agonizing boots or played threading the needle without the least reluctance on the part of the blushing girls to pay the fine of a kiss when the players sung the old rhyme The needle s eye no one can pass The thread that runs so true It has caught many a pretty lass And now it has caught you But his glory was short lived for some enemy maliciously drew out the linchpin from the smart wagon and as they were gayly driving homeward over the hills the downfall came and out they both went to the great damage of Eli s city suit and poor Lucinda s simple finery Fortunately no bones were broken and picking themselves up they sadly footed it home hoping the mishap would remain unknown But the rogues took care that Eli should not escape and the whole neighborhood laughed over the joke for the fine hat was ruined and the costly coat split down the back in the ignominious tumble Great was the humiliation of the poor student for not only was he ridiculed but Lucinda would not forgive him and the blue eyes smiled upon another worst of all he had to confess his debts and borrow money of his father to pay them He meekly bore the stern rebuke that came with the hard earned dollars but the sight of the tears his mother shed even while she comforted him filled him with remorse He went back to his books in a homespun suit a sadder and a wiser boy and fell to work as if resolved to wash out past errors and regain the confidence he had lost All that winter the wheels turned and the loom jangled that the rolls of cloth might be increased and never was the day too cold the way too long for the good mother s pious pilgrimage That summer a man came home to them shabby enough as to his clothes but so wonderfully improved in other ways that not only did the women folk glow with tender pride but father and brothers looked at him with respect and owned at last there was something in Eli No vacation for me he said I must work to pay my debts and as I am not of much use here I ll try my old plan and peddle some money into my empty pockets It was both comic and pathetic to see the shoulders that had worn the fine broadcloth burdened with a yoke the hands that had worn kid gloves grasping the tin trunks and the dapper feet trudging through dust and dew in cow hide boots But the face under the old straw hat was a manlier one than that which the tall beaver crowned and the heart under the rough vest was far happier than when the gold chain glittered above it He did so well that when he returned to college his debts were paid and the family faith in Eli restored That was an eventful year for one brother married and one went off to seek his fortune the father mortgaging his farm to give these sons a fair start in life Eli was to be a minister and the farmer left his fortunes in the hands of his wife who like many another good mother was the making of the great man of the family and was content with that knowledge leaving him the glory The next year Eli graduated with honor and went home to be received with great rejoicing just twenty one and a free man He had longed for this time and planned a happy studious life preparing to preach the gospel in a little parsonage of his own But suddenly all was changed joy turned to sorrow hope to doubt and Eli was called to relinquish liberty for duty to give up his own dreams of a home to keep a roof over the heads of the dear mother and the faithful sisters His father died suddenly leaving very little for the women folk besides the independence that lay in the skill of their own thrifty hands The elder brothers could not offer much help and Eli was the one to whom the poor souls turned in their hour of sorrow and anxiety Go on dear and don t pester yourself about us We can find food and firin here as long as the old farm is ours I guess we can manage to pay off the mortgage by and by It don t seem as if I could turn out after livin here ever sense I was married and poor father so fond on t The widow covered her face with her apron and Eli put his arms about her saying manfully as he gave up all his fondest hopes for her dearer sake Cheer up mother and trust to me I should be a poor fellow if I allowed you and the girls to want after all you ve done for me I can get a school and earn instead of spend Teaching and studying can go on together I m sure I shouldn t prosper if I shirked my duty and I won t The three sad women clung to him and the brothers looking at his brave bright face felt that Eli was indeed a man to lean on and to love in times like this Well thought the young philosopher the Lord knows what is best for me and perhaps this is a part of my education I ll try to think so and hope to get some good out of a hard job In this spirit he set about teaching and prospered wonderfully for his own great love of learning made it an easy and delightful task to help others as he had longed to be helped His innocent and tender nature made all children love him and gave him a remarkable power over them so when the first hard months were past and his efforts began to bear fruit he found that what had seemed an affliction was a blessing and that teaching was his special gift Filial duty sweetened the task a submissive heart found happiness in self sacrifice and a wise soul showed him what a noble and lovely work it was to minister to little children for of such is the kingdom of heaven For years Eli taught and his school grew famous for he copied the fashions of other countries invented new methods and gave himself so entirely to his profession that he could not fail of success The mortgage was paid off and Eli made frequent pilgrimages to the dear old mother whose staff and comfort he still was The sisters married well the brothers prospered and at thirty the schoolmaster found a nobler mate than pretty Lucinda and soon had some little pupils of his very own to love and teach There his youth ends but after the years of teaching he began to preach at last not in one pulpit but in many all over the land diffusing good thoughts now as he had peddled small wares when a boy still learning as he went still loving books and studying mankind still patient pious dutiful and tender a wise and beautiful old man till at eighty Eli s education ended Illustration Illustration ONAWANDAH What in the world have I chosen exclaimed Geoff as he drew out a manuscript in his turn and read the queer name
7789_103120_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 A story that will just suit you I think 
7789_103120_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The hero is an Indian and a brave one as you will see 
none	none	I learned the little tale from an old woman who lived in the valley of the Connecticut which the Indians called the Long River of Pines 
7789_103120_000006_000000	train-clean-360	With this very short preface Aunt Elinor began to read in her best manner the story of
none	none	 ONAWANDAH 
7789_103120_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Long ago when hostile Indians haunted the great forests and every settlement had its fort for the protection of the inhabitants in one of the towns on the Connecticut River lived Parson Bain and his little son and daughter 
none	none	The wife and mother was dead but an old servant took care of them and did her best to make Reuben and Eunice good children Her direst threat when they were naughty was The Indians will come and fetch you if you don t behave So they grew up in great fear of the red men 
7789_103120_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Even the friendly Indians who sometimes came for food or powder were regarded with suspicion by the people 
7789_103120_000008_000003	train-clean-360	No man went to work without his gun near by 
7789_103120_000008_000004	train-clean-360	On Sundays when they trudged to the rude meeting house all carried the trusty rifle on the shoulder and while the pastor preached a sentinel mounted guard at the door to give warning if canoes came down the river or a dark face peered from the wood 
7789_103120_000009_000000	train-clean-360	One autumn night when the first heavy rains were falling and a cold wind whistled through the valley a knock came at the minister s door and opening it he found an Indian boy ragged hungry and foot sore who begged for food and shelter 
7789_103120_000009_000001	train-clean-360	In his broken way he told how he had fallen ill and been left to die by enemies who had taken him from his own people months before how he had wandered for days till almost sinking and that he had come now to ask for help led by the hospitable light in the parsonage window 
7789_103120_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Send him away master or harm will come of it 
7789_103120_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He is a spy and we shall all be scalped by the murdering Injuns who are waiting in the wood said old Becky harshly while little Eunice hid in the old servant s ample skirts and twelve year old Reuben laid his hand on his cross bow ready to defend his sister if need be 
7789_103120_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But the good man drew the poor lad in saying with his friendly smile Shall not a Christian be as hospitable as a godless savage 
7789_103120_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Come in child and be fed you sorely need rest and shelter 
7789_103120_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Leaving his face to express the gratitude he had no words to tell the boy sat by the comfortable fire and ate like a famished wolf while Becky muttered her forebodings and the children eyed the dark youth at a safe distance 
7789_103120_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Something in his pinched face wounded foot and eyes full of dumb pain and patience touched the little girl s tender heart and yielding to a pitiful impulse she brought her own basin of new milk and setting it beside the stranger ran to hide behind her father suddenly remembering that this was one of the dreaded Indians 
7789_103120_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 That was well done little daughter 
7789_103120_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Thou shalt love thine enemies and share thy bread with the needy 
7789_103120_000013_000002	train-clean-360	See he is smiling that pleased him and he wishes us to be his friends 
none	none	But Eunice ventured no more that night and quaked in her little bed at the thought of the strange boy sleeping on a blanket before the fire below 
7789_103120_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Reuben hid his fears better and resolved to watch while others slept but was off as soon as his curly head touched the pillow and dreamed of tomahawks and war whoops till morning 
7789_103120_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Next day neighbors came to see the waif and one and all advised sending him away as soon as possible since he was doubtless a spy as Becky said and would bring trouble of some sort 
7789_103120_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 When he is well he may go whithersoever he will but while he is too lame to walk weak with hunger and worn out with weariness I will harbor him 
7789_103120_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He cannot feign suffering and starvation like this 
7789_103120_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I shall do my duty and leave the consequences to the Lord answered the parson with such pious firmness that the neighbors said no more 
7789_103120_000017_000000	train-clean-360	But they kept a close watch upon Onawandah when he went among them silent and submissive but with the proud air of a captive prince and sometimes a fierce flash in his black eyes when the other lads taunted him with his red skin 
none	none	He was very lame for weeks and could only sit in the sun weaving pretty baskets for Eunice and shaping bows and arrows for Reuben 
7789_103120_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The children were soon his friends for with them he was always gentle trying in his soft language and expressive gestures to show his good will and gratitude for they defended him against their ruder playmates and following their father s example trusted and cherished the homeless youth 
7789_103120_000018_000000	train-clean-360	When he was able to walk he taught the boy to shoot and trap the wild creatures of the wood to find fish where others failed and to guide himself in the wilderness by star and sun wind and water 
7789_103120_000018_000001	train-clean-360	To Eunice he brought little offerings of bark and feathers taught her to make moccasins of skin belts of shells or pouches gay with porcupine quills and colored grass 
7789_103120_000018_000002	train-clean-360	He would not work for old Becky who plainly showed her distrust saying A brave does not grind corn and bring wood that is squaw s work 
7789_103120_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Onawandah will hunt and fish and fight for you but no more And even the request of the parson could not win obedience in this though the boy would have died for the good man 
7789_103120_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 We can not tame an eagle as we can a barnyard fowl 
7789_103120_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Let him remember only kindness of us and so we turn a foe into a friend said Parson Bain stroking the sleek dark head that always bowed before him with a docile reverence shown to no other living creature 
7789_103120_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Winter came and the settlers fared hardly through the long months when the drifts rose to the eaves of their low cabins and the stores carefully harvested failed to supply even their simple wants 
7789_103120_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But the minister s family never lacked wild meat for Onawandah proved himself a better hunter than any man in the town and the boy of sixteen led the way on his snow shoes when they went to track a bear to its den chase the deer for miles or shoot the wolves that howled about their homes in the winter nights 
7789_103120_000021_000000	train-clean-360	But he never joined in their games and sat apart when the young folk made merry as if he scorned such childish pastimes and longed to be a man in all things 
7789_103120_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Why he stayed when he was well again no one could tell unless he waited for spring to make his way to his own people 
none	none	But Reuben and Eunice rejoiced to keep him for while he taught them many things he was their pupil also learning English rapidly and proving himself a very affectionate and devoted friend and servant in his own quiet way Be of good cheer little daughter I shall be gone but three days and our brave Onawandah will guard you well said the parson one April morning as he mounted his horse to visit a distant settlement where the bitter winter had brought sickness and death to more than one household The boy showed his white teeth in a bright smile as he stood beside the children while Becky croaked with a shake of the head
7789_103120_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope you mayn t find you ve warmed a viper in your bosom master 
none	none	Two days later it seemed as if Becky was a true prophet and that the confiding minister had been terribly deceived for Onawandah went away to hunt and that night the awful war whoop woke the sleeping villagers to find their houses burning while the hidden Indians shot at them by the light of the fires kindled by dusky scouts 
7789_103120_000025_000001	train-clean-360	In terror and confusion the whites flew to the fort and while the men fought bravely the women held blankets to catch arrows and bullets or bound up the hurts of their defenders 
7789_103120_000026_000000	train-clean-360	It was all over by daylight and the red men sped away up the river with several prisoners and such booty as they could plunder from the deserted houses 
none	none	Not till all fear of a return of their enemies was over did the poor people venture to leave the fort and seek their ruined homes 
7789_103120_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Then it was discovered that Becky and the parson s children were gone and great was the bewailing for the good man was much beloved by all his flock 
none	none	Suddenly the smothered voice of Becky was heard by a party of visitors calling dolefully
7789_103120_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I am here betwixt the beds 
7789_103120_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Pull me out neighbors for I am half dead with fright and smothering 
7789_103120_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The old woman was quickly extricated from her hiding place and with much energy declared that she had seen Onawandah disguised with war paint among the Indians and that he had torn away the children from her arms before she could fly from the house 
7789_103120_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 He chose his time well when they were defenceless dear lambs 
7789_103120_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Spite of all my warnings master trusted him and this is the thanks we get Oh my poor master 
7789_103120_000030_000002	train-clean-360	How can I tell him this heavy news 
7789_103120_000031_000000	train-clean-360	There was no need to tell it for as Becky sat moaning and beating her breast on the fireless hearth and the sympathizing neighbors stood about her the sound of a horse s hoofs was heard and the parson came down the hilly road like one riding for his life 
7789_103120_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He had seen the smoke afar off guessed the sad truth and hurried on to find his home in ruins and to learn by his first glance at the faces around him that his children were gone 
7789_103120_000032_000000	train-clean-360	When he had heard all there was to tell he sat down upon his door stone with his head in his hands praying for strength to bear a grief too deep for words 
none	none	The wounded and weary men tried to comfort him with hope and the women wept with him as they hugged their own babies closer to the hearts that ached for the lost children 
7789_103120_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Suddenly a stir went through the mournful group as Onawandah came from the wood with a young deer upon his shoulders and amazement in his face as he saw the desolation before him 
7789_103120_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Dropping his burden he stood an instant looking with eyes that kindled fiercely then he came bounding toward them undaunted by the hatred suspicion and surprise plainly written on the countenances before him 
7789_103120_000032_000004	train-clean-360	He missed his playmates and asked but one question 
7789_103120_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 The boy the little squaw where gone 
7789_103120_000034_000000	train-clean-360	His answer was a rough one for the men seized him and poured forth the tale heaping reproaches upon him for such treachery and ingratitude 
7789_103120_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He bore it all in proud silence till they pointed to the poor father whose dumb sorrow was more eloquent than all their wrath 
7789_103120_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Onawandah looked at him and the fire died out of his eyes as if quenched by the tears he would not shed 
7789_103120_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Shaking off the hands that held him he went to his good friend saying with passionate earnestness 
none	none	Onawandah is not traitor 
7789_103120_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Onawandah remembers 
7789_103120_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Onawandah grateful You believe 
7789_103120_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The poor parson looked up at him and could not doubt his truth for genuine love and sorrow ennobled the dark face and he had never known the boy to lie 
7789_103120_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe and trust you still but others will not 
7789_103120_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Go you are no longer safe here and I have no home to offer you said the parson sadly feeling that he cared for none unless his children were restored to him 
7789_103120_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Onawandah has no fear 
7789_103120_000038_000001	train-clean-360	He goes but he comes again to bring the boy the little squaw 
7789_103120_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Few words but they were so solemnly spoken that the most unbelieving were impressed for the youth laid one hand on the gray head bowed before him and lifted the other toward heaven as if calling the Great Spirit to hear his vow 
7789_103120_000040_000000	train-clean-360	A relenting murmur went through the crowd but the boy paid no heed as he turned away and with no arms but his hunting knife and bow no food but such as he could find no guide but the sun by day the stars by night plunged into the pathless forest and was gone 
7789_103120_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Then the people drew a long breath and muttered to one another 
7789_103120_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 He will never do it yet he is a brave lad for his years 
7789_103120_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Only a shift to get off with a whole skin I warrant you 
7789_103120_000043_000001	train-clean-360	These varlets are as cunning as foxes added Becky sourly 
none	none	The parson alone believed and hoped though weeks and months went by and his children did not come Meantime Reuben and Eunice were far away in an Indian camp resting as best they could after the long journey that followed that dreadful night 
7789_103120_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Their captors were not cruel to them for Reuben was a stout fellow and thanks to Onawandah could hold his own with the boys who would have tormented him if he had been feeble or cowardly 
7789_103120_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Eunice also was a hardy creature for her years and when her first fright and fatigue were over made herself useful in many ways among the squaws who did not let the pretty child suffer greatly though she was neglected because they knew no better 
7789_103120_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Life in a wigwam was not a life of ease and fortunately the children were accustomed to simple habits and the hardships that all endured in those early times 
none	none	But they mourned for home till their young faces were pathetic with the longing and their pillows of dry leaves were often wet with tears in the night 
7789_103120_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Their clothes grew ragged their hair unkempt their faces tanned by sun and wind 
none	none	Scanty food and exposure to all weathers tried the strength of their bodies and uncertainty as to their fate saddened their spirits yet they bore up bravely and said their prayers faithfully feeling sure that God would bring them home to father in His own good time 
7789_103120_000047_000000	train-clean-360	One day when Reuben was snaring birds in the wood for the Indians had no fear of such young children venturing to escape he heard the cry of a quail and followed it deeper and deeper into the forest till it ceased and with a sudden rustle Onawandah rose up from the brakes his finger on his lips to prevent any exclamation that might betray him to other ears and eyes 
7789_103120_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I come for you and little Laroka the name he gave Eunice meaning Wild Rose 
7789_103120_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 I take you home 
none	none	Not know me yet 
7789_103120_000048_000003	train-clean-360	Go and wait 
none	none	He spoke low and fast but the joy in his face told how glad he was to find the boy after his long search and Reuben clung to him trying not to disgrace himself by crying like a girl in his surprise and delight 
7789_103120_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Lying hidden in the tall brakes they talked in whispers while one told of the capture and the other of a plan of escape for though a friendly tribe these Indians were not Onawandah s people and they must not suspect that he knew the children else they might be separated at once 
7789_103120_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Little squaw betray me 
7789_103120_000051_000001	train-clean-360	You watch her 
7789_103120_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Tell her not to cry out not speak me any time 
7789_103120_000051_000003	train-clean-360	When I say come we go fast in the night 
7789_103120_000051_000004	train-clean-360	Not ready yet 
7789_103120_000052_000000	train-clean-360	These were the orders Reuben received and when he could compose himself he went back to the wigwams leaving his friend in the wood while he told the good news to Eunice and prepared her for the part she must play 
none	none	Fear had taught her self control and the poor child stood the test well working off her relief and rapture by pounding corn on the stone mortar till her little hands were blistered and her arms ached for hours afterward 
7789_103120_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Not till the next day did Onawandah make his appearance and then he came limping into the village weary lame and half starved after his long wandering in the wilderness 
7789_103120_000054_000001	train-clean-360	He was kindly welcomed and his story believed for he told only the first part and said nothing of his life among the white men 
7789_103120_000054_000002	train-clean-360	He hardly glanced at the children when they were pointed out to him by their captors and scowled at poor Eunice who forgot her part in her joy and smiled as she met the dark eyes that till now had always looked kindly at her 
none	none	A touch from Reuben warned her and she was glad to hide her confusion by shaking her long hair over her face as if afraid of the stranger 
7789_103120_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Onawandah took no further notice of them but seemed to be very lame with the old wound in his foot which prevented his being obliged to hunt with the men 
7789_103120_000055_000001	train-clean-360	He was resting and slowly gathering strength for the hard task he had set himself while he waited for a safe time to save the children 
7789_103120_000055_000002	train-clean-360	They understood but the suspense proved too much for little Eunice and she pined with impatience to be gone 
7789_103120_000055_000003	train-clean-360	She lost appetite and color and cast such appealing glances at Onawandah that he could not seem quite indifferent and gave her a soft word now and then or did such acts of kindness as he could perform unsuspected 
7789_103120_000055_000004	train-clean-360	When she lay awake at night thinking of home a cricket would chirp outside the wigwam and a hand slip in a leaf full of berries or a bark cup of fresh water for the feverish little mouth 
7789_103120_000055_000005	train-clean-360	Sometimes it was only a caress or a whisper of encouragement that re assured the childish heart and sent her to sleep with a comfortable sense of love and protection like a sheltering wing over a motherless bird 
none	none	Reuben stood it better and entered heartily into the excitement of the plot for he had grown tall and strong in these trying months and felt that he must prove himself a man to sustain and defend his sister Quietly he put away each day a bit of dried meat a handful of parched corn or a well sharpened arrowhead as provision for the journey while Onawandah seemed to be amusing himself with making moccasins and a little vest of deer skin for an Indian child about the age of Eunice 
7789_103120_000057_000000	train-clean-360	At last in the early autumn all the men went off on the war path leaving only boys and women behind 
7789_103120_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Then Onawandah s eyes began to kindle and Reuben s heart to beat fast for both felt that their time for escape had come 
none	none	All was ready and one moonless night the signal was given 
7789_103120_000058_000001	train-clean-360	A cricket chirped shrilly outside the tent where the children slept with one old squaw 
none	none	A strong hand cut the skin beside their bed of fir boughs and two trembling creatures crept out to follow the tall shadow that flitted noiselessly before them into the darkness of the wood 
7789_103120_000058_000003	train-clean-360	Not a broken twig a careless step or a whispered word betrayed them and they vanished as swiftly and silently as hunted deer flying for their lives 
7789_103120_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Till dawn they hurried on Onawandah carrying Eunice whose strength soon failed and Reuben manfully shouldering the hatchet and the pouch of food 
7789_103120_000059_000001	train-clean-360	At sunrise they hid in a thicket by a spring and rested while waiting for the friendly night to come again 
7789_103120_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Then they pushed on and fear gave wings to their feet so that by another morning they were far enough away to venture to travel more slowly and sleep at night 
7789_103120_000060_000000	train-clean-360	If the children had learned to love and trust the Indian boy in happier times they adored him now and came to regard him as an earthly Providence so faithful brave and tender was he so forgetful of himself so bent on saving them 
7789_103120_000060_000001	train-clean-360	He never seemed to sleep ate the poorest morsels or went without any food when provision failed let no danger daunt him no hardship wring complaint from him but went on through the wild forest led by guides invisible to them till they began to hope that home was near 
7789_103120_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Twice he saved their lives 
7789_103120_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Once when he went in search of food leaving Reuben to guard his sister the children being very hungry ignorantly ate some poisonous berries which looked like wild cherries and were deliciously sweet 
none	none	The boy generously gave most of them to Eunice and soon was terror stricken to see her grow pale and cold and deathly ill 
7789_103120_000061_000003	train-clean-360	Not knowing what to do he could only rub her hands and call wildly for Onawandah 
7789_103120_000062_000000	train-clean-360	The name echoed through the silent wood and though far away the keen ear of the Indian heard it his fleet feet brought him back in time and his knowledge of wild roots and herbs made it possible to save the child when no other help was at hand 
7789_103120_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Make fire 
7789_103120_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Keep warm 
7789_103120_000063_000002	train-clean-360	I soon come he said after hearing the story and examining Eunice who could only lift her eyes to him full of childish confidence and patience 
7789_103120_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Then he was off again scouring the woods like a hound on the scent searching everywhere for the precious little herb that would counteract the poison 
none	none	Any one watching him would have thought him crazy as he rushed hither and thither tearing up the leaves creeping on his hands and knees that it might not escape him and when he found it springing up with a cry that startled the birds and carried hope to poor Reuben who was trying to forget his own pain in his anxiety for Eunice whom he thought dying
7789_103120_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Eat eat while I make drink 
7789_103120_000065_000001	train-clean-360	All safe now cried Onawandah as he came leaping toward them with his hands full of green leaves and his dark face shining with joy 
7789_103120_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The boy was soon relieved but for hours they hung over the girl who suffered sadly till she grew unconscious and lay as if dead 
7789_103120_000066_000001	train-clean-360	Reuben s courage failed then and he cried bitterly thinking how hard it would be to leave the dear little creature under the pines and go home alone to father 
7789_103120_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Even Onawandah lost hope for a while and sat like a bronze statue of despair with his eyes fixed on his Wild Rose who seemed fading away too soon 
7789_103120_000067_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly he rose stretched his arms to the west where the sun was setting splendidly and in his own musical language prayed to the Great Spirit 
none	none	The Christian boy fell upon his knees feeling that the only help was in the Father who saw and heard them even in the wilderness Both were comforted and when they turned to Eunice there was a faint tinge of color on the pale cheeks as if the evening red kissed her the look of pain was gone and she slept quietly without the moans that had made their hearts ache before
7789_103120_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 He hears he hears cried Onawandah and for the first time Reuben saw tears in his keen eyes as the Indian boy turned his face to the sky full of a gratitude that no words were sweet enough to tell 
7789_103120_000069_000000	train-clean-360	All night Eunice lay peacefully sleeping and the moon lighted Onawandah s lonely watch for Reuben was worn out with suspense and slept beside his sister 
7789_103120_000070_000000	train-clean-360	In the morning she was safe and great was the rejoicing but for two days the little invalid was not allowed to continue the journey much as they longed to hurry on 
7789_103120_000070_000001	train-clean-360	It was a pretty sight the bed of hemlock boughs spread under a green tent of woven branches and on the pillow of moss the pale child watching the flicker of sunshine through the leaves listening to the babble of a brook close by or sleeping tranquilly lulled by the murmur of the pines 
7789_103120_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Patient loving and grateful it was a pleasure to serve her and both the lads were faithful nurses 
7789_103120_000070_000003	train-clean-360	Onawandah cooked birds for her to eat and made a pleasant drink of the wild raspberry leaves to quench her thirst 
7789_103120_000070_000004	train-clean-360	Reuben snared rabbits that she might have nourishing food and longed to shoot a deer for provision that she might not suffer hunger again on their journey 
7789_103120_000070_000005	train-clean-360	This boyish desire led him deeper into the wood than it was wise for him to go alone for it was near nightfall and wild creatures haunted the forest in those days 
none	none	The fire which Onawandah kept constantly burning guarded their little camp where Eunice lay but Reuben with no weapon but his bow and hunting knife was beyond this protection when he at last gave up his vain hunt and turned homeward Suddenly the sound of stealthy steps startled him but he could see nothing through the dusk at first and hurried on fearing that some treacherous Indian was following him Then he remembered his sister and resolved not to betray her resting place if he could help it for he had learned courage of Onawandah and longed to be as brave and generous as his dusky hero So he paused to watch and wait and soon saw the gleam of two fiery eyes not behind but above him in a tree Then he knew that it was an Indian devil as they called a species of fierce animal that lurked in the thickets and sprang on its prey like a small tiger
7789_103120_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 If I could only kill it alone how proud Onawandah would be of me thought Reuben burning for the good opinion of his friend 
7789_103120_000073_000000	train-clean-360	It would have been wiser to hurry on and give the beast no time to spring but the boy was over bold and fitting an arrow to the string aimed at the bright eye ball and let fly 
7789_103120_000073_000001	train-clean-360	A sharp snarl showed that some harm was done and rather daunted by the savage sound Reuben raced away meaning to come back next day for the prize he hoped he had secured 
7789_103120_000074_000000	train-clean-360	But soon he heard the creature bounding after him and he uttered one ringing shout for help feeling too late that he had been foolhardy Fortunately he was nearer camp than he thought 
7789_103120_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Onawandah heard him and was there in time to receive the beast as mad with the pain of the wound it sprung at Reuben 
7789_103120_000074_000002	train-clean-360	There was no time for words and the boy could only watch in breathless interest and anxiety the fight which went on between the brute and the Indian 
7789_103120_000075_000000	train-clean-360	It was sharp but short for Onawandah had his knife and as soon as he could get the snarling struggling creature down he killed it with a skilful stroke 
7789_103120_000075_000001	train-clean-360	But not before it had torn and bitten him more dangerously than he knew for the dusk hid the wounds and excitement kept him from feeling them at first 
none	none	Reuben thanked him heartily and accepted his few words of warning with grateful docility then both hurried back to Eunice who till next day knew nothing of her brother s danger 
7789_103120_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Onawandah made light of his scratches as he called them got their supper and sent Reuben early to bed for to morrow they were to start again 
7789_103120_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Excited by his adventure the boy slept lightly and waking in the night saw by the flicker of the fire Onawandah binding up a deep wound in his breast with wet moss and his own belt 
none	none	A stifled groan betrayed how much he suffered but when Reuben went to him he would accept no help said it was nothing and sent him back to bed preferring to endure the pain in stern silence with true Indian pride and courage 
7789_103120_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Next morning they set out and pushed on as fast as Eunice s strength allowed 
7789_103120_000078_000001	train-clean-360	But it was evident that Onawandah suffered much though he would not rest forbade the children to speak of his wounds and pressed on with feverish haste as if he feared that his strength might not hold out 
7789_103120_000078_000002	train-clean-360	Reuben watched him anxiously for there was a look in his face that troubled the boy and filled him with alarm as well as with remorse and love 
7789_103120_000078_000003	train-clean-360	Eunice would not let him carry her as before but trudged bravely behind him though her feet ached and her breath often failed as she tried to keep up and both children did all they could to comfort and sustain their friend who seemed glad to give his life for them 
none	none	In three days they reached the river and as if Heaven helped them in their greatest need found a canoe left by some hunter near the shore In they sprang and let the swift current bear them along Eunice kneeling in the bow like a little figure head of Hope Reuben steering with his paddle and Onawandah sitting with arms tightly folded over his breast as if to control the sharp anguish of the neglected wound 
7789_103120_000079_000001	train-clean-360	He knew that it was past help now and only cared to see the children safe then worn out but happy he was proud to die having paid his debt to the good parson and proved that he was not a liar nor a traitor 
none	none	Hour after hour they floated down the great river looking eagerly for signs of home and when at last they entered the familiar valley while the little girl cried for joy and the boy paddled as he had never done before Onawandah sat erect with his haggard eyes fixed on the dim distance and sang his death song in a clear strong voice though every breath was pain bent on dying like a brave without complaint or fear 
7789_103120_000081_000000	train-clean-360	At last they saw the smoke from the cabins on the hillside and hastily mooring the canoe all sprang out eager to be at home after their long and perilous wandering 
7789_103120_000081_000001	train-clean-360	But as his foot touched the land Onawandah felt that he could do no more and stretching his arms toward the parsonage the windows of which glimmered as hospitably as they had done when he first saw them he said with a pathetic sort of triumph in his broken voice Go 
7789_103120_000081_000002	train-clean-360	I cannot 
7789_103120_000081_000003	train-clean-360	Tell the good father Onawandah not lie not forget 
7789_103120_000081_000004	train-clean-360	He keep his promise 
7789_103120_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Then he dropped upon the grass and lay as if dead while Reuben bidding Eunice keep watch ran as fast as his tired legs could carry him to tell the tale and bring help 
none	none	The little girl did her part tenderly carrying water in her hands to wet the white lips tearing up her ragged skirt to lay fresh bandages on the wound that had been bleeding the brave boy s life away and sitting by him gathered his head into her arms begging him to wait till father came 
7789_103120_000084_000000	train-clean-360	But poor Onawandah had waited too long now he could only look up into the dear loving little face bent over him and whisper wistfully Wild Rose will remember Onawandah as the light went out of his eyes and his last breath was a smile for her

it aunty Perhaps but it is the girls turn now and here is a quiet little story that teaches the same lesson in a different way It contains a hint which some of you would better take and Aunt Elinor glanced around the circle with a smile that set her hearers on the alert to see who was to be hit Hope it isn t very moral said Geoff with a boyish dislike of being preached at It won t harm you to listen and take the moral to heart my lad Wild horses gold mines and sea scrapes are not the only things worth reading about If you ever do half so much good in the world as the people in this story did I shall be proud of you answered Aunt Elinor so soberly that Geoff folded his hands and tried to look meekly impressed Is it true asked Min Yes I heard Abby tell it herself and saw the silk stocking and the scar That sounds very interesting I do like to hear about good clothes and awful accidents cried the girl forgetting to spin in her eagerness to listen They all laughed at her odd mixture of tastes and then heard the story of LITTLE THINGS Abigail sat reading Rasselas aloud to her father while he shaved pausing now and then to explain a word or correct the girl s pronunciation for this was a lesson as well as a pleasure The handsome man in his nankin dressing gown ruffled shirt black small clothes and silk stockings stood before the tall old fashioned bureau looking often from the reflection of his own ruddy face to the pale one beside him with an expression of tender pride which plainly showed how dear his young daughter was to him Abby was a slender girl of fifteen in a short waisted gingham gown with a muslin tucker dimity apron and morocco shoes on a pair of small feet demurely crossed before her A blue eyed brown haired little creature with a broad brow and a sweet mouth evidently both intelligent and affectionate for she heartily enjoyed the story and answered her father s approving glances with a face full of the loving reverence so beautiful to see Schools were not abundant in eighteen fifteen and after learning to read spell sew and cipher a little at some dame school girls were left to pick up knowledge as they could while the brothers went to college or were apprenticed to some trade But the few things they did study were well learned so that Abby s reading was a pleasure to hear She wrote a fine clear hand seldom misspelled a word kept her own little account book in good order and already made her father s shirts hemstitching the linen cambric ruffles with the daintiest skill and turning out button holes any one might be proud of These accomplishments did not satisfy her however and she longed to know much more to do and be something great and good with the sincere longing of an earnest thoughtful girl These morning talks with her father were precious half hours to her for they not only read and discussed well chosen books but Abby opened her heart freely and received his wise counsels with a grateful docility which helped to make her after life as benevolent and blessed as his I don t wonder that Rasselas wanted to get out of the Happy Valley and see the world for himself I often feel so and long to go and have adventures like the people I read about to do something very splendid and be brave and great and loved and honored said Abby as she closed the book and looked out of the open window with wistful eyes for the chestnut trees were rustling in the May sunshine and spring was stirring in the girl s heart as well as in the budding boughs and early flowers on the green bank below Do not be in a hurry to leave your Happy Valley my dear but help to keep it so by doing your part well The happiness of life depends very much on little things and one can be brave and great and good while making small sacrifices and doing small duties faithfully and cheerfully answered mister Lyon with the look of one who practised what he preached But my little things are so stupid and easy Sewing and learning to pickle and preserve and going out to tea when I don t want to and helping mother are none of them romantic or exciting duties and sacrifices If I could take care of poor people or be a colonel in a splendid uniform and march with drums and trumpets or even a fire warden and run to save lives and property and be loved and thanked and trusted as you are I should be contented continued Abby kindling at the thought for she considered her father the noblest of men and glowed with pride when she saw him in his regimentals on great occasions or when she helped him into the leathern cap and coat and gave him the lantern staff and canvas bags he used as fire warden long before steam engines hook and ladder companies and electric alarms were dreamed of mister Lyon laughed as he washed his face at the queer three cornered stand and then sat down to have his hair tied in a queue by his daughter who prided herself on doing this as well as a barber Ah my girl it s not the things that make the most noise and show that are the bravest and the best but the everlasting patience charity and courage needed to bear our daily trials like good Christians And the smile changed to a sigh for the excellent man knew the value of these virtues and their rarity Yes I know sir but it is so splendid to be a hero and have the world ring with one s glory like Washington and Lafayette or Perry Hull and Lawrence said Abby winding the black ribbon so energetically that it nearly broke for her head was full of the brave deeds performed in the wars of seventeen seventy five and eighteen twelve the latter of which she well remembered Easy my dear easy remember that it was the faithful doing of small things which fitted these men to do the grand deeds well when the time came Heroes are not made in a minute and we never know what we may be called upon to live through Train yourself now to be skilful prompt courageous and kind then when the duty or the danger comes you will be prepared for it Keep your spindle ready and the Lord will send the flax as the old proverb says I will father and remember the other saying that you like and live up to Do right and leave the consequences to God answered Abby with her arm about his neck and a soft cheek against his feeling that with such an example before her she ought not to fail That s my good girl Come now begin at once Here s a little thing to do a very homely one but useful and some honor may be gained by doing it nicely for if you ll darn this bad rent in my new stocking I ll give you five dollars As he spoke mister Lyon handed her a heavy silk stocking with a great barn door tear in the calf He was rather proud of his handsome legs and dressed them with care importing hose of unusual fineness for state occasions being one of the old time gentlemen whose stately elegance added dignity to any scene Abby groaned as she examined the hole torn by a nail for it was a very bad one and she knew that if not well done the costly stocking would be ruined She hated to darn infinitely preferring to read or study Latin with her brother instead of repairing old damask muslin gowns and the family hose But she did it well excelling her elder sister in this branch of needle work so she could not refuse though the sacrifice of time and taste would have been almost impossible for any one but father I ll try sir and you shall pay me with a kiss five dollars is too much for such a little thing she said smiling at him as she put the stocking into the capacious pocket where girls kept housewife scissors thimble pin ball and a bit of lovage or flag root in those days I m not so sure that you ll find it an easy job but remember Bruce and his spider and don t be conquered by the little thing Now I must be off Good by my darling and mister Lyon s dark eyes twinkled as he thought of the task he had set her for it seemed as if nothing short of a miracle could restore his damaged stocking Abby forgot her heroics and ran to get his hat and cane to receive his morning kiss and answer the salute he always paused at the street corner to give her before he went away to the many cares and labors of his own busy day But while she put her little room in order dusted the parlor and clapped laces for her mother who like most ladies long ago did up her own caps and turbans Abby was thinking over the late conversation and wondering if strict attention to small affairs would really lead to something good or glorious in the end When her other duties were done she resolutely sat down to the detested darn although it would have been much pleasanter to help her sister cut out green satin leaves and quill up pink ribbon into roses for a garland to festoon the skirt of a new white dress Hour after hour she worked slowly and carefully weaving the torn edges together stitch by stitch till her eyes ached and the delicate needle grew rusty in her warm hand Her mother begged her to stop and rest sister Catharine called her to come and see how well the garland looked and a friend came to take her to drive But she refused to stir and kept at her weaving as patiently as King Robert s spider picking out a bit that puckered turning the corner with breathless care and rapping it with her thimble on the wooden egg till it lay flat Then she waited till an iron was heated and pressed it nicely finishing in time to put it on her father s bureau where he would see it when he dressed for dinner Nearly four hours over that dreadful darn But it s done now and hardly shows so I do think I ve earned my money I shall buy that work box I have wanted so long The inlaid one with nice velvet beds for the thimble scissors and bodkin and a glass in the cover and a little drawer for my silk reels Father will like that and I shall be proud to show it These agreeable thoughts were passing through Abby s mind as she went into the front yard for a breath of air after her long task was over Tulips and hyacinths were blooming there and peeping through the bars of the gate stood a little girl wistfully watching the gay blossoms and enjoying their perfume Now Abby was fond of her garden and had been hurrying the early flowers that they might be ready for her father s birthday nosegay so her first impulse was to feign that she did not see the child for she did not want to give away a single tulip But the morning talk was fresh in her memory and presently she thought Here is a little thing I can do and ashamed of the selfish impulse she gathered several of her finest flowers and offered them saying cordially I think you would like these Please take them and by and by when there are more you shall have prettier ones Oh thank you I did want some for mamma She is ill and will be so pleased was the grateful answer given with a little courtesy and a smile that made the wistful face a very happy one Do you live near by asked Abby seeing at once from the child s speech and manner that she was both well bred and grateful Just around the corner We are English and papa is dead Mamma kept school in another place till she was too ill and now I take care of her and the children as well as I can The little girl of twelve in her black frock with a face far too old and anxious for her years was so innocently pathetic as she told the sad story that Abby s tender heart was touched and an impetuous desire to do something at once made her exclaim Wait a minute and I ll send something better than flowers Wouldn t your mother like some wine jelly I helped make it and have a glassful all my own Indeed she would began the child blushing with pleasure for the poor lady needed just such delicacies but thought only of the children s wants Waiting to hear no more Abby ran in to get her offering and came back beaming with benevolent good will As it is not far and you have that big basket I ll go with you and help carry the things if I may My mother will let me and my father will come and see you I m sure if you d like to have him He takes care of everybody and is the best and wisest man in all the world Lucy Mayhew accepted these kind offers with childish confidence thinking the young lady a sort of angel in a coal scuttle bonnet and the two went chatting along good friends at once for Abby had most engaging manners and her cheerful face won its way everywhere She found the English family a very interesting one for the mother was a gentlewoman and in sore straits now being unable to use her accomplishments any longer and failing fast with no friends to protect the four little children she must soon leave alone in a strange land If they were only cared for I could go in peace but it breaks my heart to think of them in an asylum when they need a home said the poor lady telling her greatest anxiety to this sympathetic young visitor while Lucy regaled the noses of the eager little ones with delicious sniffs of the pink and blue hyacinths Tell father all about it and he ll know just what to do He always does and every one goes to him May he come and see you ma am said Abby longing to take them all home at once He will be as welcome as an angel from Heaven my child I am failing very fast and help and comfort are sorely needed answered the grateful woman with wet eyes and a heart too full for many thanks Abby s eyes were full also and promising to send father soon she went away little dreaming that the handful of flowers and a few kind words were the first links in a chain of events that brought a blessing into her own home She waited anxiously for her father s return and blushed with pleasure as he said after examining her morning s work Wonderfully well done my dear Your mother says she couldn t have done it better herself I m sorry that it shows at all but it was impossible to hide that corner and if you wear it on the inside of the leg it won t be seen much explained Abby anxiously It shows just enough for me to know where to point when I boast of my girl s patience and skill People say I m making a blue stocking of you because we read Johnson but my black stocking will prove that I haven t spoiled you yet said mister Lyon pinching her cheek as they went down to dinner arm in arm Literary ladies were looked upon with awe and by many with disapproval in those days so Abby s studious tastes were criticised by the good cousins and aunts who feared she might do something peculiar though years later they were very proud of the fine letters she wrote and the intellectual society which she had unconsciously fitted herself to enjoy and adorn Abby laughed at her father s joke but said no more just then for young people sat silent at table while their elders talked She longed to tell about Lucy and when dessert came she drew her chair near to her father s that she might pick the kernels from his walnuts and drop them into his wine waiting till he said as usual Now little girl let s take comfort For both enjoyed the hour of rest he allowed himself in the middle of the day On this occasion he varied the remark by adding as he took a bill from his pocket book and gave it to her with a kiss Well earned money my dear and most cheerfully paid Thank you sir It seems a great deal for such a small job But I do want it very much May I tell you how I d like to spend it father cried Abby beaming with the sweet delight of helping others Yes child come and tell me Something for sister I suspect or a new book perhaps And drawing her to his knee mister Lyon waited with a face full of benignant interest in her little confidences She told her story eagerly and well exclaiming as she ended And now I m so glad so very glad I have this money all my own to spend for those dear little things I know you ll help them but it s so nice to be able to do my part and giving away is such a pleasure You are your father s own daughter in that child I must go and get my contribution ready or I shall be left out said missus Lyon hastening away to add one more charity to the many which made her quiet life so beautiful I will go and see our neighbor this evening and you shall come with me You see my girl that the homely little job is likely to be a large and pleasant one and you have earned your part in it Do the duty that comes first and one never knows what beautiful experience it may blossom into Use your earnings as you like and God bless you my dear So Abby had her part in the happy days that came to the Mayhews and enjoyed it more than a dozen work boxes while her father was never tired of showing the handsome darn and telling the story of it Help and comfort were much needed around the corner for very soon the poor lady died But her confidence in the new friends raised up to her was not misplaced and when all was over and people asked What will become of the children mister Lyon answered the sad question by leading the four little orphans to his own house and keeping them till good homes were found for the three youngest Lucy was heart broken and clung to Abby in her sorrow as if nothing else could console her for all she had lost No one had the heart to speak of sending her away at present and before long the grateful little creature had won a place for herself which she never forfeited It was good for Abby to have a care of this sort and her generous nature enjoyed it thoroughly as she played elder sister in the sweetest way It was her first real lesson in the charity that made her after life so rich and beautiful but then she little dreamed how well she was to be repaid for her small share in the good work which proved to be a blessing to them all Soon preparations for sister Catharine s wedding produced a pleasant bustle in the house and both the younger girls were as busy as bees helping everywhere Dressmakers ripped and stitched upstairs visitors gossiped in the parlor and cooks simmered and scolded in the kitchen while notable Madam Lyon presided over the household keeping the peace and gently bringing order out of chaos Abby had a new sprigged muslin frock with a white sash and her first pair of silk stockings a present from her father A bunch of pink roses gave the finishing touch and she turned up her hair with a tortoise shell comb in honor of the occasion All the relations and there were many of them came to the wedding and the hospitable mansion was crowded with old and young A fine breakfast was prepared a line of carriages filled the quiet street and troops of stately ladies and gentlemen came marching in for the Lyons were a much honored family The interesting moment arrived at last the minister opened his book the lovely bride entered with her groom and a solemn silence fell upon the rustling crowd Abby was much excited and felt that she was about to disgrace herself by crying Fortunately she stood near the door and finding that a sob would come at thought of her dear sister going away forever she slipped out and ran upstairs to hide her tears in the back bedroom where she was put to accommodate guests As she opened the door a puff of smoke made her catch her breath then run to throw open the window before she turned to look for the fallen brand A fire had been kindled in this room a short time before and to Abby s dismay the sudden draught fanned the smouldering sparks which had crept from a fallen log to the mop board and thence around the wooden mantel piece A suspicious crackling was heard little tongues of flame darted from the cracks and the air was full of smoke Abby s first impulse was to fly downstairs screaming Fire at the top of her voice her second was to stand still and think what to do for an instant s recollection showed her what terror and confusion such a cry would produce in the crowded house and how unseemly a panic would be at such a time If I could only get at father But I can t without scaring every one What would he do I ve heard him tell about fires and how to put them out I know stop the draught first and Abby shut the window Now water and wet blankets and away she ran to the bath room and filling a pail dashed the water over the burning wood Then pulling the blankets from off the bed she wet them as well as she could and hung them up before the fire place going to and fro for more water till the smoke ceased to pour out and the crackling stopped These energetic measures were taken just in time to prevent a serious fire and when Abby dared to rest a moment with her eyes on the chimney fearing the treacherous blaze might burst out in a new place she discovered that her clothes were wet her face blackened her hands blistered and her breath gone No matter she thought still too much elated with her success to feel the pain Father will be pleased I know for this is what he would call an emergency and I ve had my wits about me I wish mother would come Oh dear how queerly I feel and in the midst of her self congratulation poor little Abby fainted away slipping to the floor and lying there like a new sort of Casabianca faithful at her post Lucy found her very soon having missed her and come to look for her the minute the service was over Much frightened she ran down again and tried to tell mister and missus Lyon quietly But her pale face alarmed every one and when Abby came to herself she was in her father s arms being carried from the scene of devastation to her mother s room where a crowd of anxious relatives received her like a conquering hero Well done my brave little fire warden I m proud of you were the first words she heard and they were more reviving than the burnt feathers under her nose or the lavender water plentifully sprinkled over her by her mother and sister With that hearty commendation her father left her to see that all was safe and Abby found that another sort of courage was needed to support her through the next half hour of trial for her hands were badly burned and each of the excellent relatives suggested a different remedy Flour them cried Aunt Sally fanning her violently Goose oil and cotton batting suggested Aunt Patty Nothing so good as lard pronounced Aunt Nabby I always use dry starch or a piece of salt pork added cousin Lucretia Butter them commanded grandma That s what I did when my Joseph fell into the boiler and came out with his blessed little legs the color of lobsters Butter them Dolly That settled the vexed question and Abby s hands were well buttered while a hearty laugh composed the spirits of the agitated party for the contrast between grandma s words and her splendid appearance as she sat erect in the big arm chair issuing commands like a general in silver gray satin and an imposing turban was very funny Then Abby was left to repose with Lucy and old Nurse beside her while the rest went down to eat the wedding feast and see the happy pair off in a chaise with the portmanteau slung underneath on their quiet honey moon trip to Pomfret When the bustle was all over Abby found herself a heroine in her small circle of admiring friends and neighbors who praised and petted her as if she had saved the city from destruction She needed comfort very much for one hand was so seriously injured that it never entirely recovered from the deep burn which contracted two of her finger tips This was a great sorrow to the poor girl for she could no longer play on her piano and was forced to content herself with singing like a lark when all joined in the sweet old ballads forgotten now It was a misfortune but it had its happy side for during the long months when she was partially helpless books were her solace and she studied many things which other duties or pleasures would have crowded out if Abby s poor hand had not been an excuse for such liberty and indulgence It did not make her selfish however for while regretting her uselessness she unexpectedly found work to do that made her own life happy by cheering that of another Lucy proved to be a most intelligent child and when Abby asked what return she could make for all the little girl s loving service during her trouble she discovered that help about lessons would be the favor most desired Lucy s too early cares had kept her from learning much and now that she had leisure weak eyes forbade study and she longed vainly to get on as her new friend did for Abby was her model in all things looked up to with admiration love and wonder Father I ve been thinking that I might read Lucy s lessons to her and hear her recite Then she wouldn t grieve about being backward and I can be eyes to her as she is hands to me I can t sew or work now but I can teach the little I know May I sir asked Abby one morning after reading a paper in the Spectator and having a pleasant talk about it during the happy half hour A capital plan daughter if you are sure you can keep on To begin and then fail would leave the child worse off for the hope and disappointment It will be tiresome to go on day after day so think well before you propose it answered her father much pleased with the idea I can do it and I will If I get tired I ll look at you and mother always so faithful to what you undertake and remember my motto cried Abby anxious to follow the example set her in the daily life of these good parents A hearty hand shake rewarded her and she set about the new task with a resolute purpose to succeed It was hard at first to go back to her early lessons and read them over and over again to eager Lucy who did her best to understand remember and recite But good will and gratitude worked wonders and day after day week after week month after month the teaching went on to the great surprise and satisfaction of those who watched this labor of love Both learned much and a very strong sweet friendship grew up which lasted till the young girls became old women For nearly two years the daily lessons were continued then Lucy was ready and able to go to school and Abby free from the duty that had grown a pleasure Sister Catherine being gone she was the young lady of the house now and began to go to a few parties where she distinguished herself by her graceful dancing and sprightly though modest manners She had grown strong and rosy with the exercise her sensible mother prescribed and her energetic father encouraged taking long walks with her to Roxbury and Dorchester on holidays over bridges and around the common before breakfast each morning till the pale little girl was a tall and blooming creature full of life and spirit not exactly beautiful but with a sweet intelligent face and the frank cordial ways that are so charming Her brother Sam was very proud of her and liked to see her surrounded by his friends at the merry makings to which he escorted her for she talked as well as she danced and the older gentlemen enjoyed a good chat with Miss Abby as much as the younger ones did the elaborate pigeon wings and pirouettes then in vogue Among the older men was one whom Abby much admired for he had fought travelled and studied more than most men of his age and earned the honors he wore so modestly She was never tired of asking him questions when they met and he never seemed tired of giving long interesting replies so they often sat and talked while others danced and Abby never guessed that he was studying her bright face and innocent heart as eagerly as she listened to his agreeable conversation and stirring adventures Presently he came to the house with brother Sam who shared Abby s regard for him and there while the young men amused themselves or paid their respects to the elders one of them was still watching the tall girl with the crown of brown hair as she sat by her father poured the tea for Madam laughed with her brother or made bashful Lucy share their pleasures always so busy dutiful and winning that the visitor pronounced mister Lyon s the most delightful house in Boston He heard all the little tales of Abby s youth from Sam and Lucy added her tribute with the eloquence of a grateful heart he saw how loved and trusted she was and he soon longed to know how she would answer the question he desired to ask her Having received permission from Papa in the decorous old style he only waited for an opportunity to discover if charming Abigail would consent to change her name from Lyon to Lamb and as if her lesson was to be quite complete a little thing decided her fate and made a very happy woman of the good girl On Abby s seventeenth birthday there was to be a party in her honor at the hospitable family mansion to which all her friends were invited and when she came down early to see that all was in order she found one impatient guest had already arrived It was not alone the consciousness that the new pink taffeta gown and the wreath of white roses were very becoming which made her blush so prettily as she thanked her friend for the fine nosegay he brought her but something in his face though he only wished her many happy returns in a hearty way and then added laughing as the last button flew off the glove he was awkwardly trying to fasten It is evident that you didn t sew on these buttons Miss Abby I ve observed that Sam s never come off and he says you always keep them in order Let me put one on for you It will take but a moment and you ll be so uncomfortable without it said Abby glad to find employment for her eyes A minute afterward she was sorry she had offered for he accepted the little service with thanks and stood watching while she sat down at her work table and began to sew She was very sensitive about her hand yet ashamed of being so for the scar was inside and the drawn fingers showed very little as it is natural to half close them She hoped he had never seen it and tried to hide it as she worked But this or some new consciousness made her usually nimble fingers lose their skill and she knotted the silk split the button and dropped her thimble growing angry with herself for being so silly and getting so red and flurried I m afraid I m giving you a deal of trouble said the gentleman who was watching the white hand with great interest No it is I who am foolish about my burnt hands answered Abby in her frank impetuous way See how ugly it is And she held it out as if to punish herself for the girlish feeling she despised The answer to this little outburst made her forget everything but the sweetest pleasure and surprise for kissing the scarred palm with tender respect her lover said To me it is the finest and the dearest hand in the world I know the brave story and I ve seen the good this generous hand is never tired of doing I want it for my own Will you give it to me dear Abby must have answered Yes for she wore a new ring under her glove that night and danced as if there were wings on the heels of her pink shoes Whether the button ever got sewed on or not no one knows but that bit of needlework was even more successful than the other small job for in due time there was a second wedding without a fire and Abby went away to a happy home of her own leaving sister Lucy to fill her place and be the most loving and faithful of daughters to her benefactors while they lived Long years afterward when she had children and grandchildren about her listening to the true old stories that are the best Abby used to say with her own cheerful laugh My father and mother taught me many useful lessons but none more valuable than those I learned that year and I may honestly say that patience perseverance courage friendship and love came out of that silk stocking So let me give you this bit of advice Don t despise little things my dears Illustration Illustration The Banner of Beaumanior Larks were singing in the clear sky over Dinan the hill sides were white with hosts of

7823-103122-0017	train-other-500	This dreary Latin drives me mad and I will not waste such days as this poring over dull pages like a priest when I should be hunting like a knight and gentleman
none	none	 Nay dear Gaston but you ought for obedience is the first duty of the knight and honor of the gentleman answered the girl in a soft reproachful tone which seemed to touch the lad as the voice of a master tames a high mettled horse 
7823-103122-0018	train-other-500	Had Father Nevin trusted to my honor I would not have run away but he locked me in like a monk in a cell and that I will not bear Just one hour Yvonne one little hour of freedom
7823-103122-0019	train-other-500	then I will go back else there will be no sport for me to morrow said the lad recklessly pulling up the bluets that starred the grass about him
none	none	 Ah if I were set to such a task I would so gladly learn it that I might be a fitter friend for you 
7823-103122-0020	train-other-500	said the girl reverently turning the pages of the book she could not read No need of that I like you as you are and by my faith I doubt your great willingness for when I last played tutor
7823-103122-0021	train-other-500	and left you to spell out the pretty legend of saint Coventin and his little fish I found you fast asleep with the blessed book upon the floor laughed Gaston turning the tables on his mentor with great satisfaction
7823-103122-0022	train-other-500	The girl laughed also as she retorted My tutor should not have left me to play with his dogs I bore my penance better than you and did not run away Come now we ll be merry
7823-103122-0023	train-other-500	Will you talk or shall I sing while you rest this hot head and dream of horse and hound and spearing the wild boar added Yvonne
none	none	 smoothing the locks of hair scattered on the grass with a touch as gentle as if the hand were that of a lady 
7823-103122-0024	train-other-500	and not that of a peasant rough with hard work Since I may not play a man s part yet amuse me like a boy
none	none	 with the old tales your mother used to tell when we watched the fagots blaze in the winter nights 
7823-103122-0025	train-other-500	It is long since I have heard one
none	none	 and I am never tired hearing of the deeds I mean to match if not outdo some day 
7823-103122-0026	train-other-500	Let me think a bit till I remember your favorites and do you listen to the bees above there in the willow setting you a good example idle boy
none	none	 said Yvonne spreading a coarse apron for his head 
7823-103122-0027	train-other-500	while she sat beside him racking her brain for tales to beguile this truant hour Her father was the count s forester and when the countess had died some sixteen years before
7823-103122-0028	train-other-500	leaving a month old boy good dame Gillian had taken the motherless baby and nursed and reared him with her little girl so faithfully and tenderly
none	none	 that the count never could forget the loyal service 
7823-103122-0029	train-other-500	As babies the two slept in one cradle as children they played and quarrelled together and as boy and girl they defended comforted and amused each other
7823-103122-0030	train-other-500	But time brought inevitable changes and both felt that the hour of separation was near for
none	none	 while Yvonne went on leading the peasant life to which she was born 
7823-103122-0031	train-other-500	Gaston was receiving the education befitting a young count The chaplain taught him to read and write with lessons in sacred history and a little Latin of the forester he learned woodcraft
7823-103122-0032	train-other-500	and his father taught him horsemanship and the use of arms accomplishments considered all important in those days
none	none	 Gaston cared nothing for books except such as told tales of chivalry 
7823-103122-0033	train-other-500	but dearly loved athletic sports and at sixteen rode the most fiery horse without a fall handled a sword admirably could kill a boar at the first shot and longed ardently for war
7823-103122-0034	train-other-500	that he might prove himself a man A brave high spirited generous boy with a very tender spot in his heart for the good woman who had been a mother to him and his little foster sister whose idol he was
7823-103122-0035	train-other-500	For days he seemed to forget these humble friends and led the gay active life of his age and rank but if wounded in the chase worried by the chaplain disappointed in any plan or in disgrace for any prank
7823-103122-0036	train-other-500	he turned instinctively to Dame Gillian and Yvonne sure of help and comfort for mind and body Companionship with him had refined the girl and given her glimpses of a world into which she could never enter
none	none	 yet where she could follow with eager eyes and high hopes the fortunes of this dear Gaston 
7823-103122-0037	train-other-500	who was both her prince and brother Her influence over him was great for she was of a calm and patient nature as well as
none	none	 brave and prudent beyond her years 
7823-103122-0038	train-other-500	His will was law yet in seeming to obey she often led him and he thanked her for the courage with which she helped him to control his fiery temper and strong will Now
7823-103122-0039	train-other-500	as she glanced at him she saw that he was already growing more tranquil under the soothing influences of the murmuring river the soft flicker of the sunshine and a blessed sense of freedom So
7823-103122-0040	train-other-500	while she twisted her distaff she told the stirring tales of warriors saints and fairies
none	none	 whom all Breton peasants honor love and fear 
7823-103122-0041	train-other-500	But best of all was the tale of Gaston s own ancestor
none	none	 Jean de Beaumanoir the hero of Ploermel where when sorely wounded and parched with thirst he cried for water and Geoffrey du Bois answered like a grim old warrior as he was Drink thy blood Beaumanoir and the thirst will pass and he drank and the battle madness seized him and he slew ten men winning the fight against great odds to his everlasting glory Ah those were the times to live in If they could only come again I would be a second Jean Gaston sprung to his feet as he spoke all aglow with the warlike ardor of his race and Yvonne looked up at him sure that he would prove himself a worthy descendant of the great baron and his wife the daughter of the brave Du Guesclin But you shall not be treacherously killed as he was for I will save you as the peasant woman saved poor Giles de Bretagne when starving in the tower or fight for you as Jeanne d Arc fought for her lord answered Yvonne dropping her distaff to stretch out her hand to him for she too was on her feet Gaston took the faithful hand and pointing to the white banner floating over the ruins of the old castle said heartily 
7823-103122-0042	train-other-500	We will always stand by one another and be true to the motto of our house till death
none	none	 We will answered the girl and both kept the promise loyally 
7823-103122-0043	train-other-500	as we shall see Just at that moment the sound of hoofs made the young enthusiasts start and look toward the road that wound through the valley to the hill
none	none	 An old man on a slowly pacing mule 
7823-103122-0044	train-other-500	was all they saw but the change that came over both was comical in its suddenness for the gallant knight turned to a truant school boy daunted by the sight of his tutor while the rival of the Maid of Orleans grew pale with dismay
7823-103122-0045	train-other-500	I am lost if he spy me for my father vowed I should not hunt again unless I did my task He will see me if I run
none	none	 and where can I hide till he has past 
7823-103122-0046	train-other-500	whispered Gaston ashamed of his panic yet unwilling to pay the penalty of his prank But quick witted Yvonne saved him for lifting one end of the long web of linen she showed a hollow whence some great stone had been removed
7823-103122-0047	train-other-500	and Gaston slipped into the green nest
none	none	 over which the linen lay smoothly when replaced 
7823-103122-0048	train-other-500	On came the chaplain glancing sharply about him being of an austere and suspicious nature He saw nothing however but the peasant girl in her quaint cap and wooden sabots
7823-103122-0049	train-other-500	singing to herself as she leaned against a tree with her earthen jug in her hand The mule paused in the light shadow of the willows to crop a mouthful of grass before climbing the hill and the chaplain seemed glad to rest a moment
7823-103122-0050	train-other-500	for the day was warm and the road dusty Come hither child and give me a draught of water he called and the girl ran to fill her pitcher offering it with a low reverence Thanks daughter
7823-103122-0051	train-other-500	A fine day for the bleaching but over warm for much travel
none	none	 Go to your work child I will tarry a moment in the shade before I return to my hard task of sharpening a dull youth s wit 
7823-103122-0052	train-other-500	said the old man when he had drunk and with a frowning glance at the room where he had left his prisoner he drew a breviary from his pocket and began to read while the mule browsed along the road side
7823-103122-0053	train-other-500	Yvonne went to sprinkling the neglected linen wondering with mingled anxiety and girlish merriment how Gaston fared The sun shone hotly on the dry cloth and as she approached the boy s hiding place
7823-103122-0054	train-other-500	a stir would have betrayed him had the chaplain s eyes been lifted Sprinkle me quickly I am stifling in this hole whispered an imploring voice
none	none	 Drink thy blood Beaumanoir 
7823-103122-0055	train-other-500	and the thirst will pass quoted Yvonne taking a naughty satisfaction in the ignominious captivity of the wilful boy A long sigh was the only answer he gave and taking pity on him
7823-103122-0056	train-other-500	she made a little hollow in the linen where she knew his head lay
none	none	 and poured in water till a choking sound assured her Gaston had enough 
7823-103122-0057	train-other-500	The chaplain looked up but the girl coughed loudly as she went to refill her jug with such a demure face that he suspected nothing
none	none	 and presently ambled away to seek his refractory pupil 
7823-103122-0058	train-other-500	The moment he disappeared a small earthquake seemed to take place under the linen for it flew up violently and a pair of long legs waved joyfully in the air as Gaston burst into a ringing laugh
7823-103122-0059	train-other-500	which Yvonne echoed heartily Then springing up he said throwing back his wet hair and shaking his finger at her You dared not betray me but you nearly drowned me wicked girl
7823-103122-0060	train-other-500	I cannot stop for vengeance now but I ll toss you into the river some day and leave you to get out as you can Then he was off as quickly as he came eager to reach his prison again before the chaplain came to hear the unlearned lesson
7823-103122-0061	train-other-500	Yvonne watched him till he climbed safely in at the high window and disappeared with a wave of the hand when she too went back to her work little dreaming what brave parts both were to play in dangers and captivities
7823-103122-0062	train-other-500	of which these youthful pranks and perils were but a foreshadowing Two years later in the month of March seventeen ninety three
none	none	 the insurrection broke out in Vendee and Gaston had his wish 
7823-103122-0063	train-other-500	for the old count had been an officer of the king s household and hastened to prove his loyalty Yvonne s heart beat high with pride as she saw her foster brother ride gallantly away beside his father
7823-103122-0064	train-other-500	with a hundred armed vassals behind them and the white banner fluttering above their heads in the fresh wind She longed to go with him but her part was to watch and wait to hope and pray till the hour came when she like many another woman in those days
7823-103122-0065	train-other-500	could prove herself as brave as a man and freely risk her life for those she loved Four months later the heavy tidings reached them that the old count was killed and Gaston taken prisoner
7823-103122-0066	train-other-500	Great was the lamentation among the old men women and children left behind but they had little time for sorrow
none	none	 for a band of the marauding Vendeans 
7823-103122-0067	train-other-500	burned the chateau and laid waste the Abbey Now mother I must up and away to find and rescue Gaston I promised and if he lives it shall be done Let me go you are safe now
7823-103122-0068	train-other-500	and there is no rest for me till I know how he fares said Yvonne
none	none	 when the raid was over and the frightened peasants ventured to return from the neighboring forests 
7823-103122-0069	train-other-500	whither they had hastily fled for protection Go my girl and bring me news of our young lord May you lead him safely home again to rule over us answered Dame Gillian devoted still
none	none	 for her husband was reported dead with his master 
7823-103122-0070	train-other-500	yet she let her daughter go without a murmur feeling that no sacrifice was too great So Yvonne set out
none	none	 taking with her Gaston s pet dove and the little sum of money carefully hoarded for her marriage portion 
7823-103122-0071	train-other-500	The pretty winged creature frightened by the destruction of its home had flown to her for refuge and she had cherished it for its master s sake Now when it would not leave her but came circling around her head a league away from Dinan
7823-103122-0072	train-other-500	she accepted the good omen and made the bird the companion of her perilous journey There is no room to tell all the dangers disappointments and fatigues endured before she found Gaston but
7823-103122-0073	train-other-500	after being often misled by false rumors
none	none	 she at last discovered that he was a prisoner in Fort Penthievre 
7823-103122-0074	train-other-500	His own reckless courage had brought him there for in one of the many skirmishes in which he had taken part he ventured too far away from his men and was captured after fighting desperately to cut his way out Now
7823-103122-0075	train-other-500	alone in his cell he raged like a caged eagle feeling that there was no hope of escape for the fort stood on a plateau of precipitous rock washed on two sides by the sea
7823-103122-0076	train-other-500	He had heard of the massacre of the royalist emigrants who landed there and tried to prepare himself for a like fate
none	none	 hoping to die as bravely as young Sombreuil who was shot with twenty others on what was afterward named the Champ des Martyrs three His last words when ordered by the executioner to kneel were 
7823-103122-0077	train-other-500	I do it but one knee I bend for my God the other for my king
none	none	 three The Field of Martyrs Day after day Gaston looked down from his narrow window 
7823-103122-0078	train-other-500	past which the gulls flew screaming and watched the fishers at their work the women gathering sea weed on the shore
none	none	 and the white sails flitting across the bay of Quiberon 
7823-103122-0079	train-other-500	Bitterly did he regret the wilfulness which brought him there well knowing that if he had obeyed orders he would now be free to find his father s body and avenge his death Oh for one day of liberty
none	none	 one hope of escape one friend to cheer this dreadful solitude he cried when weeks had passed and he seemed utterly forgotten 
7823-103122-0080	train-other-500	As he spoke he shook the heavy bars with impotent strength
none	none	 then bent his head as if to hide even from himself the few hot tears 
7823-103122-0081	train-other-500	wrung from him by captivity and despair Standing so with eyes too dim for seeing something brushed against his hair and a bird lit on the narrow ledge He thought it was a gull and paid no heed
7823-103122-0082	train-other-500	but in a moment a soft coo started him and looking up he saw a white dove struggling to get in Blanchette he cried and the pretty creature flew to his hand
7823-103122-0083	train-other-500	pecking at his lips in the old caressing way he knew so well My faithful bird God bless thee exclaimed the poor lad
none	none	 holding the dove close against his cheek to hide the trembling of his lip 
7823-103122-0084	train-other-500	so touched so glad was he to find in his dreary prison even a dumb friend and comforter But Blanchette had her part to play
7823-103122-0085	train-other-500	and presently fluttered back to the window ledge cooing loudly as she pecked at something underneath her wing Then Gaston remembered
none	none	 how he used to send messages to Yvonne by this carrier dove 
7823-103122-0086	train-other-500	and with a thrill of joy looked for the token hardly daring to hope that any would be found Yes there tied carefully among the white feathers was a tiny roll of paper with these words rudely written on it
7823-103122-0087	train-other-500	Be ready help will come Y The brave girl the loyal heart I might have known she would keep her promise and come to save me and Gaston dropped on his knees in gratitude
7823-103122-0088	train-other-500	Blanchette meantime tripped about the cell on her little rosy feet ate a few crumbs of the hard bread dipped her beak in the jug of water dressed her feathers daintily then flew to the bars and called him
7823-103122-0089	train-other-500	He had nothing to send back by this sure messenger but a lock of hair and this he tied with the same thread in place of the note Then kissing the bird he bade it go
none	none	 watching the silver wings flash in the sunshine as it flew away 
7823-103122-0090	train-other-500	carrying joy with it and leaving hope behind After that the little courier came often unperceived carrying letters to and fro for Yvonne sent bits of paper and Gaston wrote his answers with his blood
7823-103122-0091	train-other-500	and a quill from Blanchette s wing He thus learned how Yvonne was living in a fisher s hut on the beach and working for his rescue as well as she dared
none	none	 Every day she might be seen gathering sea weed on the rocks or twirling her distaff at the door of the dilapidated hut not as a young girl but as an old woman for she had stained her fair skin put on ragged clothes and hidden her fresh face under the pent house cap worn by the women of Quiberon 
7823-103122-0092	train-other-500	Her neighbors thought her a poor soul left desolate by the war and let her live unmolested So she worked on secretly and steadily playing her part well
none	none	 and biding her time till the long hempen rope was made the sharp file procured unsuspected 
7823-103122-0093	train-other-500	and a boat ready to receive the fugitives Her plan was perilously simple but the only one possible for Gaston was well guarded and out of that lofty cell it seemed that no prisoner could escape without wings
7823-103122-0094	train-other-500	A bird and a woman lent him those wings and his daring flight was a nine days wonder at the fort
none	none	 Only a youth accustomed to feats of agility and strength could have safely made that dangerous escape along the face of the cliff that rose straight up from the shore 
7823-103122-0095	train-other-500	But Gaston was well trained and the boyish pranks that used to bring him into dire disgrace now helped to save his life Thus when the order came written in the rude hand he had taught Yvonne long ago
7823-103122-0096	train-other-500	Pull up the thread which Blanchette will bring at midnight Watch for a light in the bay Then come down and saint Barbe protect you he was ready for the tiny file of watch spring brought by the bird
7823-103122-0097	train-other-500	had secretly done its work and several bars were loose He knew that the attempt might cost him his life but was willing to gain liberty even at that price for imprisonment seemed worse than death to his impatient spirit
7823-103122-0098	train-other-500	The jailer went his last round the great bell struck the appointed hour and Gaston stood at the window straining his eyes to catch the first ray of the promised light when the soft whir of wings gladdened his ear and Blanchette arrived
7823-103122-0099	train-other-500	looking scared and wet and weary for rain fell the wind blew fitfully
none	none	 and the poor bird was unused to such wild work as this 
7823-103122-0100	train-other-500	But obedient to its training it flew to its master
none	none	 and no angel could have been more welcome than the storm beaten little creature as it nestled in his bosom while he untangled the lengths of strong thread wound about one of its feet 
7823-103122-0101	train-other-500	He knew what to do and tying a bit of the broken bar to one end as a weight he let it down praying that no cruel gust would break or blow it away In a moment a quick jerk at the thread bade him pull again
7823-103122-0102	train-other-500	A cord came up and when that was firmly secured a second jerk was the signal for the last and most important haul Up came the stout rope knotted here and there to add safety and strength to the hands and feet that were to climb down that frail ladder
none	none	 unless some cruel fate dashed the poor boy dead upon the rocks below 
7823-103122-0103	train-other-500	The rope was made fast to an iron staple inside
none	none	 the bars were torn away and Gaston crept through the narrow opening to perch on the ledge without 
7823-103122-0104	train-other-500	while Blanchette flew down to tell Yvonne he was coming The moment the distant spark appeared he bestirred himself set his teeth and boldly began the dangerous descent
7823-103122-0105	train-other-500	Rain blinded him the wind beat him against the rock bruising hands and knees
none	none	 and the way seemed endless as he climbed slowly down clinging with the clutch of a drowning man 
7823-103122-0106	train-other-500	and blessing Yvonne for the knots that kept him from slipping when the gusts blew him to and fro More than once he thought it was all over but the good rope held fast and strength and courage nerved heart and limbs
7823-103122-0107	train-other-500	One greater than saint Barbe upheld him and he dropped at last breathless and bleeding beside the faithful Yvonne There was no time for words only a grasp of the hand a sigh of gratitude
7823-103122-0108	train-other-500	and they were away to the boat that tossed on the wild water with a single rower in his place
none	none	 It is our Hoel 
7823-103122-0109	train-other-500	I found him looking for you He is true as steel In in and off or you are lost whispered Yvonne flinging a cloak about Gaston thrusting a purse a sword and a flask into his hand and holding the boat while he leaped in
7823-103122-0110	train-other-500	But you he cried I cannot leave you in peril after all you have dared and done for me No one suspects me I am safe Go to my mother she will hide you and I will follow soon
7823-103122-0111	train-other-500	Waiting for no further speech
none	none	 she pushed the boat off 
7823-103122-0112	train-other-500	and watched it vanish in the darkness then went away to give thanks and rest after her long work and excitement
none	none	 Gaston 
7823-103122-0113	train-other-500	reached home safely and Dame Gillian concealed him in the ruins of the Abbey till anxiety for Yvonne drove him out to seek and rescue in his turn For she did not come and when a returning soldier
7823-103122-0114	train-other-500	brought word that she had been arrested in her flight and sent to Nantes Gaston could not rest but disguising himself as a peasant
none	none	 went to find her accompanied by faithful Hoel 
7823-103122-0115	train-other-500	who loved Yvonne and would gladly die for her and his young master Their hearts sunk when they discovered that she was in the Boufflay an old fortress once a royal residence and now a prison
7823-103122-0116	train-other-500	crowded with unfortunate and innocent creatures arrested on the slightest pretexts
none	none	 and guillotined or drowned by the infamous Carrier 
7823-103122-0117	train-other-500	Hundreds of men and women were there suffering terribly and among them was Yvonne brave still but with no hope of escape for few were saved and then only by some lucky accident
7823-103122-0118	train-other-500	Like a sister of mercy she went among the poor souls crowded together in the great halls hungry cold sick and despairing and they clung to her as if she were some strong sweet saint who could deliver them or teach them how to die
7823-103122-0119	train-other-500	After some weeks of this terrible life her name was called one morning on the list for that day s execution and she rose to join the sad procession setting forth Which is it to be she asked
7823-103122-0120	train-other-500	as she passed one of the men who guarded them a rough fellow whose face was half hidden by a shaggy beard You will be drowned we have no time to waste on women
none	none	 was the brutal answer but as the words passed his lips 
7823-103122-0121	train-other-500	a slip of paper was pressed into her hand
none	none	 and these words breathed into her ear by a familiar voice 
7823-103122-0122	train-other-500	I am here It was Gaston in the midst of enemies bent on saving her at the risk of his life remembering all he owed her and the motto of his race The shock of this discovery nearly betrayed them both
none	none	 and turned her so white that the woman next her put her arm about her saying sweetly 
7823-103122-0123	train-other-500	Courage my sister it is soon over I fear nothing now cried Yvonne and went on to take her place in the cart
none	none	 looking so serene and happy that those about her thought her already fit for heaven No need to repeat the dreadful history of the Noyades 
7823-103122-0124	train-other-500	it is enough to say that in the confusion of the moment Yvonne found opportunity to read and destroy the little paper which said briefly When you are flung into the river call my name and float I shall be near
7823-103122-0125	train-other-500	She understood
none	none	 and being placed with a crowd of wretched women on the old vessel which lay in the river Loire 
7823-103122-0126	train-other-500	she employed every moment in loosening the rope that tied her hands and keeping her eye on the tall bearded man who moved about seeming to do his work while his blood boiled with suppressed wrath and his heart ached with unavailing pity
7823-103122-0127	train-other-500	It was dusk before the end came for Yvonne and she was all unnerved by the sad sights she had been forced to see but when rude hands seized her she made ready for the plunge sure that Gaston would be near

7823-103122-0130	train-other-500	where they gave her fire food dry garments and the gladdest welcome one human creature ever gave to another Being a robust peasant the girl came safely through hardships that would have killed or crazed a frailer creature

none	none	 Slip around and drive him this way I never miss my aim and we will sup royally to night whispered Gaston glad to use the arms with which they had provided themselves Hoel slipped away and presently a rustle in the wood betrayed the cautious approach of the deer But he was off before a shot could be fired and the disappointed hunters followed long and far resolved not to go back empty handed They had to give it up however and were partially consoled by a rabbit which Hoel flung over his shoulder while Gaston forgetting caution began to sing an old song the women of Brittany love so well Quand vous etiez captif Bertrand fils de Bretagne Tous les fuseaux tournaient aussi dans la campagne He got no further for the stanza was finished by a voice that had often joined in the ballad when Dame Gillian sang it to the children as she spun Chaque femme apporte son echeveau de lin Ce fut votre rancon Messire du Guesclin Both paused thinking that some spirit of the wood mocked them but a loud laugh and a familiar Holo holo made Hoel cry The forester while Gaston dashed headlong into the thicket whence the sound came there to find the jolly forester indeed with a slain deer by his side waiting to receive them with open arms I taught you to stalk the deer and spear the boar

doesn t take us long to make up our minds said Nelly Blake the leader of the school as a party of girls stood chatting round the register one cold November morning I like her she looks so fresh and pleasant and so strong I just wanted to go and lean up against her when my back ached yesterday answered Maud a pale girl wrapped in a shawl I m afraid she s very energetic and I do hate to be hurried sighed plump Cordelia lounging in an easy chair I know she is for Biddy says she asked for a pail of cold water at six this morning and she s out walking now Just think how horrid cried Kitty with a shiver I wonder what she does for her complexion Never saw such a lovely color Real roses and cream said Julia shutting one eye to survey the freckles on her nose with a gloomy frown I longed to ask what sort of braces she wears to keep her so straight I mean to by and by she looks as if she wouldn t snub a body and Sally vainly tried to square her own round shoulders bent with much poring over books for she was the bright girl of the school She wears French corsets of course Nothing else gives one such a fine figure answered Maud dropping the shawl to look with pride at her own wasp like waist and stiff back Couldn t move about so easily and gracefully if she wore a strait jacket like you She s not a bit of a fashion plate but a splendid woman just natural and hearty and sweet I feel as if I shouldn t slouch and poke so much if I had her to brace me up cried Sally in her enthusiastic way I know one thing girls and that is she can wear a jersey and have it set elegantly and we can t said Kitty laboring with her own which would wrinkle and twist in spite of many hidden pins Yes I looked at it all breakfast time and forgot my second cup of coffee so my head aches as if it would split Never saw anything fit so splendidly in my life answered Nelly turning to the mirror which reflected a fine assortment of many colored jerseys for all the girls were out in their fall suits and not one of the new jackets set like Miss Orne s the teacher who had arrived to take Madame s place while that excellent old lady was laid up with a rheumatic fever They are pretty and convenient but I m afraid they will be a trial to some of us Maud and Nelly look the best but they have to keep stiff and still or the wrinkles come Kit has no peace in hers and poor Cordy looks more like a meal bag than ever while I am a perfect spectacle with my round shoulders and long thin arms A jersey on a bean pole describes me but let us be in the fashion or die laughed Sally exaggerating her own defects by poking her head forward and blinking through her glasses in a funny way There was a laugh and then a pause broken in a moment by Maud who said in a tone of apprehension I do hope Miss Orne isn t full of the new notions about clothes and food and exercise and rights and rubbish of that sort Mamma hates such ideas and so do I I hope she is full of good wise notions about health and work and study It is just what we need in this school Madame is old and lets things go and the other teachers only care to get through and have an easy time We ought to be a great deal better brisker and wiser than we are and I m ready for a good stirring up if any one will give it to us declared Sally who was a very independent girl and had read as well as studied much You Massachusetts girls are always raving about self culture and ready for queer new ways I m contented with the old ones and want to be let alone and finished off easily said Nelly the pretty New Yorker Well I go with Sally and want to get all I can in the way of health learning and manners while I m here and I m real glad Miss Orne has come for Madame s old fashioned niminy priminy ways did fret me dreadfully Miss Orne is more like our folks out West spry and strong and smart see if she isn t said Julia with a decided nod of her auburn head There she is now Girls she s running actually trotting up the avenue not like a hen but a boy with her elbows down and her head up Do come and see cried Kitty dancing about at the window as if she longed to go and do likewise All ran in time to see a tall young lady come up the wide path at a good pace looking as fresh and blithe as the goddess of health as she smiled and nodded at them so like a girl that all returned her salute with equal cordiality She gives a new sort of interest to the old treadmill doesn t she said Nelly as they scattered to their places at the stroke of nine feeling unusually anxious to appear well before the new teacher While they pull down their jerseys and take up their books we will briefly state that Madame Stein s select boarding school had for many years received six girls at a time and finished them off in the old style Plenty of French German music painting dancing and deportment turned out well bred accomplished and amiable young ladies ready for fashionable society easy lives and entire dependence on other people Dainty and delicate creatures usually for as in most schools of this sort minds and manners were much cultivated but bodies rather neglected Heads and backs ached dyspepsia was a common ailment and poorlies of all sorts afflicted the dear girls who ought not to have known what nerves meant and should have had no bottles in their closets holding wine and iron cough mixtures soothing drops and cod liver oil for weak lungs Gymnastics had once flourished but the fashion had gone by and a short walk each day was all the exercise they took though they might have had glorious romps in the old coach house and bowling alley in bad weather and lovely rambles about the spacious grounds for the house was in the suburbs and had once been a fine country mansion Some of the liveliest girls did race down the avenue now and then when Madame was away and one irrepressible creature had actually slid down the wide balusters to the horror of the entire household In cold weather all grew lazy and cuddled under blankets and around registers like so many warmth loving pussies poor Madame s rheumatism making her enjoy a hot house temperature and indulge the girls in luxurious habits Now she had been obliged to give up entirely and take to her bed saying with the resignation of an indolent nature If Anna Orne takes charge of the school I shall feel no anxiety She is equal to anything She certainly looked so as she came into the school room ready for her day s work with lungs full of fresh air brain stimulated by sound sleep wholesome exercise and a simple breakfast and a mind much interested in the task before her The girls eyes followed her as she took her place involuntarily attracted by the unusual spectacle of a robust woman Everything about her seemed so fresh harmonious and happy that it was a pleasure to see the brilliant color in her cheeks the thick coils of glossy hair on her spirited head the flash of white teeth as she spoke and the clear bright glance of eyes both keen and kind But the most admiring glances were on the dark blue jersey that showed such fine curves of the broad shoulders round waist and plump arms without a wrinkle to mar its smooth perfection Girls are quick to see what is genuine to respect what is strong and to love what is beautiful so before that day was over Miss Orne had charmed them all for they felt that she was not only able to teach but to help and amuse them After tea the other teachers went to their rooms glad to be free from the chatter of half a dozen lively tongues but Miss Orne remained in the drawing room and set the girls to dancing till they were tired then gathered them round the long table to do what they liked till prayer time Some had novels others did fancy work or lounged and all wondered what the new teacher would do next Six pairs of curious eyes were fixed upon her as she sat sewing on some queer bits of crash and six lively fancies vainly tried to guess what the articles were for no one was rude enough to ask Presently she tried on a pair of mittens and surveyed them with satisfaction saying as she caught Kitty staring with uncontrollable interest These are my beautifiers and I never like to be without them Are they to keep your hands white asked Maud who spent a good deal of time in caring for her own I wear old kid gloves at night after cold creaming mine I wear these for five minutes night and morning for a good rub after dipping them in cold water Thanks to these rough friends I seldom feel the cold get a good color and keep well answered Miss Orne polishing up her smooth cheek till it looked like a rosy apple I d like the color but not the crash Must it be so rough and with cold water asked Maud who often privately rubbed her pale face with a bit of red flannel rouge being forbidden except for theatricals Best so but there are other ways to get a color Run up and down the avenue three or four times a day eat no pastry and go to bed early said Miss Orne whose sharp eye had spied out the little weaknesses of the girls and whose kind heart longed to help them at once It makes my back ache to run and Madame says we are too old now Never too old to care for one s health my dear Better run now than lie on a sofa by and by with a back that never stops aching Do you cure your headaches in that way asked Nelly rubbing her forehead wearily I never have them and Miss Orne s bright eyes were full of pity for all pain What do you do to help it cried Nelly who firmly believed that it was inevitable I give my brain plenty of rest air and good food I never know I have any nerves except in the enjoyment they give me for I have learned how to use them I was not brought up to believe that I was born an invalid and was taught to understand the beautiful machinery God gave me and to keep it religiously in order Miss Orne spoke so seriously that there was a brief pause in which the girls were wishing that some one had taught them this lesson and made them as strong and lovely as their new teacher If crash mittens would make my jersey set like yours I d have a pair at once said Cordy sadly eyeing the buttons on her own which seemed in danger of flying off if their plump wearer moved too quickly Brisk runs are what you want and less confectionery sleep and lounging in easy chairs began Miss Orne all ready to prescribe for these poor girls the most important part of whose education had been so neglected Why how did you know said Cordy blushing as she bounced out of her luxurious seat and whisked into her pocket the paper of chocolate creams she was seldom without Her round eyes and artless surprise set the others to laughing and gave Sally courage to ask what she wanted then and there Miss Orne I wish you would show us how to be strong and hearty for I do think girls are a feeble set now a days We certainly need stirring up and I hope you will kindly do it Please begin with me then the others will see that I mean what I say Miss Orne looked up at the tall overgrown girl who stood before her with broad forehead near sighted eyes and narrow chest of a student not at all what a girl of seventeen should be physically though a clear mind and a brave spirit shone in her clever face and sounded in her resolute voice I shall very gladly do what I can for you my dear It is very simple and I am sure that a few months of my sort of training will help you much for you are just the kind of girl who should have a strong body to keep pace with a very active brain answered Miss Orne taking Sally s thin inky fingers in her own with a friendly pressure that showed her good will Madame says violent exercise is not good for girls so we gave up gymnastics long ago said Maud in her languid voice wishing that Sally would not suggest disagreeable things One does not need clubs dumb bells and bars for my style of exercise Let me show you and rising Miss Orne went through a series of energetic but graceful evolutions which put every muscle in play without great exertion That looks easy enough began Nelly Try it answered Miss Orne with a sparkle of fun in her blue eyes They did try to the great astonishment of the solemn portraits on the wall unused to seeing such antics in that dignified apartment But some of the girls were out of breath in five minutes others could not lift their arms over their heads Maud and Nelly broke several bones in their corsets trying to stoop and Kitty tumbled down in her efforts to touch her toes without bending her knees Sally got on the best of all being long of limb easy in her clothes and full of enthusiasm Pretty well for beginners said Miss Orne as they paused at last flushed and merry Do that regularly every day and you will soon gain a few inches across the chest and fill out the new jerseys with firm elastic figures Like yours added Sally with a face full of such honest admiration that it could not offend Seeing that she had made one convert and knowing that girls like sheep are sure to follow a leader Miss Orne said no more then but waited for the leaven to work The others called it one of Sally s notions but were interested to see how she would get on and had great fun when they went to bed watching her faithful efforts to imitate her teacher s rapid and effective motions The wind mill is going cried Kitty as several of them sat on the bed laughing at the long arms swinging about That is the hygienic elbow exercise and that the Orne Quickstep a mixture of the grasshopper s skip and the water bug s slide added Julia humming a tune in time to the stamp of the other s foot We will call these the Jersey Jymnastics and spell the last with a J my dear said Nelly and the name was received with as much applause as the young ladies dared to give it at that hour Laugh on but see if you don t all follow my example sooner or later when I become a model of grace strength and beauty retorted Sally as she turned them out and went to bed tingling all over with a delicious glow that sent the blood from her hot head to warm her cold feet and bring her the sound refreshing sleep she so much needed This was the beginning of a new order of things for Miss Orne carried her energy into other matters besides gymnastics and no one dared oppose her when Madame shut her ears to all complaints saying Obey her in everything and don t trouble me Pitchers of fresh milk took the place of tea and coffee cake and pie were rarely seen but better bread plain puddings and plenty of fruit Rooms were cooled off feather beds sent up garret and thick curtains abolished Sun and air streamed in and great cans of water appeared suggestively at doors in the morning Earlier hours were kept and brisk walks taken by nearly all the girls for Miss Orne baited her hook cleverly and always had some pleasant project to make the wintry expeditions inviting There were games in the parlor instead of novels and fancy work in the evening shorter lessons and longer talks on the many useful subjects that are best learned from the lips of a true teacher A cooking class was started not to make fancy dishes but the plain substantial ones all housewives should understand Several girls swept their own rooms and liked it after they saw Miss Orne do hers in a becoming dust cap and these same pioneers headed by Sally boldly coasted on the hill swung clubs in the coach house and played tag in the bowling alley rainy days It took time to work these much needed changes but young people like novelty the old routine had grown tiresome and Miss Orne made things so lively and pleasant it was impossible to resist her wishes Sally did begin to straighten up after a month or two of regular training Maud outgrew both corsets and backache Nelly got a fresh color Kitty found her thin arms developing visible muscles and Julia considered herself a Von Hillern after walking ten miles without fatigue But dear fat Cordy was the most successful of all and rejoiced greatly over the loss of a few pounds when she gave up over eating long naps and lazy habits Exercise became a sort of mania with her and she was continually trudging off for a constitutional or trotting up and down the halls when bad weather prevented the daily tramp It was the desire of her soul to grow thin and such was her ardor that Miss Orne had to check her sometimes lest she should overdo the matter All this is easy and pleasant now because it is new she said and there is no one to criticise our simple sensible ways but when you go away I am afraid you will undo the good I have tried to do you People will ridicule you fashion will condemn and frivolous pleasures make our wholesome ones seem hard Can you be steadfast and keep on We will cried all the girls but the older ones looked a little anxious as they thought of going home to introduce the new ways alone Miss Orne shook her head earnestly wishing that she could impress the important lesson indelibly upon them and very soon something happened which had that effect April came and the snowdrops and crocuses were up in the garden beds Madame was able to sit at her window peering out like a dormouse waking from its winter sleep and much did the good lady wonder at the blooming faces turned up to nod and smile at her the lively steps that tripped about the house and the amazing spectacle of her young ladies racing round the lawn as if they liked it No one knew how Miss Orne reconciled her to this new style of deportment but she made no complaint only shook her impressive cap when the girls came beaming in to pay little visits full of happy chat about their affairs They seemed to take a real interest in their studies now to be very happy and all looked so well that the wise old lady said to herself Looks are everything with women and I have never been able to show such a bouquet of blooming creatures at my breaking up as I shall this year I will let well enough alone and if fault is found dear Anna s shoulders are broad enough to bear it Things were in this promising state and all were busily preparing for the May fete at which time this class of girls would graduate when the mysterious events occurred to which we have alluded They were gathered the girls not the events round the table one night discussing with the deep interest befitting such an important topic what they should wear on examination day I think white silk jerseys and pink or blue skirts would be lovely so pretty and so appropriate for the J J Club and so nice for us to do our exercises in Miss Orne wants us to show how well we go together and of course we want to please her said Nelly taking the lead as usual in matters of taste Of course cried all the girls with an alacrity which plainly showed how entirely the new friend had won their hearts I wouldn t have believed that six months could make such a difference in one s figure and feelings said Maud surveying her waist with calm satisfaction though it was no longer slender but in perfect proportion to the rest of her youthful shape I ve had to let out every dress and it s a mercy I m going home for I shouldn t be decent if I kept on at this rate and Julia took a long breath proud of her broad chest expanded by plenty of exercise and loose clothing I take mine in and don t have to worry about my buttons flying off a la Clara Peggotty I m so pleased I want to be training all the time for I m not half thin enough yet said Cordy jumping up for a trot round the room that not a moment might be lost Come Sally you ought to join in the jubilee for you have done wonders and will be as straight as a ramrod in a little while Why so sober to night Is it because our dear Miss Orne leaves us to sit with Madame asked Nelly missing the gayest voice of the six and observing her friend s troubled face I m making up my mind whether I d better tell you something or not Don t want to scare the servants trouble Madame or vex Miss Orne for I know she wouldn t believe a word of it though I saw it with my own eyes answered Sally in such a mysterious tone that the girls with one voice cried Tell us this minute I will and perhaps some of you can explain the matter As she spoke Sally rose and stood on the rug with her hands behind her looking rather wild and queer for her short hair was in a toss her eyes shone large behind her round glasses and her voice sank to a whisper as she made this startling announcement I ve seen a ghost A general shiver pervaded the listeners and Cordy poked her head under the sofa pillows with a faint cry while the rest involuntarily drew nearer to one another Where demanded Julia the bravest of the party On the top of the house Good gracious When Sally What did it look like Don t scare us for fun cried the girls undecided whether to take this startling story in jest or earnest Listen and I ll tell you all about it answered Sally holding up her finger impressively Night before last I sat till eleven studying Against the rules I know but I forgot and when I was through I opened my window to air the room It was bright moonlight so I took a stroll along the top of the piazza and coming back with my eyes on the sky I naturally saw the roof of the main house from my wing I couldn t have been asleep could I yet I solemnly declare I saw a white figure with a veil over its head roaming to and fro as quietly as a shadow I looked and looked then I called softly but it never answered and suddenly it was gone What did you do quavered Cordy in a smothered voice from under the pillow Went straight in took my lamp and marched up to the cupola Not a sign of any one all locked and the floor dusty for we never go there now you know I didn t like it but just said Sally go to bed it s an optical illusion and serves you right for studying against the rule That was the first time Mercy on us Did you see it again cried Maud getting hold of Julia s strong arm for protection Yes in the bowling alley at midnight whispered Sally Do shut the door Kit and don t keep clutching at me in that scary way it s very unpleasant said Nelly glancing nervously over her shoulder as the six pairs of wide opened eyes were fixed on Sally I got up to shut my window last night and saw a light in the alley A dim one but bright enough to show me the same white thing going up and down with the veil as before I ll confess I was nervous then for you know there is a story that in old times the man who lived here wouldn t let his daughter marry the lover she wanted and she pined away and died and said she d haunt the cruel father and she did Old missus Foster told me all about it when I first came and Madame asked me not to repeat it so I never did I don t believe in ghosts mind you but what on earth is it trailing about in that ridiculous way Sally spoke nervously and looked excited for in spite of courage and common sense she was worried to account for the apparition How long did it stay asked Julia with her arm round Maud who was trembling and pale A good fifteen minutes by my watch then vanished light and all as suddenly as before I didn t go to look after it that time but if I see it again I ll hunt till I find out what it is Who will go with me No one volunteered and Cordy emerged long enough to say imploringly Do tell Miss Orne or get the police then dived out of sight again and lay quaking like an ostrich with its head in the sand I won t Miss Orne would think I was a fool and the police don t arrest ghosts I ll do it myself and Julia will help me I know She is the bravest of you and hasn t developed her biceps for nothing said Sally bent on keeping all the glory of the capture to themselves if possible Flattered by the compliment to her arms Julia did not decline the invitation but made a very sensible suggestion which was a great relief to the timid till Sally added a new fancy to haunt them Perhaps it is one of the servants moon struck or love lorn Myra looks sentimental and is always singing I m waiting waiting darling Morning night and noon Oh meet me by the river When softly shines the moon It s not Myra I asked her and she turned pale at the mere idea of going anywhere alone after dark and said cook had seen a banshee gliding down the Lady s Walk one night when she got up for camphor having the face ache I said no more not wanting to scare them ignorant people are so superstitious Sally paused and the girls all tried not to look scared or superstitious but did not succeed very well What are you going to do asked Nelly in a respectful tone as Julia and Sally stood side by side like Horatius and Herminius waiting for a Spurius Lartius to join them Watch like cats for a mouse and pounce as soon as possible All promise to say nothing then we can t be laughed at if it turns out some silly thing as it probably will answered Sally We promise solemnly answered the girls feeling deeply impressed with the thrilling interest of the moment Very well now don t talk about it or think about it till we report or no one will sleep a wink said Sally walking off with her ally as coolly as if after frightening them out of their wits they could forget the matter at word of command The oath of silence was well kept but lessons suffered and so did sleep for the excitement was great especially in the morning when the watchers reported the events of the night and in the evening when they took turns to go on guard There was much whisking of dressing gowns up and down the corridor of the west wing where our six roomed as the girls flew to ask questions early each day or scurried to bed glancing behind them for the banshee as they went Miss Orne observed the whispers nods and eager confabulations but said nothing for Madame had confided to her that the young ladies were planning a farewell gift for her So she was blind and deaf and smiled at the important airs of her girlish admirers Three or four days passed and no sign of the ghost appeared The boldest openly scoffed at the false alarm and the most timid began to recover from their fright Sally and Julia looked rather foolish as they answered no news morning after morning to the inquiries which were rapidly losing the breathless eagerness so flattering to the watchers You dreamed it Sally Go to sleep and don t do it again said Nelly on the fifth day as she made her evening call and found the girls yawning and cross for want of rest She has exercised too much and produced a morbid state of the brain laughed Maud I just wish she wouldn t scare me out of my senses for nothing grumbled Cordy I used to sleep like a dormouse and now I dream dreadfully and wake up tired out Come along Kit and let the old ghosts carry off these silly creatures My regards to the Woman in White when you see her again dear added Kitty as the four went off to laugh at the whole thing though they carefully locked their doors and took a peep out of window before going to sleep We may as well give it up and have a good rest I m worn out and so are you if you d own it said Julia throwing herself down for a nap before midnight I shall not give it up till I m satisfied Sleep away I ll read awhile and call you if anything comes answered Sally bound to prove the truth of her story if she waited all summer Julia was soon off and the lonely watcher sat reading till past eleven then put out her light and went to take a turn on the flat roof of the piazza that ran round the house for the night was mild and the stars companionable As she turned to come back her sharp eye caught sight of something moving on the house top as before and soon clear against the soft gloom of the sky appeared the white figure flitting to and fro A long look and then Sally made a rush at Julia shaking her violently as she said in an excited whisper Come she is there Quick upstairs to the cupola I have the candle and the key Carried away by the other s vehemence Julia mutely obeyed trembling but afraid to resist and noiseless as two shadows they crept up the stairs arriving just in time to see the ghost vanish over the edge of the roof as if it had dissolved into thin air Julia dropped down in a heap desperately frightened but Sally pulled her up and led her back to their room saying when she got there with grim satisfaction Did I dream it all Now I hope they will believe me What was it Oh what could it be whimpered Julia quite demoralized by the spectacle I begin to believe in ghosts for no human being could fly off in that way with nothing to walk on I shall speak to Miss Orne to morrow I ve had enough of this sort of fun said Sally going to the window with a strong desire to shut and lock it But she paused with her hand raised as if turned to stone for as she spoke the white figure went slowly by Julia dived into the closet with one spring Sally however was on her mettle now and holding her breath leaned out to watch With soundless steps the veiled thing went along the roof and paused at the further end Never waiting for her comrade Sally quietly stepped out and followed leaving Julia to quake with fear and listen for an alarm None came and in a few minutes that seemed like hours Sally returned looking much excited but was sternly silent and to all the other s eager questions she would only give this mysterious reply I know all but cannot tell till morning Go to sleep Believing her friend offended at her base desertion at the crisis of the affair Julia curbed her curiosity and soon forgot it in sleep Sally slept also feeling like a hero reposing after a hard won battle She was up betimes and ready to receive her early visitors with an air of triumph which silenced every jeer and convinced the most skeptical that she had something sensational to tell at last When the girls had perched themselves on any available article of furniture they waited with respectful eagerness while Sally retired to the hall for a moment and Julia rolled her eyes with her finger on her lips looking as if she could tell much if she dared Sally returned somewhat flushed but very sober and in a few dramatic words related the adventures of the night up to the point where she left Julia quivering ignominiously in the closet and like Horatius faced the foe alone I followed till the ghost entered a window Which demanded five awestruck voices at once The last Ours whispered Kitty pale as her collar while Cordy her room mate sat aghast As it turned to shut the window the veil fell back and I saw the face Sally spoke in a whisper and added with a sudden start I see it now Every girl sprang or tumbled off her perch as if an electric shock had moved them and stared about them as Nelly cried wildly Where oh where There and Sally pointed at the palest face in the room while her own reddened with the mirth she was vainly trying to suppress Cordy A general shriek of amazement and incredulity followed the question while Sally laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks at the dumb dismay of the innocent ghost As soon as she could be heard she quickly explained Yes it was Cordy walking in her sleep She wore her white flannel wrapper and a cloud round her head and took her exercise over the roofs at midnight so that no time might be lost I don t wonder she is tired in the morning after such dangerous gymnastics as these But she couldn t vanish in that strange way off the house top without breaking her neck said Julia much relieved but still mystified She didn t fly nor fall but went down the ladder left by the painters Look at the soles of her felt slippers if you doubt me and see the red paint from the roof We couldn t open the cupola windows you remember but this morning I took a stroll and looked up and saw how she did it asleep though she never would dare to do it awake Somnambulists do dreadfully dangerous things you know said Sally as if her experience of those peculiar people had been vast and varied How could I It s horrid to think of Why did you let me Kit cried Cordy uncertain whether to be proud or ashamed of her exploit Never dreamed of your doing such a silly thing and never waked up Sleep walkers are always quiet and if I had seen you I d have been too scared to know you I ll tie you to the bed post after this and not let you scare the whole house answered Kitty regarding it all as a fine joke What did I do when I got in asked Cordy curiously Took off your things and went to bed as if glad to get back I didn t dare to wake you and kept the fun all to myself till this morning Thought I ought to have a good laugh for my pains since I did all the work answered Sally in high glee at the success of her efforts I did want to get as thin as I could before I went home the boys plague me so and I suppose it wore upon me and set me to walking at night I m very sorry and I never will again if I can help it Please forgive me and don t tell any one but Miss Orne it was so silly begged poor Cordy tearfully All promised and comforted her and praised Sally and plagued Julia and had a delightfully noisy and exciting half hour before the breakfast bell rang Miss Orne wondered what made the young faces so gay and the laughter so frequent as mysterious hints and significant nods went on around the table but as soon as possible she was borne into the school room and told the thrilling tale Her interest and surprise were very flattering and when the subject had been well discussed she promised to prevent any further escapades of this sort and advised Cordy to try the Banting method for the few remaining weeks of her stay I ll try anything that will keep me from acting ghost and making every one afraid of me said Cordy secretly wondering why she had not broken her neck in her nocturnal gymnastics Do you believe in ghosts Miss Orne asked Maud who did in spite of the comic explanation of this one Not the old fashioned sort but there is a modern kind that we are all afraid of more or less answered Miss Orne with a half playful half serious look at the girls around her Do tell about them please begged Kitty while the rest looked both surprised and interested There is one which I am very anxious to keep you from fearing Women are especially haunted by it and it prevents them from doing being and thinking all that they might and ought What will people say is the name of this formidable ghost and it does much harm for few of us have the courage to live up to what we know to be right in all things You are soon to go away to begin your lives in earnest and I do hope that whatever I have been able to teach you about the care of minds and bodies will not be forgotten or neglected because it may not be the fashion outside our little world I never will forget or be afraid of that ghost Miss Orne cried Sally quick to understand and accept the warning so opportunely given I have great faith in you dear because you have proved yourself so brave in facing phantoms more easily laid But this is a hard one to meet and vanquish so watch well stand firm and let these jerseys that you are so fond of cover not only healthy young bodies but happy hearts both helping you to be sweet wise and useful women in the years to come Dear girls promise me this and I shall feel that our winter has not been wasted and that our spring is full of lovely promise for a splendid summer As she spoke with her own beautiful face bright with hope and tenderness Miss Orne opened her arms and gathered them all in to seal their promise with grateful kisses more eloquent than words Long after their school days were over the six girls kept the white jerseys they wore at the breaking up festival as relics of the J J and long after they were scattered far apart they remembered the lessons which helped them to be what their good friend hoped healthy happy and useful women Illustration Illustration The Little House In The Garden I think we little ones ought to have a story all to ourselves now said one of the smaller lads as they gathered round the fire with unabated interest So do I and I ve got a little tale that will just suit you I fancy The older boys and girls can go and play games if they don t care to hear answered Aunt Elinor producing the well worn portfolio Thanks we will try a bit and if it is very namby pamby we can run said Geoff catching sight of the name of the first chapter Aunt Elinor smiled and began to read about THE LITTLE HOUSE IN THE GARDEN I BEARS A brown bear was the first tenant in fact it was built for him and this is the way it happened A man and his wife were driving through the woods up among the mountains and hearing a queer sound looked about them till they spied two baby bears in a tree Those must be the cubs of the old bear that was killed last week said mister Hitchcock much interested all at once Poor little things how will they get on without their mother They look half scared to death and cry like real babies said the kind woman They will starve if we don t take care of them I ll shake them down you catch them in your shawl and we ll see what we can do for them So mister Hitchcock climbed up the tree to the great dismay of the two orphans who growled funny little growls and crept as far out on the branch as they dared Shake easy John or they will fall and be killed cried the wife holding out her shawl for this new kind of fruit to fall into Down they came one after the other and at first were too frightened to fight so mister Hitchcock got them into the wagon safely bundled up and missus Hitchcock soothed their alarm by gentle pattings and motherly words till they ceased to struggle and cuddled down to sleep like two confiding puppies for they were not much bigger mister Hitchcock kept the hotel that stood at the foot of the king of the mountains and in summer the house was full of people so he was glad of any new attraction and the little bears were the delight of many children At first Tom and Jerry trotted and tumbled about like frolicsome puppies and led easy lives petted fed and admired till they grew so big and bold that like other young creatures their pranks made mischief as well as fun Tom would steal all the good things he could lay his paws on in kitchen or dining room and cook declared she couldn t have the rascal loose for whole pans of milk vanished sheets of ginger bread were found in his den under the back steps and nearly every day he was seen scrambling off with booty of some sort while the fat cook waddled after scolding and shaking the poker at him to the great amusement of the boarders on the piazza People bore with him a long time but when he took a lively trot down the middle of the long dinner table one day after eating all he liked and smashing right and left as he scampered off with a terrible clatter of silver glass and china his angry master declared he wouldn t have such doings and chained him to a post on the lawn Here he tugged and growled dismally while good little Jerry frisked gayly about trying to understand what it all meant But presently his besetting sin got him into trouble likewise He loved to climb and was never happier than when scrambling up the rough posts of the back piazza to bask in the sun on the roof above peeping down with his sharp little eyes at the children who could not follow He roosted in trees like a fat brown bird and came tumbling down unexpectedly on lovers who sought quiet nooks to be romantic in He explored the chimneys and threw into them any trifle he happened to find being a rogue and fond of stealing hats balls dolls or any small article that came in his way But the fun he liked best was to climb in at the chamber windows and doze on the soft beds for Jerry was a luxurious fellow and scorned the straw of his own den This habit annoyed people much and the poor bear often came bundling out of windows with old gentlemen whacking him with canes or ladies throwing water after him One evening when there was a dance and every one was busy down stairs Jerry took a walk on the roof and being sleepy looked about for a cosey bed to take a nap in Two brothers occupied one of these rooms and both were Jerry s good friends especially the younger Georgie was fast asleep as his dancing days had not yet begun and Charlie was waltzing away down stairs so Jerry crept into bed and nestled down beside his playmate who was too sleepy to do anything but roll over thinking the big brother had come to bed By and by Charlie did come up late and tired and having forgotten a lamp undressed in the moonlight observing nothing till about to step into bed then finding something rolled up in the clothes thought it a joke of the other boys caught up a racket and began to bang away at the suspicious bundle A scene of wild confusion followed for Jerry growled and clawed and couldn t get out Georgie woke and thinking his bed fellow was his brother being abused by some frolicsome mate held on to Jerry defending him bravely till a rent in the sheet allowed a shaggy head to appear so close to his own that the poor child was painfully reminded of Red Riding Hood s false grandmother Charlie was speechless with laughter at this discovery and while Jerry bounced about the bed snarling and hugging pillows as he tried to get free terrified Georgie rushed down the hall screaming The wolf the wolf till he took refuge in his mother s room Out popped night capped heads anxious voices cried Is it fire and in a moment the house was astir The panic might have been serious if Jerry had not come galloping down stairs hotly pursued by Charlie in his night gown still belaboring the poor beast and howling He was in my bed He scared George I ll thrash him Then the alarmed ladies and gentlemen laughed and grew calm while the boys all turned out and hunted Jerry up stairs and down till he was captured and ignominiously lugged away to be tied in the barn That prank sealed his fate and he went to join his brother in captivity Here they lived for a year and went to housekeeping in a den in the bank with a trough for their food and a high knotted pole to climb on They had many visitors and learned a few tricks but were not happy bears for they longed to be free and the older they grew the more they sighed for the great forest where they were born The second summer something happened that parted them forever Among the children that year were Fred and Fan Howard two jolly young persons of twelve and fourteen Of course the bears were very interesting and Fred tried their tempers by tormenting them while Fan won their hearts with cake and nuts candy and caresses Tom was Fred s favorite and Jerry was Fan s Tom was very intelligent and covered himself with glory by various exploits One was taking off the boards which roofed the den so that the sun should dry the dampness after a rain and he carefully replaced them at night Any dog who approached the trough got his ears smartly boxed and meddlesome boys were hugged till they howled for mercy He danced in a way to convulse the soberest and Fred taught him to shoulder arms in such a funny imitation of a stout old soldier of the town that the children rolled on the grass in fits of laughter when the cap was on and the wooden gun flourished at word of command by the clumsy hero Jerry had no accomplishments but his sweet temper made many friends He let the doves eat with him the kittens frolic all over his broad back and was never rough with the small people who timidly offered the buns he took so gently from their little hands But he pined in captivity refused his food and lay in his den all day or climbed to the top of the pole and sat there looking off to the cool dark forest with such a pensive air that Fan said it made her heart ache to see him Just before the season ended Jerry disappeared No one could imagine how the chain broke but gone he was and never came back to Fan s satisfaction and Tom s great sorrow He mourned for his brother and mister Hitchcock began to talk of killing him for it would not do to let two bears loose in the neighborhood as they sometimes killed sheep and did much harm I wish my father would buy him said Fred I ve always wanted a menagerie and a tame bear would be a capital beginning I ll ask him for I hate to have the poor old fellow killed answered Fan She not only begged papa to buy Tom but confessed that she filed Jerry s chain and helped him to escape I know it was wrong but I couldn t see him suffer she said Now if you buy Tom I ll give you my five dollars to help and mister Hitchcock will forgive me and be glad to get rid of both the bears After some consultation Tom was bought and orders were sent to have a house built for him in a sunny corner of the garden with strong rings to chain him to and a good lock on the door to keep him in When he was settled in these new quarters he held daily receptions for some weeks Young and old came to see him and Fred showed off his menagerie with the pride of a budding Barnum A bare spot was soon worn on the grass where Tom s parade ground was and at all hours the poor fellow might be seen dancing and drilling or sitting at his door thoughtfully surveying the curious crowd and privately wishing he never had been born Here he lived for another year getting so big that he could hardly turn round in his house and so cross that Fred began to be a little afraid of him after several hugs much too close to be safe or agreeable One morning the door of the house was found broken off and Tom gone Fred was rather relieved but his father was anxious and ordered out the boys of the neighborhood to find the runaway lest he should alarm people or do some harm It was an easy matter to trace him for more than one terrified woman had seen the big brown beast sniffing round her back premises after food a whole schoolful of children had been startled out of their wits by a bear s head at the window and one old farmer was in a towering rage over the damage done to his bee hives and garden patch by the pesky critter afore he took to the woods After a long tramp poor Tom was found rolled up in a sunny nook resting after a glorious frolic He went home without much reluctance but from that time it was hard to keep him Bolts and bars chains and ropes were of little use for when the longing came off he went on one occasion carrying the house on his back like a snail till he tipped it over and broke loose Fred was quite worn out with his pranks and tried to sell or give him away but nobody would buy or accept such a troublesome pet Even tender hearted Fan gave him up when he frightened a little child into a fit and killed some sheep in his last holiday It was decided that he must be killed and a party of men armed with guns set out to carry the sentence into effect Fred went also to see that all was properly done and Fanny called after him with tears in her eyes Say good by for me and kill him as kindly as you can This time Tom had been gone a week and had evidently made up his mind to be a free bear for he had wandered far into the deepest wood and made a den for himself among the rocks Here they found him but could not persuade him to come out and no bold Putnam was in the troop to creep in and conquer him there Bullets will reach him if we can t so blaze away boys and finish him off We have fooled away time enough and I want to get home to supper said the leader of the hunt after many attempts had been made to lure or drive Tom from his shelter So they blazed away and growls of pain proved that some of the bullets had hit But Tom would not budge and having used up their ammunition the disappointed hunters went home resolving to bring dogs next day and finish the job They were spared the trouble however for when Fred looked from his window in the morning he saw that Tom had returned and ran down to welcome the rebel back But one look at the poor beast showed him that he had only come home to die for he was covered with wounds and lay moaning on his bed of straw looking as pathetic as a bear could his shaggy coat full of burrs his head and breast full of shot and one paw apparently broken Fanny cried over him and Fred was quite bowed down with remorse but nothing could be done and soon with a vain effort to lick the hands that stroked him poor Tom lifted his great paw for a farewell shake and died with his great head on his master s knee in token of forgiveness As if to atone for their seeming cruelty Fanny hung the little house with black while Tom lay in state and Fred resisting all temptations to keep his fine skin buried him like a warrior with his martial cloak around him in the green woods he loved so well II BOYS The next tenants of the little house were three riotous lads for Fred s family moved away and the new comers took possession one fine spring day with great rejoicing over this ready made plaything They were queer fellows of eleven twelve and fourteen for having read the Boys Froissart and other warlike works they were quite carried away by these stirring tales and each boy was a hero Harry the eldest was Henry of Navarre and wore a white plume on every occasion Ned was the Black Prince and clanked in tin armor while little Billy was William Tell and William Wallace by turns Tom s deserted mansion underwent astonishing changes about this time Bows and arrows hung on its walls battle axes lances and guns stood in the corners helmets shields and all manner of strange weapons adorned the rafters cannon peeped from its port holes a drawbridge swung over the moat that soon surrounded it the flags of all nations waved from its roof and the small house was by turns an armory a fort a castle a robber s cave a warrior s tomb a wigwam and the Bastile The neighbors were both amused and scandalized by the pranks of these dramatic young persons for they enacted with much spirit and skill all the historical events which pleased their fancy and speedily enlisted other boys to join in the new plays At one time painted and be feathered Indians whooped about the garden tomahawking the unhappy settlers in the most dreadful manner At another Achilles radiant in a tin helmet and boiler cover shield dragged Hector at the tail of his chariot the wheel barrow drawn by two antic and antique steeds who upset both victor and vanquished before the fun was over Tell shot bushels of apples off the head of the stuffed suit of clothes that acted his son Coeur de Leon and Saladin hacked blocks and cut cushions a la Walter Scott and tournaments of great splendor were held on the grass in which knights from all ages climes and races tilted gallantly while fair dames of tender years sat upon the wood pile to play Queens of Beauty and award the prize of valor Nor were more modern heroes forgotten Napoleon crossed the Alps a muck heap high fence and prickly hedge with intrepid courage Wellington won many a Waterloo in the melon patch and Washington glorified every corner of the garden by his heroic exploits Grant smoked sweet fern cigars at the fall of Richmond Sherman marched victoriously to Georgia through the corn and round the tomato bed and Phil Sheridan electrified the neighborhood by tearing down the road on a much enduring donkey stung to unusual agility by matches tied to his tail It grew to be an almost daily question among the young people What are the Morton boys at now for these interesting youths were much admired by their mates who eagerly manned the fences to behold the revels when scouts brought word of a new play going on missus Morton believed in making boys happy at home and so allowed them entire liberty in the great garden as it was safer than river streets or ball ground where a very mixed crowd was to be found Here they were under her own eye and the safe sweet tie between them still held fast for she was never too busy to bind up their wounds after a fray wave her handkerchief when cheers told of victory rummage her stores for costumes or join in their eager study of favorite heroes when rain put an end to their out of door fun So the summer was a lively one and though the vegetables suffered some damage a good crop of healthy happy hours was harvested and all were satisfied The little house looked much the worse for the raids made upon it but still stood firm with the stars and stripes waving over it and peace seemed to reign one October afternoon as the boys lay under the trees eating apples and planning what to play next Bobby wants to be a knight of the Round Table We might take him in and have fun with the rites and make him keep a vigil and all that proposed William Wallace anxious to admit his chosen friend to the inner circle of the brotherhood He s such a little chap he d be scared and howl I don t vote for that said the Black Prince rather scornfully as he lay with his kingly legs in the air and his royal mouth full of apple I do declared Henry of Navarre always generous and amiable Bob is a plucky little chap and will do anything we put him to He s poor and the other fellows look down on him so that s another reason why we ought to take him in and stand by him Let s give him a good trial and if he s brave we ll have him So we will Let s do it now he s over there waiting to be asked in He doesn t go poking his nose where he isn t wanted as some folks do cried Billy who had often been snubbed by the big boys in his efforts at knightly feats A whistle brought Bobby with a beaming face for he burned to join the fun but held back because he was not a gentleman s son A sturdy honest little soul was Bobby true as steel brave as a lion and loyal as an old time vassal to his young lord kind Billy who always told him all the plans explained the mysteries and shared the goodies when feasts were spread Now he stood leaning against one of the posts of the little house whither the boys had adjourned and listened bashfully while Harry told him what he must do to join the heroes of the Round Table He did not understand half of it but was ready for any trial and took the comical oath administered to him with the utmost solemnity You must stay here locked in for some hours and watch your armor That s the vigil young knights had to keep before they could fight You mustn t be scared at any noises you hear or anything you see or sing out for help even if you stay here till dark You ll be a coward if you do and never have a sword I promise truly hope to die if I don t answered Bobby fixing his blue eyes on the speaker and holding his curly head erect with the air of one ready to face any peril for the desire of his soul was to own a sword like Billy and clash it on warlike occasions Then a suit of armor was piled up on the red box which was by turns altar table tomb and executioner s block Banners were hung over it the place darkened two candles lighted and after certain rites which cannot be divulged the little knight was left to his vigil with the door locked The boys howled outside smote on the roof fired a cannon and taunted the prisoner with derisive epithets to stir him to wrath But no cry answered them no hint of weariness fear or anger betrayed him and after a half hour of this sort of fun they left him to the greater trial of silence solitude and uncertainty The short afternoon was soon gone and the tea bell rang before the vigil had lasted long enough He won t know what time it is let s leave him till after supper and then march out with torches and bring him in to a good feed Mother won t mind and Hetty likes to stuff fellows proposed Harry and all being hungry the first part of the plan was carried out at once But before tea was over the unusual clang of the fire bells drove all thought of Bobby out of the boys minds as they raced away to the exciting scene to take their share in the shouting running and tumbling about in every one s way The great hotel was burning and till midnight the town was in an uproar No lives were lost but much property and nothing else was thought of till dawn A heavy shower did good service and about one o clock people began to go home tired out missus Morton and other ladies were too busy giving shelter to the people from the hotel and making coffee for the firemen to send their boys to bed In fact they could not catch them for the youngsters were wild with excitement and pervaded the place like will o the wisps running errands lugging furniture splashing about with water and howling till they were as hoarse as crows This is the battle of Beauvais and we ve set the city a fire by flinging pitch pots over the walls croaked Harry to Ned as they bumped against each other one carrying a great coffee pot and the other a feather bed No it s the fall of Troy and I m AEneas lugging off the old man panted Ned staggering away with the heavy load on his back At last the flurry was over and our three lads very dirty wet and tired went to bed and to sleep and never once thought of poor Bobby till next morning Then Harry suddenly rose up with an exclamation that effectually roused both his brothers By saint Dennis we ve left that boy there all night He wouldn t be such a fool as to stay that old lock s broken easy enough said Ned looking troubled in spite of his words Yes he would He promised and he ll keep his word like a true knight It rained and was cold and no one knew where he was Oh dear I hope he isn t dead cried Billy tumbling out of bed and into his clothes as fast as he could The others laughed but dressed with unusual speed and flew to the garden house to find the lock unbroken and all as still inside as when they left it Looking very anxious Harry opened the door and all peeped in There at his post before the altar lay the little knight fast asleep Rain had soaked his clothes the chilly night air made his lips and hands purple with cold and the trials of those long hours left the round cheeks rather pale But he still guarded his arms and at the first sound was awake and ready to defend them though somewhat shaky with sleep and stiffness The penitent boys poured forth apologies in which fire remorse and breakfast were oddly mixed Bobby forgave them like a gentleman only saying with a laugh and a shiver Guess I d better go home ma ll be worried about me If I d known being out all night and getting wet was part of the business I d a left word and brought a blanket Be I a Round Table now Shall I have a sword and train with the rest I didn t holler once and wasn t much scared for all the bells and the dark and the rain You ve won your spurs and we ll knight you just as soon as we get time You re a brave fellow and I m proud to have you one of my men Please don t say much about this we ll make it all right and we re awfully sorry answered Harry while Ned put his own jacket over the wet shoulders and Billy beamed at him feeling that his friend s exploit outdid any of his own Bobby marched away as proudly as if he already saw the banners waving over him and felt the accolade that made him a true knight But that happy moment was delayed for some time because the cold caught in that shower threatened a fit of sickness and the boys play looked as if it might end in sad earnest Harry and his brothers confessed all to mamma listened with humility to her lecture on true knighthood and did penance by serving Bobby like real brothers in arms while he was ill As soon as the hardy boy was all right again they took solemn counsel together how they should reward him and atone for their carelessness Many plans were discussed but none seemed fine enough for this occasion till Billy had a bright idea Let s buy Bob some hens He wants some dreadfully and we ought to do something grand after treating him so badly and nearly killing him Who s got any money I haven t but it s a good idea responded Ned vainly groping in all his pockets for a cent to head the subscription with Mamma would lend us some and we could work to pay for it began Billy No I ve a better plan interrupted Harry with authority We ought to make a sacrifice and suffer for our sins We will have an auction and sell our arms The boys want them and will pay well My lords and gentlemen what say ye We will responded the loyal subjects of King Henry Winter is coming and we can t use them said Billy innocently And by next spring we shall be too old for such games added Ned Tis well Ho call hither my men Bring out the suits of mail sound the trumpets and set on thundered Harry striking an attitude and issuing his commands with royal brevity A funny scene ensued for while Billy ran to collect the boys Ned dismantled the armory and Hal disposed of the weapons in the most effective manner on trees fences and grass where the bidders could examine and choose at their ease Their mates had always admired and coveted these war like treasures for some were real and others ingenious imitations so they gladly came at sound of the hunter s horn which was blown when Robin Hood wanted his merry men Harry was auctioneer and rattled off the most amazing medley of nonsense in praise of the articles which he rapidly knocked down to the highest bidder The competition was lively for the boys laughed so much they hardly knew what they were doing and made the rashest offers but they all knew what the money was to be used for so they paid their bills handsomely and marched off with cross bows old guns rusty swords and tin armor quite contented with their bargains Seven dollars was realized by the sale and a fine rooster and several hens solemnly presented to Bobby who was overwhelmed by this unexpected atonement and immediately established his fowls in the wood shed where they happily resided through the winter and laid eggs with such gratifying rapidity that he earned quite a little fortune and insisted on saying that his vigil had not only made a knight of him but a millionnaire III BABIES The little house stood empty till spring then a great stir went on in the garden getting it ready for a new occupant It was mended painted red fitted up with a small table and chairs and a swing Sunflowers stood sentinel at the door vines ran over it and little beds of flowers were planted on either side Paths were dug all round the lawn and a baby carriage was rolled up and down to harden them The neighbors wondered what was coming next and one June day they found out for a procession appeared escorting the new tenant to the red mansion with great rejoicing among the boys First came Billy blowing the horn then Ned waving their best banner then Hal drawing the baby wagon in which as on a throne sat the little cousin who had come to spend the summer and rule over them like a small sweet tyrant A very sprightly damsel was four year old Queenie blue eyed plump and rosy with a cloud of yellow curls chubby arms that embraced every one and a pair of stout legs that trotted all day She surveyed her kingdom with cries of delight and took possession of mine tottage at once beginning housekeeping by a tumble out of the swing a header into the red chest and a pinch in the leaf of the table But she won great praise from the boys by making light of these mishaps and came up smiling with a bump on her brow a scratch on her pug nose and a bruise on one fat finger and turned out tea for the gentlemen as if she had done it all her life for the table was set and all manner of tiny cakes and rolls stood ready to welcome her This was only the beginning of tea parties for very soon a flock of lovely little friends came to play with Queenie and such pretty revels went on it seemed as if fairies had taken possession of the small house Dolls had picnics kittens went a visiting tin carts rattled up and down gay balloons flew about pigmy soldiers toddled round the paths in paper caps and best of all rosy little girls danced on the grass picked the flowers chased butterflies and sang as blithely as the birds Queenie took the lead in these frolics and got into no end of scrapes by her love of exploration often leading her small friends into the strawberry bed down the road over the wall or to some neighbor s house coolly demanding a dint a water and dingerbed for all us ones Guards were set bars and locks put up orders given and punishments inflicted but all in vain the dauntless baby always managed to escape and after anxious hunts and domestic flurries would be found up a tree under the big rhubarb leaves in a hen house or calmly strolling to town without her hat All sorts of people took her to drive at her request and brought her back just as her agitated relatives were flying to the river in despair Once she departed with a flock of sheep and was returned so dirty no one knew her till she was scrubbed Another time she passed the morning in the pig pen having fallen over the fence and finding pleasant society in a dozen young piggies stayed to play with them till discovered among the straw surrounded by her new friends one of whom slept sweetly in her arms We must tie her up said missus Morton quite worn out with her pranks So a strong cord was put round Queenie s waist and fastened to one of the rings in the little house where Tom used to be chained At first she raged and tugged then submitted and played about as if she didn t care but she laid plans in her naughty little mind and carried them out to the great dismay of Bessie the maid I want to tut drass she said in her most persuasive tones So Bessie gave her the rusty scissors she was allowed to use and let her play make hay till her toy wagon was full I want a dint a water pease was the next request and Bessie went in to get it She was delayed a few moments and when she came out no sign of Queenie remained but a pile of yellow hair cut off in a hurry and the end of the cord Slyboots was gone scissors and all Then there was racing and calling scolding and wailing but no Queenie was to be seen anywhere on the premises Poor Bessie ran one way Aunt Morton another and Billy who happened to be at home poked into all the nooks and corners for the runaway An hour passed and things began to look serious when Harry came in much excited and laughing so he could hardly speak Where do you think that dreadful baby has turned up Over at Pat Floyd s He found her in the water pipes You know a lot of those big ones are lying in the back street ready to use as soon as the place is dug Well that little rascal crept in and then couldn t turn round so she went on till she came out by Pat s house and nearly scared him out of his wits The pipes were not joined so she had light and air but I guess she had a hard road to travel Such a hot dirty tired baby you never saw missus Floyd is washing her up You d better go and get her Bess Bess went and returned with naughty Queenie looking as if rats had gnawed her curls off and the sand of the great desert had been ground into her hands and knees not to mention the iron rust that ruined her pretty pink frock or the crown of her hat rubbed to rags I wasn t frighted You said Dod be d all wound so I goed wite alon and Mis Foyd gived me a nice cold tater and a tootie and the bid dord washed my hands wif his wed tun That was Queenie s account of the matter but she behaved so well after it that her friends suspected the perilous prank had made a good impression upon her To keep her at home she was set to farming and the little house was a barn In it lived a rocking horse several wooden cows woolly sheep cats and dogs as well as a queer collection of carts and carriages tools and baskets Every day the busy little farmer dug and hoed planted and watered her dardin made hay harvested vegetables picked fruit or took care of animals pausing now and then to ride her horse drive out in her phaeton or go to an imaginary fire with the engine Billy had made for her The little friends came to help her and the flower beds soon looked as if an earthquake had upheaved them for things were planted upside down holes dug stones piled and potatoes laid about as if expected to dig themselves But cheeks bloomed like roses small hands got brown and busy feet trotted firmly about the paths while the red barn echoed with the gayest laughter all day long On Queenie s fifth birthday in September she had a gipsy party and all the small neighbors came to it A tent was pitched three tall poles held up a kettle over a truly fire that made the water really boil and supper was spread on the grass The little girls wore red and blue petticoats gay shawls or cloaks bright handkerchiefs on their heads and as many beads and breastpins as they liked Some had tamborines and shook them as they danced one carried a dolly in the hood of her cloak like a true gypsy and all sung skipping hand in hand round the fire The mammas looked on and helped about supper and Bess sat in the tent like an old woman and told pleasant fortunes as she looked in the palms of the soft little hands the children showed her They had a charming time and all remembered it well for that night when the fun was over every one in bed and the world asleep a great storm came on the wind blew a gale and chimney tops flew off blinds banged trees were broken apples whisked from the boughs by the bushel and much mischief was done But worst of all the dear little house blew away The roof went in one direction the boards in another the poor horse lay heels up and the rest of the animals were scattered far and wide over the garden Great was the lamentation next morning when the children saw the ruin The boys felt that it was past mending and gave it up while Queenie consoled herself for the devastation of her farm by the childish belief that a crop of new cats and dogs cows and horses would come up in the spring from the seed sowed broadcast by the storm So that was the sad end of the little house in the garden Illustration DAISY S JEWEL BOX AND HOW SHE FILLED IT Plenty of time for another Let the little folks go to bed now they ve had their story and please go on auntie cried Min when all had listened with more interest than they would confess to the children s tale So the small people trotted off much against their will and this most obliging of aunts drew forth another manuscript saying as she glanced at several of her elder nieces brave in the new trinkets Santa Claus had sent them This is a story with a moral to it which the girls will understand the boys can take naps while I read for it won t interest them If it shows up the girls we shall like it answered Geoff and composed himself to hear and enjoy DAISY S JEWEL BOX AND HOW SHE FILLED IT It would be perfectly splendid and just what I long for but I don t see how I can go with nothing fit to wear said Daisy looking up from the letter in her hand with a face full of girlish eagerness and anxiety missus Field set every fear at rest with a reassuring smile as she quietly made one of the sacrifices mothers think so small when made for the dear creatures for whom they live You shall go dear I have a little sum put by for an emergency Twenty five dollars will do a good deal when tastes are simple and we do our own dressmaking But mother that was for your cloak You need it so much I can t bear to have you give it up said sober little Jane the home girl who never cared for visiting like her gay elder sister Hush dear I can do very well with a shawl over my old sack Don t say a word to spoil Daisy s pleasure She needs a change after this dull autumn and must be neat and nice Janey said no more and fell to thinking what she had to offer Daisy for both took great pride in the pretty girl who was the queen among her young friends Daisy heard but was so busy re reading the letter that she took no notice then though she recalled the words later Come and pass the holidays with us We all want to see you and Laura begs you will not disappoint her This was the invitation that came from Laura s mother for the two girls had struck up a great friendship during the summer the city family passed in the little country town where Daisy lived She had ardently hoped that Laura would not forget the charming plan and now the cordial message came just when the season would be gayest in town I suppose I must have the everlasting white muslin for a party dress as that is the cheapest thing a girl can wear A nun s veiling is what I long for but I m afraid we can t afford it she said with a sigh coming back from visions of city delights to the all important question of dress Yes you can and new ribbons gloves and slippers as well You are so small it doesn t take much and we can make it right up ourselves So run and collect all your little finery while I go and do the shopping at once You dearest of mothers how you always manage to give me what I want and smooth all my worries away I ll be as good as gold and bring you the best present I can find Daisy s grateful kiss warmed the dear woman s heart and made her forget how shabby the old sack was as she trudged away to spend the money carefully hoarded for the much needed cloak Needles and fingers flew and two days before Christmas Daisy set out for the enchanted city feeling very rich with the pretty new dress in her trunk and five dollars for pocket money It seemed a large sum to the country girl and she planned to spend it all in gifts for mother and Janey whose tired faces rather haunted her after she had caught the last glimpse of them Her reception was a warm one for all the Vaughns were interested in the blooming little creature they had found among the hills and did their best to make her visit a pleasant one The first day she was in a delightful sort of maze things were so splendid gay and new the second she felt awkward and countrified and wished she had not come A letter from her mother on Christmas morning did her good and gave her courage to bear the little trials that afflicted her My clothes do look dowdy beside Laura s elegant costumes though they did seem very nice at home but my hair isn t red and that s a comfort she said to herself as she dressed for the party that evening She could not help smiling at the bonny figure she saw in the long mirror and wishing mother and Janey could see the work of their hands in all its glory for the simple white dress was most becoming and her kind host had supplied her with lovely flowers for bosom and bouquet But the smile died as she took up her one ornament an antique necklace given her by an old aunt At home it was considered a very rare and beautiful thing and Daisy had been rather proud of her rococo chain till she saw Laura s collection of trinkets the variety and brilliancy of which dazzled her eyes and woke a burning desire to possess treasures of the same sort It was some consolation to find that the most striking were not very expensive and after poring over them with deep interest Daisy privately resolved to buy as many as her five dollars would compass These new ornaments could be worn during her visit and serve as gifts when she went home so the extravagance would not be so great as it seemed This purpose comforted her as she put on the old necklace which looked very dingy beside the Rhinestones that flashed the silver bangles that clashed and the gilded butterflies spiders arrows flowers and daggers that shone on the young girls whom she met that evening Their fine dresses she could not hope to imitate but a pin and a pair of bracelets were possible and she resolved to have them if she had to borrow money to get home with Her head was quite turned by this desire for the cheap trinkets which attract all feminine eyes now a days and when among the pretty things that came to her from the Christmas tree that night she received a blue plush jewel box she felt that it was almost a duty to fill it as soon as possible Isn t it a beauty I never had one and it is just what I wanted said Daisy delightedly lifting the tray full of satin beds for pretty things and pulling out the little drawer underneath where the giver s card lay I told papa a work box or a fan would be better but he liked this and would buy it explained Laura who knew how useless it was to her friend It was very kind of him and I prefer it to either of those I ve nothing but my old chain and a shabby little pin to put in it now but I ll fill it in time answered Daisy whose eyes seemed to behold the unbought treasures already reposing on the dainty cushion Real jewels are the best my dear for their worth and beauty are never lost The tinsel girls wear now is poor stuff and money is thrown away in buying it said missus Vaughn who overheard them and guessed the temptation which beset the little country girl Daisy looked conscious but answered with a smile and a hand on her necklace This old thing wouldn t look well in my pretty box so I ll leave it empty till I can afford something better But that antique chain is worth many mock diamonds for it is genuine and its age adds to its value Lovers of such things would pay a good price for that and keep it carefully So don t be ashamed of it my dear though this pretty throat needs no ornament added missus Vaughn hoping the girl would not forget the little lesson she was trying to give her Daisy did not but when she went to bed set the jewel box on the table where it would meet her eyes the first thing in the morning and then fell asleep trying to decide that she would buy no baubles since there were better things to spend her money on Nothing more was said but as the two girls went about the gay street on various pleasant errands Daisy never could pass the jewellers windows without stopping to gloat over the trays full of enchanting ornaments More than once when alone she went in to inquire the prices of these much coveted trifles and their cheapness made the temptation harder to resist Certain things had a sort of fascination for her and seemed to haunt her in an uncanny way giving her no peace till she would decide to buy them A golden rose with a diamond drop of dew on its leaves got into her very dreams an enamelled butterfly flew before her as she walked and a pair of silver bangles rattled in her ear like goblin castanets I shall not be safe till I spend that money so I might as well decide on something and be at peace said poor Daisy after some days of this girlish struggle I needn t buy anything for mother and Janey for I can share my nice and useful presents with them but I should like to be able to show the girls my lovely jewel box with something pretty in it and I will Laura needn t know anything about it for I m sure she d think it silly and so would her mother I ll slip in now and buy that rose it s only three dollars and the other two will get one porte bonheur or the dear butterfly Making her way through the crowd that always stood before the brilliant window Daisy went in and demanded the rose then rather scared by this reckless act she paused and decided to look farther before buying anything else With a pleasant little flutter of the heart as the pretty trinket was done up she put her hand into her pocket to pay for it and all the color died out of her cheeks when she found no purse there In vain she pulled out handkerchief keys and pincushion no sign of money was found but a ten cent piece which had fallen out at some time She looked so pale and dismayed that the shopman guessed her misfortune before she told it but all the comfort he offered was the useless information that the crowded corner was a great place for pick pockets There was nothing to be done but to return the rose and go sadly home feeling that fate was very cruel to snatch away this long coveted happiness when so nearly won Like the milk maid who upset her pail while planning which ribbons would become her best poor Daisy s dreams of splendor came to a sudden end for instead of a golden rose she was left with only ten cents and not even a purse to put it in She went home angry disappointed and ashamed but too proud to complain though not able to keep the loss to herself for it was a sad affair and her face betrayed her in spite of her efforts to be gay I know you were staring at the French diamonds in that corner store I never can get you by there without a regular tug cried Laura when the tale was very briefly told I can t help it I m perfectly fascinated by those foolish things and I know I should have bought some so it is well that I ve lost my money perhaps answered Daisy looking so innocently penitent and so frankly disappointed that mister Vaughn said kindly So it is for now I have a chance to complete my Christmas present I was not sure it would suit so I gave it empty Please use this in buying some of the fascinating things you like so well A bright ten dollar gold piece was slipped into Daisy s hand and she was obliged to keep it in spite of all her protestations that she could live without trinkets and did not need it as her ticket home was already bought missus Vaughn added a nice little purse and Laura advised her to keep the lone ten cent piece for a good luck penny Now I can do it with a free mind and fill my box as mister Vaughn wishes me to Won t it be fun thought Daisy as she skipped up stairs after dinner with a load of care lifted from her spirits Laura was taking a music lesson so her guest went to the sewing room to mend the facing of her dress which some one had stepped on while she stood in that fatal crowd A seamstress was there sewing as if for a wager and while Daisy stitched her braid she wondered if there was any need of such haste for the young woman s fingers flew a feverish color was in her cheeks and now and then she sighed as if tired or worried Let me help if you are in a hurry Miss White I can sew fast and know something of dressmaking Please let me I d love to do anything for missus Vaughn she is so kind to me said Daisy when her small job was done lingering to make the offer though an interesting book was waiting in her room Thank you I guess I can get through by dark I do want to finish for my mother is sick and needs me as well as the money answered the needle woman pausing to give the girl a grateful smile then stitching away faster than ever Then I must help Give me that sleeve to sew up and rest a little You look dreadfully tired and you ve been working all day insisted Daisy That s real kind and it would be a great help if you really like it answered Miss White with a sigh of relief as she handed over the sleeve and saw how heartily and helpfully Daisy fell to work Of course they talked for the friendly act opened both hearts and did both girls good As the younger listened to the little story of love and labor the gold piece burned in her pocket and tinsel trinkets looked very poor beside the sacrifices so sweetly made by this good daughter for the feeble mother whose comfort and support she was Our landlord has raised the rent but I can t move now for the cold and the worry would kill ma so I m tugging away to pay the extra money else he will turn us out I m afraid Why don t you tell missus Vaughn She helps every one and loves to do it So she does bless her She has done a deal for us and that s why I can t ask for more I won t beg while I can work but worry wears on me and if I break down what will become of mother Poor Mary shook the tears out of her eyes for daylight was going and she had no time to cry but Daisy stopped to wonder how it would seem to be in her place tugging away day after day to keep a roof over mother It made her heart ache to think of it and sent her hand to her pocket with a joyful sense of power for alms giving was a new pleasure and Daisy felt very rich I ve had a present to day and I d love dearly to share it with you if you wouldn t mind I shall only waste it so do let me send it to your mother in any shape you like she said in a timid but very earnest way Oh Miss Field I couldn t do it you are too kind I never thought of hinting began Mary quite overcome by this unexpected proposal Daisy settled the matter by running away to the study where mister Vaughn was napping to ask him if he would give her two fives for the gold piece Ah the fascination is at work I see and we can t wait till Monday to buy the pretty things Girls will be girls and must sow their innocent wild oats I suppose Here my dear beware of pick pockets and good luck to the shopping said the old gentleman as he put two crisp bills into her hands with a laugh Pick pockets wont get this and I know my shopping will prosper now answered Daisy in such a happy tone that mister Vaughn wondered what plan was in the girl s head to make her look so sweet and glad She went slowly up stairs looking at the two bills which did not seem half so precious as when in the shape of gold I wonder if it would be very extravagant to give her all of it I shall do some silly thing if I keep it Her boots were very thin and she coughs and if she is sick it will be dreadful Suppose I give her five for herself and five for her mother I d love to feel rich and generous for once in my life and give real help The house was very still and Daisy paused at the head of the stairs to settle the point little dreaming that missus Vaughn had heard the talk in the sewing room and saw her as she stood thoughtfully staring at the two bits of paper in her hand I shouldn t feel ashamed if missus Vaughn found me out in this but I should never dare to let her see my bangles and pins if I got them I know she thinks them silly especially so for me She said she hoped I d set a good example to Laura in the way of simplicity and industry I liked that and so will mother But then my jewel box All empty and such a pretty thing Oh dear I wish I could be wise and silly at the same time Daisy sighed and took a few more steps then smiled pulled out her purse and taking the ten cent piece tossed it up saying Heads Mary tails myself Up flew the bright little coin and down it came with the goddess of liberty uppermost That settles it she shall have the ten and I ll be content with the old chain for all my jewelry said Daisy aloud and looking much relieved she skipped away leaving the unsuspected observer to smile at her girlish mode of deciding the question and to rejoice over the generous nature unspoiled as yet She watched her young guest with new interest during the next few days for certain fine plans were in her mind and every trifle helped the decision for or against Mary White went smiling home that night to rejoice with her feeble mother over the help that came so opportunely and so kindly Daisy looked as if her shopping had prospered wonderfully though the old necklace was the only ornament she wore and those who saw her happy face at the merry making thought that she needed no other She danced as if her feet were as light as her heart and enjoyed that party more than the first for no envy spoiled her pleasure and a secret content brightened all the world to her But the next day she discovered that temptation still had power over her and she nearly spoiled her first self conquest by the fall which is very apt to come after a triumph to show us how hard it is to stand fast even when small Apollyons get in our way She broke the clasp of the necklace and missus Vaughn directed her to a person who mended such things The man examined it with interest and asked its history Daisy very willingly told all she knew inquiring if it was really valuable I d give twenty five dollars for it any time I ve been trying to get one to go with a pair of earrings I picked up and this is just what I want Of course you don t care to sell it miss he asked glancing at Daisy s simple dress and rather excited face for his offer almost took her breath away She was not sufficiently worldly wise to see that the jeweller wanted it enough to give more for it and to make a good bargain for herself Twenty five dollars seemed a vast sum and she only paused to collect her wits before she answered eagerly Yes I should like to sell it I ve had it so long I m tired of it and it s all out of fashion missus Vaughn told me some people would be glad to get it because it is genuine Do you really think it is worth twenty five dollars It s old and I shall have to tinker it up but it matches the earrings so well I am willing to pay a good price for it Will you take the money now miss or think it over and call again asked the man more respectfully after hearing missus Vaughn s name I ll take it now if you please sir I shall leave town in a day or two and may not have time to call again said Daisy taking a half regretful look at the chain as the man counted out the money Holding it fast she went away feeling that this unexpected fortune was a reward for the good use she had made of her gold piece Now I can buy some really valuable ornament and wear it without being ashamed What shall it be No tinsel for me this time and she walked by the attractive shop window with an air of lofty indifference for she really was getting over her first craze for that sort of thing Feeling as if she possessed the power to buy real diamonds Daisy turned toward the great jewellers pausing now and then to look for some pretty gift for Janey bought with her own money What can I get for mother She never will own that she needs anything and goes shabby so I can be nice I could get some of those fine thick stockings hers are all darns but they might not fit Flannel is useful but it isn t a pretty present What does she need most As Daisy stopped before a great window full of all manner of comfortable garments her eye fell on a fur lined cloak marked twenty five dollars It seemed to answer her question like a voice and as she looked at it she heard again the words But mother that money was for your cloak and you need it very much Hush dear don t say a word to spoil Daisy s pleasure I can do very well with a shawl over the old sack How could I forget that What a selfish girl I am to be thinking of jewelry when that dear good mother hasn t a cloak to her back Daisy Field I m ashamed of you Go in and buy that nice warm one at once and don t let me hear of that ridiculous box again After this little burst of remorse and self reproach Daisy took another look and prudence suggested asking the advice of some more experienced shopper than herself before making so important a purchase As if the fates were interested in settling the matter at once while she stood undecided Mary White came down the street with a parcel of work in her hands Just the person The Vaughns needn t know anything about it and Mary is a good judge It was pleasant to see the two faces brighten as the girls met rather comical to watch the deep interest with which one listened and the other explained and beautiful to hear the grateful eagerness in Mary s voice as she answered cordially Indeed I will You ve been so kind to my mother there s nothing I wouldn t be glad to do for yours So in they went and after due consideration the cloak was bought and ordered home both girls feeling that it was a little ceremony full of love and good will for Mary s time was money yet she gave it gladly and Daisy s purse was left empty of all but the good luck penny which was to bring still greater happiness in unsuspected ways Another secret was put away in the empty jewel box and the cloak hidden in Daisy s trunk for she felt shy of telling her little business transactions lest the Vaughns should consider her extravagant But the thought of mother s surprise and pleasure warmed her heart and made the last days of her visit the happiest Being a mortal girl she did give a sigh as she tied a bit of black velvet round her white throat instead of the necklace which seemed really a treasure now it was gone and she looked with great disfavor at the shabby little pin worn where she had fondly hoped to see the golden rose She put a real one in its place and never knew that her own fresh happy face was as lovely for the thought of the two mothers made comfortable by her was better than all the pearls and diamonds that fell from the lips of the good girl in the fairy tale Let me help you pack your trunk I love to cram things in and dance on the lid when it won t shut said Laura joining her friend next day just as she had got the cloak box well hidden under a layer of clothes Thank you I m almost done and rather like to fuss over my own things in my own way You won t mind if I give this pretty box of handkerchiefs to mother will you dear I have so many things I must go halves with some one The muslin apron and box of bonbons are for Janey because she can t wear the gloves and this lovely jabot is too old for her said Daisy surveying her new possessions with girlish satisfaction Do what you like with your own Mamma has a box of presents for your people She is packing it now but I don t believe you can get it in your trunk is so much fuller than when you came This must go in a safe place or your heart will break and Laura took up the jewel box adding with a laugh as she opened it you haven t filled it after all What did you do with papa s gold piece That s a secret I ll tell some day but not yet said Daisy diving into her trunk to hide the color in her cheeks Sly thing I know you ve got silver spiders and filagree racquets and Rhine stone moons and stars stowed away somewhere and won t confess it I wanted to fill this box but mamma said you d do it better yourself so I let it alone but I was afraid you d think I was a selfish pig to have a pin for every day in the month and never give you one said Laura as she looked at the single tarnished brooch reposing on the satin cushion Where s your chain she added before Daisy could speak It is safe enough I m tired of it and don t care if I never see it again And Daisy packed away and laughed as she smoothed the white dress in its tray remembering that it was paid for by the sale of the old necklace Give it to me then I like it immensely it s so odd I ll exchange for anything of mine you choose Will you asked Laura who seemed bent on asking inconvenient questions I shall have to tell or she will think me very ungrateful and Daisy felt a pang of regret even then for Laura s offer was a generous one Like G W I cannot tell a lie so I must fess that I sold the old thing and spent the money for something I wanted very much not jewelry but something to give away Daisy was spared further confessions by the entrance of missus Vaughn with a box in her hand I have room for something more Give me that Laura it will just fit in and taking the little casket she added Mary White wants to try on your dress dear Go at once I will help Daisy Laura went and her mother stood looking down at the kneeling girl with an expression of affectionate satisfaction which would have puzzled Daisy had she seen it Has the visit been a pleasant one my dear Oh very I can t thank you enough for the good it has done me I hope I can pay a little of the debt next summer if you come our way again cried Daisy looking up with a face full of gratitude We shall probably go to Europe for the summer Laura is a good age for it now and we shall all enjoy it How splendid We shall miss you dreadfully but I m glad you are going and I hope Laura will find time to write me now and then I shall want to know how she likes the foreign parts we ve talked about so much You shall know We won t forget you my dear and with a caressing touch on the smiling yet wistful face upturned to hers missus Vaughn went away to pack the empty jewel box leaving Daisy to drop a few irrepressible tears on the new gown over the downfall of her summer hopes and the longings all girls feel for that enchanted world that lies beyond the sea We shall see you before we go so we won t gush now said Laura as she bade her friend good by adding in a whisper Some folks can have secrets as well as other folks and be as sly So don t think you have all the fun to yourself you dear good generous darling Daisy looked bewildered and missus Vaughn added to her surprise by kissing her very warmly as she said I wanted to find a good friend for my spoiled girl and I think I have succeeded There was no time for explanation and all the way home Daisy kept wondering what they meant But she forgot everything when she saw the dear faces beaming at the door and ran straight into her mother s arms while Janey hugged the trunk till her turn came for something better When the first raptures were over out came the cloak and Daisy was well repaid for her little trials and sacrifices when she was folded in it as her mother held her close and thanked her as mothers only can Sitting in its soft shelter she told all about it and coming to the end said as she took up the jewel box unpacked with the other generous gifts I haven t a thing to put in it but I shall value it because it taught me a lesson which I hope I never shall forget See what a pretty thing it is and opening it Daisy gave a cry of surprise and joy for there lay the golden rose with Laura s name and Sub rosa on a slip of paper The dear thing she knew I wanted it and that is what she meant by secrets I ll write and tell her mine to morrow Here is something more said Janey who had been lifting the tray while her sister examined the long desired flower A pair of real gold bangles shone before her delighted eyes and a card in mister Vaughn s handwriting bore these words Handcuffs for the thief who stole the pocketbook Daisy hardly had time to laugh gayly at the old gentleman s joke when Janey cried out as she opened the little drawer Here s another It was a note from missus Vaughn but all thought it the greatest treasure of the three for it said briefly DEAR DAISY Mary told me some of your secrets and I found out the others Forgive me and go to Europe with Laura in May Your visit was a little test You stood it well and we want to know more of you The little box is not quite empty but the best jewels are the self denial sweet charity and good sense you put in yourself Your friend A V Daisy could not speak and her mother looked into the box with eyes full of tender tears while Janey danced about them clashing the bangles like a happy little bayadere till her sister found her voice again Pointing to a great bright tear that shone on the blue velvet she said with her cheek against her mother s I always wanted a real diamond and there s a more precious one than any I could buy Now I m sure my jewel box is full Illustration CORNY S CATAMOUNT Two boys sat on the bars one whittling the other whistling not for want of thought by any means for his brow

7416_103126_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 That ain t just square but it s not my funeral so I won t meddle Hope you ll have first rate sport and bag a brace of cats 
7416_103126_000020_000001	train-clean-360	One thing you mind don t get too nigh before you fire and keep out of sight of the critters as much as you can 
none	none	Chris spoke in a deep whisper looking so excited and impressed by the reckless courage of his mate that Corny felt himself a Leatherstocking and went off to tea with his finger on his lips full of boyish faith in his own powers 
7416_103126_000021_000001	train-clean-360	If he had seen Chris dart behind the barn and there roll upon the grass in convulsions of laughter he would have been both surprised and hurt 
7416_103126_000022_000000	train-clean-360	No deacon could have been more sober however than Chris when they met next morning while the party of summer boarders at the old farm house were in a pleasant bustle of preparation for the long expected day on the mountain 
7416_103126_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Three merry girls a pair of small boys two amiable mammas Chris and Corny made up the party with Abner to drive the big wagon drawn by Milk and Molasses the yellow span 
7416_103126_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 All aboard shouted our young Nimrod in a hurry to be off as the lunch basket was handed up and the small boys packed in the most uncomfortable corners regardless of their arms and legs 
7416_103126_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Away they rattled with a parting cheer and peace fell upon the farm house for a few hours to the great contentment of the good people left behind 
7416_103126_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Corny s mother was one of them and her last words were A pleasant day dear 
7416_103126_000024_000002	train-clean-360	I wish you d leave that gun at home I m so afraid you ll get hurt with it 
7416_103126_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 No fun without it 
7416_103126_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Don t worry mammy I m old enough to take care of myself 
none	none	I ll see to him ma am called Chris as he hung on behind and waved his old straw hat with a steady reliable sort of look that made the anxious lady feel more comfortable
7416_103126_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 We are going to walk up and leave the horses to rest so I can choose my time 
7416_103126_000027_000001	train-clean-360	See I ve got a bottle of cold tea in this pocket and a lot of grub in the other 
7416_103126_000027_000002	train-clean-360	No danger of my starving is there whispered Corny as he leaned over to Chris who sat apparently on nothing with his long legs dangling into space 
none	none	Shouldn t wonder if you needed every mite of it 
7416_103126_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Hunting is mighty hard work on a hot day and this is going to be a blazer answered Chris pulling his big straw hat lower over his eyes 
none	none	As we intend to follow Corny s adventures we need not pause to describe the drive which was a merry one with girls chattering mammas holding on to excited small boys in danger of flying out at every jolt Abner joking till every one roared Corny s dangerous evolutions with the beloved gun and the gymnastic feats Chris performed jumping off to pick flowers for the ladies and getting on again while Milk and Molasses tore up and down the rough road as if they enjoyed it About ten o clock they reached the foot of the mountain and after a short rest at the hotel began the three mile ascent in high spirits Abner was to follow later with the wagon to bring the party down so Chris was guide as he knew the way well and often came with people The girls and younger boys hurried on full of eagerness to reach the top 
7416_103126_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The ladies went more slowly enjoying the grand beauty of the scene while Chris carried the lunch basket and Corny lingered in the rear waiting for a good chance to plunge 
none	none	He wanted to be off before Abner came as he well knew that wise man and mighty hunter would never let him go alone
7416_103126_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 The very next path I see I ll dive in and run Chris can t leave the rest to follow and if I once get a good start they won t catch me in a hurry thought the boy longing to be free and alone in the wild woods that tempted him on either hand 
none	none	Just as he was tightening his belt to be ready for the run missus Barker the stout lady called him and being a well bred lad he hastened at once to see what she wanted feeling that he was the only gentleman in the party Give me your arm dear I m getting very tired and fear I can t hold out to the top without a little help said the poor lady red and panting with the heat and steepness of the road
7416_103126_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly ma am answered Corny obeying at once and inwardly resolving to deposit his fair burden on the first fallen log they came to and make his escape 
7416_103126_000036_000000	train-clean-360	But missus Barker got on bravely with the support of his strong arm and chatted away so delightfully that Corny would really have enjoyed the walk if his soul had not been yearning for catamounts 
7416_103126_000036_000001	train-clean-360	He did his best but when they passed opening after opening into the green recesses of the wood and the granite boulders grew more and more plentiful his patience gave out and he began to plan what he could say to excuse himself 
none	none	Chris was behind apparently deaf and blind to his calls and imploring glances though he grinned cheerfully when poor Corny looked round and beckoned as well as he could with a gun on one arm and a stout lady on the other
7416_103126_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 The hardest part is coming now and we d better rest a moment 
7416_103126_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Here s a nice rock and the last spring we are likely to see till we get to the top 
7416_103126_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Come on Chris and give us the dipper 
7416_103126_000037_000003	train-clean-360	missus Barker wants a drink and so do I called the young hunter driven to despair at last 
none	none	Up came Chris and while he rummaged in the well packed basket Corny slipped into the wood leaving the good lady with her thanks half spoken sitting on a warm stone beside a muddy little pool A loud laugh followed him as he scrambled through the tall ferns and went plunging down the steep mountain side eager to reach the lower woods Let him laugh it will be my turn when I go home with a fine cat over my shoulder thought Corny tearing along heedless of falls scratches and bruised knees At length he paused for breath and looked about him well satisfied for the spot was lonely and lovely enough to suit any hunter The tallest pines he ever saw sighed far overhead the ground was ankle deep in moss and gay with scarlet bunch berries every fallen log was veiled by sweet scented Linnea green vines or nodding brakes while hidden brooks sang musically and the air was full of the soft flutter of leaves the whir of wings the sound of birds gossiping sweetly in the safe shelter of the forest where human feet so seldom came
7416_103126_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll rest a bit and then go along down keeping a look out for puss by the way thought Corny feeling safe and free and very happy for he had his own way at last and a whole day to lead the life he loved 
7416_103126_000042_000000	train-clean-360	So he bathed his hot face took a cool drink and lay on the moss staring up into the green gloom of the pines blissfully dreaming of the joys of a hunter s life till a peculiar cry startled him to his feet and sent him creeping warily toward the sound 
none	none	Whether it was a new kind of bird or a fox or a bear he did not know but fondly hoped it was a wildcat though he was well aware that the latter creature sleeps by day and prowls by night 
7416_103126_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Abner said they purred and snarled and gave a mewing sort of cry but which it was now he could not tell having unfortunately been half asleep 
7416_103126_000043_000000	train-clean-360	On he went looking up into the trees for a furry bunch behind every log and in every rocky hole longing and hoping to discover his heart s desire 
7416_103126_000043_000001	train-clean-360	But a hawk was all he saw above an ugly snake was the only living thing he found among the logs and a fat woodchuck s hind legs vanished down the most attractive hole 
7416_103126_000043_000002	train-clean-360	He shot at all three and missed them so pushed on pretending that he did not care for such small game 
none	none	Now this is what I call fun he said to himself tramping gayly along and at that moment went splash into a mud hole concealed under the grass 
7416_103126_000044_000001	train-clean-360	He sunk up to his knees and with great difficulty got out by clinging to the tussocks that grew near 
7416_103126_000044_000002	train-clean-360	In his struggles the lunch was lost for the bottle broke and the pocket where the sandwiches were stored was full of mud 
none	none	A woful spectacle was the trim lad as he emerged from the slough black and dripping in front well spattered behind hatless and one shoe gone having been carelessly left unlaced in the ardor of the chase
7416_103126_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Here s a mess thought poor Corny surveying himself with great disgust and feeling very helpless as well as tired hungry and mad Luckily my powder is dry and my gun safe so my fun isn t spoiled though I do look like a wallowing pig 
none	none	I ve heard of mud baths but I never took one before and I ll be shot if I do again 
7416_103126_000046_000000	train-clean-360	So he washed as well as he could hoping the sun would dry him picked out a few bits of bread unspoiled by the general wreck and trudged on with less ardor though by no means discouraged yet 
7416_103126_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I m too high for any game but birds and those I don t want 
7416_103126_000047_000001	train-clean-360	I ll go slap down and come out in the valley 
7416_103126_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Abner said any brook would show the way and this rascal that led me into a scrape shall lead me out he said as he followed the little stream that went tumbling over the stones that increased as the ground sloped toward the deep ravine where a waterfall shone like silver in the sun 
none	none	I ll take a bath if the pool is big enough and that will set me up Shouldn t wonder if I d got poisoned a bit with some of these vines I ve been tearing through 
7416_103126_000048_000001	train-clean-360	My hands smart like fury and I guess the mosquitoes have about eaten my face up 
7416_103126_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Never saw such clouds of stingers before said Corny looking at his scratched hands and rubbing his hot face in great discomfort for it was the gnat that drove the lion mad you remember 
7416_103126_000049_000000	train-clean-360	It was easy to say I ll follow the brook but not so easy to do it for the frolicsome stream went headlong over rocks crept under fallen logs and now and then hid itself so cleverly that one had to look and listen carefully to recover the trail 
7416_103126_000049_000001	train-clean-360	It was long past noon when Corny came out near the waterfall so tired and hungry that he heartily wished himself back among the party who had lunched well and were now probably driving gayly homeward to a good supper 
7416_103126_000050_000000	train-clean-360	No chance for a bath appeared so he washed his burning face and took a rest enjoying the splendid view far over valley and intervale through the gap in the mountain range 
7416_103126_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He was desperately tired with these hours of rough travel and very hungry but would not own it and sat considering what to do next for he saw by the sun that the afternoon was half over 
7416_103126_000050_000002	train-clean-360	There was time to go back the way he had come and by following the path down the hill he could reach the hotel and get supper and a bed or be driven home 
7416_103126_000050_000003	train-clean-360	That was the wise thing to do but his pride rebelled against returning empty handed after all his plans and boasts of great exploits 
7416_103126_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I won t go home to be laughed at by Chris and Abner 
7416_103126_000051_000001	train-clean-360	I ll shoot something if I stay all night 
7416_103126_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Who cares for hunger and mosquito bites Not I Hunters can bear more than that I guess 
7416_103126_000051_000003	train-clean-360	The next live thing I see I ll shoot it and make a fire and have a jolly supper 
7416_103126_000051_000004	train-clean-360	Now which way will I go up or down 
7416_103126_000051_000005	train-clean-360	A pretty hard prospect either way 
7416_103126_000052_000000	train-clean-360	The sight of an eagle soaring above him seemed to answer his question and fill him with new strength and ardor 
7416_103126_000052_000001	train-clean-360	To shoot the king of birds and take him home in triumph would cover the hunter with glory 
7416_103126_000052_000002	train-clean-360	It should be done 
7416_103126_000052_000003	train-clean-360	And away he went climbing tumbling leaping from rock to rock toward the place where the eagle had alighted 
7416_103126_000052_000004	train-clean-360	More cuts and bruises more vain shots and all the reward of his eager struggles was a single feather that floated down as the great bird soared serenely away leaving the boy exhausted and disappointed in a wilderness of granite boulders with no sign of a path to show the way out 
none	none	As he leaned breathless and weary against the crag where he had fondly hoped to find the eagle s nest he realized for the first time what a fool hardy thing he had done 
7416_103126_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Here he was alone without a guide in this wild region where there was neither food nor shelter and night coming on 
7416_103126_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Utterly used up he could not get home now if he had known the way and suddenly all the tales he had ever heard of men lost in the mountains came into his head 
none	none	If he had not been weak with hunger he would have felt better able to bear it but his legs trembled under him his head ached with the glare of the sun and a queer faintness came over him now and then for the city lad was unused to such violent exercise plucky as he was
7416_103126_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 The only thing to do now is to get down to the valley if I can before dark 
7416_103126_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Abner said there was an old cabin where the hunters used to sleep somewhere round that way 
7416_103126_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I can try for it and perhaps shoot something on the way 
7416_103126_000054_000003	train-clean-360	May break my bones but I can t sit and starve up here and I was a fool to come 
7416_103126_000054_000004	train-clean-360	I ll keep the feather anyway to prove that I really saw an eagle that s better than nothing 
none	none	Still bravely trying to affect the indifference to danger and fatigue which hunters are always described as possessing in such a remarkable degree Corny slung the useless gun on his back and began the steep descent discovering now the perils he had been too eager to see before He was a good climber but was stiff with weariness and his hands already sore with scratches and poison so he went slowly feeling quite unfit for such hard work 
7416_103126_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Coming to the ravine he found the only road was down its precipitous side to the valley that looked so safe and pleasant now 
7416_103126_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Stunted pines grew in the fissures of the rocks and their strong roots helped the clinging hands and feet as the boy painfully climbed slipped and swung along fearing every minute to come to some impassable barrier in the dangerous path 
7416_103126_000056_000000	train-clean-360	But he got on wonderfully well and was feeling much encouraged when his foot slipped the root he held gave way and down he went rolling and bumping to his death on the rocks below he thought as a crash came and he knew no more 
none	none	Wonder if I m dead was the first idea that occurred to him as he opened his eyes and saw a brilliant sky above him all purple gold and red 
7416_103126_000058_000000	train-clean-360	He seemed floating in the air for he swayed to and fro on a soft bed a pleasant murmur reached his ear and when he looked down he saw what looked like clouds misty and white below him 
7416_103126_000058_000001	train-clean-360	He lay a few minutes drowsily musing for the fall had stunned him then as he moved his hand something pricked it and he felt pine needles in the fingers that closed over them 
7416_103126_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Caught in a tree by Jupiter and all visions of heaven vanished in a breath as he sat up and stared about him wide awake now and conscious of many aching bones 
7416_103126_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Yes there he lay among the branches of one of the sturdy pines into which he had fallen on his way down the precipice 
7416_103126_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Blessed little tree set there to save a life and teach a lesson to a wilful young heart that never forgot that hour 
7416_103126_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Holding fast lest a rash motion should set him bounding further down like a living ball Corny took an observation as rapidly as possible for the red light was fading and the mist rising from the valley 
7416_103126_000061_000001	train-clean-360	All he could see was a narrow ledge where the tree stood and anxious to reach a safer bed for the night he climbed cautiously down to drop on the rock so full of gratitude for safety that he could only lie quite still for a little while thinking of mother and trying not to cry 
7416_103126_000062_000000	train-clean-360	He was much shaken by the fall his flesh bruised his clothes torn and his spirit cowed for hunger weariness pain and danger showed him what a very feeble creature he was after all 
7416_103126_000062_000001	train-clean-360	He could do no more till morning and resigned himself to a night on the mountain side glad to be there alive though doubtful what daylight would show him 
7416_103126_000062_000002	train-clean-360	Too tired to move he lay watching the western sky where the sun set gloriously behind the purple hills 
7416_103126_000062_000003	train-clean-360	All below was wrapped in mist and not a sound reached him but the sigh of the pine and the murmur of the waterfall 
7416_103126_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 This is a first class scrape 
none	none	What a fool I was not to go back when I could instead of blundering down here where no one can get at me and as like as not I can t get out alone 
7416_103126_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Gun smashed in that confounded fall so I can t even fire a shot to call help 
7416_103126_000063_000003	train-clean-360	Nothing to eat or drink and very likely a day or so to spend here till I m found if I ever am Chris said Yell if you want us Much good that would do now 
7416_103126_000063_000004	train-clean-360	I ll try though And getting up on his weary legs Corny shouted till he was hoarse but echo alone answered him and after a few efforts he gave it up trying to accept the situation like a man 
none	none	As if kind Nature took pity on the poor boy the little ledge was soft with lichens and thin grass and here and there grew a sprig of checkerberry sown by the wind sheltered by the tree and nourished by the moisture that trickled down the rock from some hidden spring Eagerly Corny ate the sweet leaves to stay the pangs of hunger that gnawed him and finished his meal with grass and pine needles calling himself a calf and wishing his pasture were wider
7416_103126_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 The fellows we read about always come to grief in a place where they can shoot a bird catch a fish or knock over some handy beast for supper he said talking to himself for company 
7416_103126_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 Even the old chap lost in the bush in Australia had a savage with him who dug a hole in a tree and pulled out a nice fat worm to eat 
7416_103126_000064_000002	train-clean-360	I m not lucky enough even to find a sassafras bush to chew or a bird s egg to suck 
none	none	My poor gun is broken or I might bang away at a hawk and cook him for supper if the bog didn t spoil my matches as it did my lunch Oh well 
7416_103126_000064_000005	train-clean-360	I ll pull through I guess and when it s all over it will be a jolly good story to tell 
7416_103126_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Then hoping to forget his woes in sleep he nestled under the low growing branches of the pine and lay blinking drowsily at the twilight world outside 
7416_103126_000065_000001	train-clean-360	A dream came and he saw the old farm house in sad confusion caused by his absence the women crying the men sober all anxious and all making ready to come and look for him 
7416_103126_000065_000002	train-clean-360	So vivid was it that he woke himself by crying out Here I am and nearly went over the ledge stretching out his arms to Abner 
7416_103126_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The start and the scare made it hard to go to sleep again and he sat looking at the solemn sky full of stars that seemed watching over him alone there like a poor lost child on the great mountain s stony breast 
none	none	He had never seen the world at that hour before and it made a deep impression on him for it was a vast wild scene full of gloomy shadows below unknown dangers around and a new sense of utter littleness and helplessness which taught the boy human dependence upon Heavenly love as no words even from his mother s tender lips could have done Thoughts of the suffering his wilfulness had given her wrung a few penitent tears from him which he was not ashamed to shed since only the kind stars saw them and better still he resolved to own the fault to atone for it and to learn wisdom from this lesson which might yet prove to be a very bitter one He felt better after this little breakdown and presently his thoughts were turned from conscience to catamounts again for sounds in the woods below led him to believe that the much desired animal was on the prowl His excited fancy painted dozens of them not far away waiting to be shot and there he was cooped up on that narrow ledge with a broken gun unable even to get a look at them He felt that it was a just punishment and after the first regret tried to comfort himself with the fact that he was much safer where he was than alone in the forest at that hour for various nocturnal voices suggested restless and dangerous neighbors Presently his wakeful eyes saw lights twinkling far off on the opposite side of the ravine and he imagined he heard shouts and shots 
7416_103126_000068_000001	train-clean-360	But the splash of the waterfall and the rush of the night wind deadened the sounds to his ear and drowned his own reply 
none	none	They are looking for me and will never think of this strange place 
7416_103126_000069_000001	train-clean-360	I can t make them hear and must wait till morning 
7416_103126_000069_000002	train-clean-360	Poor Chris will get an awful scolding for letting me go 
7416_103126_000069_000003	train-clean-360	Don t believe he told a word till he had to 
7416_103126_000069_000004	train-clean-360	I ll make it up to him 
7416_103126_000069_000005	train-clean-360	Chris is a capital fellow and I just wish I had him here to make things jolly thought the lonely lad 
none	none	But soon the lights vanished the sounds died away and the silence of midnight brooded over the hills seldom broken except by the soft cry of an owl the rustle of the pine or a louder gust of wind as it grew strong and cold 
7416_103126_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Corny kept awake as long as he could fearing to dream and fall but by and by he dropped off and slept soundly till the chill of dawn waked him 
none	none	At any other time he would have heartily enjoyed the splendor of the eastern sky as the red glow spread and brightened till the sun came dazzling through the gorge making the wild solitude beautiful and grand Now however he would have given it all for a hot beefsteak and a cup of coffee as he wet his lips with a few drops of ice cold water and browsed over his small pasture till not a green spire remained 
7416_103126_000072_000001	train-clean-360	He was stiff and full of pain but daylight and the hope of escape cheered him up and gave him coolness and courage to see how best he could accomplish his end 
none	none	The wind soon blew away the mist and let him see that the dry bed of a stream lay just below 
7416_103126_000073_000001	train-clean-360	To reach it he must leap at risk of his bones or find some means to swing down ten or twelve feet 
7416_103126_000073_000002	train-clean-360	Once there it was pretty certain that by following the rough road he would come into the valley from whence he could easily find his way home 
none	none	Much elated at this unexpected good fortune he took the strap that had slung his gun the leathern belt about his waist and the strong cords of his pouch and knotting them together made a rope long enough to let him drop within two or three feet of the stones below 
7416_103126_000073_000004	train-clean-360	This he fastened firmly round the trunk of the pine and finished his preparations by tying his handkerchief to one of the branches that it might serve as a guide for him a signal for others and a trophy of his grand fall 
7416_103126_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Then putting a little sprig of the evergreen tree in his jacket with a grateful thought of all it had done for him he swung himself off and landed safely below not minding a few extra bumps after his late exploits at tumbling 
7416_103126_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Feeling like a prisoner set free he hurried as fast as bare feet and stiff legs would carry him along the bed of the stream coming at last into the welcome shelter of the woods which seemed more beautiful than ever after the bleak region of granite in which he had been all night 
7416_103126_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Anxious to report himself alive and relieve his mother s anxiety he pressed on till he struck the path and soon saw not far away the old cabin Abner had spoken of 
7416_103126_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Just before this happy moment he had heard a shot fired somewhere in the forest and as he hurried toward the sound he saw an animal dart into the hut as if for shelter 
7416_103126_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Whether it was a rabbit woodchuck or dog he had not seen as a turn in the path prevented a clear view and hoping it was old Buff looking for him he ran in to find himself face to face with a catamount at last 
7416_103126_000078_000000	train-clean-360	There she was the big fierce cat crouched in a corner with fiery eyes growling and spitting at sight of an enemy but too badly wounded to fight as the blood that dripped from her neck and the tremble of her limbs plainly showed 
7416_103126_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Now s my chance 
7416_103126_000079_000001	train-clean-360	Don t care who shot her I ll kill her and have her too if I pay my last dollar thought Corny and catching up a stout bit of timber fallen from the old roof he struck one quick blow which finished poor puss who gave up the ghost with a savage snarl and a vain effort to pounce on him 
none	none	This splendid piece of good luck atoned for all the boy had gone through and only waiting to be sure the beast was quite dead and past clawing he flung his prize over his shoulder and with renewed strength and spirit trudged along the woodland road toward home proudly imagining his triumphal entry upon the scene of suspense and alarm
7416_103126_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Wish I didn t look so like a scare crow but perhaps my rags will add to the effect 
7416_103126_000081_000001	train-clean-360	Won t the girls laugh at my swelled face and scream at the cat 
7416_103126_000081_000002	train-clean-360	Poor mammy will mourn over me and coddle me up as if I d been to the wars 
7416_103126_000081_000003	train-clean-360	Hope some house isn t very far off for I don t believe I can lug this brute much farther I m so starved and shaky 
7416_103126_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Just as he paused to take breath and shift his burden from one shoulder to the other a loud shout startled him and a moment after several men came bursting through the wood cheering like lunatics as they approached 
7416_103126_000083_000000	train-clean-360	It was Abner Chris and some of the neighbors setting out again on their search after a night of vain wandering 
7416_103126_000083_000001	train-clean-360	Corny could have hugged them all and cried like a girl but pride kept him steady though his face showed his joy as he nodded his hatless head with a cool 
none	none	Hullo Chris burst into his ringing laugh and danced a wild sort of jig round his mate as the only way in which he could fitly express his relief for he had been so bowed down with remorse at his imprudence in letting Corny go that no one could find the heart to blame him and all night the poor lad had rushed up and down seeking calling hoping and fearing till he was about used up and looked nearly as dilapidated as Corny 
7416_103126_000086_000000	train-clean-360	The tale was soon told and received with the most flattering signs of interest wonder sympathy and admiration 
none	none	Why in thunder didn t you tell me and I d a got up a hunt wuth havin not go stramashing off alone on a wild goose chase like this Never did see such a chap as you be for gittin inter scrapes and out of em too I m bound to own growled Abner
7416_103126_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 That isn t a wild goose is it proudly demanded Corny pointing to the cat which now lay on the ground while he leaned against a tree to hide his weariness for he felt ready to drop now all the excitement was over 
none	none	No it ain t and I congratulate you on a good job 
7416_103126_000089_000001	train-clean-360	Where did you shoot her asked Abner stooping to examine the creature 
7416_103126_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t shoot her broke my gun when I took that header down the mountain 
7416_103126_000090_000001	train-clean-360	I hit her a rap with a club in the cabin where I found her answered Corny heartily wishing he need not share the prize with any one 
7416_103126_000090_000002	train-clean-360	But he was honest and added at once Some one else had put a bullet into her I only finished her off 
7416_103126_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Chris did it he fired a spell back and see the critter run but we was too keen after you to stop for any other game 
7416_103126_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Guess you ve had enough of catamounts for one spell hey and Abner laughed as he looked at poor Corny who was a more sorry spectacle than he knew ragged and rough hatless and shoeless his face red and swelled with the poisoning and bites his eyes heavy with weariness and in his mouth a bit of wild cherry bark which he chewed ravenously 
7416_103126_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 No I haven t 
none	none	I want this one and will buy it if Chris will let me 
7416_103126_000092_000002	train-clean-360	I said I d kill one and I did and want to keep the skin for I ought to have something to show after all this knocking about and turning somersaults half a mile long answered Corny stoutly as he tried to shoulder his load again 
7416_103126_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Here give me the varmint and you hang on to Chris my boy or we ll have to cart you home 
none	none	You ve done first rate and now you want a good meal of vittles to set you up 
7416_103126_000093_000002	train-clean-360	Right about face neighbors and home we go to the tune of Hail Columby 
7416_103126_000094_000000	train-clean-360	As Abner spoke the procession set forth 
none	none	The tall jolly man with the dead animal at his back went first then Corny trying not to lean on the arm Chris put round him but very glad of the support next the good farmers all talking at once while old Buff soberly brought up the rear with his eye on the wildcat well knowing that he would have a fine feast when the handsome skin was off 
7416_103126_000095_000000	train-clean-360	In this order they reached home and Corny tumbled into his mother s arms to be no more seen for some hours 
none	none	What went on in her room no one knows but when at last the hero emerged refreshed by sleep and food clad in clean clothes his wounds bound up and plantain leaves dipped in cream spread upon his afflicted countenance he received the praises and congratulations showered upon him very meekly 
7416_103126_000095_000002	train-clean-360	He made no more boasts of skill and courage that summer set out on no more wild hunts and gave up his own wishes so cheerfully that it was evident something had worked a helpful change in wilful Corny 
7416_103126_000096_000000	train-clean-360	He liked to tell the story of that day and night when his friends were recounting adventures by sea and land but he never said much about the hours on the ledge always owned that Chris shot the beast and usually ended by sagely advising his hearers to let their mothers know when they went off on a lark of that kind 
none	none	Those who knew and loved him best observed that he was fonder than ever of nibbling checkerberry leaves that he didn t mind being laughed at for liking to wear a bit of pine in his buttonhole and that the skin of the catamount so hardly won lay before his study table till the moths ate it up Illustration THE COOKING CLASS A young girl in a little cap and a big apron sat poring over a cook book with a face full of the deepest anxiety She had the kitchen to herself for mamma was out for the day cook was off duty and Edith could mess to her heart s content She belonged to a cooking class the members of which were to have a lunch at two P M with the girl next door and now the all absorbing question was what to make Turning the pages of the well used book she talked to herself as the various receipts met her eye Lobster salad and chicken croquettes I ve had and neither were very good Now I want to distinguish myself by something very nice I d try a meat porcupine or a mutton duck if there was time but they are fussy and ought to be rehearsed before given to the class Bavarian cream needs berries and whipped cream and I won t tire my arms beating eggs Apricots a la Neige is an easy thing and wholesome but the girls won t like it I know as well as some rich thing that will make them ill as Carrie s plum pudding did A little meat dish is best for lunch I d try sweetbreads and bacon if I didn t hate to burn my face and scent my clothes frying Birds are elegant let me see if I can do larded grouse No I don t like to touch that cold fat stuff How mortified Ella was when she had birds on toast and forgot to draw them I shouldn t make such a blunder as that I do hope Potted pigeons the very thing Had that in our last lesson but the girls are all crazy about puff paste so they won t try pigeons Why didn t I think of it at once for we ve got them in the house and don t want them to day mamma being called away All ready too so nice I do detest to pick and clean birds Simmer from one to three hours Plenty of time I ll do it I ll do it La la la And away skipped Edith in high spirits for she did not love to cook yet wished to stand well with the class some members of which were very ambitious and now and then succeeded with an elaborate dish more by good luck than skill Six plump birds were laid out on a platter with their legs folded in the most pathetic manner these Edith bore away in triumph to the kitchen and opening the book before her went to work energetically resigning herself to frying the pork and cutting up the onion which she had overlooked when hastily reading the receipt In time they were stuffed the legs tied down to the tails the birds browned in the stew pan and put to simmer with a pinch of herbs Now I can clear up and rest a bit If I ever have to work for a living I won t be a cook said Edith with a sigh of weariness as she washed her dishes wondering how there could be so many for no careless Irish girl would have made a greater clutter over this small job than the young lady who had not yet learned one of the most important things that a cook should know The bell rang just as she got done and was planning to lie and rest on the dining room sofa till it was time to take up her pigeons Tell whoever it is that I m engaged she whispered as the maid passed on her way to the door It s your cousin miss from the country and she has a trunk with her Of course she s to come in asked Maria coming back in a moment Oh dear me I forgot all about Patty Mamma said any day this week and this is the most inconvenient one of the seven Of course she must come in Go and tell her I ll be there in a minute answered Edith too well bred not to give even an unwelcome guest a kindly greeting Whisking off cap and apron and taking a last look at the birds just beginning to send forth a savory steam she went to meet her cousin Patty was a rosy country lass of sixteen plainly dressed and rather shy but a sweet sensible little body with a fresh rustic air which marked her for a field flower at once How do you do dear so sorry mamma is away called to a sick friend in a hurry But I m here and glad to see you I ve an engagement at two and you shall go with me It s only a lunch close by just a party of girls I ll tell you about it upstairs Chatting away Edith led Patty up to the pretty room ready for her and soon both were laughing over a lively account of the exploits of the cooking class Suddenly in the midst of the cream pie which had been her great success and nearly the death of all who partook thereof Edith paused sniffed the air like a hound and crying tragically They are burning They are burning rushed down stairs as if the house was on fire Much alarmed Patty hurried after her guided to the kitchen by the sound of lamentation There she found Edith hanging over a stew pan with anguish in her face and despair in her voice as she breathlessly explained the cause of her flight My pigeons Are they burnt Do smell and tell me After all my trouble I shall be heart broken if they are spoilt Both pretty noses sniffed and sniffed again as the girls bent over the pan regardless of the steam which was ruining their crimps and reddening their noses Reluctantly Patty owned that a slight flavor of scorch did pervade the air but suggested that a touch more seasoning would conceal the sad fact I ll try it Did you ever do any Do you love to cook Don t you want to make something to carry It would please the girls and make up for my burnt mess said Edith as she skimmed the broth and added pepper and salt with a lavish hand I don t know anything about pigeons except to feed and pet them We don t eat ours I can cook plain dishes and make all kinds of bread Would biscuit or tea cake do Patty looked so pleased at the idea of contributing to the feast that Edith could not bear to tell her that hot biscuit and tea cake were not just the thing for a city lunch She accepted the offer and Patty fell to work so neatly and skilfully that by the time the pigeons were done two pans full of delicious little biscuit were baked and folded in a nice napkin lay ready to carry off in the porcelain plate with a wreath of roses painted on it In spite of all her flavoring the burnt odor and taste still lingered round Edith s dish but fondly hoping no one would perceive it she dressed hastily gave Patty a touch here and there and set forth at the appointed time to Augusta s lunch Six girls belonged to this class and the rule was for each to bring her contribution and set it on the table prepared to receive them all then when the number was complete the covers were raised the dishes examined eaten if possible and pronounced upon the prize being awarded to the best The girl at whose house the lunch was given provided the prize and they were often both pretty and valuable On this occasion a splendid bouquet of Jaqueminot roses in a lovely vase ornamented the middle of the table and the eyes of all rested admiringly upon it as the seven girls gathered round after depositing their dishes Patty had been kindly welcomed and soon forgot her shyness in wonder at the handsome dresses graceful manners and lively gossip of the girls A pleasant merry set all wearing the uniform of the class dainty white aprons and coquettish caps with many colored ribbons like stage maid servants At the sound of a silver bell each took her place before the covered dish which bore her name and when Augusta said Ladies we will begin off went napkins silver covers white paper or whatever hid the contribution from longing eyes A moment of deep silence while quick glances took in the prospect and then a unanimous explosion of laughter followed for six platters of potted pigeons stood upon the board with nothing but the flowers to break the ludicrous monotony of the scene How they laughed for a time they could do nothing else because if one tried to explain she broke down and joined in the gale of merriment again quite helplessly One or two got hysterical and cried as well as laughed and all made such a noise that Augusta s mamma peeped in to see what was the matter Six agitated hands pointed to the comical sight on the table which looked as if a flight of potted pigeons had alighted there and six breathless voices cried in a chorus Isn t it funny Don t tell Much amused the good lady retired to enjoy the joke alone while the exhausted girls wiped their eyes and began to talk all at once Such a clatter but out of it all Patty evolved the fact that each meant to surprise the rest and they certainly had I tried puff paste said Augusta fanning her hot face So did I cried the others And it was a dead failure So was mine echoed the voices Then I thought I d do the other dish we had that day Just what I did Feeling sure you would all try the pastry and perhaps get on better than I Exactly our case and a fresh laugh ended this general confession Now we must eat our pigeons as we have nothing else and it is against the rule to add from outside stores I propose that we each pass our dish round then we can all criticise it and so get some good out of this very funny lunch Augusta s plan was carried out and all being hungry after their unusual exertions the girls fell upon the unfortunate birds like so many famished creatures The first one went very well but when the dishes were passed again each taster looked at it anxiously for none were very good there was nothing to fall back upon and variety is the spice of life as every one knows Oh for a slice of bread sighed one damsel Why didn t we think of it asked another I did but we always have so much cake I thought it was foolish to lay in rolls exclaimed Augusta rather mortified at the neglect I expected to have to taste six pies and one doesn t want bread with pastry you know As Edith spoke she suddenly remembered Patty s biscuit which had been left on the side table by their modest maker as there seemed to be no room for them Rejoicing now over the rather despised dish Edith ran to get it saying as she set it in the middle with a flourish My cousin s contribution She came so late we only had time for that So glad I took the liberty of bringing her and them A murmur of welcome greeted the much desired addition to the feast which would have been a decided failure without it and the pretty plate went briskly round till nothing was left but the painted roses in it With this help the best of the potted pigeons were eaten while a lively discussion went on about what they would have next time Let us each tell our dish and not change We shall never learn if we don t keep to one thing till we do it well I will choose mince pie and bring a good one if it takes me all the week to do it said Edith heroically taking the hardest thing she could think of to encourage the others Fired by this noble example each girl pledged herself to do or die and a fine list of rich dishes was made out by these ambitious young cooks Then a vote of thanks to Patty was passed her biscuit unanimously pronounced the most successful contribution and the vase presented to the delighted girl whose blushes were nearly as deep as the color of the flowers behind which she tried to hide them Soon after this ceremony the party broke up and Edith went home to tell the merry story proudly adding that the country cousin had won the prize You rash child to undertake mince pie It is one of the hardest things to make and about the most unwholesome when eaten Read the receipt and see what you have pledged yourself to do my dear said her mother much amused at the haps and mishaps of the cooking class Edith opened her book and started bravely off at Puff paste but by the time she had come to the end of the three pages devoted to directions for the making of that indigestible delicacy her face was very sober and when she read aloud the following receipt for the mince meat despair slowly settled upon her like a cloud One cup chopped meat one one two cups raisins one one two cups currants one one two cups brown sugar one one three cups molasses three cups chopped apples one cup meat liquor two teaspoonfuls salt two teaspoonfuls cinnamon one two teaspoonful mace one two teaspoonful powdered cloves one lemon grated one four piece citron sliced one two cup brandy one four cup wine three teaspoonfuls rosewater Oh me what a job I shall have to work at it every day till next Saturday for the paste alone will take all the wits I ve got I was rash but I spoke without thinking and wanted to do something really fine We can t be shown about things so I must blunder along as well as I can groaned Edith I can help about the measuring and weighing and chopping I always help mother at Thanksgiving time and she makes splendid pies We only have mince then as she thinks it s bad for us said Patty full of sympathy and good will What are you to take to the lunch asked Edith s mother smiling at her daughter s mournful face bent over the fatal book full of dainty messes that tempted the unwary learner to her doom Only coffee I can t make fancy things but my coffee is always good They said they wanted it so I offered I will have my pills and powders ready for if you all go on at this rate you will need a dose of some sort after your lunch Give your orders Edith and devote your mind to the task I wish you good luck and good digestion my dears With that the mamma left the girls to cheer one another and lay plans for a daily lesson till the perfect pie was made They certainly did their best for they began on Monday and each morning through the week went to the mighty task with daily increasing courage and skill They certainly needed the former for even good natured Nancy got tired of having the young ladies messing round so much and looked cross as the girls appeared in the kitchen Edith s brothers laughed at the various failures which appeared at table and dear mamma was tired of tasting pastry and mince meat in all stages of progression But the undaunted damsels kept on till Saturday came and a very superior pie stood ready to be offered for the inspection of the class I never want to see another said Edith as the girls dressed together weary but well satisfied with their labor for the pie had been praised by all beholders and the fragrance of Patty s coffee filled the house as it stood ready to be poured hot and clear into the best silver pot at the last moment Well I feel as if I d lived in a spice mill this week or a pastry cook s kitchen and I am glad we are done Your brothers won t get any pie for a long while I guess if it depends on you laughed Patty putting on the new ribbons her cousin had given her When Florence s brothers were here last night I heard those rascals making all sorts of fun of us and Alf said we ought to let them come to lunch I scorned the idea and made their mouths water telling about the good things we were going to have said Edith exulting over the severe remarks she had made to these gluttonous young men who adored pie yet jeered at unfortunate cooks Florence the lunch giver of the week had made her table pretty with a posy at each place put the necessary roll in each artistically folded napkin and hung the prize from the gas burner a large blue satin bag full of the most delicious bonbons money could buy There was some delay about beginning as one distracted cook sent word that her potato puffs wouldn t brown and begged them to wait for her So they adjourned to the parlor and talked till the flushed but triumphant Ella arrived with the puffs in fine order When all was ready and the covers raised another surprise awaited them not a merry one like the last but a very serious affair which produced domestic warfare in two houses at least On each dish lay a card bearing a new name for these carefully prepared delicacies The mince pie was re christened Nightmare veal cutlets Dyspepsia escalloped lobster Fits lemon sherbet Colic coffee Palpitation and so on even to the pretty sack of confectionery which was labelled Toothache Great was the indignation of the insulted cooks and a general cry of Who did it arose The poor maid who waited on them declared with tears that not a soul had been in and she herself only absent five minutes getting the ice water Florence felt that her guests had been outraged and promised to find out the wretch and punish him or her in the most terrible manner So the irate young ladies ate their lunch before it cooled but forgot to criticise the dishes so full were they of wonder at this daring deed They were just beginning to calm down when a loud sneeze caused a general rush toward the sofa that stood in a recess of the dining room A small boy nearly suffocated with suppressed laughter and dust was dragged forth and put on trial without a moment s delay Florence was judge the others jury and the unhappy youth being penned in a corner was ordered to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth on penalty of a sound whipping with the big Japanese war fan that hung on the wall over his head Vainly trying to suppress his giggles Phil faced the seven ladies like a man and told as little as possible delighting to torment them like a true boy Do you know who put those cards there Don t you wish you did Phil Gordon answer at once Yes I do Was it Alf He s at home Saturdays and it s just like a horrid Harvard Soph to plague us so It was not Did you see it done I did Man or woman Mary fibs and may have been bribed Man with a chuckle of great glee Do I know him Oh don t you Edith s brother Rex No ma am Do be a good boy and tell us We won t scold though it was a very very rude thing to do What will you give me Do you need to be bribed to do your duty Well I guess it s no fun to hide in that stuffy place and smell nice grub and see you tuck away without offering a fellow a taste Give me a good go at the lunch and I ll see what I can do for you Boys are such pigs Shall we girls Yes we must know Then go and stuff you bad boy but we shall stand guard over you till you tell us who wrote and put those insulting cards here Florence let out the prisoner and stood by him while he ate in a surprisingly short time the best of everything on the table well knowing that such a rare chance would not soon be his again Now give me some of that candy and I ll tell demanded the young Shylock bound to make the best of his power while it lasted Did you ever see such a little torment I can t give the nice bonbons because we haven t decided who is to have them Never mind Pick out a few and get rid of him cried the girls hovering round their prey and longing to shake the truth out of him A handful of sweeties were reluctantly bestowed and then all waited for the name of the evil doer with breathless interest Well began Phil with exasperating slowness Alf wrote the cards and gave me half a dollar to put em round Made a nice thing of it haven t I and before one of the girls could catch him he had bolted from the room with one hand full of candy the other of mince pie and his face shining with the triumphant glee of a small boy who has teased seven big girls and got the better of them What went on just after that is not recorded though Phil peeped in at the windows hooted through the slide and beat a tattoo on the various doors The opportune arrival of his mother sent him whooping down the street and the distressed damsels finished their lunch with what appetite they could Edith got the prize for her pie was pronounced a grand success and partaken of so copiously that several young ladies had reason to think it well named Nightmare by the derisive Alfred Emboldened by her success Edith invited them all to her house on the next Saturday and suggested that she and her cousin provide the lunch as they had some new dishes to offer not down in the receipt book they had been studying all winter As the ardor of the young cooks was somewhat damped by various failures and the discovery that good cooking is an art not easily learned anything in the way of novelty was welcome and the girls gladly accepted the invitation feeling a sense of relief at the thought of not having any dish to worry about though not one of them owned that she was tired of messing as the disrespectful boys called it It was unanimously decided to wither with silent scorn the audacious Alfred and his ally Rex while Phil was to be snubbed by his sister till he had begged pardon for his share of the evil deed Then having sweetened their tongues and tempers with the delicious bonbons the girls departed feeling that the next lunch would be an event of unusual interest The idea of it originated in a dinner which Patty got one day when Nancy who wanted a holiday was unexpectedly called away to the funeral of a cousin the fifth relative who had died in a year such was the mortality in the jovial old creature s family Edith s mother was very busy with a dressmaker and gladly accepted the offer the girls made to get dinner alone No fancy dishes if you please the boys come in as hungry as hunters and want a good solid meal so get something wholesome and plain and plenty of it was the much relieved lady s only suggestion as she retired to the sewing room and left the girls to keep house in their own way Now Edie you be the mistress and give your orders and I ll be cook Only have things that go well together not all baked or all boiled because there isn t room enough on the range you know said Patty putting on a big apron with an air of great satisfaction for she loved to cook and was tired of doing nothing I ll watch all you do and learn so that the next time Nancy goes off in a hurry I can take her place and not have to give the boys what they hate a picked up dinner answered Edith pleased with her part yet a little mortified to find how few plain things she could make well What do the boys like asked Patty longing to please them for they all were very kind to her Roast beef and custard pudding with two or three kinds of vegetables Can we do all that Yes indeed I ll make the pudding right away and have it baked before the meat goes in I can cook as many vegetables as you please and soup too So the order was given and all went well if one might judge by the sounds of merriment in the kitchen Patty made her best gingerbread and cooked some apples with sugar and spice for tea and at the stroke of two had a nice dinner smoking on the table to the great contentment of the hungry boys who did eat like hunters and advised mamma to send old Nancy away and keep Patty for cook which complimentary but rash proposal pleased their cousin very much Now this is useful cookery and well done though it looks so simple Any girl can learn how and be independent of servants if need be Drop your class Edith and take a few lessons of Patty That would suit me better than French affairs that are neither economical nor wholesome I will mamma for I m tired of creaming butter larding things and beating eggs These dishes are not so elegant but we must have them so I may as well learn if Pat will teach me With pleasure all I know Mother thinks it a very important part of a girl s education for if you can t keep servants you can do your own work well and if you are rich you are not so dependent as an ignorant lady is All kinds of useful sewing and housework come first with us and the accomplishments afterward as time and money allow That sort of thing turns out the kind of girl I like and so does every sensible fellow Good luck to you cousin and my best thanks for a capital dinner and a wise little lecture for dessert Rex made his best bow as he left the table and Patty colored high with pleasure at the praise of the tall collegian Out of this and the talk the ladies had afterward grew the lunch which Edith proposed and to the preparation of which went much thought and care for the girls meant to have many samples of country fare so that various tastes might be pleased The plan gradually grew as they worked and a little surprise was added which was a great success When Saturday came the younger boys were all packed off for a holiday in the country that the coast might be clear No hiding under sofas in my house no meddling with my dinner if you please gentlemen said Edith as she saw the small brothers safely off and fell to work with Patty and the maid to arrange the dining room to suit the feast about to be spread there As antique furniture is the fashion now a days it was easy to collect all the old tables chairs china and ornaments in the house and make a pleasant place of the sunny room where a tall clock always stood and damask hangings a century old added much to the effect A massive mahogany table was set forth with ancient silver glass china and all sorts of queer old salt cellars pepper pots pickle dishes knives and spoons High backed chairs stood round it and the guests were received by a very pretty old lady in plum colored satin with a muslin pelerine and a large lace cap most becoming to the rosy face it surrounded A fat watch ticked in the wide belt mitts covered the plump hands and a reticule hung at the side Madam s daughter in a very short waisted pink silk gown muslin apron and frill was even prettier than her mother for her dark curly hair hung on her shoulders and a little cap was stuck on the top with long pink streamers Her mitts went to the elbow and a pink sash was tied in a large bow behind Black satin shoes covered her feet and a necklace of gold beads was round her throat Great was the pleasure this little surprise gave the girls and gay was the chatter that went on as they were welcomed by the hostesses who constantly forgot their parts Madam frisked now and then and Pretty Peggy was so anxious about dinner that she was not as devoted to her company as a well bred young lady should be But no one minded and when the bell rang all gathered about the table eager to see what the feast was to be Ladies we have endeavored to give you a taste of some of the good old dishes rather out of fashion now said Madam standing at her place with a napkin pinned over the purple dress and a twinkle in the blue eyes under the wide cap frills We thought it would be well to introduce some of them to the class and to our family cooks who either scorn the plain dishes or don t know how to cook them well There is a variety and we hope all will find something to enjoy Peggy uncover and let us begin At first the girls looked a little disappointed for the dishes were not very new to them but when they tasted a real boiled dinner and found how good it was also baked beans neither hard greasy nor burnt beefsteak tender juicy and well flavored potatoes mealy in spite of the season Indian pudding made as few modern cooks know how to do it brown bread with home made butter and pumpkin pie that cut like wedges of vegetable gold they changed their minds and began to eat with appetites that would have destroyed their reputations as delicate young ladies if they had been seen Tea in egg shell cups election cake and cream cheese with fruit ended the dinner and as they sat admiring the tiny old spoons the crisp cake and the little cheeses like snow balls Edith said in reply to various compliments paid her Let us give honor where honor is due Patty suggested this and did most of the cooking so thank her and borrow her receipt book It s very funny ever so old copied and tried by her grandmother and full of directions for making quantities of nice things from pie like this to a safe sure wash for the complexion May dew rose leaves and lavender doesn t that sound lovely Let me copy it cried several girls afflicted with freckles or sallow with too much coffee and confectionery Yes indeed But I was going to say as we have no prize to day we have prepared a little souvenir of our old fashioned dinner for each of you Bring them daughter I hope the ladies will pardon the homeliness of the offering and make use of the hint that accompanies each As Edith spoke with a comical mingling of the merry girl and the stately old lady she was trying to personate Patty brought from the side board where it had stood covered up a silver salver on which lay five dainty little loaves of bread on the top of each appeared a receipt for making the same nicely written on colored cards and held in place by a silver scarf pin How cunning What lovely pins I ll take the hint and learn to make good bread at once It smells as sweet as a nut and isn t hard or heavy a bit Such a pretty idea and so clever of you to carry it out so well These remarks went on as the little loaves went round each girl finding her pin well suited to her pet fancy or foible for all were different and all very pretty whether the design was a palette a skate a pen a racquet a fan a feather a bar of music or a daisy Seeing that her dinner was a success in spite of its homeliness Edith added the last surprise which had also been one to Patty and herself when it arrived just in time to be carried out She forgot to be Madam now and said with a face full of mingled merriment and satisfaction as she pushed her cap askew and pulled off her mitts Girls the best joke of all is that Rex and Alf sent the pins and made Phil bring them with a most humble apology for their impertinence last week A meeker boy I never saw and for that we may thank Floy but I think the dinner Pat and I got the other day won Rex s heart so that he made Alf eat humble pie in this agreeable manner We won t say anything about it but all wear our pins and show the boys that we can forgive and forget as sweet girls should though we do cook and have ideas of our own beyond looking pretty and minding our older brothers We will cried the chorus with one voice and Florence added I also propose that when we have learned to make something beside kickshaws as the boys call our fancy dishes we have a dinner like this and invite those rascals to it which will be heaping coals of fire on their heads and stopping their mouths forevermore from making jokes about our cooking class Illustration The HARE AND THE TORTOISE Tramp tramp tramp that was the boys going down stairs in a hurry Bump bump that was the bicycle being zigzagged through the hall Bang that was the front door slamming behind both boys and bicycle leaving the house quiet for a time though the sound of voices outside suggested that a lively discussion was going on The bicycle fever had reached Perryville and raged all summer Now the town was very like a once tranquil pool infested with the long legged water bugs that go skating over its surface in all directions for wheels of every kind darted to and fro startling horses running over small children and pitching their riders headlong in the liveliest manner Men left their business to see the lads try new wheels women grew skilful in the binding of wounds and the mending of sorely rent garments gay girls begged for rides standing on the little step behind and boys clamored for bicycles that they might join the army of martyrs to the last craze Sidney West was the proud possessor of the best wheel in town and displayed his treasure with immense satisfaction before the admiring eyes of his mates He had learned to ride in a city rink and flattered himself that he knew all there was to learn except those feats which only professional gymnasts acquire He mounted with skilful agility rode with as much grace as the tread mill movements of the legs permit and managed to guide his tall steed without much danger to himself or others The occasional headers he took and the bruises which kept his manly limbs in a chronic state of mourning he did not mention but concealed his stiffness heroically and bound his younger brother to eternal silence by the bribe of occasional rides on the old wheel Hugh was a loyal lad and regarded his big brother as the most remarkable fellow in the world so he forgave Sid s domineering ways was a willing slave a devoted admirer and a faithful imitator of all the masculine virtues airs and graces of this elder brother On one point only did they disagree and that was Sid s refusal to give Hugh the old wheel when the new one came Hugh had fondly hoped it would be his hints to that effect having been dropped when Sid wanted an errand done and for weeks the younger boy had waited and labored patiently sure that his reward would be the small bicycle on which he could proudly take his place as a member of the newly formed club with them to set forth in the blue uniform with horns blowing badges glittering and legs flying for a long spin to return after dark a mysterious line of tall shadows with lanterns dimly burning and warning whistles sounding as they went Great therefore was his disappointment and wrath when he discovered that Sid had agreed to sell the wheel to another fellow if it suited him leaving poor Hugh the only boy of his set without a machine Much as he loved Sid he could not forgive this underhand and mercenary transaction It seemed so unbrotherly to requite such long and willing service to dash such ardent hopes to betray such blind confidence for filthy lucre and when the deed was done to laugh and ride gayly away on the splendid British Challenge the desire of all hearts and eyes This morning Hugh had freely vented his outraged feelings and Sid had tried to make light of the affair though quite conscious that he had been both unkind and unfair A bicycle tournament was to take place in the city twenty miles away and the members of the club were going Sid wishing to distinguish himself intended to ride thither and was preparing for the long trip with great care Hugh was wild to go but having spent his pocket money and been forbidden to borrow he could not take the cars as the others had done no horse was to be had and their own stud consisted of an old donkey who would have been hopeless even with the inducement offered in the immortal ditty If I had a donkey what wouldn t go Do you think I d whip him Oh no no I d take him to Jarley s Wax work Show Therefore poor Hugh was in a desperate state of mind as he sat on the gate post watching Sid make his pet s toilet till every plated handle rod screw and axle shone like silver I know I could have ridden the Star if you hadn t let Joe have it I do think it was right down mean of you so does Aunt Ruth and father too only he wont say so because men always stand by one another and snub boys This was strong language for gentle Hugh but he felt that he must vent his anguish in some way or cry like a girl and that disgrace must be avoided even if he failed in respect to his elders Sid was whistling softly as he oiled and rubbed but he was not feeling as easy as he looked and heartily wished that he had not committed himself to Joe for it would have been pleasant to take the little chap as he called the fourteen year older along with him and do the honors of the rink on this great occasion Now it was too late so he affected a careless air and added insult to injury by answering his brother s reproaches in the joking spirit which is peculiarly exasperating at such moments Children shouldn t play with matches nor small boys with bicycles I don t want to commit murder and I certainly should if I let you try to ride twenty miles when you can t go one without nearly breaking your neck or your knees and Sid glanced with a smile at the neat darns which ornamented his brother s trousers over those portions of his long legs How s a fellow going to learn if he isn t allowed to try Might as well tell me to keep away from the water till I can swim You give me a chance and see if I can t ride as well as some older fellows who have been pitched round pretty lively before they dared to try a twenty mile spin answered Hugh clapping both hands on his knees to hide the tell tale darns If Joe doesn t want it you can use the old wheel till I decide what to do with it I suppose a man has a right to sell his own property if he likes said Sid rather nettled at the allusion to his own tribulations in times past Of course he has but if he s promised to give a thing he ought to do it and not sneak out of the bargain after he s got lots of work done to pay for it That s what makes me mad for I believed you and depended on it and it hurts me more to have you deceive me than it would to lose ten bicycles and Hugh choked a little at the thought in spite of his attempt to look sternly indignant You are welcome to your opinion but I wouldn t cry about it Play with chaps of your own size and don t hanker after men s property Take the cars if you want to go so much and stop bothering me retorted Sid getting cross because he was in the wrong and wouldn t own it You know I can t No money and mustn t borrow What s the use of twitting a fellow like that and Hugh with great difficulty refrained from knocking off the new helmet hat which was close to his foot as Sid bent to inspect the shining hub of the cherished wheel Take Sancho then you might arrive before the fun was all over if you carried whips and pins and crackers enough to keep the old boy going you d be a nice span This allusion to the useless donkey was cruel but Hugh held on to the last remnant of his temper and made a wild proposal in the despair of the moment Don t be a donkey yourself See here why can t we ride and tie I ve tried this wheel and got on tip top You d be along to see to me and we d take turns Do Sid I want to go awfully and if you only will I won t say another word about Joe But Sid only burst out laughing at the plan in the most heartless manner No thank you I don t mean to walk a step when I can ride or lend my new wheel to a chap who can hardly keep right side up on the old one It looks like a jolly plan to you I dare say but I don t see it young man I hope I sha n t be a selfish brute when I m seventeen I ll have a bicycle yet A No one and then you ll see how I ll lend it like a gentleman and not insult other fellows because they happen to be two or three years younger Keep cool my son and don t call names If you are such a smart lad why don t you walk since wheels and horses and donkey fail It s only twenty miles nothing to speak of you know Well I could do it if I liked I ve walked eighteen and wasn t half so tired as you were Any one can get over the ground on a bicycle but it takes strength and courage to keep it up on foot Better try it I will some day Don t crow too loud my little rooster you are not cock of the walk yet If I was I wouldn t hit a fellow when he s down and fearing he should kick over the tall bicycle that stood so temptingly near him Hugh walked away trying to whistle though his lips were more inclined to tremble than to pucker Just bring my lunch will you Auntie is putting it up I must be off called Sid so used to giving orders that he did so even at this unpropitious moment Get it yourself I m not going to slave for you any longer old tyrant growled Hugh for the trodden worm turned at last as worms will This was open revolt and Sid felt that things were in a bad way but would not stop to mend them then Whew here s a tempest in a teapot Well it is too bad but I can t help it now I ll make it all right to morrow and bring him round with a nice account of the fun Hullo Bemis going to town he called as a neighbor came spinning noiselessly by Part way and take the cars at Lawton It s hard riding over the hills and a bother to steer a wheel through the streets Come on if you re ready All right and springing up Sid was off forgetting all about the lunch Hugh dodging behind the lilac bushes heard what passed and the moment they were gone ran to the gate to watch them out of sight with longing eyes then turned away listlessly wondering how he should spend the holiday his brother was going to enjoy so much At that moment Aunt Ruth hurried to the door waving the leathern pouch well stored with cake and sandwiches cold coffee and pie Sid s forgotten his bag Run call stop him she cried trotting down the walk with her cap strings waving wildly in the fresh October wind For an instant Hugh hesitated thinking sullenly Serves him right I won t run after him then his kind heart got the better of his bad humor and catching up the bag he raced down the road at his best pace eager to heap coals of fire on Sid s proud head to say nothing of his own desire to see more of the riders They will have to go slowly up the long hill and I ll catch them then he thought as he tore over the ground for he was a good runner and prided himself on his strong legs Unfortunately for his amiable intentions the boys had taken a short cut to avoid the hill and were out of sight down a lane where Hugh never dreamed they would dare to go so mounted Well they have done well to get over the hill at this rate Guess they won t keep it up long panted Hugh stopping short when he saw no signs of the riders The road stretched invitingly before him the race had restored his spirits and curiosity to see what had become of his friends lured him to the hill top where temptation sat waiting for him Up he trudged finding the fresh air the sunny sky the path strewn with red and yellow leaves and the sense of freedom so pleasant that when he reached the highest point and saw the world all before him as it were a daring project seemed to flash upon him nearly taking his breath away with its manifold delights Sid said Walk and why not at least to Lawton and take the cars from there as Bemis means to do Wouldn t the old fellows be surprised to see me turn up at the rink It s quarter past eight now and the fun begins at three I could get there easy enough and by Jupiter I will Got lunch all here and money enough to pay this car fare I guess If I haven t I ll go a little further and take a horse car What a lark here goes and with a whoop of boyish delight at breaking bounds away went Hugh down the long hill like a colt escaped from its pasture The others were just ahead but the windings of the road hid them from him so all went on unconscious of each other s proximity Hugh s run gave him a good start and he got over the ground famously for five or six miles then he went more slowly thinking he had plenty of time to catch a certain train But he had no watch and when he reached Lawton he had the pleasure of seeing the cars go out at one end of the station as he hurried in at the other I won t give it up but just go on and do it afoot That will be something to brag of when the other chaps tell big stories I ll see how fast I can go for I m not tired and can eat on the way Much obliged to Sid for a nice lunch And chuckling over this piece of good luck Hugh set out again only pausing for a good drink at the town pump The thirteen miles did not seem very long when he thought of them but as he walked them they appeared to grow longer and longer till he felt as if he must have travelled about fifty He was in good practice and fortunately had on easy shoes but he was in such a hurry to make good time that he allowed himself no rest and jogged on up hill and down with the resolute air of one walking for a wager There we will leave him and see what had befallen Sid for his adventures were more exciting than Hugh s though all seemed plain sailing when he started At Lawton he had parted from his friend and gone on alone having laid in a store of gingerbread from a baker s cart and paused to eat drink and rest by a wayside brook A few miles further he passed a party of girls playing lawn tennis and as he slowly rolled along regarding them from his lofty perch one suddenly exclaimed Why it s our neighbor Sidney West How did he come here and waving her racquet Alice ran across the lawn to find out Very willing to stop and display his new uniform which was extremely becoming Sid dismounted doffed his helmet and smiled upon the damsels leaning over the hedge like a knight of old Come in and play a game and have some lunch You will have plenty of time and some of us are going to the rink by and by Do we want a boy to help us for Maurice is too lazy and Jack has hurt his hand with that stupid base ball said Alice beckoning persuasively while the other girls nodded and smiled hopefully Thus allured the youthful Ulysses hearkened to the voice of the little Circe in a round hat and entered the enchanted grove to forget the passage of time as he disported himself among the nymphs He was not changed to a beast as in the immortal story though the three young gentlemen did lie about the lawn in somewhat grovelling attitudes and Alice waved her racquet as if it were a wand while her friends handed glasses of lemonade to the recumbent heroes during pauses in the game While thus blissfully engaged time slipped away and Hugh passed him in the race quite unconscious that his brother was reposing in the tent that looked so inviting as the dusty tired boy plodded by counting every mile stone with increasing satisfaction If I get to Uncle Tim s by one o clock I shall have done very well Four miles an hour is a fair pace and only one stop I ll telegraph to auntie as soon as I arrive but she won t worry she s used to having us turn up all right when we get ready thought Hugh grateful that no over anxious mamma was fretting about his long absence The boys had no mother and Aunt Ruth was an easy old lady who let them do as they liked to their great contentment As he neared his journey s end our traveller s spirits rose and the blisters on his heels were forgotten in the dramatic scene his fancy painted when Sid should discover him at Uncle Tim s or calmly seated at the rink Whistling gayly he was passing through a wooded bit of road when the sound of voices made him look back to see a carriage full of girls approaching escorted by a bicycle rider whose long blue legs looked strangely familiar Anxious to keep his secret till the last moment also conscious that he was not in company trim Hugh dived into the wood out of sight while the gay party went by returning to the road as soon as they were hidden by a bend If Sid hadn t been so mean I should have been with him and had some of the fun I don t feel like forgiving him in a hurry for making me foot it like a tramp while he is having such a splendid time If Hugh could have known what was to happen very soon after he had muttered these words to himself as he wiped his hot face and took the last sip of the coffee to quench his thirst he would have been sorry he uttered them and have forgiven his brother everything While he was slowly toiling up the last long hill Sid was coasting down on the other side eager to display his courage and skill before the girls being of an age when boys begin to wish to please and astonish the gentler creatures whom they have hitherto treated with indifference or contempt It was a foolish thing to do for the road was rough with steep banks on either side and a sharp turn at the end but Sid rolled gayly along with an occasional bump till a snake ran across the road making the horse shy the girls scream the rider turn to see what was the matter and in doing so lose his balance just when a large stone needed to be avoided Over went Sid down rattled the wheel up rose a cloud of dust and sudden silence fell upon the girls at sight of this disaster They expected their gallant escort would spring up and laugh over his accident but when he remained flat upon his back where he had alighted after a somersault with the bicycle spread over him like a pall they were alarmed and flew to the rescue A cut on the forehead was bleeding and the blow had evidently stunned him for a moment Luckily a house was near and a man seeing the accident hastened to offer more efficient help than any the girls had wit enough to give in the first flurry as all four only flapped wildly at Sid with their handkerchiefs and exclaimed excitedly What shall we do Is he dead Run for water Call somebody quick Don t be scat gals it takes a sight of thumpin to break a boy s head He ain t hurt much kinder dazed for a minute I ll hist up this pesky mashine and set him on his legs if he hain t damaged em With these cheering words the farmer cleared away the ruins and propped the fallen rider against a tree which treatment had such a good effect that Sid was himself in a moment and much disgusted to find what a scrape he was in This is nothing a mere bump quite right thanks Let us go on at once so sorry to alarm you ladies He began his polite speech bravely but ended with a feeble smile and a clutch at the tree suddenly turning sick and dizzy again You come along a me I ll tinker you and your whirligig up young man No use sayin go ahead for the thing is broke and you want to keep quiet for a spell Drive along gals I ll see to him and my old woman can nuss him better n a dozen flutterin young things scat half to death Taking matters into his own hands the farmer had boy and bicycle under his roof in five minutes and with vain offers of help many regrets and promises to let his Uncle Tim know where he was in case he did not arrive the girls reluctantly drove away leaving no sign of the catastrophe except the trampled road and a dead snake Peace was hardly restored when Hugh came down the hill little dreaming what had happened and for the second time passed his brother who just then was lying on a sofa in the farm house while a kind old woman adorned his brow with a large black plaster suggesting brown paper steeped in vinegar for the various bruises on his arms and legs Some one killed the snake and made a great fuss about it I should say thought Hugh observing the signs of disorder in the dust but resisting a boy s interest in such affairs he stoutly tramped on sniffing the whiffs of sea air that now and then saluted his nose telling him that he was nearing his much desired goal Presently the spires of the city came in sight to his great satisfaction and only the long bridge and a street or two lay between him and Uncle Tim s easy chair into which he soon hoped to cast himself Half way across the bridge a farm wagon passed with a bicycle laid carefully on the barrels of vegetables going to market Hugh gazed affectionately at it longing to borrow it for one brief delicious spin to the bridge end Had he known that it was Sid s broken wheel going to be repaired without loss of time thanks to the good farmer s trip to town he would have paused to have a hearty laugh in spite of his vow not to stop till his journey was over Just as Hugh turned into the side street where Uncle Tim lived a horse car went by in one corner of which sat a pale youth with a battered hat drawn low over his eyes who handed out his ticket with the left hand and frowned when the car jolted as if the jar hurt him Had he looked out of the window he would have seen a very dusty boy with a pouch over his shoulder walking smartly down the street where his relation lived But Sid carefully turned his head aside fearing to be recognized for he was on his way to a certain club to which Bemis belonged preferring his sympathy and hospitality to the humiliation of having his mishap told at home by Uncle Tim who would be sure to take Hugh s part and exult over the downfall of the proud Well for him that he avoided that comfortable mansion for on the door steps stood Hugh beaming with satisfaction as the clock struck one proclaiming that he had done his twenty miles in a little less than five hours Not bad for a little chap even though he is a donkey chuckled the boy dusting his shoes wiping his red face and touching himself up as well as he could in order to present as fresh and unwearied an aspect as possible when he burst upon his astonished brother s sight In he marched when the door opened to find his uncle and two rosy cousins just sitting down to dinner Always glad to see the lads they gave him a cordial welcome and asked for his brother Hasn t he come yet cried Hugh surprised yet glad to be the first on the field Nothing had been seen of him and Hugh at once told his tale to the great delight of his jolly uncle and the admiring wonder of Meg and May the rosy young cousins They all enjoyed the exploit immensely and at once insisted that the pedestrian should be refreshed by a bath a copious meal and a good rest in the big chair where he repeated his story by particular request You deserve a bicycle and you shall have one as sure as my name is Timothy West I like pluck and perseverance and you ve got both so come on my boy and name the wheel you like best Sid needs a little taking down as you lads say and this will give it to him I fancy I m a younger brother myself and I know what their trials are As his uncle made these agreeable remarks Hugh looked as if his trials were all over for his face shone with soap and satisfaction his hunger was quenched by a splendid dinner his tired feet luxuriated in a pair of vast slippers and the blissful certainty of owning a first class bicycle filled his cup to overflowing Words could hardly express his gratitude and nothing but the hope of meeting Sid with this glorious news would have torn him from the reposeful Paradise where he longed to linger Pluck and perseverance with cold cream on the blistered heels got him into his shoes again and he rode away in a horse car as in a triumphal chariot to find his brother I won t brag but I do feel immensely tickled at this day s work Wonder how he got on Did it in two or three hours I suppose and is parading round with those swell club fellows at the rink I ll slip in and let him find me as if I wasn t a bit proud of what I ve done and didn t care two pins for anybody s praise With this plan in his head Hugh enjoyed the afternoon very much keeping a sharp lookout for Sid even while astonishing feats were being performed before his admiring eyes But nowhere did he see his brother for he was searching for a blue uniform and a helmet with a certain badge on it while Sid in a borrowed hat and coat sat in a corner looking on whenever a splitting headache and the pain in his bones allowed him to see and enjoy the exploits in which he had hoped to join Not until it was over did the brothers meet as they went out and then the expression on Sid s face was so comical that Hugh laughed till the crowd about them stared wondering what the joke could be How in the world did you get here asked the elder boy giving his hat a sudden pull to hide the plaster Walked as you advised me to Words cannot express the pleasure that answer gave Hugh or the exultation he vainly tried to repress as his eyes twinkled and a grin of real boyish fun shone upon his sunburnt countenance You expect me to believe that do you Just as you please I started to catch you with your bag and when I missed you thought I might as well keep on Got in about one had dinner at uncle s and been enjoying these high jinks ever since Very well for a beginning Keep it up and you ll be a Rowell by and by What do you suppose father will say to you small boy Not much Uncle will make that all right He thought it was a plucky thing to do and so did the girls When did you get in asked Hugh rather nettled at Sid s want of enthusiasm though it was evident he was much impressed by the small boy s prank I took it easy after Bemis left me Had a game of tennis at the Blanchards as I came along dinner at the club and strolled up here with the fellows Got a headache and don t feel up to much As Sid spoke and Hugh s keen eye took in the various signs of distress which betrayed a hint of the truth the grin changed to a hearty Ha ha as he smote his knees exclaiming gleefully You ve come to grief I know it I see it Own up and don t shirk for I ll find it out somehow as sure as you live Don t make such a row in the street Get aboard this car and I ll tell you for you ll give me no peace till I do answered Sid well knowing that Alice would never keep the secret To say that it was nuts to Hugh faintly expresses the interest he took in the story which was extracted bit by bit from the reluctant sufferer but after a very pardonable crow over the mishaps of his oppressor he yielded to the sympathy he felt for his brother and was very good to him This touched Sid and filled him with remorse for past unkindness for one sees one s faults very plainly and is not ashamed to own it when one is walking through the Valley of Humiliation Look here I ll tell you what I ll do he said as they left the car and Hugh offered an arm with a friendly air pleasant to see I ll give you the old wheel and let Joe get another where he can It s small for him and I doubt if he wants it any way I do think you were a plucky fellow to tramp your twenty miles in good time and not bear malice either so let s say Done and forgive and forget Much obliged but uncle is going to give me a new one so Joe needn t be disappointed I know how hard that is and am glad to keep him from it for he s poor and can t afford a new one That answer was Hugh s only revenge for his own trials and Sid felt it though he merely said with a hearty slap on the shoulder Glad to hear it Uncle is a trump and so are you We ll take the last train home and I ll pay your fare Thank you Poor old man you did get a bump didn t you exclaimed Hugh as they took off their hats in the hall and the patch appeared in all its gloomy length and breadth Head will be all right in a day or two but I stove in my helmet and ground a hole in both knees of my new shorts Had to borrow a fit out of Bemis and leave my rags behind We needn t mention any more than is necessary to the girls I hate to be fussed over answered Sid trying to speak carelessly Hugh had to stop and have another laugh remembering the taunts his own mishaps had called forth but he did not retaliate and Sid never forgot it Their stay was a short one and Hugh was the hero of the hour quite eclipsing his brother who usually took the first place but now very meekly played second fiddle conscious that he was not an imposing figure in a coat much too big for him with a patch on his forehead a purple bruise on one cheek and a general air of dilapidation very trying to the usually spruce youth When they left Uncle Tim patted Hugh on the head a liberty the boy would have resented if the delightful old gentleman had not followed it up by saying with a reckless generosity worthy of record Choose your bicycle my boy and send the bill to me Then turning to Sid he added in a tone that made the pale face redden suddenly And do you remember that the tortoise beat the hare in the old fable we all know That is the last of the stories for our holiday is over and to morrow we must go home We have had a splendid time and thank you and auntie so much dear grandma said Min expressing the feeling of all the children as they stood about the fire when the bicycle tale ended I m so glad my darlings and please God we ll all meet here again next year well and happy and ready for more fun answered the old lady with arms and lap full of loving little people Auntie deserves a vote of thanks and I rise to propose it said Geoff and it was passed with great applause Many thanks If the odds and ends in my portfolio have given you pleasure or done you any good my fondest wishes are gratified answered Aunt Elinor laughing yet well pleased I tucked a moral in as we hide pills in jelly and I hope you didn t find them hard to swallow Very easy and nice I intend to look after little things faithfully and tell the girls how to make their jerseys fit said Min I m going to fill my jewel box as Daisy did and learn to cook added Lotty Eli is the boy for me and I won t forget to be kind to my small chap said Walt stroking his younger brother s head with unusual kindness Well I m rather mixed in my heroes but I ll take the best of Corny Onawandah and the banner fellow for my share cried Geoff The little people proclaimed their favorites but as all spoke together only a comical mixture of doves bears babies table cloths and blue hose reached the ear Then came the good night kisses the patter of departing feet and silence fell upon the room The little wheel was still the chairs stood empty the old
