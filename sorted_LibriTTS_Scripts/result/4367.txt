OF GENERAL GRANT Produced by David Widger PERSONAL MEMOIRS OF U S GRANT complete by U S Grant PREFACE Man proposes and God disposes There are but few important events in the affairs of men brought about by their own choice Although frequently urged by friends to write my memoirs I had determined never to do so nor to write anything for publication At the age of nearly sixty two I received an injury from a fall which confined me closely to the house while it did not apparently affect my general health This made study a pleasant pastime Shortly after the rascality of a business partner developed itself by the announcement of a failure This was followed soon after by universal depression of all securities which seemed to threaten the extinction of a good part of the income still retained and for which I am indebted to the kindly act of friends At this juncture the editor of the Century Magazine asked me to write a few articles for him I consented for the money it gave me for at that moment I was living upon borrowed money The work I found congenial and I determined to continue it The event is an important one for me for good or evil I hope for the former In preparing these volumes for the public I have entered upon the task with the sincere desire to avoid doing injustice to any one whether on the National or Confederate side other than the unavoidable injustice of not making mention often where special mention is due There must be many errors of omission in this work because the subject is too large to be treated of in two volumes in such way as to do justice to all the officers and men engaged There were thousands of instances during the rebellion of individual company regimental and brigade deeds of heroism which deserve special mention and are not here alluded to The troops engaged in them will have to look to the detailed reports of their individual commanders for the full history of those deeds The first volume as well as a portion of the second was written before I had reason to suppose I was in a critical condition of health Later I was reduced almost to the point of death and it became impossible for me to attend to anything for weeks I have however somewhat regained my strength and am able often to devote as many hours a day as a person should devote to such work I would have more hope of satisfying the expectation of the public if I could have allowed myself more time I have used my best efforts with the aid of my eldest son F D Grant assisted by his brothers to verify from the records every statement of fact given The comments are my own and show how I saw the matters treated of whether others saw them in the same light or not With these remarks I present these volumes to the public asking no favor but hoping they will meet the approval of the reader U S GRANT MOUNT MACGREGOR NEW YORK July one eighteen eighty five CONTENTS VOLUME I CHAPTER I ANCESTRY BIRTH BOYHOOD CHAPTER II WEST POINT GRADUATION CHAPTER

ANCESTRY BIRTH BOYHOOD My family is American and has been for generations in all its branches direct and collateral Mathew Grant the founder of the branch in America of which I am a descendant reached Dorchester Massachusetts in May sixteen thirty In sixteen thirty five he moved to what is now Windsor Connecticut and was the surveyor for that colony for more than forty years He was also for many years of the time town clerk He was a married man when he arrived at Dorchester but his children were all born in this country His eldest son Samuel took lands on the east side of the Connecticut River opposite Windsor which have been held and occupied by descendants of his to this day I am of the eighth generation from Mathew Grant and seventh from Samuel Mathew Grant s first wife died a few years after their settlement in Windsor and he soon after married the widow Rockwell who with her first husband had been fellow passengers with him and his first wife on the ship Mary and John from Dorchester England in sixteen thirty missus Rockwell had several children by her first marriage and others by her second By intermarriage two or three generations later I am descended from both the wives of Mathew Grant In the fifth descending generation my great grandfather Noah Grant and his younger brother Solomon held commissions in the English army in seventeen fifty six in the war against the French and Indians Both were killed that year My grandfather also named Noah was then but nine years old At the breaking out of the war of the Revolution after the battles of Concord and Lexington he went with a Connecticut company to join the Continental army and was present at the battle of Bunker Hill He served until the fall of Yorktown or through the entire Revolutionary war He must however have been on furlough part of the time as I believe most of the soldiers of that period were for he married in Connecticut during the war had two children and was a widower at the close Soon after this he emigrated to Westmoreland County Pennsylvania and settled near the town of Greensburg in that county He took with him the younger of his two children Peter Grant The elder Solomon remained with his relatives in Connecticut until old enough to do for himself when he emigrated to the British West Indies Not long after his settlement in Pennsylvania my grandfather Captain Noah Grant married a Miss Kelly and in seventeen ninety nine he emigrated again this time to Ohio and settled where the town of Deerfield now stands He had now five children including Peter a son by his first marriage My father Jesse R Grant was the second child oldest son by the second marriage Peter Grant went early to Maysville Kentucky where he was very prosperous married had a family of nine children and was drowned at the mouth of the Kanawha River Virginia in eighteen twenty five being at the time one of the wealthy men of the West My grandmother Grant died in eighteen oh five leaving seven children This broke up the family Captain Noah Grant was not thrifty in the way of laying up stores on earth and after the death of his second wife he went with the two youngest children to live with his son Peter in Maysville The rest of the family found homes in the neighborhood of Deerfield my father in the family of judge Tod the father of the late Governor Tod of Ohio His industry and independence of character were such that I imagine his labor compensated fully for the expense of his maintenance There must have been a cordiality in his welcome into the Tod family for to the day of his death he looked upon judge Tod and his wife with all the reverence he could have felt if they had been parents instead of benefactors I have often heard him speak of missus Tod as the most admirable woman he had ever known He remained with the Tod family only a few years until old enough to learn a trade He went first I believe with his half brother Peter Grant who though not a tanner himself owned a tannery in Maysville Kentucky Here he learned his trade and in a few years returned to Deerfield and worked for and lived in the family of a mister Brown the father of John Brown whose body lies mouldering in the grave while his soul goes marching on I have often heard my father speak of John Brown particularly since the events at Harper s Ferry Brown was a boy when they lived in the same house but he knew him afterwards and regarded him as a man of great purity of character of high moral and physical courage but a fanatic and extremist in whatever he advocated It was certainly the act of an insane man to attempt the invasion of the South and the overthrow of slavery with less than twenty men My father set up for himself in business establishing a tannery at Ravenna the county seat of Portage County In a few years he removed from Ravenna and set up the same business at Point Pleasant Clermont County Ohio During the minority of my father the West afforded but poor facilities for the most opulent of the youth to acquire an education and the majority were dependent almost exclusively upon their own exertions for whatever learning they obtained I have often heard him say that his time at school was limited to six months when he was very young too young indeed to learn much or to appreciate the advantages of an education and to a quarter s schooling afterwards probably while living with judge Tod But his thirst for education was intense He learned rapidly and was a constant reader up to the day of his death in his eightieth year Books were scarce in the Western Reserve during his youth but he read every book he could borrow in the neighborhood where he lived This scarcity gave him the early habit of studying everything he read so that when he got through with a book he knew everything in it The habit continued through life Even after reading the daily papers which he never neglected he could give all the important information they contained He made himself an excellent English scholar and before he was twenty years of age was a constant contributor to Western newspapers and was also from that time until he was fifty years old an able debater in the societies for this purpose which were common in the West at that time He always took an active part in politics but was never a candidate for office except I believe that he was the first Mayor of Georgetown He supported Jackson for the Presidency but he was a Whig a great admirer of Henry Clay and never voted for any other democrat for high office after Jackson My mother s family lived in Montgomery County Pennsylvania for several generations I have little information about her ancestors Her family took no interest in genealogy so that my grandfather who died when I was sixteen years old knew only back to his grandfather On the other side my father took a great interest in the subject and in his researches he found that there was an entailed estate in Windsor Connecticut belonging to the family to which his nephew Lawson Grant still living was the heir He was so much interested in the subject that he got his nephew to empower him to act in the matter and in eighteen thirty two or eighteen thirty three when I was a boy ten or eleven years old he went to Windsor proved the title beyond dispute and perfected the claim of the owners for a consideration three thousand dollars I think I remember the circumstance well and remember too hearing him say on his return that he found some widows living on the property who had little or nothing beyond their homes From these he refused to receive any recompense My mother s father John Simpson moved from Montgomery County Pennsylvania to Clermont County Ohio about the year eighteen nineteen taking with him his four children three daughters and one son My mother Hannah Simpson was the third of these children and was then over twenty years of age Her oldest sister was at that time married and had several children She still lives in Clermont County at this writing October fifth eighteen eighty four and is over ninety ears of age Until her memory failed her a few years ago she thought the country ruined beyond recovery when the Democratic party lost control in eighteen sixty Her family which was large inherited her views with the exception of one son who settled in Kentucky before the war He was the only one of the children who entered the volunteer service to suppress the rebellion Her brother next of age and now past eighty eight is also still living in Clermont County within a few miles of the old homestead and is as active in mind as ever He was a supporter of the Government during the war and remains a firm believer that national success by the Democratic party means irretrievable ruin In June eighteen twenty one my father Jesse R Grant married Hannah Simpson I was born on the twenty seventh of April eighteen twenty two at Point Pleasant Clermont County Ohio In the fall of eighteen twenty three we moved to Georgetown the county seat of Brown the adjoining county east This place remained my home until at the age of seventeen in eighteen thirty nine I went to West Point The schools at the time of which I write were very indifferent There were no free schools and none in which the scholars were classified They were all supported by subscription and a single teacher who was often a man or a woman incapable of teaching much even if they imparted all they knew would have thirty or forty scholars male and female from the infant learning the A B C s up to the young lady of eighteen and the boy of twenty studying the highest branches taught the three R s Reading Riting Rithmetic I never saw an algebra or other mathematical work higher than the arithmetic in Georgetown until after I was appointed to West Point I then bought a work on algebra in Cincinnati but having no teacher it was Greek to me My life in Georgetown was uneventful From the age of five or six until seventeen I attended the subscription schools of the village except during the winters of eighteen thirty six seven and eighteen thirty eight nine The former period was spent in Maysville Kentucky attending the school of Richardson and Rand the latter in Ripley Ohio at a private school I was not studious in habit and probably did not make progress enough to compensate for the outlay for board and tuition At all events both winters were spent in going over the same old arithmetic which I knew every word of before and repeating A noun is the name of a thing which I had also heard my Georgetown teachers repeat until I had come to believe it but I cast no reflections upon my old teacher Richardson He turned out bright scholars from his school many of whom have filled conspicuous places in the service of their States Two of my contemporaries there who I believe never attended any other institution of learning have held seats in Congress and one if not both other high offices these are Wadsworth and Brewster My father was from my earliest recollection in comfortable circumstances considering the times his place of residence and the community in which he lived Mindful of his own lack of facilities for acquiring an education his greatest desire in maturer years was for the education of his children Consequently as stated before I never missed a quarter from school from the time I was old enough to attend till the time of leaving home This did not exempt me from labor In my early days every one labored more or less in the region where my youth was spent and more in proportion to their private means It was only the very poor who were exempt While my father carried on the manufacture of leather and worked at the trade himself he owned and tilled considerable land I detested the trade preferring almost any other labor but I was fond of agriculture and of all employment in which horses were used We had among other lands fifty acres of forest within a mile of the village In the fall of the year choppers were employed to cut enough wood to last a twelve month When I was seven or eight years of age I began hauling all the wood used in the house and shops I could not load it on the wagons of course at that time but I could drive and the choppers would load and some one at the house unload When about eleven years old I was strong enough to hold a plough From that age until seventeen I did all the work done with horses such as breaking up the land furrowing ploughing corn and potatoes bringing in the crops when harvested hauling all the wood besides tending two or three horses a cow or two and sawing wood for stoves et cetera while still attending school For this I was compensated by the fact that there was never any scolding or punishing by my parents no objection to rational enjoyments such as fishing going to the creek a mile away to swim in summer taking a horse and visiting my grandparents in the adjoining county fifteen miles off skating on the ice in winter or taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the ground While still quite young I had visited Cincinnati forty five miles away several times alone also Maysville Kentucky often and once Louisville The journey to Louisville was a big one for a boy of that day I had also gone once with a two horse carriage to Chilicothe about seventy miles with a neighbor s family who were removing to Toledo Ohio and returned alone and had gone once in like manner to Flat Rock Kentucky about seventy miles away On this latter occasion I was fifteen years of age While at Flat Rock at the house of a mister Payne whom I was visiting with his brother a neighbor of ours in Georgetown I saw a very fine saddle horse which I rather coveted and proposed to mister Payne the owner to trade him for one of the two I was driving Payne hesitated to trade with a boy but asking his brother about it the latter told him that it would be all right that I was allowed to do as I pleased with the horses I was seventy miles from home with a carriage to take back and mister Payne said he did not know that his horse had ever had a collar on I asked to have him hitched to a farm wagon and we would soon see whether he would work It was soon evident that the horse had never worn harness before but he showed no viciousness and I expressed a confidence that I could manage him A trade was at once struck I receiving ten dollars difference The next day mister Payne of Georgetown and I started on our return We got along very well for a few miles when we encountered a ferocious dog that frightened the horses and made them run The new animal kicked at every jump he made I got the horses stopped however before any damage was done and without running into anything After giving them a little rest to quiet their fears we started again That instant the new horse kicked and started to run once more The road we were on struck the turnpike within half a mile of the point where the second runaway commenced and there there was an embankment twenty or more feet deep on the opposite side of the pike I got the horses stopped on the very brink of the precipice My new horse was terribly frightened and trembled like an aspen but he was not half so badly frightened as my companion mister Payne who deserted me after this last experience and took passage on a freight wagon for Maysville Every time I attempted to start my new horse would commence to kick I was in quite a dilemma for a time Once in Maysville I could borrow a horse from an uncle who lived there but I was more than a day s travel from that point Finally I took out my bandanna the style of handkerchief in universal use then and with this blindfolded my horse In this way I reached Maysville safely the next day no doubt much to the surprise of my friend Here I borrowed a horse from my uncle and the following day we proceeded on our journey About half my school days in Georgetown were spent at the school of John D White a North Carolinian and the father of Chilton White who represented the district in Congress for one term during the rebellion mister White was always a Democrat in politics and Chilton followed his father He had two older brothers all three being school mates of mine at their father s school who did not go the same way The second brother died before the rebellion began he was a Whig and afterwards a Republican His oldest brother was a Republican and brave soldier during the rebellion Chilton is reported as having told of an earlier horse trade of mine As he told the story there was a mister Ralston living within a few miles of the village who owned a colt which I very much wanted My father had offered twenty dollars for it but Ralston wanted twenty five I was so anxious to have the colt that after the owner left I begged to be allowed to take him at the price demanded My father yielded but said twenty dollars was all the horse was worth and told me to offer that price if it was not accepted I was to offer twenty two and a half and if that would not get him to give the twenty five I at once mounted a horse and went for the colt When I got to mister Ralston s house I said to him Papa says I may offer you twenty dollars for the colt but if you won t take that I am to offer twenty two and a half and if you won t take that to give you twenty five It would not require a Connecticut man to guess the price finally agreed upon This story is nearly true I certainly showed very plainly that I had come for the colt and meant to have him I could not have been over eight years old at the time This transaction caused me great heart burning The story got out among the boys of the village and it was a long time before I heard the last of it Boys enjoy the misery of their companions at least village boys in that day did and in later life I have found that all adults are not free from the peculiarity I kept the horse until he was four years old when he went blind and I sold him for twenty dollars When I went to Maysville to school in eighteen thirty six at the age of fourteen I recognized my colt as one of the blind horses working on the tread wheel of the ferry boat I have describes enough of my early life to give an impression of the whole I did not like to work but I did as much of it while young as grown men can be hired to do in these days and attended school at the same time I had as many privileges as any boy in the village and probably more than most of them I have no recollection of ever having been punished at home either by scolding or by the rod But at school the case was different The rod was freely used there and I was not exempt from its influence I can see John D White the school teacher now with his long beech switch always in his hand It was not always the same one either Switches were brought in bundles from a beech wood near the school house by the boys for whose benefit they were intended Often a whole bundle would be used up in a single day I never had any hard feelings against my teacher either while attending the school or in later years when reflecting upon my experience mister White was a kindhearted man and was much respected by the community in which he lived He only followed the universal custom of the period and that under which he had received his own education CHAPTER II WEST POINT GRADUATION In the winter of eighteen thirty eight nine I was attending school at Ripley only ten miles distant from Georgetown but spent the Christmas holidays at home During this vacation my father received a letter from the Honorable Thomas Morris then United States Senator from Ohio When he read it he said to me Ulysses I believe you are going to receive the appointment What appointment I inquired To West Point I have applied for it But I won t go I said He said he thought I would AND I THOUGHT SO TOO IF HE DID I really had no objection to going to West Point except that I had a very exalted idea of the acquirements necessary to get through I did not believe I possessed them and could not bear the idea of failing There had been four boys from our village or its immediate neighborhood who had been graduated from West Point and never a failure of any one appointed from Georgetown except in the case of the one whose place I was to take He was the son of doctor Bailey our nearest and most intimate neighbor Young Bailey had been appointed in eighteen thirty seven Finding before the January examination following that he could not pass he resigned and went to a private school and remained there until the following year when he was reappointed Before the next examination he was dismissed doctor Bailey was a proud and sensitive man and felt the failure of his son so keenly that he forbade his return home There were no telegraphs in those days to disseminate news rapidly no railroads west of the Alleghanies and but few east and above all there were no reporters prying into other people s private affairs Consequently it did not become generally known that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district until I was appointed I presume missus Bailey confided to my mother the fact that Bartlett had been dismissed and that the doctor had forbidden his son s return home The Honorable Thomas L Hamer one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced was our member of Congress at the time and had the right of nomination He and my father had been members of the same debating society where they were generally pitted on opposite sides and intimate personal friends from their early manhood up to a few years before In politics they differed Hamer was a life long Democrat while my father was a Whig They had a warm discussion which finally became angry over some act of President Jackson the removal of the deposit of public moneys I think after which they never spoke until after my appointment I know both of them felt badly over this estrangement and would have been glad at any time to come to a reconciliation but neither would make the advance Under these circumstances my father would not write to Hamer for the appointment but he wrote to Thomas Morris United States Senator from Ohio informing him that there was a vacancy at West Point from our district and that he would be glad if I could be appointed to fill it This letter I presume was turned over to mister Hamer and as there was no other applicant he cheerfully appointed me This healed the breach between the two never after reopened Besides the argument used by my father in favor of my going to West Point that he thought I would go there was another very strong inducement I had always a great desire to travel I was already the best travelled boy in Georgetown except the sons of one man John Walker who had emigrated to Texas with his family and immigrated back as soon as he could get the means to do so In his short stay in Texas he acquired a very different opinion of the country from what one would form going there now I had been east to Wheeling Virginia and north to the Western Reserve in Ohio west to Louisville and south to Bourbon County Kentucky besides having driven or ridden pretty much over the whole country within fifty miles of home Going to West Point would give me the opportunity of visiting the two great cities of the continent Philadelphia and New York This was enough When these places were visited I would have been glad to have had a steamboat or railroad collision or any other accident happen by which I might have received a temporary injury sufficient to make me ineligible for a time to enter the Academy Nothing of the kind occurred and I had to face the music Georgetown has a remarkable record for a western village It is and has been from its earliest existence a democratic town There was probably no time during the rebellion when if the opportunity could have been afforded it would not have voted for Jefferson Davis for President of the United States over mister Lincoln or any other representative of his party unless it was immediately after some of John Morgan s men in his celebrated raid through Ohio spent a few hours in the village The rebels helped themselves to whatever they could find horses boots and shoes especially horses and many ordered meals to be prepared for them by the families This was no doubt a far pleasanter duty for some families than it would have been to render a like service for Union soldiers The line between the Rebel and Union element in Georgetown was so marked that it led to divisions even in the churches There were churches in that part of Ohio where treason was preached regularly and where to secure membership hostility to the government to the war and to the liberation of the slaves was far more essential than a belief in the authenticity or credibility of the Bible There were men in Georgetown who filled all the requirements for membership in these churches Yet this far off western village with a population including old and young male and female of about one thousand about enough for the organization of a single regiment if all had been men capable of bearing arms furnished the Union army four general officers and one colonel West Point graduates and nine generals and field officers of Volunteers that I can think of Of the graduates from West Point all had citizenship elsewhere at the breaking out of the rebellion except possibly General A V Kautz who had remained in the army from his graduation Two of the colonels also entered the service from other localities The other seven General McGroierty Colonels White Fyffe Loudon and Marshall Majors King and Bailey were all residents of Georgetown when the war broke out and all of them who were alive at the close returned there Major Bailey was the cadet who had preceded me at West Point He was killed in West Virginia in his first engagement As far as I know every boy who has entered West Point from that village since my time has been graduated I took passage on a steamer at Ripley Ohio for Pittsburg about the middle of May eighteen thirty nine Western boats at that day did not make regular trips at stated times but would stop anywhere and for any length of time for passengers or freight I have myself been detained two or three days at a place after steam was up the gang planks all but one drawn in and after the time advertised for starting had expired On this occasion we had no vexatious delays and in about three days Pittsburg was reached From Pittsburg I chose passage by the canal to Harrisburg rather than by the more expeditious stage This gave a better opportunity of enjoying the fine scenery of Western Pennsylvania and I had rather a dread of reaching my destination at all At that time the canal was much patronized by travellers and with the comfortable packets of the period no mode of conveyance could be more pleasant when time was not an object From Harrisburg to Philadelphia there was a railroad the first I had ever seen except the one on which I had just crossed the summit of the Alleghany Mountains and over which canal boats were transported In travelling by the road from Harrisburg I thought the perfection of rapid transit had been reached We travelled at least eighteen miles an hour when at full speed and made the whole distance averaging probably as much as twelve miles an hour This seemed like annihilating space I stopped five days in Philadelphia saw about every street in the city attended the theatre visited Girard College which was then in course of construction and got reprimanded from home afterwards for dallying by the way so long My sojourn in New York was shorter but long enough to enable me to see the city very well I reported at West Point on the thirtieth or thirty first of May and about two weeks later passed my examination for admission without difficulty very much to my surprise A military life had no charms for me and I had not the faintest idea of staying in the army even if I should be graduated which I did not expect The encampment which preceded the commencement of academic studies was very wearisome and uninteresting When the twenty eighth of August came the date for breaking up camp and going into barracks I felt as though I had been at West Point always and that if I staid to graduation I would have to remain always I did not take hold of my studies with avidity in fact I rarely ever read over a lesson the second time during my entire cadetship I could not sit in my room doing nothing There is a fine library connected with the Academy from which cadets can get books to read in their quarters I devoted more time to these than to books relating to the course of studies Much of the time I am sorry to say was devoted to novels but not those of a trashy sort I read all of Bulwer s then published Cooper s Marryat s Scott s Washington Irving s works Lever s and many others that I do not now remember Mathematics was very easy to me so that when January came I passed the examination taking a good standing in that branch In French the only other study at that time in the first year s course my standing was very low In fact if the class had been turned the other end foremost I should have been near head I never succeeded in getting squarely at either end of my class in any one study during the four years I came near it in French artillery infantry and cavalry tactics and conduct Early in the session of the Congress which met in December eighteen thirty nine a bill was discussed abolishing the Military Academy I saw in this an honorable way to obtain a discharge and read the debates with much interest but with impatience at the delay in taking action for I was selfish enough to favor the bill It never passed and a year later although the time hung drearily with me I would have been sorry to have seen it succeed My idea then was to get through the course secure a detail for a few years as assistant professor of mathematics at the Academy and afterwards obtain a permanent position as professor in some respectable college but circumstances always did shape my course different from my plans At the end of two years the class received the usual furlough extending from the close of the June examination to the twenty eighth of August This I enjoyed beyond any other period of my life My father had sold out his business in Georgetown where my youth had been spent and to which my day dreams carried me back as my future home if I should ever be able to retire on a competency He had moved to Bethel only twelve miles away in the adjoining county of Clermont and had bought a young horse that had never been in harness for my special use under the saddle during my furlough Most of my time was spent among my old school mates these ten weeks were shorter than one week at West Point Persons acquainted with the Academy know that the corps of cadets is divided into four companies for the purpose of military exercises These companies are officered from the cadets the superintendent and commandant selecting the officers for their military bearing and qualifications The adjutant quartermaster four captains and twelve lieutenants are taken from the first or Senior class the sergeants from the second or junior class and the corporals from the third or Sophomore class I had not been called out as a corporal but when I returned from furlough I found myself the last but one about my standing in all the tactics of eighteen sergeants The promotion was too much for me That year my standing in the class as shown by the number of demerits of the year was about the same as it was among the sergeants and I was dropped and served the fourth year as a private During my first year s encampment General Scott visited West Point and reviewed the cadets With his commanding figure his quite colossal size and showy uniform I thought him the finest specimen of manhood my eyes had ever beheld and the most to be envied I could never resemble him in appearance but I believe I did have a presentiment for a moment that some day I should occupy his place on review although I had no intention then of remaining in the army My experience in a horse trade ten years before and the ridicule it caused me were too fresh in my mind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimate chum The next summer Martin Van Buren then President of the United States visited West Point and reviewed the cadets he did not impress me with the awe which Scott had inspired In fact I regarded General Scott and Captain C F Smith the Commandant of Cadets as the two men most to be envied in the nation I retained a high regard for both up to the day of their death The last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two but they still seemed about five times as long as Ohio years to me At last all the examinations were passed and the members of the class were called upon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments I was anxious to enter the cavalry or dragoons as they were then called but there was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time and attached to that besides the full complement of officers there were at least four brevet second lieutenants I recorded therefore my first choice dragoons second fourth infantry and got the latter Again there was a furlough or more properly speaking leave of absence for the class were now commissioned officers this time to the end of September Again I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school mates and again I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use besides a horse and buggy that I could drive but I was not in a physical condition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion For six months before graduation I had had a desperate cough Tyler s grip it was called and I was very much reduced weighing but one hundred and seventeen pounds just my weight at entrance though I had grown six inches in stature in the mean time There was consumption in my father s family two of his brothers having died of that disease which made my symptoms more alarming The brother and sister next younger than myself died during the rebellion of the same disease and I seemed the most promising subject for it of the three in eighteen forty three Having made alternate choice of two different arms of service with different uniforms I could not get a uniform suit until notified of my assignment I left my measurement with a tailor with directions not to make the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantry or dragoons Notice did not reach me for several weeks and then it took at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor and two more to make the clothes and have them sent to me This was a time of great suspense I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how it looked and probably wanted my old school mates particularly the girls to see me in it The conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances that happened soon after the arrival of the clothes which gave me a distaste for military uniform that I never recovered from Soon after the arrival of the suit I donned it and put off for Cincinnati on horseback While I was riding along a street of that city imagining that every one was looking at me with a feeling akin to mine when I first saw General Scott a little urchin bareheaded footed with dirty and ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows that s what suspenders were called then and a shirt that had not seen a wash tub for weeks turned to me and cried Soldier will you work No sir ee I ll sell my shirt first The horse trade and its dire consequences were recalled to mind The other circumstance occurred at home Opposite our house in Bethel stood the old stage tavern where man and beast found accommodation The stable man was rather dissipated but possessed of some humor On my return I found him parading the streets and attending in the stable barefooted but in a pair of sky blue nankeen pantaloons just the color of my uniform trousers with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed down the outside seams in imitation of mine The joke was a huge one in the mind of many of the people and was much enjoyed by them but I did not appreciate it so highly During the remainder of my leave of absence my time was spent in visiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati and occasionally other towns in that part of the State CHAPTER III ARMY LIFE CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR CAMP SALUBRITY On the thirtieth of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks saint Louis with the fourth United States infantry It was the largest military post in the country at that time being garrisoned by sixteen companies of infantry eight of the threed regiment the remainder of the fourth Colonel Steven Kearney one of the ablest officers of the day commanded the post and under him discipline was kept at a high standard but without vexatious rules or regulations Every drill and roll call had to be attended but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoy themselves leaving the garrison and going where they pleased without making written application to state where they were going for how long et cetera so that they were back for their next duty It did seem to me in my early army days that too many of the older officers when they came to command posts made it a study to think what orders they could publish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable I noticed however a few years later when the Mexican war broke out that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed of disabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service They had the moral courage to proclaim it too They were right but they did not always give their disease the right name At West Point I had a class mate in the last year of our studies he was room mate also F T Dent whose family resided some five miles west of Jefferson Barracks Two of his unmarried brothers were living at home at that time and as I had taken with me from Ohio my horse saddle and bridle I soon found my way out to White Haven the name of the Dent estate As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent There were at home besides the young men two daughters one a school miss of fifteen the other a girl of eight or nine There was still an older daughter of seventeen who had been spending several years at boarding school in saint Louis but who though through school had not yet returned home She was spending the winter in the city with connections the family of Colonel John O Fallon well known in saint Louis In February she returned to her country home After that I do not know but my visits became more frequent they certainly did become more enjoyable We would often take walks or go on horseback to visit the neighbors until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity Sometimes one of the brothers would accompany us sometimes one of the younger sisters If the fourth infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracks it is possible even probable that this life might have continued for some years without my finding out that there was anything serious the matter with me but in the following May a circumstance occurred which developed my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it The annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violent discussion in Congress in the press and by individuals The administration of President Tyler then in power was making the most strenuous efforts to effect the annexation which was indeed the great and absorbing question of the day During these discussions the greater part of the single rifle regiment in the army the twod dragoons which had been dismounted a year or two before and designated Dismounted Rifles was stationed at Fort Jessup Louisiana some twenty five miles east of the Texas line to observe the frontier About the first of May the threed infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana to go into camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup and there await further orders The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way down the Mississippi within a few days after the receipt of this order About the time they started I obtained a leave of absence for twenty days to go to Ohio to visit my parents I was obliged to go to saint Louis to take a steamer for Louisville or Cincinnati or the first steamer going up the Ohio River to any point Before I left saint Louis orders were received at Jefferson Barracks for the fourth infantry to follow the threed A messenger was sent after me to stop my leaving but before he could reach me I was off totally ignorant of these events A day or two after my arrival at Bethel I received a letter from a classmate and fellow lieutenant in the fourth informing me of the circumstances related above and advising me not to open any letter post marked saint Louis or Jefferson Barracks until the expiration of my leave and saying that he would pack up my things and take them along for me His advice was not necessary for no other letter was sent to me I now discovered that I was exceedingly anxious to get back to Jefferson Barracks and I understood the reason without explanation from any one My leave of absence required me to report for duty at Jefferson Barracks at the end of twenty days I knew my regiment had gone up the Red River but I was not disposed to break the letter of my leave besides if I had proceeded to Louisiana direct I could not have reached there until after the expiration of my leave Accordingly at the end of the twenty days I reported for duty to Lieutenant Ewell commanding at Jefferson Barracks handing him at the same time my leave of absence After noticing the phraseology of the order leaves of absence were generally worded at the end of which time he will report for duty with his proper command he said he would give me an order to join my regiment in Louisiana I then asked for a few days leave before starting which he readily granted This was the same Ewell who acquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during the rebellion He was a man much esteemed and deservedly so in the old army and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars both in my estimation unholy I immediately procured a horse and started for the country taking no baggage with me of course There is an insignificant creek the Gravois between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its mouth There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run a coffee mill and at low water there is none running whatever On this occasion it had been raining heavily and when the creek was reached I found the banks full to overflowing and the current rapid I looked at it a moment to consider what to do One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where or to do anything not to turn back or stop until the thing intended was accomplished I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way depending upon making inquiries on the road and if I got past the place without knowing it instead of turning back I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction take that and come in by the other side So I struck into the stream and in an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by the current I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it wet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream I went on however to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my future brother in law We were not of the same size but the clothes answered every purpose until I got more of my own Before I returned I mustered up courage to make known in the most awkward manner imaginable the discovery I had made on learning that the fourth infantry had been ordered away from Jefferson Barracks The young lady afterwards admitted that she too although until then she had never looked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable to her had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account for when the regiment left Before separating it was definitely understood that at a convenient time we would join our fortunes and not let the removal of a regiment trouble us This was in May eighteen forty four It was the twenty twod of August eighteen forty eight before the fulfilment of this agreement My duties kept me on the frontier of Louisiana with the Army of Observation during the pendency of Annexation and afterwards I was absent through the war with Mexico provoked by the action of the army if not by the annexation itself During that time there was a constant correspondence between Miss Dent and myself but we only met once in the period of four years and three months In May eighteen forty five I procured a leave for twenty days visited saint Louis and obtained the consent of the parents for the union which had not been asked for before As already stated it was never my intention to remain in the army long but to prepare myself for a professorship in some college Accordingly soon after I was settled at Jefferson Barracks I wrote a letter to Professor Church Professor of Mathematics at West Point requesting him to ask my designation as his assistant when next a detail had to be made Assistant professors at West Point are all officers of the army supposed to be selected for their special fitness for the particular branch of study they are assigned to teach The answer from Professor Church was entirely satisfactory and no doubt I should have been detailed a year or two later but for the Mexican War coming on Accordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued in garrison with regularity if not persistency I reviewed my West Point course of mathematics during the seven months at Jefferson Barracks and read many valuable historical works besides an occasional novel To help my memory I kept a book in which I would write up from time to time my recollections of all I had read since last posting it When the regiment was ordered away I being absent at the time my effects were packed up by Lieutenant Haslett of the fourth infantry and taken along I never saw my journal after nor did I ever keep another except for a portion of the time while travelling abroad Often since a fear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet and fall into the hands of some malicious person who would publish it I know its appearance would cause me as much heart burning as my youthful horse trade or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes The threed infantry had selected camping grounds on the reservation at Fort Jessup about midway between the Red River and the Sabine Our orders required us to go into camp in the same neighborhood and await further instructions Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pine woods between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore about three miles from each and on high ground back from the river The place was given the name of Camp Salubrity and proved entitled to it The camp was on a high sandy pine ridge with spring branches in the valley in front and rear The springs furnished an abundance of cool pure water and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes which abound in that region in great multitudes and of great voracity In the valley they swarmed in myriads but never came to the summit of the ridge The regiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred and that was caused by an accident There was no intimation given that the removal of the threed and fourth regiments of infantry to the western border of Louisiana was occasioned in any way by the prospective annexation of Texas but it was generally understood that such was the case Ostensibly we were intended to prevent filibustering into Texas but really as a menace to Mexico in case she appeared to contemplate war Generally the officers of the army were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not but not so all of them For myself I was bitterly opposed to the measure and to this day regard the war which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory Texas was originally a state belonging to the republic of Mexico It extended from the Sabine River on the east to the Rio Grande on the west and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and east to the territory of the United States and New Mexico another Mexican state at that time on the north and west An empire in territory it had but a very sparse population until settled by Americans who had received authority from Mexico to colonize These colonists paid very little attention to the supreme government and introduced slavery into the state almost from the start though the constitution of Mexico did not nor does it now sanction that institution Soon they set up an independent government of their own and war existed between Texas and Mexico in name from that time until eighteen thirty six when active hostilities very nearly ceased upon the capture of Santa Anna the Mexican President Before long however the same people who with permission of Mexico had colonized Texas and afterwards set up slavery there and then seceded as soon as they felt strong enough to do so offered themselves and the State to the United States and in eighteen forty five their offer was accepted The occupation separation and annexation were from the inception of the movement to its final consummation a conspiracy to acquire territory out of which slave states might be formed for the American Union Even if the annexation itself could be justified the manner in which the subsequent war was forced upon Mexico cannot The fact is annexationists wanted more territory than they could possibly lay any claim to as part of the new acquisition Texas as an independent State never had exercised jurisdiction over the territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande Mexico had never recognized the independence of Texas and maintained that even if independent the State had no claim south of the Nueces I am aware that a treaty made by the Texans with Santa Anna while he was under duress ceded all the territory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande but he was a prisoner of war when the treaty was made and his life was in jeopardy He knew too that he deserved execution at the hands of the Texans if they should ever capture him The Texans if they had taken his life would have only followed the example set by Santa Anna himself a few years before when he executed the entire garrison of the Alamo and the villagers of Goliad In taking military possession of Texas after annexation the army of occupation under General Taylor was directed to occupy the disputed territory The army did not stop at the Nueces and offer to negotiate for a settlement of the boundary question but went beyond apparently in order to force Mexico to initiate war It is to the credit of the American nation however that after conquering Mexico and while practically holding the country in our possession so that we could have retained the whole of it or made any terms we chose we paid a round sum for the additional territory taken more than it was worth or was likely to be to Mexico To us it was an empire and of incalculable value but it might have been obtained by other means The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war Nations like individuals are punished for their transgressions We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times The fourth infantry went into camp at Salubrity in the month of May eighteen forty four with instructions as I have said to await further orders At first officers and men occupied ordinary tents As the summer heat increased these were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun The summer was whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers in visiting those stationed at and near Fort Jessup twenty five miles away visiting the planters on the Red River and the citizens of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore There was much pleasant intercourse between the inhabitants and the officers of the army I retain very agreeable recollections of my stay at Camp Salubrity and of the acquaintances made there and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers living who were there at the time I can call to mind only two officers of the fourth infantry besides myself who were at Camp Salubrity with the regiment who are now alive With a war in prospect and belonging to a regiment that had an unusual number of officers detailed on special duty away from the regiment my hopes of being ordered to West Point as instructor vanished At the time of which I now write officers in the quartermaster s commissary s and adjutant general s departments were appointed from the line of the army and did not vacate their regimental commissions until their regimental and staff commissions were for the same grades Generally lieutenants were appointed to captaincies to fill vacancies in the staff corps If they should reach a captaincy in the line before they arrived at a majority in the staff they would elect which commission they would retain In the fourth infantry in eighteen forty four at least six line officers were on duty in the staff and therefore permanently detached from the regiment Under these circumstances I gave up everything like a special course of reading and only read thereafter for my own amusement and not very much for that until the war was over I kept a horse and rode and staid out of doors most of the time by day and entirely recovered from the cough which I had carried from West Point and from all indications of consumption I have often thought that my life was saved and my health restored by exercise and exposure enforced by an administrative act and a war both of which I disapproved As summer wore away and cool days and colder nights came upon us the tents We were occupying ceased to afford comfortable quarters and further orders not reaching us we began to look about to remedy the hardship Men were put to work getting out timber to build huts and in a very short time all were comfortably housed privates as well as officers The outlay by the government in accomplishing this was nothing or nearly nothing The winter was spent more agreeably than the summer had been There were occasional parties given by the planters along the coast as the bottom lands on the Red River were called The climate was delightful Near the close of the short session of Congress of eighteen forty four five the bill for the annexation of Texas to the United States was passed It reached President Tyler on the first of March eighteen forty five and promptly received his approval When the news reached us we began to look again for further orders They did not arrive promptly and on the first of May following I asked and obtained a leave of absence for twenty days for the purpose of visiting saint Louis The object of this visit has been before stated Early in July the long expected orders were received but they only took the regiment to New Orleans Barracks We reached there before the middle of the month and again waited weeks for still further orders The yellow fever was raging in New Orleans during the time we remained there and the streets of the city had the appearance of a continuous well observed Sunday I recollect but one occasion when this observance seemed to be broken by the inhabitants One morning about daylight I happened to be awake and hearing the discharge of a rifle not far off I looked out to ascertain where the sound came from I observed a couple of clusters of men near by and learned afterwards that it was nothing only a couple of gentlemen deciding a difference of opinion with rifles at twenty paces I do not remember if either was killed or even hurt but no doubt the question of difference was settled satisfactorily and honorably in the estimation of the parties engaged I do not believe I ever would have the courage to fight a duel If any man should wrong me to the extent of my being willing to kill him I would not be willing to give him the choice of weapons with which it should be done and of the time place and distance separating us when I executed him If I should do another such a wrong as to justify him in killing me I would make any reasonable atonement within my power if convinced of the wrong done I place my opposition to duelling on higher grounds than here stated No doubt a majority of the duels fought have been for want of moral courage on the part of those engaged to decline At Camp Salubrity and when we went to New Orleans Barracks the fourth infantry was commanded by Colonel Vose then an old gentleman who had not commanded on drill for a number of years He was not a man to discover infirmity in the presence of danger It now appeared that war was imminent and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics Accordingly when we got settled down at our new post he took command of the regiment at a battalion drill Only two or three evolutions had been gone through when he dismissed the battalion and turning to go to his own quarters dropped dead He had not been complaining of ill health but no doubt died of heart disease He was a most estimable man of exemplary habits and by no means the author of his own disease CHAPTER IV CORPUS CHRISTI MEXICAN SMUGGLING SPANISH RULE IN MEXICO SUPPLYING TRANSPORTATION Early in September the regiment left New Orleans for Corpus Christi now in Texas Ocean steamers were not then common and the passage was made in sailing vessels At that time there was not more than three feet of water in the channel at the outlet of Corpus Christi Bay the debarkation therefore had to take place by small steamers and at an island in the channel called Shell Island the ships anchoring some miles out from shore This made the work slow and as the army was only supplied with one or two steamers it took a number of days to effect the landing of a single regiment with its stores camp and garrison equipage et cetera There happened to be pleasant weather while this was going on but the land swell was so great that when the ship and steamer were on opposite sides of the same wave they would be at considerable distance apart The men and baggage were let down to a point higher than the lower deck of the steamer and when ship and steamer got into the trough between the waves and were close together the load would be drawn over the steamer and rapidly run down until it rested on the deck After I had gone ashore and had been on guard several days at Shell Island quite six miles from the ship I had occasion for some reason or other to return on board While on the Suviah I think that was the name of our vessel I heard a tremendous racket at the other end of the ship and much and excited sailor language such as damn your eyes et cetera In a moment or two the captain who was an excitable little man dying with consumption and not weighing much over a hundred pounds came running out carrying a sabre nearly as large and as heavy as he was and crying that his men had mutinied It was necessary to sustain the captain without question and in a few minutes all the sailors charged with mutiny were in irons I rather felt for a time a wish that I had not gone aboard just then As the men charged with mutiny submitted to being placed in irons without resistance I always doubted if they knew that they had mutinied until they were told By the time I was ready to leave the ship again I thought I had learned enough of the working of the double and single pulley by which passengers were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamer below and determined to let myself down without assistance Without saying anything of my intentions to any one I mounted the railing and taking hold of the centre rope just below the upper block I put one foot on the hook below the lower block and stepped off just as I did so some one called out hold on It was too late I tried to hold on with all my might but my heels went up and my head went down so rapidly that my hold broke and I plunged head foremost into the water some twenty five feet below with such velocity that it seemed to me I never would stop When I came to the surface again being a fair swimmer and not having lost my presence of mind I swam around until a bucket was let down for me and I was drawn up without a scratch or injury I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized with me in the least when they found me uninjured I rather enjoyed the joke myself The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later and I believe before the mutineers were tried I hope they got clear because as before stated I always thought the mutiny was all in the brain of a very weak and sick man After reaching shore or Shell Island the labor of getting to Corpus Christi was slow and tedious There was if my memory serves me but one small steamer to transport troops and baggage when the fourth infantry arrived Others were procured later The distance from Shell Island to Corpus Christi was some sixteen or eighteen miles The channel to the bay was so shallow that the steamer small as it was had to be dragged over the bottom when loaded Not more than one trip a day could be effected Later this was remedied by deepening the channel and increasing the number of vessels suitable to its navigation Corpus Christi is near the head of the bay of the same name formed by the entrance of the Nueces River into tide water and is on the west bank of that bay At the time of its first occupancy by United States troops there was a small Mexican hamlet there containing probably less than one hundred souls There was in addition a small American trading post at which goods were sold to Mexican smugglers All goods were put up in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each suitable for loading on pack mules Two of these packages made a load for an ordinary Mexican mule and three for the larger ones The bulk of the trade was in leaf tobacco and domestic cotton cloths and calicoes The Mexicans had before the arrival of the army but little to offer in exchange except silver The trade in tobacco was enormous considering the population to be supplied Almost every Mexican above the age of ten years and many much younger smoked the cigarette Nearly every Mexican carried a pouch of leaf tobacco powdered by rolling in the hands and a roll of corn husks to make wrappers The cigarettes were made by the smokers as they used them Up to the time of which I write and for years afterwards I think until the administration of President Juarez the cultivation manufacture and sale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly and paid the bulk of the revenue collected from internal sources The price was enormously high and made successful smuggling very profitable The difficulty of obtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody male and female used it at that time I know from my own experience that when I was at West Point the fact that tobacco in every form was prohibited and the mere possession of the weed severely punished made the majority of the cadets myself included try to acquire the habit of using it I failed utterly at the time and for many years afterward but the majority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition Under Spanish rule Mexico was prohibited from producing anything that the mother country could supply This rule excluded the cultivation of the grape olive and many other articles to which the soil and climate were well adapted The country was governed for revenue only and tobacco which cannot be raised in Spain but is indigenous to Mexico offered a fine instrumentality for securing this prime object of government The native population had been in the habit of using the weed from a period back of any recorded history of this continent Bad habits if not restrained by law or public opinion spread more rapidly and universally than good ones and the Spanish colonists adopted the use of tobacco almost as generally as the natives Spain therefore in order to secure the largest revenue from this source prohibited the cultivation except in specified localities and in these places farmed out the privilege at a very high price The tobacco when raised could only be sold to the government and the price to the consumer was limited only by the avarice of the authorities and the capacity of the people to pay All laws for the government of the country were enacted in Spain and the officers for their execution were appointed by the Crown and sent out to the New El Dorado The Mexicans had been brought up ignorant of how to legislate or how to rule When they gained their independence after many years of war it was the most natural thing in the world that they should adopt as their own the laws then in existence The only change was that Mexico became her own executor of the laws and the recipient of the revenues The tobacco tax yielding so large a revenue under the law as it stood was one of the last if not the very last of the obnoxious imposts to be repealed Now the citizens are allowed to cultivate any crops the soil will yield Tobacco is cheap and every quality can be produced Its use is by no means so general as when I first visited the country Gradually the Army of Occupation assembled at Corpus Christi When it was all together it consisted of seven companies of the twod regiment of dragoons four companies of light artillery five regiments of infantry the threed fourth fifth seventh and eighth and one regiment of artillery acting as infantry not more than three thousand men in all General Zachary Taylor commanded the whole There were troops enough in one body to establish a drill and discipline sufficient to fit men and officers for all they were capable of in case of battle The rank and file were composed of men who had enlisted in time of peace to serve for seven dollars a month and were necessarily inferior as material to the average volunteers enlisted later in the war expressly to fight and also to the volunteers in the war for the preservation of the Union The men engaged in the Mexican war were brave and the officers of the regular army from highest to lowest were educated in their profession A more efficient army for its number and armament I do not believe ever fought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his first two engagements on Mexican or Texan soil The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed territory furthest from the Mexican settlements was not sufficient to provoke hostilities We were sent to provoke a fight but it was essential that Mexico should commence it It was very doubtful whether Congress would declare war but if Mexico should attack our troops the Executive could announce Whereas war exists by the acts of et cetera and prosecute the contest with vigor Once initiated there were but few public men who would have the courage to oppose it Experience proves that the man who obstructs a war in which his nation is engaged no matter whether right or wrong occupies no enviable place in life or history Better for him individually to advocate war pestilence and famine than to act as obstructionist to a war already begun The history of the defeated rebel will be honorable hereafter compared with that of the Northern man who aided him by conspiring against his government while protected by it The most favorable posthumous history the stay at home traitor can hope for is oblivion Mexico showing no willingness to come to the Nueces to drive the invaders from her soil it became necessary for the invaders to approach to within a convenient distance to be struck Accordingly preparations were begun for moving the army to the Rio Grande to a point near Matamoras It was desirable to occupy a position near the largest centre of population possible to reach without absolutely invading territory to which we set up no claim whatever The distance from Corpus Christi to Matamoras is about one hundred and fifty miles The country does not abound in fresh water and the length of the marches had to be regulated by the distance between water supplies Besides the streams there were occasional pools filled during the rainy season some probably made by the traders who travelled constantly between Corpus Christi and the Rio Grande and some by the buffalo There was not at that time a single habitation cultivated field or herd of domestic animals between Corpus Christi and Matamoras It was necessary therefore to have a wagon train sufficiently large to transport the camp and garrison equipage officers baggage rations for the army and part rations of grain for the artillery horses and all the animals taken from the north where they had been accustomed to having their forage furnished them The army was but indifferently supplied with transportation Wagons and harness could easily be supplied from the north but mules and horses could not so readily be brought The American traders and Mexican smugglers came to the relief Contracts were made for mules at from eight to eleven dollars each The smugglers furnished the animals and took their pay in goods of the description before mentioned I doubt whether the Mexicans received in value from the traders five dollars per head for the animals they furnished and still more whether they paid anything but their own time in procuring them Such is trade such is war The government paid in hard cash to the contractor the stipulated price Between the Rio Grande and the Nueces there was at that time a large band of wild horses feeding as numerous probably as the band of buffalo roaming further north was before its rapid extermination commenced The Mexicans used to capture these in large numbers and bring them into the American settlements and sell them A picked animal could be purchased at from eight to twelve dollars but taken at wholesale they could be bought for thirty six dollars a dozen Some of these were purchased for the army and answered a most useful purpose The horses were generally very strong formed much like the Norman horse and with very heavy manes and tails A number of officers supplied themselves with these and they generally rendered as useful service as the northern animal in fact they were much better when grazing was the only means of supplying forage There was no need for haste and some months were consumed in the necessary preparations for a move In the meantime the army was engaged in all the duties pertaining to the officer and the soldier Twice that I remember small trains were sent from Corpus Christi with cavalry escorts to San Antonio and Austin with paymasters and funds to pay off small detachments of troops stationed at those places General Taylor encouraged officers to accompany these expeditions I accompanied one of them in December eighteen forty five The distance from Corpus Christi to San Antonio was then computed at one hundred and fifty miles Now that roads exist it is probably less From San Antonio to Austin we computed the distance at one hundred and ten miles and from the latter place back to Corpus Christi at over two hundred miles I know the distance now from San Antonio to Austin is but little over eighty miles so that our computation was probably too high There was not at the time an individual living between Corpus Christi and San Antonio until within about thirty miles of the latter point where there were a few scattering Mexican settlements along the San Antonio River The people in at least one of these hamlets lived underground for protection against the Indians The country abounded in game such as deer and antelope with abundance of wild turkeys along the streams and where there were nut bearing woods On the Nueces about twenty five miles up from Corpus Christi were a few log cabins the remains of a town called San Patricio but the inhabitants had all been massacred by the Indians or driven away San Antonio was about equally divided in population between Americans and Mexicans From there to Austin there was not a single residence except at New Braunfels on the Guadalupe River At that point was a settlement of Germans who had only that year come into the State At all events they were living in small huts about such as soldiers would hastily construct for temporary occupation From Austin to Corpus Christi there was only a small settlement at Bastrop with a few farms along the Colorado River but after leaving that there were no settlements except the home of one man with one female slave at the old town of Goliad Some of the houses were still standing Goliad had been quite a village for the period and region but some years before there had been a Mexican massacre in which every inhabitant had been killed or driven away This with the massacre of the prisoners in the Alamo San Antonio about the same time more than three hundred men in all furnished the strongest justification the Texans had for carrying on the war with so much cruelty In fact from that time until the Mexican war the hostilities between Texans and Mexicans was so great that neither was safe in the neighborhood of the other who might be in superior numbers or possessed of superior arms The man we found living there seemed like an old friend he had come from near Fort Jessup Louisiana where the officers of the threed and fourth infantry and the twod dragoons had known him and his family He had emigrated in advance of his family to build up a home for them CHAPTER V TRIP TO AUSTIN PROMOTION TO FULL SECOND LIEUTENANT ARMY OF OCCUPATION When our party left Corpus Christi it was quite large including the cavalry escort Paymaster Major Dix his clerk and the officers who like myself were simply on leave but all the officers on leave except Lieutenant Benjamin afterwards killed in the valley of Mexico Lieutenant now General Augur and myself concluded to spend their allotted time at San Antonio and return from there We were all to be back at Corpus Christi by the end of the month The paymaster was detained in Austin so long that if we had waited for him we would have exceeded our leave We concluded therefore to start back at once with the animals we had and having to rely principally on grass for their food it was a good six days journey We had to sleep on the prairie every night except at Goliad and possibly one night on the Colorado without shelter and with only such food as we carried with us and prepared ourselves The journey was hazardous on account of Indians and there were white men in Texas whom I would not have cared to meet in a secluded place Lieutenant Augur was taken seriously sick before we reached Goliad and at a distance from any habitation To add to the complication his horse a mustang that had probably been captured from the band of wild horses before alluded to and of undoubted longevity at his capture gave out It was absolutely necessary to get for ward to Goliad to find a shelter for our sick companion By dint of patience and exceedingly slow movements Goliad was at last reached and a shelter and bed secured for our patient We remained over a day hoping that Augur might recover sufficiently to resume his travels He did not however and knowing that Major Dix would be along in a few days with his wagon train now empty and escort we arranged with our Louisiana friend to take the best of care of the sick lieutenant until thus relieved and went on I had never been a sportsman in my life had scarcely ever gone in search of game and rarely seen any when looking for it On this trip there was no minute of time while travelling between San Patricio and the settlements on the San Antonio River from San Antonio to Austin and again from the Colorado River back to San Patricio when deer or antelope could not be seen in great numbers Each officer carried a shot gun and every evening after going into camp some would go out and soon return with venison and wild turkeys enough for the entire camp I however never went out and had no occasion to fire my gun except being detained over a day at Goliad Benjamin and I concluded to go down to the creek which was fringed with timber much of it the pecan and bring back a few turkeys We had scarcely reached the edge of the timber when I heard the flutter of wings overhead and in an instant I saw two or three turkeys flying away These were soon followed by more then more and more until a flock of twenty or thirty had left from just over my head All this time I stood watching the turkeys to see where they flew with my gun on my shoulder and never once thought of levelling it at the birds When I had time to reflect upon the matter I came to the conclusion that as a sportsman I was a failure and went back to the house Benjamin remained out and got as many turkeys as he wanted to carry back After the second night at Goliad Benjamin and I started to make the remainder of the journey alone We reached Corpus Christi just in time to avoid absence without leave We met no one not even an Indian during the remainder of our journey except at San Patricio A new settlement had been started there in our absence of three weeks induced possibly by the fact that there were houses already built while the proximity of troops gave protection against the Indians On the evening of the first day out from Goliad we heard the most unearthly howling of wolves directly in our front The prairie grass was tall and we could not see the beasts but the sound indicated that they were near To my ear it appeared that there must have been enough of them to devour our party horses and all at a single meal The part of Ohio that I hailed from was not thickly settled but wolves had been driven out long before I left Benjamin was from Indiana still less populated where the wolf yet roamed over the prairies He understood the nature of the animal and the capacity of a few to make believe there was an unlimited number of them He kept on towards the noise unmoved I followed in his trail lacking moral courage to turn back and join our sick companion I have no doubt that if Benjamin had proposed returning to Goliad I would not only have seconded the motion but have suggested that it was very hard hearted in us to leave Augur sick there in the first place but Benjamin did not propose turning back When he did speak it was to ask Grant how many wolves do you think there are in that pack Knowing where he was from and suspecting that he thought I would over estimate the number I determined to show my acquaintance with the animal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct and answered Oh about twenty very indifferently He smiled and rode on In a minute we were close upon them and before they saw us There were just TWO of them Seated upon their haunches with their mouths close together they had made all the noise we had been hearing for the past ten minutes I have often thought of this incident since when I have heard the noise of a few disappointed politicians who had deserted their associates There are always more of them before they are counted A week or two before leaving Corpus Christi on this trip I had been promoted from brevet second lieutenant fourth infantry to full second lieutenant seventh infantry Frank Gardner one of the seventh was promoted to the fourth in the same orders We immediately made application to be transferred so as to get back to our old regiments On my return I found that our application had been approved at Washington While in the seventh infantry I was in the company of Captain Holmes afterwards a Lieutenant general in the Confederate army I never came in contact with him in the war of the Rebellion nor did he render any very conspicuous service in his high rank My transfer carried me to the company of Captain McCall who resigned from the army after the Mexican war and settled in Philadelphia He was prompt however to volunteer when the rebellion broke out and soon rose to the rank of major general in the Union army I was not fortunate enough to meet him after he resigned In the old army he was esteemed very highly as a soldier and gentleman Our relations were always most pleasant The preparations at Corpus Christi for an advance progressed as rapidly in the absence of some twenty or more lieutenants as if we had been there The principal business consisted in securing mules and getting them broken to harness The process was slow but amusing The animals sold to the government were all young and unbroken even to the saddle and were quite as wild as the wild horses of the prairie Usually a number would be brought in by a company of Mexicans partners in the delivery The mules were first driven into a stockade called a corral inclosing an acre or more of ground The Mexicans who were all experienced in throwing the lasso would go into the corral on horseback with their lassos attached to the pommels of their saddles Soldiers detailed as teamsters and black smiths would also enter the corral the former with ropes to serve as halters the latter with branding irons and a fire to keep the irons heated A lasso was then thrown over the neck of a mule when he would immediately go to the length of his tether first one end then the other in the air While he was thus plunging and gyrating another lasso would be thrown by another Mexican catching the animal by a fore foot This would bring the mule to the ground when he was seized and held by the teamsters while the blacksmith put upon him with hot irons the initials U S Ropes were then put about the neck with a slipnoose which would tighten around the throat if pulled With a man on each side holding these ropes the mule was released from his other bindings and allowed to rise With more or less difficulty he would be conducted to a picket rope outside and fastened there The delivery of that mule was then complete This process was gone through with every mule and wild horse with the army of occupation The method of breaking them was less cruel and much more amusing It is a well known fact that where domestic animals are used for specific purposes from generation to generation the descendants are easily as a rule subdued to the same uses At that time in Northern Mexico the mule or his ancestors the horse and the ass was seldom used except for the saddle or pack At all events the Corpus Christi mule resisted the new use to which he was being put The treatment he was subjected to in order to overcome his prejudices was summary and effective The soldiers were principally foreigners who had enlisted in our large cities and with the exception of a chance drayman among them it is not probable that any of the men who reported themselves as competent teamsters had ever driven a mule team in their lives or indeed that many had had any previous experience in driving any animal whatever to harness Numbers together can accomplish what twice their number acting individually could not perform Five mules were allotted to each wagon A teamster would select at the picket rope five animals of nearly the same color and general appearance for his team With a full corps of assistants other teamsters he would then proceed to get his mules together In two s the men would approach each animal selected avoiding as far as possible its heels Two ropes would be put about the neck of each animal with a slip noose so that he could be choked if too unruly They were then led out harnessed by force and hitched to the wagon in the position they had to keep ever after Two men remained on either side of the leader with the lassos about its neck and one man retained the same restraining influence over each of the others All being ready the hold would be slackened and the team started The first motion was generally five mules in the air at one time backs bowed hind feet extended to the rear After repeating this movement a few times the leaders would start to run This would bring the breeching tight against the mules at the wheels which these last seemed to regard as a most unwarrantable attempt at coercion and would resist by taking a seat sometimes going so far as to lie down In time all were broken in to do their duty submissively if not cheerfully but there never was a time during the war when it was safe to let a Mexican mule get entirely loose Their drivers were all teamsters by the time they got through I recollect one case of a mule that had worked in a team under the saddle not only for some time at Corpus Christi where he was broken but all the way to the point opposite Matamoras then to Camargo where he got loose from his fastenings during the night He did not run away at first but staid in the neighborhood for a day or two coming up sometimes to the feed trough even but on the approach of the teamster he always got out of the way At last growing tired of the constant effort to catch him he disappeared altogether Nothing short of a Mexican with his lasso could have caught him Regulations would not have warranted the expenditure of a dollar in hiring a man with a lasso to catch that mule but they did allow the expenditure of the mule on a certificate that he had run away without any fault of the quartermaster on whose returns he was borne and also the purchase of another to take his place I am a competent witness for I was regimental quartermaster at the time While at Corpus Christi all the officers who had a fancy for riding kept horses The animals cost but little in the first instance and when picketed they would get their living without any cost I had three not long before the army moved but a sad accident bereft me of them all at one time A colored boy who gave them all the attention they got besides looking after my tent and that of a class mate and fellow lieutenant and cooking for us all for about eight dollars per month was riding one to water and leading the other two The led horses pulled him from his seat and all three ran away They never were heard of afterwards Shortly after that some one told Captain Bliss General Taylor s Adjutant General of my misfortune Yes I heard Grant lost five or six dollars worth of horses the other day he replied That was a slander they were broken to the saddle when I got them and cost nearly twenty dollars I never suspected the colored boy of malicious intent in letting them get away because if they had not escaped he could have had one of them to ride on the long march then in prospect CHAPTER VI ADVANCE OF THE ARMY CROSSING THE COLORADO THE RIO GRANDE 
4196-23901-0000	train-other-500	At last the preparations were complete
none	none	 and orders were issued for the advance to begin 
4196-23901-0001	train-other-500	on the eighth of March General Taylor had an army of not more than three thousand men One battery the siege guns and all the convalescent troops were sent on by water
none	none	 to Brazos Santiago at the mouth of the Rio Grande A guard was left back at Corpus Christi 
4196-23901-0002	train-other-500	to look after public property and to take care of those who were too sick to be removed The remainder of the army probably not more than twenty five hundred men was divided into three brigades
4196-23901-0003	train-other-500	with the cavalry independent Colonel Twiggs with seven companies of dragoons and a battery of light artillery moved on the eighth He was followed
none	none	 by the three infantry brigades with a day s interval between the commands Thus the rear brigade did not move from Corpus Christi until the eleventh of March 
4196-23901-0004	train-other-500	In view of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day over narrow roads through dense forests and across large streams in our late war
4196-23901-0005	train-other-500	it seems strange now that a body of less than three thousand men
none	none	 should have been broken into four columns separated by a day s march 
4196-23901-0006	train-other-500	General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the troops and in this instance I doubt not he looked upon the enemy as the aggrieved party
4196-23901-0007	train-other-500	and was not willing to injure them further than his instructions from Washington demanded His orders to the troops enjoined scrupulous regard for the rights of all peaceable persons and the payment
none	none	 of the highest price for all supplies taken for the use of the army All officers of foot regiments who had horses were permitted to ride them on the march 
4196-23901-0008	train-other-500	when it did not interfere with their military duties As already related having lost my five or six dollars worth of horses but a short time before
none	none	 I determined not to get another but to make the journey on foot My company commander Captain McCall had two good American horses of considerably more value in that country where native horses were cheap 
4196-23901-0010	train-other-500	than they were in the States He used one himself and wanted the other for his servant He was quite anxious to know whether I did not intend to get me another horse before the march began
4196-23901-0011	train-other-500	I told him No I belonged to a foot regiment I did not understand the object of his solicitude at the time but when we were about to start he said There Grant is a horse for you
4196-23901-0012	train-other-500	I found that he could not bear the idea of his servant riding on a long march while his lieutenant went a foot He had found a mustang a three year old colt
4196-23901-0013	train-other-500	only recently captured which had been purchased by one of the colored servants with the regiment for the sum of three dollars It was probably the only horse at Corpus Christi
4196-23901-0014	train-other-500	that could have been purchased just then for any reasonable price Five dollars sixty six and two thirds per cent advance induced the owner to part with the mustang
4196-23901-0015	train-other-500	I was sorry to take him because I really felt that belonging to a foot regiment it was my duty to march with the men But I saw the Captain s earnestness in the matter and accepted the horse for the trip
4196-23901-0016	train-other-500	The day we started was the first time the horse had ever been under saddle I had however but little difficulty in breaking him though for the first day there were frequent disagreements between us
4196-23901-0017	train-other-500	as to which way we should go and sometimes whether we should go at all At no time during the day could I choose exactly the part of the column I would march with
4196-23901-0018	train-other-500	but after that I had as tractable a horse as any with the army and there was none that stood the trip better He never ate a mouthful of food on the journey except the grass he could pick
4196-23901-0019	train-other-500	within the length of his picket rope A few days out from Corpus Christi the immense herd of wild horses that ranged at that time
none	none	 between the Nueces and the Rio Grande was seen directly in advance of the head of the column 
4196-23901-0020	train-other-500	and but a few miles off It was the very band from which the horse I was riding had been captured but a few weeks before The column was halted for a rest and a number of officers myself among them
4196-23901-0021	train-other-500	rode out two or three miles to the right to see the extent of the herd The country was a rolling prairie and from the higher ground the vision was obstructed only by the earth s curvature
4196-23901-0022	train-other-500	As far as the eye could reach to our right the herd extended To the left it extended equally There was no estimating the number of animals in it I have no idea
4196-23901-0023	train-other-500	that they could all have been corralled in the State of Rhode Island or Delaware at one time If they had been they would have been so thick that the pasturage would have given out the first day People
4196-23901-0024	train-other-500	who saw the Southern herd of buffalo fifteen or twenty years ago can appreciate the size of the Texas band of wild horses in eighteen forty six At the point where the army struck the Little Colorado River
4196-23901-0025	train-other-500	the stream was quite wide and of sufficient depth for navigation The water was brackish and the banks were fringed with timber Here the whole army concentrated before attempting to cross
4196-23901-0026	train-other-500	The army was not accompanied by a pontoon train and at that time the troops were not instructed in bridge building To add to the embarrassment of the situation the army was here for the first time threatened
4196-23901-0027	train-other-500	with opposition Buglers concealed from our view by the brush on the opposite side sounded the assembly and other military calls
none	none	 Like the wolves before spoken of they gave the impression that there was a large number of them and that 
4196-23901-0028	train-other-500	if the troops were in proportion to the noise they were sufficient to devour General Taylor and his army
none	none	 There were probably but few troops and those engaged principally 
4196-23901-0029	train-other-500	in watching the movements of the invader
none	none	 A few of our cavalry dashed in and forded and swam the stream 
4196-23901-0030	train-other-500	and all opposition was soon dispersed I do not remember that a single shot was fired The troops waded the stream which was up to their necks in the deepest part
4196-23901-0031	train-other-500	Teams were crossed by attaching a long rope to the end of the wagon tongue passing it between the two swing mules and by the side of the leader
4196-23901-0032	train-other-500	hitching his bridle as well as the bridle of the mules in rear to it and carrying the end to men on the opposite shore
4196-23901-0033	train-other-500	The bank down to the water was steep on both sides A rope long enough to cross the river therefore was attached to the back axle of the wagon and men behind would hold the rope
4196-23901-0034	train-other-500	to prevent the wagon beating the mules into the water This latter rope also served the purpose of bringing the end of the forward one back to be used over again
none	none	 The water was deep enough for a short distance 
4196-23901-0035	train-other-500	to swim the little Mexican mules which the army was then using but they and the wagons were pulled through so fast by the men at the end of the rope ahead that no time was left them to show their obstinacy
4196-23901-0036	train-other-500	In this manner the artillery and transportation of the army of occupation crossed the Colorado River About the middle of the month of March
none	none	 the advance of the army reached the Rio Grande and went into camp near the banks of the river 
4196-23901-0037	train-other-500	opposite the city of Matamoras and almost under the guns of a small fort at the lower end of the town There was not at that time a single habitation from Corpus Christi
none	none	 until the Rio Grande was reached The work of fortifying was commenced at once The fort was laid out by the engineers but the work was done by the soldiers under the supervision of their officers the chief engineer retaining general directions The Mexicans now became so incensed at our near approach that some of their troops crossed the river above us and made it unsafe for small bodies of men to go far beyond 
4196-23901-0038	train-other-500	the limits of camp They captured two companies of dragoons commanded by Captains Thornton and Hardee The latter figured as a general in the late war on the Confederate side
none	none	 and was author of the tactics first used by both armies Lieutenant Theodric Porter 
4196-23901-0039	train-other-500	of the fourth infantry was killed while out with a small detachment and Major Cross the assistant quartermaster general had also been killed not far from camp There was no base of supplies nearer
4196-23901-0040	train-other-500	than Point Isabel on the coast north of the mouth of the Rio Grande and
none	none	 twenty five miles away 
4196-23901-0041	train-other-500	The enemy if the Mexicans could be called such at this time when no war had been declared hovered about in such numbers that it was not safe to send a wagon train after supplies with any escort that could be spared
none	none	 I have already said that General Taylor s whole command on the Rio Grande numbered 
4196-23901-0042	train-other-500	less than three thousand men He had however a few more troops at Point Isabel or Brazos Santiago The supplies brought from Corpus Christi in wagons were running short
4196-23901-0043	train-other-500	Work was therefore pushed with great vigor on the defences to enable the minimum number of troops to hold the fort All the men who could be employed were kept at work from early dawn until darkness closed the labors of the day
4196-23901-0044	train-other-500	With all this the fort was not completed until the supplies grew so short that further delay in obtaining more could not be thought of
4196-23901-0045	train-other-500	By the latter part of April the work was in a partially defensible condition and the seventh infantry Major Jacob Brown commanding was marched in to garrison it with some few pieces of artillery
4196-23901-0046	train-other-500	All the supplies on hand with the exception of enough to carry the rest of the army to Point Isabel were left with the garrison and the march was commenced with the remainder of the command every wagon being taken with the army
none	none	 Early on the second day after starting the force reached its destination without opposition from the Mexicans There was some delay in getting supplies ashore from vessels at anchor in the open roadstead CHAPTER VII THE MEXICAN WAR THE BATTLE OF PALO ALTO THE BATTLE OF RESACA DE LA PALMA ARMY OF INVASION GENERAL TAYLOR MOVEMENT ON CAMARGO While General Taylor was away with the bulk of his army the little garrison up the river was besieged As we lay in our tents upon the sea shore the artillery at the fort on the Rio Grande could be distinctly heard The war had begun There were no possible means of obtaining news from the garrison and information from outside could not be otherwise than unfavorable What General Taylor s feelings were during this suspense I do not know but for myself a young second lieutenant who had never heard a hostile gun before I felt sorry that I had enlisted A great many men when they smell battle afar off chafe to get into the fray When they say so themselves they generally fail to convince their hearers that they are as anxious as they would like to make believe and as they approach danger they become more subdued This rule is not universal for I have known a few men who were always aching for a fight when there was no enemy near who were as good as their word when the battle did come But the number of such men is small On the seventh of May the wagons were all loaded and General Taylor started on his return with his army reinforced at Point Isabel but still less than three thousand strong to relieve the garrison on the Rio Grande The road from Point Isabel to Matamoras is over an open rolling treeless prairie until the timber that borders the bank of the Rio Grande is reached This river like the Mississippi flows through a rich alluvial valley in the most meandering manner running towards all points of the compass at times within a few miles Formerly the river ran by Resaca de la Palma some four or five miles east of the present channel The old bed of the river at Resaca had become filled at places leaving a succession of little lakes The timber that had formerly grown upon both banks and for a considerable distance out was still standing This timber was struck six or eight miles out from the besieged garrison at a point known as Palo Alto Tall trees or woods Early in the forenoon of the eighth of May as Palo Alto was approached an army certainly outnumbering our little force was seen drawn up in line of battle just in front of the timber Their bayonets and spearheads glistened in the sunlight formidably The force was composed largely of cavalry armed with lances Where we were the grass was tall reaching nearly to the shoulders of the men very stiff and each stock was pointed at the top and hard and almost as sharp as a darning needle General Taylor halted his army before the head of column came in range of the artillery of the Mexicans He then formed a line of battle facing the enemy His artillery two batteries and two eighteen pounder iron guns drawn by oxen were placed in position at intervals along the line A battalion was thrown to the rear commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Childs of the artillery as reserves These preparations completed orders were given for a platoon of each company to stack arms and go to a stream off to the right of the command to fill their canteens and also those of the rest of their respective companies When the men were all back in their places in line the command to advance was given As I looked down that long line of about three thousand armed men advancing towards a larger force also armed I thought what a fearful responsibility General Taylor must feel commanding such a host and so far away from friends The Mexicans immediately opened fire upon us first with artillery and then with infantry At first their shots did not reach us and the advance was continued As we got nearer the cannon balls commenced going through the ranks They hurt no one however during this advance because they would strike the ground long before they reached our line and ricochetted through the tall grass so slowly that the men would see them and open ranks and let them pass When we got to a point where the artillery could be used with effect a halt was called and the battle opened on both sides The infantry under General Taylor was armed with flint lock muskets and paper cartridges charged with powder buck shot and ball At the distance of a few hundred yards a man might fire at you all day without your finding it out The artillery was generally six pounder brass guns throwing only solid shot but General Taylor had with him three or four twelve pounder howitzers throwing shell besides his eighteen pounders before spoken of that had a long range This made a powerful armament The Mexicans were armed about as we were so far as their infantry was concerned but their artillery only fired solid shot We had greatly the advantage in this arm The artillery was advanced a rod or two in front of the line and opened fire The infantry stood at order arms as spectators watching the effect of our shots upon the enemy and watching his shots so as to step out of their way It could be seen that the eighteen pounders and the howitzers did a great deal of execution On our side there was little or no loss while we occupied this position During the battle Major Ringgold an accomplished and brave artillery officer was mortally wounded and Lieutenant Luther also of the artillery was struck During the day several advances were made and just at dusk it became evident that the Mexicans were falling back We again advanced and occupied at the close of the battle substantially the ground held by the enemy at the beginning In this last move there was a brisk fire upon our troops and some execution was done One cannon ball passed through our ranks not far from me It took off the head of an enlisted man and the under jaw of Captain Page of my regiment while the splinters from the musket of the killed soldier and his brains and bones knocked down two or three others including one officer Lieutenant Wallen hurting them more or less Our casualties for the day were nine killed and forty seven wounded At the break of day on the ninth the army under Taylor was ready to renew the battle but an advance showed that the enemy had entirely left our front during the night The chaparral before us was impenetrable except where there were roads or trails with occasionally clear or bare spots of small dimensions A body of men penetrating it might easily be ambushed It was better to have a few men caught in this way than the whole army yet it was necessary that the garrison at the river should be relieved To get to them the chaparral had to be passed Thus I assume General Taylor reasoned He halted the army not far in advance of the ground occupied by the Mexicans the day before and selected Captain C F Smith of the artillery and Captain McCall of my company to take one hundred and fifty picked men each and find where the enemy had gone This left me in command of the company an honor and responsibility I thought very great Smith and McCall found no obstruction in the way of their advance until they came up to the succession of ponds before describes at Resaca The Mexicans had passed them and formed their lines on the opposite bank This position they had strengthened a little by throwing up dead trees and brush in their front and by placing artillery to cover the approaches and open places Smith and McCall deployed on each side of the road as well as they could and engaged the enemy at long range Word was sent back and the advance of the whole army was at once commenced As we came up we were deployed in like manner I was with the right wing and led my company through the thicket wherever a penetrable place could be found taking advantage of any clear spot that would carry me towards the enemy At last I got pretty close up without knowing it The balls commenced to whistle very thick overhead cutting the limbs of the chaparral right and left We could not see the enemy so I ordered my men to lie down an order that did not have to be enforced We kept our position until it became evident that the enemy were not firing at us and then withdrew to find better ground to advance upon By this time some progress had been made on our left A section of artillery had been captured by the cavalry and some prisoners had been taken The Mexicans were giving way all along the line and many of them had no doubt left early I at last found a clear space separating two ponds There seemed to be a few men in front and I charged upon them with my company There was no resistance and we captured a Mexican colonel who had been wounded and a few men Just as I was sending them to the rear with a guard of two or three men a private came from the front bringing back one of our officers who had been badly wounded in advance of where I was The ground had been charged over before My exploit was equal to that of the soldier who boasted that he had cut off the leg of one of the enemy When asked why he did not cut off his head he replied Some one had done that before This left no doubt in my mind but that the battle of Resaca de la Palma would have been won just as it was if I had not been there There was no further resistance The evening of the ninth the army was encamped on its old ground near the Fort and the garrison was relieved The siege had lasted a number of days but the casualties were few in number Major Jacob Brown of the seventh infantry the commanding officer had been killed and in his honor the fort was named Since then a town of considerable importance has sprung up on the ground occupied by the fort and troops which has also taken his name The battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma seemed to us engaged as pretty important affairs but we had only a faint conception of their magnitude until they were fought over in the North by the Press and the reports came back to us At the same time or about the same time we learned that war existed between the United States and Mexico by the acts of the latter country On learning this fact General Taylor transferred our camps to the south or west bank of the river and Matamoras was occupied We then became the Army of Invasion Up to this time Taylor had none but regular troops in his command but now that invasion had already taken place volunteers for one year commenced arriving The army remained at Matamoras until sufficiently reinforced to warrant a movement into the interior General Taylor was not an officer to trouble the administration much with his demands but was inclined to do the best he could with the means given him He felt his responsibility as going no further If he had thought that he was sent to perform an impossibility with the means given him he would probably have informed the authorities of his opinion and left them to determine what should be done If the judgment was against him he would have gone on and done the best he could with the means at hand without parading his grievance before the public No soldier could face either danger or responsibility more calmly than he These are qualities more rarely found than genius or physical courage General Taylor never made any great show or parade either of uniform or retinue In dress he was possibly too plain rarely wearing anything in the field to indicate his rank or even that he was an officer but he was known to every soldier in his army and was respected by all I can call to mind only one instance when I saw him in uniform and one other when I heard of his wearing it On both occasions he was unfortunate The first was at Corpus Christi He had concluded to review his army before starting on the march and gave orders accordingly Colonel Twiggs was then second in rank with the army and to him was given the command of the review Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Worth a far different soldier from Taylor in the use of the uniform was next to Twiggs in rank and claimed superiority by virtue of his brevet rank when the accidents of service threw them where one or the other had to command Worth declined to attend the review as subordinate to Twiggs until the question was settled by the highest authority This broke up the review and the question was referred to Washington for final decision General Taylor was himself only a colonel in real rank at that time and a brigadier general by brevet He was assigned to duty however by the President with the rank which his brevet gave him Worth was not so assigned but by virtue of commanding a division he must under the army regulations of that day have drawn the pay of his brevet rank The question was submitted to Washington and no response was received until after the army had reached the Rio Grande It was decided against General Worth who at once tendered his resignation and left the army going north no doubt by the same vessel that carried it This kept him out of the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma Either the resignation was not accepted or General Worth withdrew it before action had been taken At all events he returned to the army in time to command his division in the battle of Monterey and served with it to the end of the war The second occasion on which General Taylor was said to have donned his uniform was in order to receive a visit from the Flag Officer of the naval squadron off the mouth of the Rio Grande While the army was on that river the Flag Officer sent word that he would call on the General to pay his respects on a certain day General Taylor knowing that naval officers habitually wore all the uniform the law allowed on all occasions of ceremony thought it would be only civil to receive his guest in the same style His uniform was therefore got out brushed up and put on in advance of the visit The Flag Officer knowing General Taylor s aversion to the wearing of the uniform and feeling that it would be regarded as a compliment should he meet him in civilian s dress left off his uniform for this occasion The meeting was said to have been embarrassing to both and the conversation was principally apologetic The time was whiled away pleasantly enough at Matamoras while we were waiting for volunteers It is probable that all the most important people of the territory occupied by our army left their homes before we got there but with those remaining the best of relations apparently existed It was the policy of the Commanding General to allow no pillaging no taking of private property for public or individual use without satisfactory compensation so that a better market was afforded than the people had ever known before Among the troops that joined us at Matamoras was an Ohio regiment of which Thomas L Hamer the Member of Congress who had given me my appointment to West Point was major He told me then that he could have had the colonelcy but that as he knew he was to be appointed a brigadier general he preferred at first to take the lower grade I have said before that Hamer was one of the ablest men Ohio ever produced At that time he was in the prime of life being less than fifty years of age and possessed an admirable physique promising long life But he was taken sick before Monterey and died within a few days I have always believed that had his life been spared he would have been President of the United States during the term filled by President Pierce Had Hamer filled that office his partiality for me was such there is but little doubt I should have been appointed to one of the staff corps of the army the Pay Department probably and would therefore now be preparing to retire Neither of these speculations is unreasonable and they are mentioned to show how little men control their own destiny Reinforcements having arrived in the month of August the movement commenced from Matamoras to Camargo the head of navigation on the Rio Grande The line of the Rio Grande was all that was necessary to hold unless it was intended to invade Mexico from the North In that case the most natural route to take was the one which General Taylor selected It entered a pass in the Sierra Madre Mountains at Monterey through which the main road runs to the City of Mexico Monterey itself was a good point to hold even if the line of the Rio Grande covered all the territory we desired to occupy at that time It is built on a plain two thousand feet above tide water where the air is bracing and the situation healthy On the nineteenth of August the army started for Monterey leaving a small garrison at Matamoras The troops with the exception of the artillery cavalry and the brigade to which I belonged were moved up the river to Camargo on steamers As there were but two or three of these the boats had to make a number of trips before the last of the troops were up Those who marched did so by the south side of the river Lieutenant Colonel Garland of the fourth infantry was the brigade commander and on this occasion commanded the entire marching force One day out convinced him that marching by day in that latitude in the month of August was not a beneficial sanitary measure particularly for Northern men The order of marching was changed and night marches were substituted with the best results When Camargo was reached we found a city of tents outside the Mexican hamlet I was detailed to act as quartermaster and commissary to the regiment The teams that had proven abundantly sufficient to transport all supplies from Corpus Christi to the Rio Grande over the level prairies of Texas were entirely inadequate to the needs of the reinforced army in a mountainous country To obviate the deficiency pack mules were hired with Mexicans to pack and drive them I had charge of the few wagons allotted to the fourth infantry and of the pack train to supplement them There were not men enough in the army to manage that train without the help of Mexicans who had learned how As it was the difficulty was great enough The troops would take up their march at an early hour each day After they had started the tents and cooking utensils had to be made into packages so that they could be lashed to the backs of the mules Sheet iron kettles tent poles and mess chests were inconvenient articles to transport in that way It took several hours to get ready to start each morning and by the time we were ready some of the mules first loaded would be tired of standing so long with their loads on their backs Sometimes one would start to run bowing his back and kicking up until he scattered his load others would lie down and try to disarrange their loads by attempting to get on the top of them by rolling on them others with tent poles for part of their loads would manage to run a tent pole on one side of a sapling while they would take the other I am not aware of ever having used a profane expletive in my life but I would have the charity to excuse those who may have done so if they were in charge of a train of Mexican pack mules at the time CHAPTER VIII ADVANCE ON MONTEREY THE BLACK FORT THE BATTLE OF MONTEREY SURRENDER OF THE CITY The advance from Camargo was commenced on the fifth of September The army was divided into four columns separated from each other by one day s march The advance reached Cerralvo in four days and halted for the remainder of the troops to come up By the thirteenth the rear guard had arrived and the same day the advance resumed its march followed as before a day separating the divisions The forward division halted again at Marin twenty four miles from Monterey Both this place and Cerralvo were nearly deserted and men women and children were seen running and scattered over the hills as we approached but when the people returned they found all their abandoned property safe which must have given them a favorable opinion of Los Grengos the Yankees From Marin the movement was in mass On the nineteenth General Taylor with is army was encamped at Walnut Springs within three miles of Monterey The town is on a small stream coming out of the mountain pass and is backed by a range of hills of moderate elevation To the north between the city and Walnut Springs stretches an extensive plain On this plain and entirely outside of the last houses of the city stood a strong fort enclosed on all sides to which our army gave the name of Black Fort Its guns commanded the approaches to the city to the full extent of their range There were two detached spurs of hills or mountains to the north and northwest of the city which were also fortified On one of these stood the Bishop s Palace The road to Saltillo leaves the upper or western end of the city under the fire of the guns from these heights The lower or eastern end was defended by two or three small detached works armed with artillery and infantry To the south was the mountain stream before mentioned and back of that the range of foot hills The plaza in the centre of the city was the citadel properly speaking All the streets leading from it were swept by artillery cannon being intrenched behind temporary parapets The house tops near the plaza were converted into infantry fortifications by the use of sand bags for parapets Such were the defences of Monterey in September eighteen forty seven General Ampudia with a force of certainly ten thousand men was in command General Taylor s force was about six thousand five hundred strong in three divisions under Generals Butler Twiggs and Worth The troops went into camp at Walnut Springs while the engineer officers under Major Mansfield a General in the late war commenced their reconnoissance Major Mansfield found that it would be practicable to get troops around out of range of the Black Fort and the works on the detached hills to the north west of the city to the Saltillo road With this road in our possession the enemy would be cut off from receiving further supplies if not from all communication with the interior General Worth with his division somewhat reinforced was given the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road and of carrying the detached works outside the city in that quarter He started on his march early in the afternoon of the twentieth The divisions under Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to threaten the east and north sides of the city and the works on those fronts in support of the movement under General Worth Worth s was regarded as the main attack on Monterey and all other operations were in support of it His march this day was uninterrupted but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily about the Bishop s Palace and the other outside fortifications on their left General Worth reached a defensible position just out of range of the enemy s guns on the heights north west of the city and bivouacked for the night The engineer officers with him Captain Sanders and Lieutenant George G Meade afterwards the commander of the victorious National army at the battle of Gettysburg made a reconnoissance to the Saltillo road under cover of night During the night of the twentieth General Taylor had established a battery consisting of two twenty four pounder howitzers and a ten inch mortar at a point from which they could play upon Black Fort A natural depression in the plain sufficiently deep to protect men standing in it from the fire from the fort was selected and the battery established on the crest nearest the enemy The fourth infantry then consisting of but six reduced companies was ordered to support the artillerists while they were intrenching themselves and their guns I was regimental quartermaster at the time and was ordered to remain in charge of camp and the public property at Walnut Springs It was supposed that the regiment would return to its camp in the morning The point for establishing the siege battery was reached and the work performed without attracting the attention of the enemy At daylight the next morning fire was opened on both sides and continued with what seemed to me at that day great fury My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I mounted a horse and rode to the front to see what was going on I had been there but a short time when an order to charge was given and lacking the moral courage to return to camp where I had been ordered to stay I charged with the regiment As soon as the troops were out of the depression they came under the fire of Black Fort As they advanced they got under fire from batteries guarding the east or lower end of the city and of musketry About one third of the men engaged in the charge were killed or wounded in the space of a few minutes We retreated to get out of fire not backward but eastward and perpendicular to the direct road running into the city from Walnut Springs I was I believe the only person in the fourth infantry in the charge who was on horseback When we got to a lace of safety the regiment halted and drew itself together what was left of it The adjutant of the regiment Lieutenant Hoskins who was not in robust health found himself very much fatigued from running on foot in the charge and retreat and seeing me on horseback expressed a wish that he could be mounted also I offered him my horse and he accepted the offer A few minutes later I saw a soldier a quartermaster s man mounted not far away I ran to him took his horse and was back with the regiment in a few minutes In a short time we were off again and the next place of safety from the shots of the enemy that I recollect of being in was a field of cane or corn to the north east of the lower batteries The adjutant to whom I had loaned my horse was killed and I was designated to act in his place This charge was ill conceived or badly executed We belonged to the brigade commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Garland and he had received orders to charge the lower batteries of the city and carry them if he could without too much loss for the purpose of creating a diversion in favor of Worth who was conducting the movement which it was intended should be decisive By a movement by the left flank Garland could have led his men beyond the range of the fire from Black Fort and advanced towards the northeast angle of the city as well covered from fire as could be expected There was no undue loss of life in reaching the lower end of Monterey except that sustained by Garland s command Meanwhile Quitman s brigade conducted by an officer of engineers had reached the eastern end of the city and was placed under cover of the houses without much loss Colonel Garland s brigade also arrived at the suburbs and by the assistance of some of our troops that had reached house tops from which they could fire into a little battery covering the approaches to the lower end of the city the battery was speedily captured and its guns were turned upon another work of the enemy An entrance into the east end of the city was now secured and the houses protected our troops so long as they were inactive On the west General Worth had reached the Saltillo road after some fighting but without heavy loss He turned from his new position and captured the forts on both heights in that quarter This gave him possession of the upper or west end of Monterey Troops from both Twiggs s and Butler s divisions were in possession of the east end of the town but the Black Fort to the north of the town and the plaza in the centre were still in the possession of the enemy Our camps at Walnut Springs three miles away were guarded by a company from each regiment A regiment of Kentucky volunteers guarded the mortars and howitzers engaged against Black Fort Practically Monterey was invested There was nothing done on the twenty twod by the United States troops but the enemy kept up a harmless fire upon us from Black Fort and the batteries still in their possession at the east end of the city During the night they evacuated these so that on the morning of the twenty threed we held undisputed possession of the east end of Monterey Twiggs s division was at the lower end of the city and well covered from the fire of the enemy But the streets leading to the plaza all Spanish or Spanish American towns have near their centres a square called a plaza were commanded from all directions by artillery The houses were flat roofed and but one or two stories high and about the plaza the roofs were manned with infantry the troops being protected from our fire by parapets made of sand bags All advances into the city were thus attended with much danger While moving along streets which did not lead to the plaza our men were protected from the fire and from the view of the enemy except at the crossings but at these a volley of musketry and a discharge of grape shot were invariably encountered The threed and fourth regiments of infantry made an advance nearly to the plaza in this way and with heavy loss The loss of the threed infantry in commissioned officers was especially severe There were only five companies of the regiment and not over twelve officers present and five of these officers were killed When within a square of the plaza this small command ten companies in all was brought to a halt Placing themselves under cover from the shots of the enemy the men would watch to detect a head above the sand bags on the neighboring houses The exposure of a single head would bring a volley from our soldiers We had not occupied this position long when it was discovered that our ammunition was growing low I volunteered to go back two to the point we had started from report our position to General Twiggs and ask for ammunition to be forwarded We were at this time occupying ground off from the street in rear of the houses My ride back was an exposed one Before starting I adjusted myself on the side of my horse furthest from the enemy and with only one foot holding to the cantle of the saddle and an arm over the neck of the horse exposed I started at full run It was only at street crossings that my horse was under fire but these I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I was past and under cover of the next block of houses before the enemy fired I got out safely without a scratch At one place on my ride I saw a sentry walking in front of a house and stopped to inquire what he was doing there Finding that the house was full of wounded American officers and soldiers I dismounted and went in I found there Captain Williams of the Engineer Corps wounded in the head probably fatally and Lieutenant Territt also badly wounded his bowels protruding from his wound There were quite a number of soldiers also Promising them to report their situation I left readjusted myself to my horse recommenced the run and was soon with the troops at the east end Before ammunition could be collected the two regiments I had been with were seen returning running the same gauntlet in getting out that they had passed in going in but with comparatively little loss The movement was countermanded and the troops were withdrawn The poor wounded officers and men I had found fell into the hands of the enemy during the night and died While this was going on at the east General Worth with a small division of troops was advancing towards the plaza from the opposite end of the city He resorted to a better expedient for getting to the plaza the citadel than we did on the east Instead of moving by the open streets he advanced through the houses cutting passageways from one to another Without much loss of life he got so near the plaza during the night that before morning Ampudia the Mexican commander made overtures for the surrender of the city and garrison This stopped all further hostilities The terms of surrender were soon agreed upon The prisoners were paroled and permitted to take their horses and personal property with them My pity was aroused by the sight of the Mexican garrison of Monterey marching out of town as prisoners and no doubt the same feeling was experienced by most of our army who witnessed it Many of the prisoners were cavalry armed with lances and mounted on miserable little half starved horses that did not look as if they could carry their riders out of town The men looked in but little better condition I thought how little interest the men before me had in the results of the war and how little knowledge they had of what it was all about After the surrender of the garrison of Monterey a quiet camp life was led until midwinter As had been the case on the Rio Grande the people who remained at their homes fraternized with the Yankees in the pleasantest manner In fact under the humane policy of our commander I question whether the great majority of the Mexican people did not regret our departure as much as they had regretted our coming Property and person were thoroughly protected and a market was afforded for all the products of the country such as the people had never enjoyed before The educated and wealthy portion of the population here as elsewhere abandoned their homes and remained away from them as long as they were in the possession of the invaders but this class formed a very small percentage of the whole population CHAPTER IX POLITICAL INTRIGUE BUENA VISTA MOVEMENT AGAINST VERA CRUZ SIEGE AND CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ The Mexican war was a political war and the administration conducting it desired to make party capital out of it General Scott was at the head of the army and being a soldier of acknowledged professional capacity his claim to the command of the forces in the field was almost indisputable and does not seem to have been denied by President Polk or Marcy his Secretary of War Scott was a Whig and the administration was democratic General Scott was also known to have political aspirations and nothing so popularizes a candidate for high civil positions as military victories It would not do therefore to give him command of the army of conquest The plans submitted by Scott for a campaign in Mexico were disapproved by the administration and he replied in a tone possibly a little disrespectful to the effect that if a soldier s plans were not to be supported by the administration success could not be expected This was on the twenty seventh of May eighteen forty six Four days later General Scott was notified that he need not go to Mexico General Gaines was next in rank but he was too old and feeble to take the field Colonel Zachary Taylor a brigadier general by brevet was therefore left in command He too was a Whig but was not supposed to entertain any political ambitions nor did he but after the fall of Monterey his third battle and third complete victory the Whig papers at home began to speak of him as the candidate of their party for the Presidency Something had to be done to neutralize his growing popularity He could not be relieved from duty in the field where all his battles had been victories the design would have been too transparent It was finally decided to send General Scott to Mexico in chief command and to authorize him to carry out his own original plan that is capture Vera Cruz and march upon the capital of the country It was no doubt supposed that Scott s ambition would lead him to slaughter Taylor or destroy his chances for the Presidency and yet it was hoped that he would not make sufficient capital himself to secure the prize The administration had indeed a most embarrassing problem to solve It was engaged in a war of conquest which must be carried to a successful issue or the political object would be unattained Yet all the capable officers of the requisite rank belonged to the opposition and the man selected for his lack of political ambition had himself become a prominent candidate for the Presidency It was necessary to destroy his chances promptly The problem was to do this without the loss of conquest and without permitting another general of the same political party to acquire like popularity The fact is the administration of mister Polk made every preparation to disgrace Scott or to speak more correctly to drive him to such desperation that he would disgrace himself General Scott had opposed conquest by the way of the Rio Grande Matamoras and Saltillo from the first Now that he was in command of all the forces in Mexico he withdrew from Taylor most of his regular troops and left him only enough volunteers as he thought to hold the line then in possession of the invading army Indeed Scott did not deem it important to hold anything beyond the Rio Grande and authorized Taylor to fall back to that line if he chose General Taylor protested against the depletion of his army and his subsequent movement upon Buena Vista would indicate that he did not share the views of his chief in regard to the unimportance of conquest beyond the Rio Grande Scott had estimated the men and material that would be required to capture Vera Cruz and to march on the capital of the country two hundred and sixty miles in the interior He was promised all he asked and seemed to have not only the confidence of the President but his sincere good wishes The promises were all broken Only about half the troops were furnished that had been pledged other war material was withheld and Scott had scarcely started for Mexico before the President undertook to supersede him by the appointment of Senator Thomas H Benton as lieutenant general This being refused by Congress the President asked legislative authority to place a junior over a senior of the same grade with the view of appointing Benton to the rank of major general and then placing him in command of the army but Congress failed to accede to this proposition as well and Scott remained in command but every general appointed to serve under him was politically opposed to the chief and several were personally hostile General Scott reached Brazos Santiago or Point Isabel at the mouth of the Rio Grande late in December eighteen forty six and proceeded at once up the river to Camargo where he had written General Taylor to meet him Taylor however had gone to or towards Tampico for the purpose of establishing a post there He had started on this march before he was aware of General Scott being in the country Under these circumstances Scott had to issue his orders designating the troops to be withdrawn from Taylor without the personal consultation he had expected to hold with his subordinate General Taylor s victory at Buena Vista February twenty twod twenty threed and twenty fourth eighteen forty seven with an army composed almost entirely of volunteers who had not been in battle before and over a vastly superior force numerically made his nomination for the Presidency by the Whigs a foregone conclusion He was nominated and elected in eighteen forty eight I believe that he sincerely regretted this turn in his fortunes preferring the peace afforded by a quiet life free from abuse to the honor of filling the highest office in the gift of any people the Presidency of the United States When General Scott assumed command of the army of invasion I was in the division of General David Twiggs in Taylor s command but under the new orders my regiment was transferred to the division of General William Worth in which I served to the close of the war The troops withdrawn from Taylor to form part of the forces to operate against Vera Cruz were assembled at the mouth of the Rio Grande preparatory to embarkation for their destination I found General Worth a different man from any I had before served directly under He was nervous impatient and restless on the march or when important or responsible duty confronted him There was not the least reason for haste on the march for it was known that it would take weeks to assemble shipping enough at the point of our embarkation to carry the army but General Worth moved his division with a rapidity that would have been commendable had he been going to the relief of a beleaguered garrison The length of the marches was regulated by the distances between places affording a supply of water for the troops and these distances were sometimes long and sometimes short General Worth on one occasion at least after having made the full distance intended for the day and after the troops were in camp and preparing their food ordered tents struck and made the march that night which had been intended for the next day Some commanders can move troops so as to get the maximum distance out of them without fatigue while others can wear them out in a few days without accomplishing so much General Worth belonged to this latter class He enjoyed however a fine reputation for his fighting qualities and thus attached his officers and men to him The army lay in camp upon the sand beach in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Rio Grande for several weeks awaiting the arrival of transports to carry it to its new field of operations The transports were all sailing vessels The passage was a tedious one and many of the troops were on shipboard over thirty days from the embarkation at the mouth of the Rio Grande to the time of debarkation south of Vera Cruz The trip was a comfortless one for officers and men The transports used were built for carrying freight and possessed but limited accommodations for passengers and the climate added to the discomfort of all The transports with troops were assembled in the harbor of Anton Lizardo some sixteen miles south of Vera Cruz as they arrived and there awaited the remainder of the fleet bringing artillery ammunition and supplies of all kinds from the North With the fleet there was a little steam propeller dispatch boat the first vessel of the kind I had ever seen and probably the first of its kind ever seen by any one then with the army At that day ocean steamers were rare and what there were were sidewheelers This little vessel going through the fleet so fast so noiselessly and with its propeller under water out of view attracted a great deal of attention I recollect that Lieutenant Sidney Smith of the fourth infantry by whom I happened to be standing on the deck of a vessel when this propeller was passing exclaimed Why the thing looks as if it was propelled by the force of circumstances Finally on the seventh of March eighteen forty seven the little army of ten or twelve thousand men given Scott to invade a country with a population of seven or eight millions a mountainous country affording the greatest possible natural advantages for defence was all assembled and ready to commence the perilous task of landing from vessels lying in the open sea The debarkation took place inside of the little island of Sacrificios some three miles south of Vera Cruz The vessels could not get anywhere near shore so that everything had to be landed in lighters or surf boats General Scott had provided these before leaving the North The breakers were sometimes high so that the landing was tedious The men were got ashore rapidly because they could wade when they came to shallow water but the camp and garrison equipage provisions ammunition and all stores had to be protected from the salt water and therefore their landing took several days The Mexicans were very kind to us however and threw no obstacles in the way of our landing except an occasional shot from their nearest fort During the debarkation one shot took off the head of Major Albertis No other I believe reached anywhere near the same distance On the ninth of March the troops were landed and the investment of Vera Cruz from the Gulf of Mexico south of the city to the Gulf again on the north was soon and easily effected The landing of stores was continued until everything was got ashore Vera Cruz at the time of which I write and up to eighteen eighty was a walled city The wall extended from the water s edge south of the town to the water again on the north There were fortifications at intervals along the line and at the angles In front of the city and on an island half a mile out in the Gulf stands San Juan de Ulloa an enclosed fortification of large dimensions and great strength for that period Against artillery of the present day the land forts and walls would prove elements of weakness rather than strength After the invading army had established their camps out of range of the fire from the city batteries were established under cover of night far to the front of the line where the troops lay These batteries were intrenched and the approaches sufficiently protected If a sortie had been made at any time by the Mexicans the men serving the batteries could have been quickly reinforced without great exposure to the fire from the enemy s main line No serious attempt was made to capture the batteries or to drive our troops away The siege continued with brisk firing on our side till the twenty seventh of March by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall surrounding the city Upon this General Morales who was Governor of both the city and of San Juan de Ulloa commenced a correspondence with General Scott looking to the surrender of the town forts and garrison On the twenty ninth Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott s army About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of artillery besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition fell into the hands of the victorious force The casualties on our side during the siege amounted to sixty four officers and men killed and wounded CHAPTER X MARCH TO JALAPA BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO PEROTE PUEBLA SCOTT AND TAYLOR General Scott had less than twelve thousand men at Vera Cruz He had been promised by the administration a very much larger force or claimed that he had and he was a man of veracity Twelve thousand was a very small army with which to penetrate two hundred and sixty miles into an enemy s country and to besiege the capital a city at that time of largely over one hundred thousand inhabitants Then too any line of march that could be selected led through mountain passes easily defended In fact there were at that time but two roads from Vera Cruz to the City of Mexico that could be taken by an army one by Jalapa and Perote the other by Cordova and Orizaba the two coming together on the great plain which extends to the City of Mexico after the range of mountains is passed It was very important to get the army away from Vera Cruz as soon as possible in order to avoid the yellow fever or vomito which usually visits that city early in the year and is very fatal to persons not acclimated but transportation which was expected from the North was arriving very slowly It was absolutely necessary to have enough to supply the army to Jalapa sixty five miles in the interior and above the fevers of the coast At that point the country is fertile and an army of the size of General Scott s could subsist there for an indefinite period Not counting the sick the weak and the garrisons for the captured city and fort the moving column was now less than ten thousand strong This force was composed of three divisions under Generals Twiggs Patterson and Worth The importance of escaping the vomito was so great that as soon as transportation enough could be got together to move a division the advance was commenced On the eighth of April Twiggs s division started for Jalapa He was followed very soon by Patterson with his division General Worth was to bring up the rear with his command as soon as transportation enough was assembled to carry six days rations for his troops with the necessary ammunition and camp and garrison equipage It was the thirteenth of April before this division left Vera Cruz The leading division ran against the enemy at Cerro Gordo some fifty miles west on the road to Jalapa and went into camp at Plan del Rio about three miles from the fortifications General Patterson reached Plan del Rio with his division soon after Twiggs arrived The two were then secure against an attack from Santa Anna who commanded the Mexican forces At all events they confronted the enemy without reinforcements and without molestation until the eighteenth of April General Scott had remained at Vera Cruz to hasten preparations for the field but on the twelfth learning the situation at the front he hastened on to take personal supervision He at once commenced his preparations for the capture of the position held by Santa Anna and of the troops holding it Cerro Gordo is one of the higher spurs of the mountains some twelve to fifteen miles east of Jalapa and Santa Anna had selected this point as the easiest to defend against an invading army The road said to have been built by Cortez zigzags around the mountain side and was defended at every turn by artillery On either side were deep chasms or mountain walls A direct attack along the road was an impossibility A flank movement seemed equally impossible After the arrival of the commanding general upon the scene reconnoissances were sent out to find or to make a road by which the rear of the enemy s works might be reached without a front attack These reconnoissances were made under the supervision of Captain Robert E Lee assisted by Lieutenants P G T Beauregard Isaac I Stevens Z B Tower G W Smith George B McClellan and J G Foster of the corps of engineers all officers who attained rank and fame on one side or the other in the great conflict for the preservation of the unity of the nation The reconnoissance was completed and the labor of cutting out and making roads by the flank of the enemy was effected by the seventeenth of the month This was accomplished without the knowledge of Santa Anna or his army and over ground where he supposed it impossible On the same day General Scott issued his order for the attack on the eighteenth The attack was made as ordered and perhaps there was not a battle of the Mexican war or of any other where orders issued before an engagement were nearer being a correct report of what afterwards took place Under the supervision of the engineers roadways had been opened over chasms to the right where the walls were so steep that men could barely climb them Animals could not These had been opened under cover of night without attracting the notice of the enemy The engineers who had directed the opening led the way and the troops followed Artillery was let down the steep slopes by hand the men engaged attaching a strong rope to the rear axle and letting the guns down a piece at a time while the men at the ropes kept their ground on top paying out gradually while a few at the front directed the course of the piece In like manner the guns were drawn by hand up the opposite slopes In this way Scott s troops reached their assigned position in rear of most of the intrenchments of the enemy unobserved The attack was made the Mexican reserves behind the works beat a hasty retreat and those occupying them surrendered On the left General Pillow s command made a formidable demonstration which doubtless held a part of the enemy in his front and contributed to the victory I am not pretending to give full details of all the battles fought but of the portion that I saw There were troops engaged on both sides at other points in which both sustained losses but the battle was won as here narrated The surprise of the enemy was complete the victory overwhelming some three thousand prisoners fell into Scott s hands also a large amount of ordnance and ordnance stores The prisoners were paroled the artillery parked and the small arms and ammunition destroyed The battle of Buena Vista was probably very important to the success of General Scott at Cerro Gordo and in his entire campaign from Vera Cruz to the great plains reaching to the City of Mexico The only army Santa Anna had to protect his capital and the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz was the one he had with him confronting General Taylor It is not likely that he would have gone as far north as Monterey to attack the United States troops when he knew his country was threatened with invasion further south When Taylor moved to Saltillo and then advanced on to Buena Vista Santa Anna crossed the desert confronting the invading army hoping no doubt to crush it and get back in time to meet General Scott in the mountain passes west of Vera Cruz His attack on Taylor was disastrous to the Mexican army but notwithstanding this he marched his army to Cerro Gordo a distance not much short of one thousand miles by the line he had to travel in time to intrench himself well before Scott got there If he had been successful at Buena Vista his troops would no doubt have made a more stubborn resistance at Cerro Gordo Had the battle of Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had time to move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an army not demoralized nor depleted by defeat After the battle the victorious army moved on to Jalapa where it was in a beautiful productive and healthy country far above the fevers of the coast Jalapa however is still in the mountains and between there and the great plain the whole line of the road is easy of defence It was important therefore to get possession of the great highway between the sea coast and the capital up to the point where it leaves the mountains before the enemy could have time to re organize and fortify in our front Worth s division was selected to go forward to secure this result The division marched to Perote on the great plain not far from where the road debouches from the mountains There is a low strong fort on the plain in front of the town known as the Castle of Perote This however offered no resistance and fell into our hands with its armament General Scott having now only nine or ten thousand men west of Vera Cruz and the time of some four thousand of them being about to expire a long delay was the consequence The troops were in a healthy climate and where they could subsist for an indefinite period even if their line back to Vera Cruz should be cut off It being ascertained that the men whose time would expire before the City of Mexico could possibly fall into the hands of the American army would not remain beyond the term for which they had volunteered the commanding general determined to discharge them at once for a delay until the expiration of their time would have compelled them to pass through Vera Cruz during the season of the vomito This reduced Scott s force in the field to about five thousand men Early in May Worth with his division left Perote and marched on to Puebla The roads were wide and the country open except through one pass in a spur of mountains coming up from the south through which the road runs Notwithstanding this the small column was divided into two bodies moving a day apart Nothing occurred on the march of special note except that while lying at the town of Amozoque an easy day s march east of Puebla a body of the enemy s cavalry two or three thousand strong was seen to our right not more than a mile away A battery or two with two or three infantry regiments was sent against them and they soon disappeared On the fifteenth of May we entered the city of Puebla General Worth was in command at Puebla until the latter end of May when General Scott arrived Here as well as on the march up his restlessness particularly under responsibilities showed itself During his brief command he had the enemy hovering around near the city in vastly superior numbers to his own The brigade to which I was attached changed quarters three different times in about a week occupying at first quarters near the plaza in the heart of the city then at the western entrance then at the extreme east On one occasion General Worth had the troops in line under arms all day with three days cooked rations in their haversacks He galloped from one command to another proclaiming the near proximity of Santa Anna with an army vastly superior to his own General Scott arrived upon the scene the latter part of the month and nothing more was heard of Santa Anna and his myriads There were of course bodies of mounted Mexicans hovering around to watch our movements and to pick up stragglers or small bodies of troops if they ventured too far out These always withdrew on the approach of any considerable number of our soldiers After the arrival of General Scott I was sent as quartermaster with a large train of wagons back two days march at least to procure forage We had less than a thousand men as escort and never thought of danger We procured full loads for our entire train at two plantations which could easily have furnished as much more There had been great delay in obtaining the authority of Congress for the raising of the troops asked for by the administration A bill was before the National Legislature from early in the session of eighteen forty six seven authorizing the creation of ten additional regiments for the war to be attached to the regular army but it was the middle of February before it became a law Appointments of commissioned officers had then to be made men had to be enlisted the regiments equipped and the whole transported to Mexico It was August before General Scott received reinforcement sufficient to warrant an advance His moving column not even now more than ten thousand strong was in four divisions commanded by Generals Twiggs Worth Pillow and Quitman There was also a cavalry corps under General Harney composed of detachments of the first twod and threed dragoons The advance commenced on the seventh of August with Twiggs s division in front The remaining three divisions followed with an interval of a day between The marches were short to make concentration easier in case of attack I had now been in battle with the two leading commanders conducting armies in a foreign land The contrast between the two was very marked General Taylor never wore uniform but dressed himself entirely for comfort He moved about the field in which he was operating to see through his own eyes the situation Often he would be without staff officers and when he was accompanied by them there was no prescribed order in which they followed He was very much given to sit his horse side ways with both feet on one side particularly on the battlefield General Scott was the reverse in all these particulars He always wore all the uniform prescribed or allowed by law when he inspected his lines word would be sent to all division and brigade commanders in advance notifying them of the hour when the commanding general might be expected This was done so that all the army might be under arms to salute their chief as he passed On these occasions he wore his dress uniform cocked hat aiguillettes sabre and spurs His staff proper besides all officers constructively on his staff engineers inspectors quartermasters et cetera that could be spared followed also in uniform and in prescribed order Orders were prepared with great care and evidently with the view that they should be a history of what followed In their modes of expressing thought these two generals contrasted quite as strongly as in their other characteristics General Scott was precise in language cultivated a style peculiarly his own was proud of his rhetoric not averse to speaking of himself often in the third person and he could bestow praise upon the person he was talking about without the least embarrassment Taylor was not a conversationalist but on paper he could put his meaning so plainly that there could be no mistaking it He knew how to express what he wanted to say in the fewest well chosen words but would not sacrifice meaning to the construction of high sounding sentences But with their opposite characteristics both were great and successful soldiers both were true patriotic and upright in all their dealings Both were pleasant to serve under Taylor was pleasant to serve with Scott saw more through the eyes of his staff officers than through his own His plans were deliberately prepared and fully expressed in orders Taylor saw for himself and gave orders to meet the emergency without reference to how they would read in history CHAPTER XI ADVANCE ON THE CITY OF MEXICO BATTLE OF CONTRERAS ASSAULT AT CHURUBUSCO NEGOTIATIONS FOR PEACE BATTLE OF MOLINO DEL REY STORMING OF CHAPULTEPEC SAN COSME EVACUATION OF THE CITY HALLS OF THE MONTEZUMAS The route followed by the army from Puebla to the City of Mexico was over Rio Frio mountain the road leading over which at the highest point is about eleven thousand feet above tide water The pass through this mountain might have been easily defended but it was not and the advanced division reached the summit in three days after leaving Puebla The City of Mexico lies west of Rio Frio mountain on a plain backed by another mountain six miles farther west with others still nearer on the north and south Between the western base of Rio Frio and the City of Mexico there are three lakes Chalco and Xochimilco on the left and Texcoco on the right extending to the east end of the City of Mexico Chalco and Texcoco are divided by a narrow strip of land over which the direct road to the city runs Xochimilco is also to the left of the road but at a considerable distance south of it and is connected with Lake Chalco by a narrow channel There is a high rocky mound called El Penon on the right of the road springing up from the low flat ground dividing the lakes This mound was strengthened by intrenchments at its base and summit and rendered a direct attack impracticable Scott s army was rapidly concentrated about Ayotla and other points near the eastern end of Lake Chalco Reconnoissances were made up to within gun shot of El Penon while engineers were seeking a route by the south side of Lake Chalco to flank the city and come upon it from the south and south west A way was found around the lake and by the eighteenth of August troops were in saint Augustin Tlalpam a town about eleven miles due south from the plaza of the capital Between saint Augustin Tlalpam and the city lie the hacienda of San Antonio and the village of Churubusco and south west of them is Contreras All these points except saint Augustin Tlalpam were intrenched and strongly garrisoned Contreras is situated on the side of a mountain near its base where volcanic rocks are piled in great confusion reaching nearly to San Antonio This made the approach to the city from the south very difficult The brigade to which I was attached Garland s of Worth s division was sent to confront San Antonio two or three miles from saint Augustin Tlalpam on the road to Churubusco and the City of Mexico The ground on which San Antonio stands is completely in the valley and the surface of the land is only a little above the level of the lakes and except to the south west it was cut up by deep ditches filled with water To the south west is the Pedregal the volcanic rock before spoken of over which cavalry or artillery could not be passed and infantry would make but poor progress if confronted by an enemy From the position occupied by Garland s brigade therefore no movement could be made against the defences of San Antonio except to the front and by a narrow causeway over perfectly level ground every inch of which was commanded by the enemy s artillery and infantry If Contreras some three miles west and south should fall into our hands troops from there could move to the right flank of all the positions held by the enemy between us and the city Under these circumstances General Scott directed the holding of the front of the enemy without making an attack until further orders On the eighteenth of August the day of reaching San Augustin Tlalpam Garland s brigade secured a position within easy range of the advanced intrenchments of San Antonio but where his troops were protected by an artificial embankment that had been thrown up for some other purpose than defense General Scott at once set his engineers reconnoitring the works about Contreras and on the nineteenth movements were commenced to get troops into positions from which an assault could be made upon the force occupying that place The Pedregal on the north and north east and the mountain on the south made the passage by either flank of the enemy s defences difficult for their work stood exactly between those natural bulwarks but a road was completed during the day and night of the nineteenth and troops were got to the north and west of the enemy This affair like that of Cerro Gordo was an engagement in which the officers of the engineer corps won special distinction In fact in both cases tasks which seemed difficult at first sight were made easier for the troops that had to execute them than they would have been on an ordinary field The very strength of each of these positions was by the skill of the engineers converted into a defence for the assaulting parties while securing their positions for final attack All the troops with General Scott in the valley of Mexico except a part of the division of General Quitman at San Augustin Tlalpam and the brigade of Garland Worth s division at San Antonio were engaged at the battle of Contreras or were on their way in obedience to the orders of their chief to reinforce those who were engaged The assault was made on the morning of the twentieth and in less than half an hour from the sound of the advance the position was in our hands with many prisoners and large quantities of ordnance and other stores The brigade commanded by General Riley was from its position the most conspicuous in the final assault but all did well volunteers and regulars From the point occupied by Garland s brigade we could see the progress made at Contreras and the movement of troops toward the flank and rear of the enemy opposing us The Mexicans all the way back to the city could see the same thing and their conduct showed plainly that they did not enjoy the sight We moved out at once and found them gone from our immediate front Clarke s brigade of Worth s division now moved west over the point of the Pedregal and after having passed to the north sufficiently to clear San Antonio turned east and got on the causeway leading to Churubusco and the City of Mexico When he approached Churubusco his left under Colonel Hoffman attacked a tete de pont at that place and brought on an engagement About an hour after Garland was ordered to advance directly along the causeway and got up in time to take part in the engagement San Antonio was found evacuated the evacuation having probably taken place immediately upon the enemy seeing the stars and stripes waving over Contreras The troops that had been engaged at Contreras and even then on their way to that battle field were moved by a causeway west of and parallel to the one by way of San Antonio and Churubusco It was expected by the commanding general that these troops would move north sufficiently far to flank the enemy out of his position at Churubusco before turning east to reach the San Antonio road but they did not succeed in this and Churubusco proved to be about the severest battle fought in the valley of Mexico General Scott coming upon the battle field about this juncture ordered two brigades under Shields to move north and turn the right of the enemy This Shields did but not without hard fighting and heavy loss The enemy finally gave way leaving in our hands prisoners artillery and small arms The balance of the causeway held by the enemy up to the very gates of the city fell in like manner I recollect at this place that some of the gunners who had stood their ground were deserters from General Taylor s army on the Rio Grande Both the strategy and tactics displayed by General Scott in these various engagements of the twentieth of August eighteen forty seven were faultless as I look upon them now after the lapse of so many years As before stated the work of the engineer officers who made the reconnoissances and led the different commands to their destinations was so perfect that the chief was able to give his orders to his various subordinates with all the precision he could use on an ordinary march I mean up to the points from which the attack was to commence After that point is reached the enemy often induces a change of orders not before contemplated The enemy outside the city outnumbered our soldiery quite three to one but they had become so demoralized by the succession of defeats this day that the City of Mexico could have been entered without much further bloodshed In fact Captain Philip Kearney afterwards a general in the war of the rebellion rode with a squadron of cavalry to the very gates of the city and would no doubt have entered with his little force only at that point he was badly wounded as were several of his officers He had not heard the call for a halt General Franklin Pierce had joined the army in Mexico at Puebla a short time before the advance upon the capital commenced He had consequently not been in any of the engagements of the war up to the battle of Contreras By an unfortunate fall of his horse on the afternoon of the nineteenth he was painfully injured The next day when his brigade with the other troops engaged on the same field was ordered against the flank and rear of the enemy guarding the different points of the road from San Augustin Tlalpam to the city General Pierce attempted to accompany them He was not sufficiently recovered to do so and fainted This circumstance gave rise to exceedingly unfair and unjust criticisms of him when he became a candidate for the Presidency Whatever General Pierce s qualifications may have been for the Presidency he was a gentleman and a man of courage I was not a supporter of him politically but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the volunteer generals General Scott abstained from entering the city at this time because mister Nicholas P Trist the commissioner on the part of the United States to negotiate a treaty of peace with Mexico was with the army and either he or General Scott thought probably both of them that a treaty would be more possible while the Mexican government was in possession of the capital than if it was scattered and the capital in the hands of an invader Be this as it may we did not enter at that time The army took up positions along the slopes of the mountains south of the city as far west as Tacubaya Negotiations were at once entered into with Santa Anna who was then practically THE GOVERNMENT and the immediate commander of all the troops engaged in defence of the country A truce was signed which denied to either party the right to strengthen its position or to receive reinforcements during the continuance of the armistices but authorized General Scott to draw supplies for his army from the city in the meantime Negotiations were commenced at once and were kept up vigorously between mister Trist and the commissioners appointed on the part of Mexico until the twod of September At that time mister Trist handed in his ultimatum Texas was to be given up absolutely by Mexico and New Mexico and California ceded to the United States for a stipulated sum to be afterwards determined I do not suppose mister Trist had any discretion whatever in regard to boundaries The war was one of conquest in the interest of an institution and the probabilities are that private instructions were for the acquisition of territory out of which new States might be carved At all events the Mexicans felt so outraged at the terms proposed that they commenced preparations for defence without giving notice of the termination of the armistice The terms of the truce had been violated before when teams had been sent into the city to bring out supplies for the army The first train entering the city was very severely threatened by a mob This however was apologized for by the authorities and all responsibility for it denied and thereafter to avoid exciting the Mexican people and soldiery our teams with their escorts were sent in at night when the troops were in barracks and the citizens in bed The circumstance was overlooked and negotiations continued As soon as the news reached General Scott of the second violation of the armistice about the fourth of September he wrote a vigorous note to President Santa Anna calling his attention to it and receiving an unsatisfactory reply declared the armistice at an end General Scott with Worth s division was now occupying Tacubaya a village some four miles south west of the City of Mexico and extending from the base up the mountain side for the distance of half a mile More than a mile west and also a little above the plain stands Molino del Rey The mill is a long stone structure one story high and several hundred feet in length At the period of which I speak General Scott supposed a portion of the mill to be used as a foundry for the casting of guns This however proved to be a mistake It was valuable to the Mexicans because of the quantity of grain it contained The building is flat roofed and a line of sand bags over the outer walls rendered the top quite a formidable defence for infantry Chapultepec is a mound springing up from the plain to the height of probably three hundred feet and almost in a direct line between Molino del Rey and the western part of the city It was fortified both on the top and on the rocky and precipitous sides The City of Mexico is supplied with water by two aqueducts resting on strong stone arches One of these aqueducts draws its supply of water from a mountain stream coming into it at or near Molino del Rey and runs north close to the west base of Chapultepec thence along the centre of a wide road until it reaches the road running east into the city by the Garita San Cosme from which point the aqueduct and road both run east to the city The second aqueduct starts from the east base of Chapultepec where it is fed by a spring and runs north east to the city This aqueduct like the other runs in the middle of a broad road way thus leaving a space on each side The arches supporting the aqueduct afforded protection for advancing troops as well as to those engaged defensively At points on the San Cosme road parapets were thrown across with an embrasure for a single piece of artillery in each At the point where both road and aqueduct turn at right angles from north to east there was not only one of these parapets supplied by one gun and infantry supports but the houses to the north of the San Cosme road facing south and commanding a view of the road back to Chapultepec were covered with infantry protected by parapets made of sandbags The roads leading to garitas the gates San Cosme and Belen by which these aqueducts enter the city were strongly intrenched Deep wide ditches filled with water lined the sides of both roads Such were the defences of the City of Mexico in September eighteen forty seven on the routes over which General Scott entered Prior to the Mexican war General Scott had been very partial to General Worth indeed he continued so up to the close of hostilities but for some reason Worth had become estranged from his chief Scott evidently took this coldness somewhat to heart He did not retaliate however but on the contrary showed every disposition to appease his subordinate It was understood at the time that he gave Worth authority to plan and execute the battle of Molino del Rey without dictation or interference from any one for the very purpose of restoring their former relations The effort failed and the two generals remained ever after cold and indifferent towards each other if not actually hostile The battle of Molino del Rey was fought on the eighth of September The night of the seventh Worth sent for his brigade and regimental commanders with their staffs to come to his quarters to receive instructions for the morrow These orders contemplated a movement up to within striking distance of the Mills before daylight The engineers had reconnoitred the ground as well as possible and had acquired all the information necessary to base proper orders both for approach and attack By daylight on the morning of the eighth the troops to be engaged at Molino were all at the places designated The ground in front of the Mills to the south was commanded by the artillery from the summit of Chapultepec as well as by the lighter batteries at hand but a charge was made and soon all was over Worth s troops entered the Mills by every door and the enemy beat a hasty retreat back to Chapultepec Had this victory been followed up promptly no doubt Americans and Mexicans would have gone over the defences of Chapultepec so near together that the place would have fallen into our hands without further loss The defenders of the works could not have fired upon us without endangering their own men This was not done and five days later more valuable lives were sacrificed to carry works which had been so nearly in our possession on the eighth I do not criticise the failure to capture Chapultepec at this time The result that followed the first assault could not possibly have been foreseen and to profit by the unexpected advantage the commanding general must have been on the spot and given the necessary instructions at the moment or the troops must have kept on without orders It is always however in order to follow a retreating foe unless stopped or otherwise directed The loss on our side at Molino del Rey was severe for the numbers engaged It was especially so among commissioned officers I was with the earliest of the troops to enter the Mills In passing through to the north side looking towards Chapultepec I happened to notice that there were armed Mexicans still on top of the building only a few feet from many of our men Not seeing any stairway or ladder reaching to the top of the building I took a few soldiers and had a cart that happened to be standing near brought up and placing the shafts against the wall and chocking the wheels so that the cart could not back used the shafts as a sort of ladder extending to within three or four feet of the top By this I climbed to the roof of the building followed by a few men but found a private soldier had preceded me by some other way There were still quite a number of Mexicans on the roof among them a major and five or six officers of lower grades who had not succeeded in getting away before our troops occupied the building They still had their arms while the soldier before mentioned was walking as sentry guarding the prisoners he had SURROUNDED all by himself I halted the sentinel received the swords from the commissioned officers and proceeded with the assistance of the soldiers now with me to disable the muskets by striking them against the edge of the wall and throw them to the ground below Molino del Rey was now captured and the troops engaged with the exception of an appropriate guard over the captured position and property were marched back to their quarters in Tacubaya The engagement did not last many minutes but the killed and wounded were numerous for the number of troops engaged During the night of the eleventh batteries were established which could play upon the fortifications of Chapultepec The bombardment commenced early on the morning of the twelfth but there was no further engagement during this day than that of the artillery General Scott assigned the capture of Chapultepec to General Pillow but did not leave the details to his judgment Two assaulting columns two hundred and fifty men each composed of volunteers for the occasion were formed They were commanded by Captains McKinzie and Casey respectively The assault was successful but bloody In later years if not at the time the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec have seemed to me to have been wholly unnecessary When the assaults upon the garitas of San Cosme and Belen were determined upon the road running east to the former gate could have been reached easily without an engagement by moving along south of the Mills until west of them sufficiently far to be out of range thence north to the road above mentioned or if desirable to keep the two attacking columns nearer together the troops could have been turned east so as to come on the aqueduct road out of range of the guns from Chapultepec In like manner the troops designated to act against Belen could have kept east of Chapultepec out of range and come on to the aqueduct also out of range of Chapultepec Molino del Rey and Chapultepec would both have been necessarily evacuated if this course had been pursued for they would have been turned General Quitman a volunteer from the State of Mississippi who stood well with the army both as a soldier and as a man commanded the column acting against Belen General Worth commanded the column against San Cosme When Chapultepec fell the advance commenced along the two aqueduct roads I was on the road to San Cosme and witnessed most that took place on that route When opposition was encountered our troops sheltered themselves by keeping under the arches supporting the aqueduct advancing an arch at a time We encountered no serious obstruction until within gun shot of the point where the road we were on intersects that running east to the city the point where the aqueduct turns at a right angle I have described the defences of this position before There were but three commissioned officers besides myself that I can now call to mind with the advance when the above position was reached One of these officers was a Lieutenant Semmes of the Marine Corps I think Captain Gore and Lieutenant Judah of the fourth infantry were the others Our progress was stopped for the time by the single piece of artillery at the angle of the roads and the infantry occupying the house tops back from it West of the road from where we were stood a house occupying the south west angle made by the San Cosme road and the road we were moving upon A stone wall ran from the house along each of these roads for a considerable distance and thence back until it joined enclosing quite a yard about the house I watched my opportunity and skipped across the road and behind the south wall Proceeding cautiously to the west corner of the enclosure I peeped around and seeing nobody continued still cautiously until the road running east and west was reached I then returned to the troops and called for volunteers All that were close to me or that heard me about a dozen offered their services Commanding them to carry their arms at a trail I watched our opportunity and got them across the road and under cover of the wall beyond before the enemy had a shot at us Our men under cover of the arches kept a close watch on the intrenchments that crossed our path and the house tops beyond and whenever a head showed itself above the parapets they would fire at it Our crossing was thus made practicable without loss When we reached a safe position I instructed my little command again to carry their arms at a trail not to fire at the enemy until they were ordered and to move very cautiously following me until the San Cosme road was reached we would then be on the flank of the men serving the gun on the road and with no obstruction between us and them When we reached the south west corner of the enclosure before described I saw some United States troops pushing north through a shallow ditch near by who had come up since my reconnaissance This was the company of Captain Horace Brooks of the artillery acting as infantry I explained to Brooks briefly what I had discovered and what I was about to do He said as I knew the ground and he did not I might go on and he would follow As soon as we got on the road leading to the city the troops serving the gun on the parapet retreated and those on the house tops near by followed our men went after them in such close pursuit the troops we had left under the arches joining that a second line across the road about half way between the first and the garita was carried No reinforcements had yet come up except Brooks s company and the position we had taken was too advanced to be held by so small a force It was given up but retaken later in the day with some loss Worth s command gradually advanced to the front now open to it Later in the day in reconnoitring I found a church off to the south of the road which looked to me as if the belfry would command the ground back of the garita San Cosme I got an officer of the voltigeurs with a mountain howitzer and men to work it to go with me The road being in possession of the enemy we had to take the field to the south to reach the church This took us over several ditches breast deep in water and grown up with water plants These ditches however were not over eight or ten feet in width The howitzer was taken to pieces and carried by the men to its destination When I knocked for admission a priest came to the door who while extremely polite declined to admit us With the little Spanish then at my command I explained to him that he might save property by opening the door and he certainly would save himself from becoming a prisoner for a time at least and besides I intended to go in whether he consented or not He began to see his duty in the same light that I did and opened the door though he did not look as if it gave him special pleasure to do so The gun was carried to the belfry and put together We were not more than two or three hundred yards from San Cosme The shots from our little gun dropped in upon the enemy and created great confusion Why they did not send out a small party and capture us I do not know We had no infantry or other defences besides our one gun The effect of this gun upon the troops about the gate of the city was so marked that General Worth saw it from his position three He was so pleased that he sent a staff officer Lieutenant Pemberton later Lieutenant General commanding the defences of Vicksburg to bring me to him He expressed his gratification at the services the howitzer in the church steeple was doing saying that every shot was effective and ordered a captain of voltigeurs to report to me with another howitzer to be placed along with the one already rendering so much service I could not tell the General that there was not room enough in the steeple for another gun because he probably would have looked upon such a statement as a contradiction from a second lieutenant I took the captain with me but did not use his gun The night of the thirteenth of September was spent by the troops under General Worth in the houses near San Cosme and in line confronting the general line of the enemy across to Belen The troops that I was with were in the houses north of the road leading into the city and were engaged during the night in cutting passage ways from one house to another towards the town During the night Santa Anna with his army except the deserters left the city He liberated all the convicts confined in the town hoping no doubt that they would inflict upon us some injury before daylight but several hours after Santa Anna was out of the way the city authorities sent a delegation to General Scott to ask if not demand an armistice respecting church property the rights of citizens and the supremacy of the city government in the management of municipal affairs General Scott declined to trammel himself with conditions but gave assurances that those who chose to remain within our lines would be protected so long as they behaved themselves properly General Quitman had advanced along his line very successfully on the thirteenth so that at night his command occupied nearly the same position at Belen that Worth s troops did about San Cosme After the interview above related between General Scott and the city council orders were issued for the cautious entry of both columns in the morning The troops under Worth were to stop at the Alameda a park near the west end of the city Quitman was to go directly to the Plaza and take possession of the Palace a mass of buildings on the east side in which Congress has its sessions the national courts are held the public offices are all located the President resides and much room is left for museums receptions et cetera This is the building generally designated as the Halls of the Montezumas CHAPTER XII PROMOTION TO FIRST LIEUTENANT CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF MEXICO THE ARMY MEXICAN SOLDIERS PEACE NEGOTIATIONS On entering the city the troops were fired upon by the released convicts and possibly by deserters and hostile citizens The streets were deserted and the place presented the appearance of a city of the dead except for this firing by unseen persons from house tops windows and around corners In this firing the lieutenant colonel of my regiment Garland was badly wounded Lieutenant Sidney Smith of the fourth infantry was also wounded mortally He died a few days after and by his death I was promoted to the grade of first lieutenant four I had gone into the battle of Palo Alto in May eighteen forty six a second lieutenant and I entered the city of Mexico sixteen months later with the same rank after having been in all the engagements possible for any one man and in a regiment that lost more officers during the war than it ever had present at any one engagement My regiment lost four commissioned officers all senior to me by steamboat explosions during the Mexican war The Mexicans were not so discriminating They sometimes picked off my juniors General Scott soon followed the troops into the city in state I wonder that he was not fired upon but I believe he was not at all events he was not hurt He took quarters at first in the Halls of the Montezumas and from there issued his wise and discreet orders for the government of a conquered city and for suppressing the hostile acts of liberated convicts already spoken of orders which challenge the respect of all who study them Lawlessness was soon suppressed and the City of Mexico settled down into a quiet law abiding place The people began to make their appearance upon the streets without fear of the invaders Shortly afterwards the bulk of the troops were sent from the city to the villages at the foot of the mountains four or five miles to the south and south west Whether General Scott approved of the Mexican war and the manner in which it was brought about I have no means of knowing His orders to troops indicate only a soldierly spirit with probably a little regard for the perpetuation of his own fame On the other hand General Taylor s I think indicate that he considered the administration accountable for the war and felt no responsibility resting on himself further than for the faithful performance of his duties Both generals deserve the commendations of their countrymen and to live in the grateful memory of this people to the latest generation Earlier in this narrative I have stated that the plain reached after passing the mountains east of Perote extends to the cities of Puebla and Mexico The route travelled by the army before reaching Puebla goes over a pass in a spur of mountain coming up from the south This pass is very susceptible of defence by a smaller against a larger force Again the highest point of the road bed between Vera Cruz and the City of Mexico is over Rio Frio mountain which also might have been successfully defended by an inferior against a superior force But by moving north of the mountains and about thirty miles north of Puebla both of these passes would have been avoided The road from Perote to the City of Mexico by this latter route is as level as the prairies in our West Arriving due north from Puebla troops could have been detached to take possession of that place and then proceeding west with the rest of the army no mountain would have been encountered before reaching the City of Mexico It is true this road would have brought troops in by Guadalupe a town church and detached spur of mountain about two miles north of the capital all bearing the same general name and at this point Lake Texcoco comes near to the mountain which was fortified both at the base and on the sides but troops could have passed north of the mountain and come in only a few miles to the north west and so flanked the position as they actually did on the south It has always seemed to me that this northern route to the City of Mexico would have been the better one to have taken But my later experience has taught me two lessons first that things are seen plainer after the events have occurred second that the most confident critics are generally those who know the least about the matter criticised I know just enough about the Mexican war to approve heartily of most of the generalship but to differ with a little of it It is natural that an important city like Puebla should not have been passed with contempt it may be natural that the direct road to it should have been taken but it could have been passed its evacuation insured and possession acquired without danger of encountering the enemy in intricate mountain defiles In this same way the City of Mexico could have been approached without any danger of opposition except in the open field But General Scott s successes are an answer to all criticism He invaded a populous country penetrating two hundred and sixty miles into the interior with a force at no time equal to one half of that opposed to him he was without a base the enemy was always intrenched always on the defensive yet he won every battle he captured the capital and conquered the government Credit is due to the troops engaged it is true but the plans and the strategy were the general s I had now made marches and been in battle under both General Scott and General Taylor The former divided his force of ten thousand five hundred men into four columns starting a day apart in moving from Puebla to the capital of the nation when it was known that an army more than twice as large as his own stood ready to resist his coming The road was broad and the country open except in crossing the Rio Frio mountain General Taylor pursued the same course in marching toward an enemy He moved even in smaller bodies I never thought at the time to doubt the infallibility of these two generals in all matters pertaining to their profession I supposed they moved in small bodies because more men could not be passed over a single road on the same day with their artillery and necessary trains Later I found the fallacy of this belief The rebellion which followed as a sequence to the Mexican war never could have been suppressed if larger bodies of men could not have been moved at the same time than was the custom under Scott and Taylor The victories in Mexico were in every instance over vastly superior numbers There were two reasons for this Both General Scott and General Taylor had such armies as are not often got together At the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma General Taylor had a small army but it was composed exclusively of regular troops under the best of drill and discipline Every officer from the highest to the lowest was educated in his profession not at West Point necessarily but in the camp in garrison and many of them in Indian wars The rank and file were probably inferior as material out of which to make an army to the volunteers that participated in all the later battles of the war but they were brave men and then drill and discipline brought out all there was in them A better army man for man probably never faced an enemy than the one commanded by General Taylor in the earliest two engagements of the Mexican war The volunteers who followed were of better material but without drill or discipline at the start They were associated with so many disciplined men and professionally educated officers that when they went into engagements it was with a confidence they would not have felt otherwise They became soldiers themselves almost at once All these conditions we would enjoy again in case of war The Mexican army of that day was hardly an organization The private soldier was picked up from the lower class of the inhabitants when wanted his consent was not asked he was poorly clothed worse fed and seldom paid He was turned adrift when no longer wanted The officers of the lower grades were but little superior to the men With all this I have seen as brave stands made by some of these men as I have ever seen made by soldiers Now Mexico has a standing army larger than that of the United States They have a military school modelled after West Point Their officers are educated and no doubt generally brave The Mexican war of eighteen forty six eight would be an impossibility in this generation The Mexicans have shown a patriotism which it would be well if we would imitate in part but with more regard to truth They celebrate the anniversaries of Chapultepec and Molino del Rey as of very great victories The anniversaries are recognized as national holidays At these two battles while the United States troops were victorious it was at very great sacrifice of life compared with what the Mexicans suffered The Mexicans as on many other occasions stood up as well as any troops ever did The trouble seemed to be the lack of experience among the officers which led them after a certain time to simply quit without being particularly whipped but because they had fought enough Their authorities of the present day grow enthusiastic over their theme when telling of these victories and speak with pride of the large sum of money they forced us to pay in the end With us now twenty years after the close of the most stupendous war ever known we have writers who profess devotion to the nation engaged in trying to prove that the Union forces were not victorious practically they say we were slashed around from Donelson to Vicksburg and to Chattanooga and in the East from Gettysburg to Appomattox when the physical rebellion gave out from sheer exhaustion There is no difference in the amount of romance in the two stories I would not have the anniversaries of our victories celebrated nor those of our defeats made fast days and spent in humiliation and prayer but I would like to see truthful history written Such history will do full credit to the courage endurance and soldierly ability of the American citizen no matter what section of the country he hailed from or in what ranks he fought The justice of the cause which in the end prevailed will I doubt not come to be acknowledged by every citizen of the land in time For the present and so long as there are living witnesses of the great war of sections there will be people who will not be consoled for the loss of a cause which they believed to be holy As time passes people even of the South will begin to wonder how it was possible that their ancestors ever fought for or justified institutions which acknowledged the right of property in man After the fall of the capital and the dispersal of the government of Mexico it looked very much as if military occupation of the country for a long time might be necessary General Scott at once began the preparation of orders regulations and laws in view of this contingency He contemplated making the country pay all the expenses of the occupation without the army becoming a perceptible burden upon the people His plan was to levy a direct tax upon the separate states and collect at the ports left open to trade a duty on all imports From the beginning of the war private property had not been taken either for the use of the army or of individuals without full compensation This policy was to be pursued There were not troops enough in the valley of Mexico to occupy many points but now that there was no organized army of the enemy of any size reinforcements could be got from the Rio Grande and there were also new volunteers arriving from time to time all by way of Vera Cruz Military possession was taken of Cuernavaca fifty miles south of the City of Mexico of Toluca nearly as far west and of Pachuca a mining town of great importance some sixty miles to the north east Vera Cruz Jalapa Orizaba and Puebla were already in our possession Meanwhile the Mexican government had departed in the person of Santa Anna and it looked doubtful for a time whether the United States commissioner mister Trist would find anybody to negotiate with A temporary government however was soon established at Queretaro and Trist began negotiations for a conclusion of the war Before terms were finally agreed upon he was ordered back to Washington but General Scott prevailed upon him to remain as an arrangement had been so nearly reached and the administration must approve his acts if he succeeded in making such a treaty as had been contemplated in his instructions The treaty was finally signed the twod of February eighteen forty eight and accepted by the government at Washington It is that known as the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and secured to the United States the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas and the whole territory then included in New Mexico and Upper California for the sum of fifteen million dollars Soon after entering the city of Mexico the opposition of Generals Pillow Worth and Colonel Duncan to General Scott became very marked Scott claimed that they had demanded of the President his removal I do not know whether this is so or not but I do know of their unconcealed hostility to their chief At last he placed them in arrest and preferred charges against them of insubordination and disrespect This act brought on a crisis in the career of the general commanding He had asserted from the beginning that the administration was hostile to him that it had failed in its promises of men and war material that the President himself had shown duplicity if not treachery in the endeavor to procure the appointment of Benton and the administration now gave open evidence of its enmity About the middle of February orders came convening a court of inquiry composed of Brevet Brigadier General Towson the paymaster general of the army Brigadier General Cushing and Colonel Belknap to inquire into the conduct of the accused and the accuser and shortly afterwards orders were received from Washington relieving Scott of the command of the army in the field and assigning Major General William O Butler of Kentucky to the place This order also released Pillow Worth and Duncan from arrest If a change was to be made the selection of General Butler was agreeable to every one concerned so far as I remember to have heard expressions on the subject There were many who regarded the treatment of General Scott as harsh and unjust It is quite possible that the vanity of the General had led him to say and do things that afforded a plausible pretext to the administration for doing just what it did and what it had wanted to do from the start The court tried the accuser quite as much as the accused It was adjourned before completing its labors to meet in Frederick Maryland General Scott left the country and never after had more than the nominal command of the army until early in eighteen sixty one He certainly was not sustained in his efforts to maintain discipline in high places The efforts to kill off politically the two successful generals made them both candidates for the Presidency General Taylor was nominated in eighteen forty eight and was elected Four years later General Scott received the nomination but was badly beaten and the party nominating him died with his defeat five CHAPTER XIII TREATY OF PEACE MEXICAN BULL FIGHTS REGIMENTAL QUARTERMASTER TRIP TO POPOCATAPETL TRIP TO THE CAVES OF MEXICO The treaty of peace between the two countries was signed by the commissioners of each side early in February eighteen forty eight It took a considerable time for it to reach Washington receive the approval of the administration and be finally ratified by the Senate It was naturally supposed by the army that there would be no more fighting and officers and men were of course anxious to get home but knowing there must be delay they contented themselves as best they could Every Sunday there was a bull fight for the amusement of those who would pay their fifty cents I attended one of them just one not wishing to leave the country without having witnessed the national sport The sight to me was sickening I could not see how human beings could enjoy the sufferings of beasts and often of men as they seemed to do on these occasions At these sports there are usually from four to six bulls sacrificed The audience occupies seats around the ring in which the exhibition is given each seat but the foremost rising higher than the one in front so that every one can get a full view of the sport When all is ready a bull is turned into the ring Three or four men come in mounted on the merest skeletons of horses blind or blind folded and so weak that they could not make a sudden turn with their riders without danger of falling down The men are armed with spears having a point as sharp as a needle Other men enter the arena on foot armed with red flags and explosives about the size of a musket cartridge To each of these explosives is fastened a barbed needle which serves the purpose of attaching them to the bull by running the needle into the skin Before the animal is turned loose a lot of these explosives are attached to him The pain from the pricking of the skin by the needles is exasperating but when the explosions of the cartridges commence the animal becomes frantic As he makes a lunge towards one horseman another runs a spear into him He turns towards his last tormentor when a man on foot holds out a red flag the bull rushes for this and is allowed to take it on his horns The flag drops and covers the eyes of the animal so that he is at a loss what to do it is jerked from him and the torment is renewed When the animal is worked into an uncontrollable frenzy the horsemen withdraw and the matadores literally murderers enter armed with knives having blades twelve or eighteen inches long and sharp The trick is to dodge an attack from the animal and stab him to the heart as he passes If these efforts fail the bull is finally lassoed held fast and killed by driving a knife blade into the spinal column just back of the horns He is then dragged out by horses or mules another is let into the ring and the same performance is renewed On the occasion when I was present one of the bulls was not turned aside by the attacks in the rear the presentations of the red flag et cetera et cetera but kept right on and placing his horns under the flanks of a horse threw him and his rider to the ground with great force The horse was killed and the rider lay prostrate as if dead The bull was then lassoed and killed in the manner above described Men came in and carried the dead man off in a litter When the slaughtered bull and horse were dragged out a fresh bull was turned into the ring Conspicuous among the spectators was the man who had been carried out on a litter but a few minutes before He was only dead so far as that performance went but the corpse was so lively that it could not forego the chance of witnessing the discomfiture of some of his brethren who might not be so fortunate There was a feeling of disgust manifested by the audience to find that he had come to life again I confess that I felt sorry to see the cruelty to the bull and the horse I did not stay for the conclusion of the performance but while I did stay there was not a bull killed in the prescribed way Bull fights are now prohibited in the Federal District embracing a territory around the City of Mexico somewhat larger than the District of Columbia and they are not an institution in any part of the country During one of my recent visits to Mexico bull fights were got up in my honor at Puebla and at Pachuca I was not notified in advance so as to be able to decline and thus prevent the performance but in both cases I civilly declined to attend Another amusement of the people of Mexico of that day and one which nearly all indulged in male and female old and young priest and layman was Monte playing Regular feast weeks were held every year at what was then known as saint Augustin Tlalpam eleven miles out of town There were dealers to suit every class and condition of people In many of the booths tlackos the copper coin of the country four of them making six and a quarter cents of our money were piled up in great quantities with some silver to accommodate the people who could not bet more than a few pennies at a time In other booths silver formed the bulk of the capital of the bank with a few doubloons to be changed if there should be a run of luck against the bank In some there was no coin except gold Here the rich were said to bet away their entire estates in a single day All this is stopped now For myself I was kept somewhat busy during the winter of eighteen forty seven eight My regiment was stationed in Tacubaya I was regimental quartermaster and commissary General Scott had been unable to get clothing for the troops from the North The men were becoming well they needed clothing Material had to be purchased such as could be obtained and people employed to make it up into Yankee uniforms A quartermaster in the city was designated to attend to this special duty but clothing was so much needed that it was seized as fast as made up A regiment was glad to get a dozen suits at a time I had to look after this matter for the fourth infantry Then our regimental fund had run down and some of the musicians in the band had been without their extra pay for a number of months The regimental bands at that day were kept up partly by pay from the government and partly by pay from the regimental fund There was authority of law for enlisting a certain number of men as musicians So many could receive the pay of non commissioned officers of the various grades and the remainder the pay of privates This would not secure a band leader nor good players on certain instruments In garrison there are various ways of keeping up a regimental fund sufficient to give extra pay to musicians establish libraries and ten pin alleys subscribe to magazines and furnish many extra comforts to the men The best device for supplying the fund is to issue bread to the soldiers instead of flour The ration used to be eighteen ounces per day of either flour or bread and one hundred pounds of flour will make one hundred and forty pounds of bread This saving was purchased by the commissary for the benefit of the fund In the emergency the fourth infantry was laboring under I rented a bakery in the city hired bakers Mexicans bought fuel and whatever was necessary and I also got a contract from the chief commissary of the army for baking a large amount of hard bread In two months I made more money for the fund than my pay amounted to during the entire war While stationed at Monterey I had relieved the post fund in the same way There however was no profit except in the saving of flour by converting it into bread In the spring of eighteen forty eight a party of officers obtained leave to visit Popocatapetl the highest volcano in America and to take an escort I went with the party many of whom afterwards occupied conspicuous positions before the country Of those who went south and attained high rank there was Lieutenant Richard Anderson who commanded a corps at Spottsylvania Captain Sibley a major general and after the war for a number of years in the employ of the Khedive of Egypt Captain George Crittenden a rebel general S B Buckner who surrendered Fort Donelson and Mansfield Lovell who commanded at New Orleans before that city fell into the hands of the National troops Of those who remained on our side there were Captain Andrew Porter Lieutenant C P Stone and Lieutenant Z B Tower There were quite a number of other officers whose names I cannot recollect At a little village Ozumba near the base of Popocatapetl where we purposed to commence the ascent we procured guides and two pack mules with forage for our horses High up on the mountain there was a deserted house of one room called the Vaqueria which had been occupied years before by men in charge of cattle ranging on the mountain The pasturage up there was very fine when we saw it and there were still some cattle descendants of the former domestic herd which had now become wild It was possible to go on horseback as far as the Vaqueria though the road was somewhat hazardous in places Sometimes it was very narrow with a yawning precipice on one side hundreds of feet down to a roaring mountain torrent below and almost perpendicular walls on the other side At one of these places one of our mules loaded with two sacks of barley one on each side the two about as big as he was struck his load against the mountain side and was precipitated to the bottom The descent was steep but not perpendicular The mule rolled over and over until the bottom was reached and we supposed of course the poor animal was dashed to pieces What was our surprise not long after we had gone into bivouac to see the lost mule cargo and owner coming up the ascent The load had protected the animal from serious injury and his owner had gone after him and found a way back to the path leading up to the hut where we were to stay The night at the Vaqueria was one of the most unpleasant I ever knew It was very cold and the rain fell in torrents A little higher up the rain ceased and snow began The wind blew with great velocity The log cabin we were in had lost the roof entirely on one side and on the other it was hardly better then a sieve There was little or no sleep that night As soon as it was light the next morning we started to make the ascent to the summit The wind continued to blow with violence and the weather was still cloudy but there was neither rain nor snow The clouds however concealed from our view the country below us except at times a momentary glimpse could be got through a clear space between them The wind carried the loose snow around the mountain sides in such volumes as to make it almost impossible to stand up against it We labored on and on until it became evident that the top could not be reached before night if at all in such a storm and we concluded to return The descent was easy and rapid though dangerous until we got below the snow line At the cabin we mounted our horses and by night were at Ozumba The fatigues of the day and the loss of sleep the night before drove us to bed early Our beds consisted of a place on the dirt floor with a blanket under us Soon all were asleep but long before morning first one and then another of our party began to cry out with excruciating pain in the eyes Not one escaped it By morning the eyes of half the party were so swollen that they were entirely closed The others suffered pain equally The feeling was about what might be expected from the prick of a sharp needle at a white heat We remained in quarters until the afternoon bathing our eyes in cold water This relieved us very much and before night the pain had entirely left The swelling however continued and about half the party still had their eyes entirely closed but we concluded to make a start back those who could see a little leading the horses of those who could not see at all We moved back to the village of Ameca Ameca some six miles and stopped again for the night The next morning all were entirely well and free from pain The weather was clear and Popocatapetl stood out in all its beauty the top looking as if not a mile away and inviting us to return About half the party were anxious to try the ascent again and concluded to do so The remainder I was with the remainder concluded that we had got all the pleasure there was to be had out of mountain climbing and that we would visit the great caves of Mexico some ninety miles from where we then were on the road to Acapulco The party that ascended the mountain the second time succeeded in reaching the crater at the top with but little of the labor they encountered in their first attempt Three of them Anderson Stone and Buckner wrote accounts of their journey which were published at the time I made no notes of this excursion and have read nothing about it since but it seems to me that I can see the whole of it as vividly as if it were but yesterday I have been back at Ameca Ameca and the village beyond twice in the last five years The scene had not changed materially from my recollection of it The party which I was with moved south down the valley to the town of Cuantla some forty miles from Ameca Ameca The latter stands on the plain at the foot of Popocatapetl at an elevation of about eight thousand feet above tide water The slope down is gradual as the traveller moves south but one would not judge that in going to Cuantla descent enough had been made to occasion a material change in the climate and productions of the soil but such is the case In the morning we left a temperate climate where the cereals and fruits are those common to the United States we halted in the evening in a tropical climate where the orange and banana the coffee and the sugar cane were flourishing We had been travelling apparently on a plain all day but in the direction of the flow of water Soon after the capture of the City of Mexico an armistice had been agreed to designating the limits beyond which troops of the respective armies were not to go during its continuance Our party knew nothing about these limits As we approached Cuantla bugles sounded the assembly and soldiers rushed from the guard house in the edge of the town towards us Our party halted and I tied a white pocket handkerchief to a stick and using it as a flag of truce proceeded on to the town Captains Sibley and Porter followed a few hundred yards behind I was detained at the guard house until a messenger could be dispatched to the quarters of the commanding general who authorized that I should be conducted to him I had been with the general but a few minutes when the two officers following announced themselves The Mexican general reminded us that it was a violation of the truce for us to be there However as we had no special authority from our own commanding general and as we knew nothing about the terms of the truce we were permitted to occupy a vacant house outside the guard for the night with the promise of a guide to put us on the road to Cuernavaca the next morning Cuernavaca is a town west of Guantla The country through which we passed between these two towns is tropical in climate and productions and rich in scenery At one point about half way between the two places the road goes over a low pass in the mountains in which there is a very quaint old town the inhabitants of which at that day were nearly all full blooded Indians Very few of them even spoke Spanish The houses were built of stone and generally only one story high The streets were narrow and had probably been paved before Cortez visited the country They had not been graded but the paving had been done on the natural surface We had with us one vehicle a cart which was probably the first wheeled vehicle that had ever passed through that town On a hill overlooking this town stands the tomb of an ancient king and it was understood that the inhabitants venerated this tomb very highly as well as the memory of the ruler who was supposed to be buried in it We ascended the mountain and surveyed the tomb but it showed no particular marks of architectural taste mechanical skill or advanced civilization The next day we went into Cuernavaca After a day s rest at Cuernavaca our party set out again on the journey to the great caves of Mexico We had proceeded but a few miles when we were stopped as before by a guard and notified that the terms of the existing armistice did not permit us to go further in that direction Upon convincing the guard that we were a mere party of pleasure seekers desirous of visiting the great natural curiosities of the country which we expected soon to leave we were conducted to a large hacienda near by and directed to remain there until the commanding general of that department could be communicated with and his decision obtained as to whether we should be permitted to pursue our journey The guard promised to send a messenger at once and expected a reply by night At night there was no response from the commanding general but the captain of the guard was sure he would have a reply by morning Again in the morning there was no reply The second evening the same thing happened and finally we learned that the guard had sent no message or messenger to the department commander We determined therefore to go on unless stopped by a force sufficient to compel obedience After a few hours travel we came to a town where a scene similar to the one at Cuantia occurred The commanding officer sent a guide to conduct our party around the village and to put us upon our road again This was the last interruption that night we rested at a large coffee plantation some eight miles from the cave we were on the way to visit It must have been a Saturday night the peons had been paid off and spent part of the night in gambling away their scanty week s earnings Their coin was principally copper and I do not believe there was a man among them who had received as much as twenty five cents in money They were as much excited however as if they had been staking thousands I recollect one poor fellow who had lost his last tlacko pulled off his shirt and in the most excited manner put that up on the turn of a card Monte was the game played the place out of doors near the window of the room occupied by the officers of our party The next morning we were at the mouth of the cave at an early hour provided with guides candles and rockets We explored to a distance of about three miles from the entrance and found a succession of chambers of great dimensions and of great beauty when lit up with our rockets Stalactites and stalagmites of all sizes were discovered Some of the former were many feet in diameter and extended from ceiling to floor some of the latter were but a few feet high from the floor but the formation is going on constantly and many centuries hence these stalagmites will extend to the ceiling and become complete columns The stalagmites were all a little concave and the cavities were filled with water The water percolates through the roof a drop at a time often the drops several minutes apart and more or less charged with mineral matter Evaporation goes on slowly leaving the mineral behind This in time makes the immense columns many of them thousands of tons in weight which serve to support the roofs over the vast chambers I recollect that at one point in the cave one of these columns is of such huge proportions that there is only a narrow passage left on either side of it Some of our party became satisfied with their explorations before we had reached the point to which the guides were accustomed to take explorers and started back without guides Coming to the large column spoken of they followed it entirely around and commenced retracing their steps into the bowels of the mountain without being aware of the fact When the rest of us had completed our explorations we started out with our guides but had not gone far before we saw the torches of an approaching party We could not conceive who these could be for all of us had come in together and there were none but ourselves at the entrance when we started in Very soon we found it was our friends It took them some time to conceive how they had got where they were They were sure they had kept straight on for the mouth of the cave and had gone about far enough to have reached it CHAPTER XIV RETURN OF THE ARMY MARRIAGE ORDERED TO THE PACIFIC COAST CROSSING THE ISTHMUS ARRIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO My experience in the Mexican war was of great advantage to me afterwards Besides the many practical lessons it taught the war brought nearly all the officers of the regular army together so as to make them personally acquainted It also brought them in contact with volunteers many of whom served in the war of the rebellion afterwards Then in my particular case I had been at West Point at about the right time to meet most of the graduates who were of a suitable age at the breaking out of the rebellion to be trusted with large commands Graduating in eighteen forty three I was at the military academy from one to four years with all cadets who graduated between eighteen forty and eighteen forty six seven classes These classes embraced more than fifty officers who afterwards became generals on one side or the other in the rebellion many of them holding high commands All the older officers who became conspicuous in the rebellion I had also served with and known in Mexico Lee J E Johnston A S Johnston Holmes Hebert and a number of others on the Confederate side McCall Mansfield Phil Kearney and others on the National side The acquaintance thus formed was of immense service to me in the war of the rebellion I mean what I learned of the characters of those to whom I was afterwards opposed I do not pretend to say that all movements or even many of them were made with special reference to the characteristics of the commander against whom they were directed But my appreciation of my enemies was certainly affected by this knowledge The natural disposition of most people is to clothe a commander of a large army whom they do not know with almost superhuman abilities A large part of the National army for instance and most of the press of the country clothed General Lee with just such qualities but I had known him personally and knew that he was mortal and it was just as well that I felt this The treaty of peace was at last ratified and the evacuation of Mexico by United States troops was ordered Early in June the troops in the City of Mexico began to move out Many of them including the brigade to which I belonged were assembled at Jalapa above the vomito to await the arrival of transports at Vera Cruz but with all this precaution my regiment and others were in camp on the sand beach in a July sun for about a week before embarking while the fever raged with great virulence in Vera Cruz not two miles away I can call to mind only one person an officer who died of the disease My regiment was sent to Pascagoula Mississippi to spend the summer As soon as it was settled in camp I obtained a leave of absence for four months and proceeded to saint Louis On the twenty twod of August eighteen forty eight I was married to Miss Julia Dent the lady of whom I have before spoken We visited my parents and relations in Ohio and at the end of my leave proceeded to my post at Sackett s Harbor New York In April following I was ordered to Detroit Michigan where two years were spent with but few important incidents The present constitution of the State of Michigan was ratified during this time By the terms of one of its provisions all citizens of the United States residing within the State at the time of the ratification became citizens of Michigan also During my stay in Detroit there was an election for city officers mister Zachariah Chandler was the candidate of the Whigs for the office of Mayor and was elected although the city was then reckoned democratic All the officers stationed there at the time who offered their votes were permitted to cast them I did not offer mine however as I did not wish to consider myself a citizen of Michigan This was mister Chandler s first entry into politics a career he followed ever after with great success and in which he died enjoying the friendship esteem and love of his countrymen In the spring of eighteen fifty one the garrison at Detroit was transferred to Sackett s Harbor and in the following spring the entire fourth infantry was ordered to the Pacific Coast It was decided that missus Grant should visit my parents at first for a few months and then remain with her own family at their saint Louis home until an opportunity offered of sending for her In the month of April the regiment was assembled at Governor s Island New York Harbor and on the fifth of July eight companies sailed for Aspinwall We numbered a little over seven hundred persons including the families of officers and soldiers Passage was secured for us on the old steamer Ohio commanded at the time by Captain Schenck of the navy It had not been determined until a day or two before starting that the fourth infantry should go by the Ohio consequently a complement of passengers had already been secured The addition of over seven hundred to this list crowded the steamer most uncomfortably especially for the tropics in July In eight days Aspinwall was reached At that time the streets of the town were eight or ten inches under water and foot passengers passed from place to place on raised foot walks July is at the height of the wet season on the Isthmus At intervals the rain would pour down in streams followed in not many minutes by a blazing tropical summer s sun These alternate changes from rain to sunshine were continuous in the afternoons I wondered how any person could live many months in Aspinwall and wondered still more why any one tried In the summer of eighteen fifty two the Panama railroad was completed only to the point where it now crosses the Chagres River From there passengers were carried by boats to Gorgona at which place they took mules for Panama some twenty five miles further Those who travelled over the Isthmus in those days will remember that boats on the Chagres River were propelled by natives not inconveniently burdened with clothing These boats carried thirty to forty passengers each The crews consisted of six men to a boat armed with long poles There were planks wide enough for a man to walk on conveniently running along the sides of each boat from end to end The men would start from the bow place one end of their poles against the river bottom brace their shoulders against the other end and then walk to the stern as rapidly as they could In this way from a mile to a mile and a half an hour could be made against the current of the river I as regimental quartermaster had charge of the public property and had also to look after the transportation A contract had been entered into with the steamship company in New York for the transportation of the regiment to California including the Isthmus transit A certain amount of baggage was allowed per man and saddle animals were to be furnished to commissioned officers and to all disabled persons The regiment with the exception of one company left as guards to the public property camp and garrison equipage principally and the soldiers with families took boats propelled as above described for Gorgona From this place they marched to Panama and were soon comfortably on the steamer anchored in the bay some three or four miles from the town I with one company of troops and all the soldiers with families all the tents mess chests and camp kettles was sent to Cruces a town a few miles higher up the Chagres River than Gorgona There I found an impecunious American who had taken the contract to furnish transportation for the regiment at a stipulated price per hundred pounds for the freight and so much for each saddle animal But when we reached Cruces there was not a mule either for pack or saddle in the place The contractor promised that the animals should be on hand in the morning In the morning he said that they were on the way from some imaginary place and would arrive in the course of the day This went on until I saw that he could not procure the animals at all at the price he had promised to furnish them for The unusual number of passengers that had come over on the steamer and the large amount of freight to pack had created an unprecedented demand for mules Some of the passengers paid as high as forty dollars for the use of a mule to ride twenty five miles when the mule would not have sold for ten dollars in that market at other times Meanwhile the cholera had broken out and men were dying every hour To diminish the food for the disease I permitted the company detailed with me to proceed to Panama The captain and the doctors accompanied the men and I was left alone with the sick and the soldiers who had families The regiment at Panama was also affected with the disease but there were better accommodations for the well on the steamer and a hospital for those taken with the disease on an old hulk anchored a mile off There were also hospital tents on shore on the island of Flamingo which stands in the bay I was about a week at Cruces before transportation began to come in About one third of the people with me died either at Cruces or on the way to Panama There was no agent of the transportation company at Cruces to consult or to take the responsibility of procuring transportation at a price which would secure it I therefore myself dismissed the contractor and made a new contract with a native at more than double the original price Thus we finally reached Panama The steamer however could not proceed until the cholera abated and the regiment was detained still longer Altogether on the Isthmus and on the Pacific side we were delayed six weeks About one seventh of those who left New York harbor with the fourth infantry on the fifth of July now lie buried on the Isthmus of Panama or on Flamingo island in Panama Bay One amusing circumstance occurred while we were lying at anchor in Panama Bay In the regiment there was a Lieutenant Slaughter who was very liable to sea sickness It almost made him sick to see the wave of a table cloth when the servants were spreading it Soon after his graduation Slaughter was ordered to California and took passage by a sailing vessel going around Cape Horn The vessel was seven months making the voyage and Slaughter was sick every moment of the time never more so than while lying at anchor after reaching his place of destination On landing in California he found orders which had come by the Isthmus notifying him of a mistake in his assignment he should have been ordered to the northern lakes He started back by the Isthmus route and was sick all the way But when he arrived at the East he was again ordered to California this time definitely and at this date was making his third trip He was as sick as ever and had been so for more than a month while lying at anchor in the bay I remember him well seated with his elbows on the table in front of him his chin between his hands and looking the picture of despair At last he broke out I wish I had taken my father s advice he wanted me to go into the navy if I had done so I should not have had to go to sea so much Poor Slaughter it was his last sea voyage He was killed by Indians in Oregon By the last of August the cholera had so abated that it was deemed safe to start The disease did not break out again on the way to California and we reached San Francisco early in September CHAPTER XV SAN FRANCISCO EARLY CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES LIFE ON THE PACIFIC COAST PROMOTED CAPTAIN FLUSH TIMES IN CALIFORNIA San Francisco at that day was a lively place Gold or placer digging as it was called was at its height Steamers plied daily between San Francisco and both Stockton and Sacramento Passengers and gold from the southern mines came by the Stockton boat from the northern mines by Sacramento In the evening when these boats arrived Long Wharf there was but one wharf in San Francisco in eighteen fifty two was alive with people crowding to meet the miners as they came down to sell their dust and to have a time Of these some were runners for hotels boarding houses or restaurants others belonged to a class of impecunious adventurers of good manners and good presence who were ever on the alert to make the acquaintance of people with some ready means in the hope of being asked to take a meal at a restaurant Many were young men of good family good education and gentlemanly instincts Their parents had been able to support them during their minority and to give them good educations but not to maintain them afterwards From eighteen forty nine to eighteen fifty three there was a rush of people to the Pacific coast of the class described All thought that fortunes were to be picked up without effort in the gold fields on the Pacific Some realized more than their most sanguine expectations but for one such there were hundreds disappointed many of whom now fill unknown graves others died wrecks of their former selves and many without a vicious instinct became criminals and outcasts Many of the real scenes in early California life exceed in strangeness and interest any of the mere products of the brain of the novelist Those early days in California brought out character It was a long way off then and the journey was expensive The fortunate could go by Cape Horn or by the Isthmus of Panama but the mass of pioneers crossed the plains with their ox teams This took an entire summer They were very lucky when they got through with a yoke of worn out cattle All other means were exhausted in procuring the outfit on the Missouri River The immigrant on arriving found himself a stranger in a strange land far from friends Time pressed for the little means that could be realized from the sale of what was left of the outfit would not support a man long at California prices Many became discouraged Others would take off their coats and look for a job no matter what it might be These succeeded as a rule There were many young men who had studied professions before they went to California and who had never done a day s manual labor in their lives who took in the situation at once and went to work to make a start at anything they could get to do Some supplied carpenters and masons with material carrying plank brick or mortar as the case might be others drove stages drays or baggage wagons until they could do better More became discouraged early and spent their time looking up people who would treat or lounging about restaurants and gambling houses where free lunches were furnished daily They were welcomed at these places because they often brought in miners who proved good customers My regiment spent a few weeks at Benicia barracks and then was ordered to Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River then in Oregon Territory During the winter of eighteen fifty two three the territory was divided all north of the Columbia River being taken from Oregon to make Washington Territory Prices for all kinds of supplies were so high on the Pacific coast from eighteen forty nine until at least eighteen fifty three that it would have been impossible for officers of the army to exist upon their pay if it had not been that authority was given them to purchase from the commissary such supplies as he kept at New Orleans wholesale prices A cook could not be hired for the pay of a captain The cook could do better At Benicia in eighteen fifty two flour was twenty five cents per pound potatoes were sixteen cents beets turnips and cabbage six cents onions thirty seven one two cents meat and other articles in proportion In eighteen fifty three at Vancouver vegetables were a little lower I with three other officers concluded that we would raise a crop for ourselves and by selling the surplus realize something handsome I bought a pair of horses that had crossed the plains that summer and were very poor They recuperated rapidly however and proved a good team to break up the ground with I performed all the labor of breaking up the ground while the other officers planted the potatoes Our crop was enormous Luckily for us the Columbia River rose to a great height from the melting of the snow in the mountains in June and overflowed and killed most of our crop This saved digging it up for everybody on the Pacific coast seemed to have come to the conclusion at the same time that agriculture would be profitable In eighteen fifty three more than three quarters of the potatoes raised were permitted to rot in the ground or had to be thrown away The only potatoes we sold were to our own mess While I was stationed on the Pacific coast we were free from Indian wars There were quite a number of remnants of tribes in the vicinity of Portland in Oregon and of Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory They had generally acquired some of the vices of civilization but none of the virtues except in individual cases The Hudson s Bay Company had held the North west with their trading posts for many years before the United States was represented on the Pacific coast They still retained posts along the Columbia River and one at Fort Vancouver when I was there Their treatment of the Indians had brought out the better qualities of the savages Farming had been undertaken by the company to supply the Indians with bread and vegetables they raised some cattle and horses and they had now taught the Indians to do the labor of the farm and herd They always compensated them for their labor and always gave them goods of uniform quality and at uniform price Before the advent of the American the medium of exchange between the Indian and the white man was pelts Afterward it was silver coin If an Indian received in the sale of a horse a fifty dollar gold piece not an infrequent occurrence the first thing he did was to exchange it for American half dollars These he could count He would then commence his purchases paying for each article separately as he got it He would not trust any one to add up the bill and pay it all at once At that day fifty dollar gold pieces not the issue of the government were common on the Pacific coast They were called slugs The Indians along the lower Columbia as far as the Cascades and on the lower Willamette died off very fast during the year I spent in that section for besides acquiring the vices of the white people they had acquired also their diseases The measles and the small pox were both amazingly fatal In their wild state before the appearance of the white man among them the principal complaints they were subject to were those produced by long involuntary fasting violent exercise in pursuit of game and over eating Instinct more than reason had taught them a remedy for these ills It was the steam bath Something like a bake oven was built large enough to admit a man lying down Bushes were stuck in the ground in two rows about six feet long and some two or three feet apart other bushes connected the rows at one end The tops of the bushes were drawn together to interlace and confined in that position the whole was then plastered over with wet clay until every opening was filled Just inside the open end of the oven the floor was scooped out so as to make a hole that would hold a bucket or two of water These ovens were always built on the banks of a stream a big spring or pool of water When a patient required a bath a fire was built near the oven and a pile of stones put upon it The cavity at the front was then filled with water When the stones were sufficiently heated the patient would draw himself into the oven a blanket would be thrown over the open end and hot stones put into the water until the patient could stand it no longer He was then withdrawn from his steam bath and doused into the cold stream near by This treatment may have answered with the early ailments of the Indians With the measles or small pox it would kill every time During my year on the Columbia River the small pox exterminated one small remnant of a band of Indians entirely and reduced others materially I do not think there was a case of recovery among them until the doctor with the Hudson Bay Company took the matter in hand and established a hospital Nearly every case he treated recovered I never myself saw the treatment described in the preceding paragraph but have heard it described by persons who have witnessed it The decimation among the Indians I knew of personally and the hospital established for their benefit was a Hudson s Bay building not a stone s throw from my own quarters The death of Colonel Bliss of the Adjutant General s department which occurred July fifth eighteen fifty three promoted me to the captaincy of a company then stationed at Humboldt Bay California The notice reached me in September of the same year and I very soon started to join my new command There was no way of reaching Humboldt at that time except to take passage on a San Francisco sailing vessel going after lumber Red wood a species of cedar which on the Pacific coast takes the place filled by white pine in the East then abounded on the banks of Humboldt Bay There were extensive saw mills engaged in preparing this lumber for the San Francisco market and sailing vessels used in getting it to market furnished the only means of communication between Humboldt and the balance of the world I was obliged to remain in San Francisco for several days before I found a vessel This gave me a good opportunity of comparing the San Francisco of eighteen fifty two with that of eighteen fifty three As before stated there had been but one wharf in front of the city in eighteen fifty two Long Wharf In eighteen fifty three the town had grown out into the bay beyond what was the end of this wharf when I first saw it Streets and houses had been built out on piles where the year before the largest vessels visiting the port lay at anchor or tied to the wharf There was no filling under the streets or houses San Francisco presented the same general appearance as the year before that is eating drinking and gambling houses were conspicuous for their number and publicity They were on the first floor with doors wide open At all hours of the day and night in walking the streets the eye was regaled on every block near the water front by the sight of players at faro Often broken places were found in the street large enough to let a man down into the water below I have but little doubt that many of the people who went to the Pacific coast in the early days of the gold excitement and have never been heard from since or who were heard from for a time and then ceased to write found watery graves beneath the houses or streets built over San Francisco Bay Besides the gambling in cards there was gambling on a larger scale in city lots These were sold On Change much as stocks are now sold on Wall Street Cash at time of purchase was always paid by the broker but the purchaser had only to put up his margin He was charged at the rate of two or three per cent a month on the difference besides commissions The sand hills some of them almost inaccessible to foot passengers were surveyed off and mapped into fifty vara lots a vara being a Spanish yard These were sold at first at very low prices but were sold and resold for higher prices until they went up to many thousands of dollars The brokers did a fine business and so did many such purchasers as were sharp enough to quit purchasing before the final crash came As the city grew the sand hills back of the town furnished material for filling up the bay under the houses and streets and still further out The temporary houses first built over the water in the harbor soon gave way to more solid structures The main business part of the city now is on solid ground made where vessels of the largest class lay at anchor in the early days I was in San Francisco again in eighteen fifty four Gambling houses had disappeared from public view The city had become staid and orderly CHAPTER XVI RESIGNATION PRIVATE LIFE LIFE AT GALENA THE COMING CRISIS My family all this while was at the East It consisted now of a wife and two children I saw no chance of supporting them on the Pacific coast out of my pay as an army officer I concluded therefore to resign and in March applied for a leave of absence until the end of the July following tendering my resignation to take effect at the end of that time I left the Pacific coast very much attached to it and with the full expectation of making it my future home That expectation and that hope remained uppermost in my mind until the Lieutenant Generalcy bill was introduced into Congress in the winter of eighteen sixty three four The passage of that bill and my promotion blasted my last hope of ever becoming a citizen of the further West In the late summer of eighteen fifty four I rejoined my family to find in it a son whom I had never seen born while I was on the Isthmus of Panama I was now to commence at the age of thirty two a new struggle for our support My wife had a farm near saint Louis to which we went but I had no means to stock it A house had to be built also I worked very hard never losing a day because of bad weather and accomplished the object in a moderate way If nothing else could be done I would load a cord of wood on a wagon and take it to the city for sale I managed to keep along very well until eighteen fifty eight when I was attacked by fever and ague I had suffered very severely and for a long time from this disease while a boy in Ohio It lasted now over a year and while it did not keep me in the house it did interfere greatly with the amount of work I was able to perform In the fall of eighteen fifty eight I sold out my stock crops and farming utensils at auction and gave up farming In the winter I established a partnership with Harry Boggs a cousin of missus Grant in the real estate agency business I spent that winter at saint Louis myself but did not take my family into town until the spring Our business might have become prosperous if I had been able to wait for it to grow As it was there was no more than one person could attend to and not enough to support two families While a citizen of saint Louis and engaged in the real estate agency business I was a candidate for the office of county engineer an office of respectability and emolument which would have been very acceptable to me at that time The incumbent was appointed by the county court which consisted of five members My opponent had the advantage of birth over me he was a citizen by adoption and carried off the prize I now withdrew from the company partnership with Boggs and in May eighteen sixty removed to Galena Illinois and took a clerkship in my father s store While a citizen of Missouri my first opportunity for casting a vote at a Presidential election occurred I had been in the army from before attaining my majority and had thought but little about politics although I was a Whig by education and a great admirer of mister Clay But the Whig party had ceased to exist before I had an opportunity of exercising the privilege of casting a ballot the Know Nothing party had taken its place but was on the wane and the Republican party was in a chaotic state and had not yet received a name It had no existence in the Slave States except at points on the borders next to Free States In saint Louis City and County what afterwards became the Republican party was known as the Free Soil Democracy led by the Honorable Frank P Blair Most of my neighbors had known me as an officer of the army with Whig proclivities They had been on the same side and on the death of their party many had become Know Nothings or members of the American party There was a lodge near my new home and I was invited to join it I accepted the invitation was initiated attended a meeting just one week later and never went to another afterwards I have no apologies to make for having been one week a member of the American party for I still think native born citizens of the United States should have as much protection as many privileges in their native country as those who voluntarily select it for a home But all secret oath bound political parties are dangerous to any nation no matter how pure or how patriotic the motives and principles which first bring them together No political party can or ought to exist when one of its corner stones is opposition to freedom of thought and to the right to worship God according to the dictate of one s own conscience or according to the creed of any religious denomination whatever Nevertheless if a sect sets up its laws as binding above the State laws wherever the two come in conflict this claim must be resisted and suppressed at whatever cost Up to the Mexican war there were a few out and out abolitionists men who carried their hostility to slavery into all elections from those for a justice of the peace up to the Presidency of the United States They were noisy but not numerous But the great majority of people at the North where slavery did not exist were opposed to the institution and looked upon its existence in any part of the country as unfortunate They did not hold the States where slavery existed responsible for it and believed that protection should be given to the right of property in slaves until some satisfactory way could be reached to be rid of the institution Opposition to slavery was not a creed of either political party In some sections more anti slavery men belonged to the Democratic party and in others to the Whigs But with the inauguration of the Mexican war in fact with the annexation of Texas the inevitable conflict commenced As the time for the Presidential election of eighteen fifty six the first at which I had the opportunity of voting approached party feeling began to run high The Republican party was regarded in the South and the border States not only as opposed to the extension of slavery but as favoring the compulsory abolition of the institution without compensation to the owners The most horrible visions seemed to present themselves to the minds of people who one would suppose ought to have known better Many educated and otherwise sensible persons appeared to believe that emancipation meant social equality Treason to the Government was openly advocated and was not rebuked It was evident to my mind that the election of a Republican President in eighteen fifty six meant the secession of all the Slave States and rebellion Under these circumstances I preferred the success of a candidate whose election would prevent or postpone secession to seeing the country plunged into a war the end of which no man could foretell With a Democrat elected by the unanimous vote of the Slave States there could be no pretext for secession for four years I very much hoped that the passions of the people would subside in that time and the catastrophe be averted altogether if it was not I believed the country would be better prepared to receive the shock and to resist it I therefore voted for James Buchanan for President Four years later the Republican party was successful in electing its candidate to the Presidency The civilized world has learned the consequence Four millions of human beings held as chattels have been liberated the ballot has been given to them the free schools of the country have been opened to their children The nation still lives and the people are just as free to avoid social intimacy with the blacks as ever they were or as they are with white people While living in Galena I was nominally only a clerk supporting myself and family on a stipulated salary In reality my position was different My father had never lived in Galena himself but had established my two brothers there the one next younger than myself in charge of the business assisted by the youngest When I went there it was my father s intention to give up all connection with the business himself and to establish his three sons in it but the brother who had really built up the business was sinking with consumption and it was not thought best to make any change while he was in this condition He lived until September eighteen sixty one when he succumbed to that insidious disease which always flatters its victims into the belief that they are growing better up to the close of life A more honorable man never transacted business In September eighteen sixty one I was engaged in an employment which required all my attention elsewhere During the eleven months that I lived in Galena prior to the first call for volunteers I had been strictly attentive to my business and had made but few acquaintances other than customers and people engaged in the same line with myself When the election took place in November eighteen sixty I had not been a resident of Illinois long enough to gain citizenship and could not therefore vote I was really glad of this at the time for my pledges would have compelled me to vote for Stephen A Douglas who had no possible chance of election The contest was really between mister Breckinridge and mister Lincoln between minority rule and rule by the majority I wanted as between these candidates to see mister Lincoln elected Excitement ran high during the canvass and torch light processions enlivened the scene in the generally quiet streets of Galena many nights during the campaign I did not parade with either party but occasionally met with the wide awakes Republicans in their rooms and superintended their drill It was evident from the time of the Chicago nomination to the close of the canvass that the election of the Republican candidate would be the signal for some of the Southern States to secede I still had hopes that the four years which had elapsed since the first nomination of a Presidential candidate by a party distinctly opposed to slavery extension had given time for the extreme pro slavery sentiment to cool down for the Southerners to think well before they took the awful leap which they had so vehemently threatened But I was mistaken The Republican candidate was elected and solid substantial people of the North west and I presume the same order of people throughout the entire North felt very serious but determined after this event It was very much discussed whether the South would carry out its threat to secede and set up a separate government the corner stone of which should be protection to the Divine institution of slavery For there were people who believed in the divinity of human slavery as there are now people who believe Mormonism and Polygamy to be ordained by the Most High We forgive them for entertaining such notions but forbid their practice It was generally believed that there would be a flurry that some of the extreme Southern States would go so far as to pass ordinances of secession But the common impression was that this step was so plainly suicidal for the South that the movement would not spread over much of the territory and would not last long Doubtless the founders of our government the majority of them at least regarded the confederation of the colonies as an experiment Each colony considered itself a separate government that the confederation was for mutual protection against a foreign foe and the prevention of strife and war among themselves If there had been a desire on the part of any single State to withdraw from the compact at any time while the number of States was limited to the original thirteen I do not suppose there would have been any to contest the right no matter how much the determination might have been regretted The problem changed on the ratification of the Constitution by all the colonies it changed still more when amendments were added and if the right of any one State to withdraw continued to exist at all after the ratification of the Constitution it certainly ceased on the formation of new States at least so far as the new States themselves were concerned It was never possessed at all by Florida or the States west of the Mississippi all of which were purchased by the treasury of the entire nation Texas and the territory brought into the Union in consequence of annexation were purchased with both blood and treasure and Texas with a domain greater than that of any European state except Russia was permitted to retain as state property all the public lands within its borders It would have been ingratitude and injustice of the most flagrant sort for this State to withdraw from the Union after all that had been spent and done to introduce her yet if separation had actually occurred Texas must necessarily have gone with the South both on account of her institutions and her geographical position Secession was illogical as well as impracticable it was revolution Now the right of revolution is an inherent one When people are oppressed by their government it is a natural right they enjoy to relieve themselves of the oppression if they are strong enough either by withdrawal from it or by overthrowing it and substituting a government more acceptable But any people or part of a people who resort to this remedy stake their lives their property and every claim for protection given by citizenship on the issue Victory or the conditions imposed by the conqueror must be the result In the case of the war between the States it would have been the exact truth if the South had said We do not want to live with you Northern people any longer we know our institution of slavery is obnoxious to you and as you are growing numerically stronger than we it may at some time in the future be endangered So long as you permitted us to control the government and with the aid of a few friends at the North to enact laws constituting your section a guard against the escape of our property we were willing to live with you You have been submissive to our rule heretofore but it looks now as if you did not intend to continue so and we will remain in the Union no longer Instead of this the seceding States cried lustily Let us alone you have no constitutional power to interfere with us Newspapers and people at the North reiterated the cry Individuals might ignore the constitution but the Nation itself must not only obey it but must enforce the strictest construction of that instrument the construction put upon it by the Southerners themselves The fact is the constitution did not apply to any such contingency as the one existing from eighteen sixty one to eighteen sixty five Its framers never dreamed of such a contingency occurring If they had foreseen it the probabilities are they would have sanctioned the right of a State or States to withdraw rather than that there should be war between brothers The framers were wise in their generation and wanted to do the very best possible to secure their own liberty and independence and that also of their descendants to the latest days It is preposterous to suppose that the people of one generation can lay down the best and only rules of government for all who are to come after them and under unforeseen contingencies At the time of the framing of our constitution the only physical forces that had been subdued and made to serve man and do his labor were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe Rude machinery propelled by water power had been invented sails to propel ships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing breeze but the application of stream to propel vessels against both wind and current and machinery to do all manner of work had not been thought of The instantaneous transmission of messages around the world by means of electricity would probably at that day have been attributed to witchcraft or a league with the Devil Immaterial circumstances had changed as greatly as material ones We could not and ought not to be rigidly bound by the rules laid down under circumstances so different for emergencies so utterly unanticipated The fathers themselves would have been the first to declare that their prerogatives were not irrevocable They would surely have resisted secession could they have lived to see the shape it assumed I travelled through the Northwest considerably during the winter of eighteen sixty one We had customers in all the little towns in south west Wisconsin south east Minnesota and north east Iowa These generally knew I had been a captain in the regular army and had served through the Mexican war Consequently wherever I stopped at night some of the people would come to the public house where I was and sit till a late hour discussing the probabilities of the future My own views at that time were like those officially expressed by mister Seward at a later day that the war would be over in ninety days I continued to entertain these views until after the battle of Shiloh I believe now that there would have been no more battles at the West after the capture of Fort Donelson if all the troops in that region had been under a single commander who would have followed up that victory There is little doubt in my mind now that the prevailing sentiment of the South would have been opposed to secession in eighteen sixty and eighteen sixty one if there had been a fair and calm expression of opinion unbiased by threats and if the ballot of one legal voter had counted for as much as that of any other But there was no calm discussion of the question Demagogues who were too old to enter the army if there should be a war others who entertained so high an opinion of their own ability that they did not believe they could be spared from the direction of the affairs of state in such an event declaimed vehemently and unceasingly against the North against its aggressions upon the South its interference with Southern rights et cetera et cetera They denounced the Northerners as cowards poltroons negro worshippers claimed that one Southern man was equal to five Northern men in battle that if the South would stand up for its rights the North would back down mister Jefferson Davis said in a speech delivered at La Grange Mississippi before the secession of that State that he would agree to drink all the blood spilled south of Mason and Dixon s line if there should be a war The young men who would have the fighting to do in case of war believed all these statements both in regard to the aggressiveness of the North and its cowardice They too cried out for a separation from such people The great bulk of the legal voters of the South were men who owned no slaves their homes were generally in the hills and poor country their facilities for educating their children even up to the point of reading and writing were very limited their interest in the contest was very meagre what there was if they had been capable of seeing it was with the North they too needed emancipation Under the old regime they were looked down upon by those who controlled all the affairs in the interest of slave owners as poor white trash who were allowed the ballot so long as they cast it according to direction I am aware that this last statement may be disputed and individual testimony perhaps adduced to show that in ante bellum days the ballot was as untrammelled in the south as in any section of the country but in the face of any such contradiction I reassert the statement The shot gun was not resorted to Masked men did not ride over the country at night intimidating voters but there was a firm feeling that a class existed in every State with a sort of divine right to control public affairs If they could not get this control by one means they must by another The end justified the means The coercion if mild was complete There were two political parties it is true in all the States both strong in numbers and respectability but both equally loyal to the institution which stood paramount in Southern eyes to all other institutions in state or nation The slave owners were the minority but governed both parties Had politics ever divided the slave holders and the non slave holders the majority would have been obliged to yield or internecine war would have been the consequence I do not know that the Southern people were to blame for this condition of affairs There was a time when slavery was not profitable and the discussion of the merits of the institution was confined almost exclusively to the territory where it existed The States of Virginia and Kentucky came near abolishing slavery by their own acts one State defeating the measure by a tie vote and the other only lacking one But when the institution became profitable all talk of its abolition ceased where it existed and naturally as human nature is constituted arguments were adduced in its support The cotton gin probably had much to do with the justification of slavery The winter of eighteen sixty one will be remembered by middle aged people of to day as one of great excitement South Carolina promptly seceded after the result of the Presidential election was known Other Southern States proposed to follow In some of them the Union sentiment was so strong that it had to be suppressed by force Maryland Delaware Kentucky and Missouri all Slave States failed to pass ordinances of secession but they were all represented in the so called congress of the so called Confederate States The Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Missouri in eighteen sixty one Jackson and Reynolds were both supporters of the rebellion and took refuge with the enemy The governor soon died and the lieutenant governor assumed his office issued proclamations as governor of the State was recognized as such by the Confederate Government and continued his pretensions until the collapse of the rebellion The South claimed the sovereignty of States but claimed the right to coerce into their confederation such States as they wanted that is all the States where slavery existed They did not seem to think this course inconsistent The fact is the Southern slave owners believed that in some way the ownership of slaves conferred a sort of patent of nobility a right to govern independent of the interest or wishes of those who did not hold such property They convinced themselves first of the divine origin of the institution and next that that particular institution was not safe in the hands of any body of legislators but themselves Meanwhile the Administration of President Buchanan looked helplessly on and proclaimed that the general government had no power to interfere that the Nation had no power to save its own life mister Buchanan had in his cabinet two members at least who were as earnest to use a mild term in the cause of secession as mister Davis or any Southern statesman One of them Floyd the Secretary of War scattered the army so that much of it could be captured when hostilities should commence and distributed the cannon and small arms from Northern arsenals throughout the South so as to be on hand when treason wanted them The navy was scattered in like manner The President did not prevent his cabinet preparing for war upon their government either by destroying its resources or storing them in the South until a de facto government was established with Jefferson Davis as its President and Montgomery Alabama as the Capital The secessionists had then to leave the cabinet In their own estimation they were aliens in the country which had given them birth Loyal men were put into their places Treason in the executive branch of the government was estopped But the harm had already been done The stable door was locked after the horse had been stolen During all of the trying winter of eighteen sixty one when the Southerners were so defiant that they would not allow within their borders the expression of a sentiment hostile to their views it was a brave man indeed who could stand up and proclaim his loyalty to the Union On the other hand men at the North prominent men proclaimed that the government had no power to coerce the South into submission to the laws of the land that if the North undertook to raise armies to go south these armies would have to march over the dead bodies of the speakers A portion of the press of the North was constantly proclaiming similar views When the time arrived for the President elect to go to the capital of the Nation to be sworn into office it was deemed unsafe for him to travel not only as a President elect but as any private citizen should be allowed to do Instead of going in a special car receiving the good wishes of his constituents at all the stations along the road he was obliged to stop on the way and to be smuggled into the capital He disappeared from public view on his journey and the next the country knew his arrival was announced at the capital There is little doubt that he would have been assassinated if he had attempted to travel openly throughout his journey CHAPTER XVII OUTBREAK OF THE REBELLION PRESIDING AT A UNION MEETING MUSTERING OFFICER OF STATE TROOPS LYON AT CAMP JACKSON SERVICES TENDERED TO THE GOVERNMENT The fourth of March eighteen sixty one came and Abraham Lincoln was sworn to maintain the Union against all its enemies The secession of one State after another followed until eleven had gone out On the eleventh of April Fort Sumter a National fort in the harbor of Charleston South Carolina was fired upon by the Southerners and a few days after was captured The Confederates proclaimed themselves aliens and thereby debarred themselves of all right to claim protection under the Constitution of the United States We did not admit the fact that they were aliens but all the same they debarred themselves of the right to expect better treatment than people of any other foreign state who make war upon an independent nation Upon the firing on Sumter President Lincoln issued his first call for troops and soon after a proclamation convening Congress in extra session The call was for seventy five thousand volunteers for ninety days service If the shot fired at Fort Sumter was heard around the world the call of the President for seventy five thousand men was heard throughout the Northern States There was not a state in the North of a million of inhabitants that would not have furnished the entire number faster than arms could have been supplied to them if it had been necessary As soon as the news of the call for volunteers reached Galena posters were stuck up calling for a meeting of the citizens at the court house in the evening Business ceased entirely all was excitement for a time there were no party distinctions all were Union men determined to avenge the insult to the national flag In the evening the court house was packed Although a comparative stranger I was called upon to preside the sole reason possibly was that I had been in the army and had seen service With much embarrassment and some prompting I made out to announce the object of the meeting Speeches were in order but it is doubtful whether it would have been safe just then to make other than patriotic ones There was probably no one in the house however who felt like making any other The two principal speeches were by B B Howard the post master and a Breckinridge Democrat at the November election the fall before and John A Rawlins an elector on the Douglas ticket E B Washburne with whom I was not acquainted at that time came in after the meeting had been organized and expressed I understood afterwards a little surprise that Galena could not furnish a presiding officer for such an occasion without taking a stranger He came forward and was introduced and made a speech appealing to the patriotism of the meeting After the speaking was over volunteers were called for to form a company The quota of Illinois had been fixed at six regiments and it was supposed that one company would be as much as would be accepted from Galena The company was raised and the officers and non commissioned officers elected before the meeting adjourned I declined the captaincy before the balloting but announced that I would aid the company in every way I could and would be found in the service in some position if there should be a war I never went into our leather store after that meeting to put up a package or do other business The ladies of Galena were quite as patriotic as the men They could not enlist but they conceived the idea of sending their first company to the field uniformed They came to me to get a description of the United States uniform for infantry subscribed and bought the material procured tailors to cut out the garments and the ladies made them up In a few days the company was in uniform and ready to report at the State capital for assignment The men all turned out the morning after their enlistment and I took charge divided them into squads and superintended their drill When they were ready to go to Springfield I went with them and remained there until they were assigned to a regiment There were so many more volunteers than had been called for that the question whom to accept was quite embarrassing to the governor Richard Yates The legislature was in session at the time however and came to his relief A law was enacted authorizing the governor to accept the services of ten additional regiments one from each congressional district for one month to be paid by the State but pledged to go into the service of the United States if there should be a further call during their term Even with this relief the governor was still very much embarrassed Before the war was over he was like the President when he was taken with the varioloid at last he had something he could give to all who wanted it In time the Galena company was mustered into the United States service forming a part of the eleventh Illinois volunteer infantry My duties I thought had ended at Springfield and I was prepared to start home by the evening train leaving at nine o clock Up to that time I do not think I had been introduced to Governor Yates or had ever spoken to him I knew him by sight however because he was living at the same hotel and I often saw him at table The evening I was to quit the capital I left the supper room before the governor and was standing at the front door when he came out He spoke to me calling me by my old army title Captain and said he understood that I was about leaving the city I answered that I was He said he would be glad if I would remain over night and call at the Executive office the next morning I complied with his request and was asked to go into the Adjutant General s office and render such assistance as I could the governor saying that my army experience would be of great service there I accepted the proposition My old army experience I found indeed of very great service I was no clerk nor had I any capacity to become one The only place I ever found in my life to put a paper so as to find it again was either a side coat pocket or the hands of a clerk or secretary more careful than myself But I had been quartermaster commissary and adjutant in the field The army forms were familiar to me and I could direct how they should be made out There was a clerk in the office of the Adjutant General who supplied my deficiencies The ease with which the State of Illinois settled its accounts with the government at the close of the war is evidence of the efficiency of mister Loomis as an accountant on a large scale He remained in the office until that time As I have stated the legislature authorized the governor to accept the services of ten additional regiments I had charge of mustering these regiments into the State service They were assembled at the most convenient railroad centres in their respective congressional districts I detailed officers to muster in a portion of them but mustered three in the southern part of the State myself One of these was to assemble at Belleville some eighteen miles south east of saint Louis When I got there I found that only one or two companies had arrived There was no probability of the regiment coming together under five days This gave me a few idle days which I concluded to spend in saint Louis There was a considerable force of State militia at Camp Jackson on the outskirts of saint Louis at the time There is but little doubt that it was the design of Governor Claiborn Jackson to have these troops ready to seize the United States arsenal and the city of saint Louis Why they did not do so I do not know There was but a small garrison two companies I think under Captain N Lyon at the arsenal and but for the timely services of the honorable F P Blair I have little doubt that saint Louis would have gone into rebel hands and with it the arsenal with all its arms and ammunition Blair was a leader among the Union men of saint Louis in eighteen sixty one There was no State government in Missouri at the time that would sanction the raising of troops or commissioned officers to protect United States property but Blair had probably procured some form of authority from the President to raise troops in Missouri and to muster them into the service of the United States At all events he did raise a regiment and took command himself as Colonel With this force he reported to Captain Lyon and placed himself and regiment under his orders It was whispered that Lyon thus reinforced intended to break up Camp Jackson and capture the militia I went down to the arsenal in the morning to see the troops start out I had known Lyon for two years at West Point and in the old army afterwards Blair I knew very well by sight I had heard him speak in the canvass of eighteen fifty eight possibly several times but I had never spoken to him As the troops marched out of the enclosure around the arsenal Blair was on his horse outside forming them into line preparatory to their march I introduced myself to him and had a few moments conversation and expressed my sympathy with his purpose This was my first personal acquaintance with the Honorable afterwards Major General F P Blair Camp Jackson surrendered without a fight and the garrison was marched down to the arsenal as prisoners of war Up to this time the enemies of the government in saint Louis had been bold and defiant while Union men were quiet but determined The enemies had their head quarters in a central and public position on Pine Street near Fifth from which the rebel flag was flaunted boldly The Union men had a place of meeting somewhere in the city I did not know where and I doubt whether they dared to enrage the enemies of the government by placing the national flag outside their head quarters As soon as the news of the capture of Camp Jackson reached the city the condition of affairs was changed Union men became rampant aggressive and if you will intolerant They proclaimed their sentiments boldly and were impatient at anything like disrespect for the Union The secessionists became quiet but were filled with suppressed rage They had been playing the bully The Union men ordered the rebel flag taken down from the building on Pine Street The command was given in tones of authority and it was taken down never to be raised again in saint Louis I witnessed the scene I had heard of the surrender of the camp and that the garrison was on its way to the arsenal I had seen the troops start out in the morning and had wished them success I now determined to go to the arsenal and await their arrival and congratulate them I stepped on a car standing at the corner of fourth and Pine streets and saw a crowd of people standing quietly in front of the head quarters who were there for the purpose of hauling down the flag There were squads of other people at intervals down the street They too were quiet but filled with suppressed rage and muttered their resentment at the insult to what they called their flag Before the car I was in had started a dapper little fellow he would be called a dude at this day stepped in He was in a great state of excitement and used adjectives freely to express his contempt for the Union and for those who had just perpetrated such an outrage upon the rights of a free people There was only one other passenger in the car besides myself when this young man entered He evidently expected to find nothing but sympathy when he got away from the mud sills engaged in compelling a free people to pull down a flag they adored He turned to me saying Things have come to a pretty pass when a free people can t choose their own flag Where I came from if a man dares to say a word in favor of the Union we hang him to a limb of the first tree we come to I replied that after all we were not so intolerant in saint Louis as we might be I had not seen a single rebel hung yet nor heard of one there were plenty of them who ought to be however The young man subsided He was so crestfallen that I believe if I had ordered him to leave the car he would have gone quietly out saying to himself More Yankee oppression By nightfall the late defenders of Camp Jackson were all within the walls of the saint Louis arsenal prisoners of war The next day I left saint Louis for Mattoon Illinois where I was to muster in the regiment from that congressional district This was the twenty first Illinois infantry the regiment of which I subsequently became colonel I mustered one regiment afterwards when my services for the State were about closed Brigadier General John Pope was stationed at Springfield as United States mustering officer all the time I was in the State service He was a native of Illinois and well acquainted with most of the prominent men in the State I was a carpet bagger and knew but few of them While I was on duty at Springfield the senators representatives in Congress ax governors and the State legislators were nearly all at the State capital The only acquaintance I made among them was with the governor whom I was serving and by chance with Senator S A Douglas The only members of Congress I knew were Washburne and Philip Foulk With the former though he represented my district and we were citizens of the same town I only became acquainted at the meeting when the first company of Galena volunteers was raised Foulk I had known in saint Louis when I was a citizen of that city I had been three years at West Point with Pope and had served with him a short time during the Mexican war under General Taylor I saw a good deal of him during my service with the State On one occasion he said to me that I ought to go into the United States service I told him I intended to do so if there was a war He spoke of his acquaintance with the public men of the State and said he could get them to recommend me for a position and that he would do all he could for me I declined to receive endorsement for permission to fight for my country Going home for a day or two soon after this conversation with General Pope I wrote from Galena the following letter to the Adjutant General of the Army GALENA ILLINOIS May twenty four eighteen sixty one colonel L THOMAS Adjt general U S A Washington D C SIR Having served for fifteen years in the regular army including four years at West Point and feeling it the duty of every one who has been educated at the Government expense to offer their services for the support of that Government I have the honor very respectfully to tender my services until the close of the war in such capacity as may be offered I would say in view of my present age and length of service I feel myself competent to command a regiment if the President in his judgment should see fit to intrust one to me Since the first call of the President I have been serving on the staff of the Governor of this State rendering such aid as I could in the organization of our State militia and am still engaged in that capacity A letter addressed to me at Springfield Illinois will reach me I am very respectfully Your obt svt U S GRANT This letter failed to elicit an answer from the Adjutant General of the Army I presume it was hardly read by him and certainly it could not have been submitted to higher authority Subsequent to the war General Badeau having heard of this letter applied to the War Department for a copy of it The letter could not be found and no one recollected ever having seen it I took no copy when it was written Long after the application of General Badeau General Townsend who had become Adjutant General of the Army while packing up papers preparatory to the removal of his office found this letter in some out of the way place It had not been destroyed but it had not been regularly filed away I felt some hesitation in suggesting rank as high as the colonelcy of a regiment feeling somewhat doubtful whether I would be equal to the position But I had seen nearly every colonel who had been mustered in from the State of Illinois and some from Indiana and felt that if they could command a regiment properly and with credit I could also Having but little to do after the muster of the last of the regiments authorized by the State legislature I asked and obtained of the governor leave of absence for a week to visit my parents in Covington Kentucky immediately opposite Cincinnati General McClellan had been made a major general and had his headquarters at Cincinnati In reality I wanted to see him I had known him slightly at West Point where we served one year together and in the Mexican war I was in hopes that when he saw me he would offer me a position on his staff I called on two successive days at his office but failed to see him on either occasion and returned to Springfield CHAPTER XVIII APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE twenty oneST ILLINOIS PERSONNEL OF THE REGIMENT GENERAL LOGAN MARCH TO MISSOURI MOVEMENT AGAINST HARRIS AT FLORIDA MO GENERAL POPE IN COMMAND STATIONED AT MEXICO MO While I was absent from the State capital on this occasion the President s second call for troops was issued This time it was for three hundred thousand men for three years or the war This brought into the United States service all the regiments then in the State service These had elected their officers from highest to lowest and were accepted with their organizations as they were except in two instances A Chicago regiment the nineteenth infantry had elected a very young man to the colonelcy When it came to taking the field the regiment asked to have another appointed colonel and the one they had previously chosen made lieutenant colonel The twenty first regiment of infantry mustered in by me at Mattoon refused to go into the service with the colonel of their selection in any position While I was still absent Governor Yates appointed me colonel of this latter regiment A few days after I was in charge of it and in camp on the fair grounds near Springfield My regiment was composed in large part of young men of as good social position as any in their section of the State It embraced the sons of farmers lawyers physicians politicians merchants bankers and ministers and some men of maturer years who had filled such positions themselves There were also men in it who could be led astray and the colonel elected by the votes of the regiment had proved to be fully capable of developing all there was in his men of recklessness It was said that he even went so far at times as to take the guard from their posts and go with them to the village near by and make a night of it When there came a prospect of battle the regiment wanted to have some one else to lead them I found it very hard work for a few days to bring all the men into anything like subordination but the great majority favored discipline and by the application of a little regular army punishment all were reduced to as good discipline as one could ask The ten regiments which had volunteered in the State service for thirty days it will be remembered had done so with a pledge to go into the National service if called upon within that time When they volunteered the government had only called for ninety days enlistments Men were called now for three years or the war They felt that this change of period released them from the obligation of re volunteering When I was appointed colonel the twenty first regiment was still in the State service About the time they were to be mustered into the United States service such of them as would go two members of Congress from the State McClernand and Logan appeared at the capital and I was introduced to them I had never seen either of them before but I had read a great deal about them and particularly about Logan in the newspapers Both were democratic members of Congress and Logan had been elected from the southern district of the State where he had a majority of eighteen thousand over his Republican competitor His district had been settled originally by people from the Southern States and at the breaking out of secession they sympathized with the South At the first outbreak of war some of them joined the Southern army many others were preparing to do so others rode over the country at night denouncing the Union and made it as necessary to guard railroad bridges over which National troops had to pass in southern Illinois as it was in Kentucky or any of the border slave states Logan s popularity in this district was unbounded He knew almost enough of the people in it by their Christian names to form an ordinary congressional district As he went in politics so his district was sure to go The Republican papers had been demanding that he should announce where he stood on the questions which at that time engrossed the whole of public thought Some were very bitter in their denunciations of his silence Logan was not a man to be coerced into an utterance by threats He did however come out in a speech before the adjournment of the special session of Congress which was convened by the President soon after his inauguration and announced his undying loyalty and devotion to the Union But I had not happened to see that speech so that when I first met Logan my impressions were those formed from reading denunciations of him McClernand on the other hand had early taken strong grounds for the maintenance of the Union and had been praised accordingly by the Republican papers The gentlemen who presented these two members of Congress asked me if I would have any objections to their addressing my regiment I hesitated a little before answering It was but a few days before the time set for mustering into the United States service such of the men as were willing to volunteer for three years or the war I had some doubt as to the effect a speech from Logan might have but as he was with McClernand whose sentiments on the all absorbing questions of the day were well known I gave my consent McClernand spoke first and Logan followed in a speech which he has hardly equalled since for force and eloquence It breathed a loyalty and devotion to the Union which inspired my men to such a point that they would have volunteered to remain in the army as long as an enemy of the country continued to bear arms against it They entered the United States service almost to a man General Logan went to his part of the State and gave his attention to raising troops The very men who at first made it necessary to guard the roads in southern Illinois became the defenders of the Union Logan entered the service himself as colonel of a regiment and rapidly rose to the rank of major general His district which had promised at first to give much trouble to the government filled every call made upon it for troops without resorting to the draft There was no call made when there were not more volunteers than were asked for That congressional district stands credited at the War Department to day with furnishing more men for the army than it was called on to supply I remained in Springfield with my regiment until the threed of July when I was ordered to Quincy Illinois By that time the regiment was in a good state of discipline and the officers and men were well up in the company drill There was direct railroad communication between Springfield and Quincy but I thought it would be good preparation for the troops to march there We had no transportation for our camp and garrison equipage so wagons were hired for the occasion and on the threed of July we started There was no hurry but fair marches were made every day until the Illinois River was crossed There I was overtaken by a dispatch saying that the destination of the regiment had been changed to Ironton Missouri and ordering me to halt where I was and await the arrival of a steamer which had been dispatched up the Illinois River to take the regiment to saint Louis The boat when it did come grounded on a sand bar a few miles below where we were in camp We remained there several days waiting to have the boat get off the bar but before this occurred news came that an Illinois regiment was surrounded by rebels at a point on the Hannibal and saint Joe Railroad some miles west of Palmyra in Missouri and I was ordered to proceed with all dispatch to their relief We took the cars and reached Quincy in a few hours When I left Galena for the last time to take command of the twenty first regiment I took with me my oldest son Frederick D Grant then a lad of eleven years of age On receiving the order to take rail for Quincy I wrote to missus Grant to relieve what I supposed would be her great anxiety for one so young going into danger that I would send Fred home from Quincy by river I received a prompt letter in reply decidedly disapproving my proposition and urging that the lad should be allowed to accompany me It came too late Fred was already on his way up the Mississippi bound for Dubuque Iowa from which place there was a railroad to Galena My sensations as we approached what I supposed might be a field of battle were anything but agreeable I had been in all the engagements in Mexico that it was possible for one person to be in but not in command If some one else had been colonel and I had been lieutenant colonel I do not think I would have felt any trepidation Before we were prepared to cross the Mississippi River at Quincy my anxiety was relieved for the men of the besieged regiment came straggling into town I am inclined to think both sides got frightened and ran away I took my regiment to Palmyra and remained there for a few days until relieved by the nineteenth Illinois infantry From Palmyra I proceeded to Salt River the railroad bridge over which had been destroyed by the enemy Colonel John M Palmer at that time commanded the thirteenth Illinois which was acting as a guard to workmen who were engaged in rebuilding this bridge Palmer was my senior and commanded the two regiments as long as we remained together The bridge was finished in about two weeks and I received orders to move against Colonel Thomas Harris who was said to be encamped at the little town of Florida some twenty five miles south of where we then were At the time of which I now write we had no transportation and the country about Salt River was sparsely settled so that it took some days to collect teams and drivers enough to move the camp and garrison equipage of a regiment nearly a thousand strong together with a week s supply of provision and some ammunition While preparations for the move were going on I felt quite comfortable but when we got on the road and found every house deserted I was anything but easy In the twenty five miles we had to march we did not see a person old or young male or female except two horsemen who were on a road that crossed ours As soon as they saw us they decamped as fast as their horses could carry them I kept my men in the ranks and forbade their entering any of the deserted houses or taking anything from them We halted at night on the road and proceeded the next morning at an early hour Harris had been encamped in a creek bottom for the sake of being near water The hills on either side of the creek extend to a considerable height possibly more than a hundred feet As we approached the brow of the hill from which it was expected we could see Harris camp and possibly find his men ready formed to meet us my heart kept getting higher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat I would have given anything then to have been back in Illinois but I had not the moral courage to halt and consider what to do I kept right on When we reached a point from which the valley below was in full view I halted The place where Harris had been encamped a few days before was still there and the marks of a recent encampment were plainly visible but the troops were gone My heart resumed its place It occurred to me at once that Harris had been as much afraid of me as I had been of him This was a view of the question I had never taken before but it was one I never forgot afterwards From that event to the close of the war I never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy though I always felt more or less anxiety I never forgot that he had as much reason to fear my forces as I had his The lesson was valuable Inquiries at the village of Florida divulged the fact that Colonel Harris learning of my intended movement while my transportation was being collected took time by the forelock and left Florida before I had started from Salt River He had increased the distance between us by forty miles The next day I started back to my old camp at Salt River bridge The citizens living on the line of our march had returned to their houses after we passed and finding everything in good order nothing carried away they were at their front doors ready to greet us now They had evidently been led to believe that the National troops carried death and devastation with them wherever they went In a short time after our return to Salt River bridge I was ordered with my regiment to the town of Mexico General Pope was then commanding the district embracing all of the State of Missouri between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers with his headquarters in the village of Mexico I was assigned to the command of a sub district embracing the troops in the immediate neighborhood some three regiments of infantry and a section of artillery There was one regiment encamped by the side of mine I assumed command of the whole and the first night sent the commander of the other regiment the parole and countersign Not wishing to be outdone in courtesy he immediately sent me the countersign for his regiment for the night When he was informed that the countersign sent to him was for use with his regiment as well as mine it was difficult to make him understand that this was not an unwarranted interference of one colonel over another No doubt he attributed it for the time to the presumption of a graduate of West Point over a volunteer pure and simple But the question was soon settled and we had no further trouble My arrival in Mexico had been preceded by that of two or three regiments in which proper discipline had not been maintained and the men had been in the habit of visiting houses without invitation and helping themselves to food and drink or demanding them from the occupants They carried their muskets while out of camp and made every man they found take the oath of allegiance to the government I at once published orders prohibiting the soldiers from going into private houses unless invited by the inhabitants and from appropriating private property to their own or to government uses The people were no longer molested or made afraid I received the most marked courtesy from the citizens of Mexico as long as I remained there Up to this time my regiment had not been carried in the school of the soldier beyond the company drill except that it had received some training on the march from Springfield to the Illinois River There was now a good opportunity of exercising it in the battalion drill While I was at West Point the tactics used in the army had been Scott s and the musket the flint lock I had never looked at a copy of tactics from the time of my graduation My standing in that branch of studies had been near the foot of the class In the Mexican war in the summer of eighteen forty six I had been appointed regimental quartermaster and commissary and had not been at a battalion drill since The arms had been changed since then and Hardee s tactics had been adopted I got a copy of tactics and studied one lesson intending to confine the exercise of the first day to the commands I had thus learned By pursuing this course from day to day I thought I would soon get through the volume We were encamped just outside of town on the common among scattering suburban houses with enclosed gardens and when I got my regiment in line and rode to the front I soon saw that if I attempted to follow the lesson I had studied I would have to clear away some of the houses and garden fences to make room I perceived at once however that Hardee s tactics a mere translation from the French with Hardee s name attached was nothing more than common sense and the progress of the age applied to Scott s system The commands were abbreviated and the movement expedited Under the old tactics almost every change in the order of march was preceded by a halt then came the change and then the forward march With the new tactics all these changes could be made while in motion I found no trouble in giving commands that would take my regiment where I wanted it to go and carry it around all obstacles I do not believe that the officers of the regiment ever discovered that I had never studied the tactics that I used CHAPTER XIX COMMISSIONED BRIGADIER GENERAL COMMAND AT IRONTON MO JEFFERSON CITY CAPE GIRARDEAU GENERAL PRENTISS SEIZURE OF PADUCAH HEADQUARTERS AT CAIRO I had not been in Mexico many weeks when reading a saint Louis paper I found the President had asked the Illinois delegation in Congress to recommend some citizens of the State for the position of brigadier general and that they had unanimously recommended me as first on a list of seven I was very much surprised because as I have said my acquaintance with the Congressmen was very limited and I did not know of anything I had done to inspire such confidence The papers of the next day announced that my name with three others had been sent to the Senate and a few days after our confirmation was announced When appointed brigadier general I at once thought it proper that one of my aides should come from the regiment I had been commanding and so selected Lieutenant C B Lagow While living in saint Louis I had had a desk in the law office of McClellan Moody and Hillyer Difference in views between the members of the firm on the questions of the day and general hard times in the border cities had broken up this firm Hillyer was quite a young man then in his twenties and very brilliant I asked him to accept a place on my staff I also wanted to take one man from my new home Galena The canvass in the Presidential campaign the fall before had brought out a young lawyer by the name of John A Rawlins who proved himself one of the ablest speakers in the State He was also a candidate for elector on the Douglas ticket When Sumter was fired upon and the integrity of the Union threatened there was no man more ready to serve his country than he I wrote at once asking him to accept the position of assistant adjutant general with the rank of captain on my staff He was about entering the service as major of a new regiment then organizing in the north western part of the State but he threw this up and accepted my offer Neither Hillyer nor Lagow proved to have any particular taste or special qualifications for the duties of the soldier and the former resigned during the Vicksburg campaign the latter I relieved after the battle of Chattanooga Rawlins remained with me as long as he lived and rose to the rank of brigadier general and chief of staff to the General of the Army an office created for him before the war closed He was an able man possessed of great firmness and could say no so emphatically to a request which he thought should not be granted that the person he was addressing would understand at once that there was no use of pressing the matter General Rawlins was a very useful officer in other ways than this I became very much attached to him Shortly after my promotion I was ordered to Ironton Missouri to command a district in that part of the State and took the twenty first Illinois my old regiment with me Several other regiments were ordered to the same destination about the same time Ironton is on the Iron Mountain railroad about seventy miles south of saint Louis and situated among hills rising almost to the dignity of mountains When I reached there about the eighth of August Colonel B Gratz Brown afterwards Governor of Missouri and in eighteen seventy two Vice Presidential candidate was in command Some of his troops were ninety days men and their time had expired some time before The men had no clothing but what they had volunteered in and much of this was so worn that it would hardly stay on General Hardee the author of the tactics I did not study was at Greenville some twenty five miles further south it was said with five thousand Confederate troops Under these circumstances Colonel Brown s command was very much demoralized A squadron of cavalry could have ridden into the valley and captured the entire force Brown himself was gladder to see me on that occasion than he ever has been since I relieved him and sent all his men home within a day or two to be mustered out of service Within ten days after reading Ironton I was prepared to take the offensive against the enemy at Greenville I sent a column east out of the valley we were in with orders to swing around to the south and west and come into the Greenville road ten miles south of Ironton Another column marched on the direct road and went into camp at the point designated for the two columns to meet I was to ride out the next morning and take personal command of the movement My experience against Harris in northern Missouri had inspired me with confidence But when the evening train came in it brought General B M Prentiss with orders to take command of the district His orders did not relieve me but I knew that by law I was senior and at that time even the President did not have the authority to assign a junior to command a senior of the same grade I therefore gave General Prentiss the situation of the troops and the general condition of affairs and started for saint Louis the same day The movement against the rebels at Greenville went no further From saint Louis I was ordered to Jefferson City the capital of the State to take command General Sterling Price of the Confederate army was thought to be threatening the capital Lexington Chillicothe and other comparatively large towns in the central part of Missouri I found a good many troops in Jefferson City but in the greatest confusion and no one person knew where they all were Colonel Mulligan a gallant man was in command but he had not been educated as yet to his new profession and did not know how to maintain discipline I found that volunteers had obtained permission from the department commander or claimed they had to raise some of them regiments some battalions some companies the officers to be commissioned according to the number of men they brought into the service There were recruiting stations all over town with notices rudely lettered on boards over the doors announcing the arm of service and length of time for which recruits at that station would be received The law required all volunteers to serve for three years or the war But in Jefferson City in August eighteen sixty one they were recruited for different periods and on different conditions some were enlisted for six months some for a year some without any condition as to where they were to serve others were not to be sent out of the State The recruits were principally men from regiments stationed there and already in the service bound for three years if the war lasted that long The city was filled with Union fugitives who had been driven by guerilla bands to take refuge with the National troops They were in a deplorable condition and must have starved but for the support the government gave them They had generally made their escape with a team or two sometimes a yoke of oxen with a mule or a horse in the lead A little bedding besides their clothing and some food had been thrown into the wagon All else of their worldly goods were abandoned and appropriated by their former neighbors for the Union man in Missouri who staid at home during the rebellion if he was not immediately under the protection of the National troops was at perpetual war with his neighbors I stopped the recruiting service and disposed the troops about the outskirts of the city so as to guard all approaches Order was soon restored I had been at Jefferson City but a few days when I was directed from department headquarters to fit out an expedition to Lexington Booneville and Chillicothe in order to take from the banks in those cities all the funds they had and send them to saint Louis The western army had not yet been supplied with transportation It became necessary therefore to press into the service teams belonging to sympathizers with the rebellion or to hire those of Union men This afforded an opportunity of giving employment to such of the refugees within our lines as had teams suitable for our purposes They accepted the service with alacrity As fast as troops could be got off they were moved west some twenty miles or more In seven or eight days from my assuming command at Jefferson City I had all the troops except a small garrison at an advanced position and expected to join them myself the next day But my campaigns had not yet begun for while seated at my office door with nothing further to do until it was time to start for the front I saw an officer of rank approaching who proved to be Colonel Jefferson C Davis I had never met him before but he introduced himself by handing me an order for him to proceed to Jefferson City and relieve me of the command The orders directed that I should report at department headquarters at saint Louis without delay to receive important special instructions It was about an hour before the only regular train of the day would start I therefore turned over to Colonel Davis my orders and hurriedly stated to him the progress that had been made to carry out the department instructions already described I had at that time but one staff officer doing myself all the detail work usually performed by an adjutant general In an hour after being relieved from the command I was on my way to saint Louis leaving my single staff officer six to follow the next day with our horses and baggage The important special instructions which I received the next day assigned me to the command of the district of south east Missouri embracing all the territory south of saint Louis in Missouri as well as all southern Illinois At first I was to take personal command of a combined expedition that had been ordered for the capture of Colonel Jeff Thompson a sort of independent or partisan commander who was disputing with us the possession of south east Missouri Troops had been ordered to move from Ironton to Cape Girardeau sixty or seventy miles to the south east on the Mississippi River while the forces at Cape Girardeau had been ordered to move to Jacksonville ten miles out towards Ironton and troops at Cairo and Bird s Point at the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers were to hold themselves in readiness to go down the Mississippi to Belmont eighteen miles below to be moved west from there when an officer should come to command them I was the officer who had been selected for this purpose Cairo was to become my headquarters when the expedition terminated In pursuance of my orders I established my temporary headquarters at Cape Girardeau and sent instructions to the commanding officer at Jackson to inform me of the approach of General Prentiss from Ironton Hired wagons were kept moving night and day to take additional rations to Jackson to supply the troops when they started from there Neither General Prentiss nor Colonel Marsh who commanded at Jackson knew their destination I drew up all the instructions for the contemplated move and kept them in my pocket until I should hear of the junction of our troops at Jackson Two or three days after my arrival at Cape Girardeau word came that General Prentiss was approaching that place Jackson I started at once to meet him there and to give him his orders As I turned the first corner of a street after starting I saw a column of cavalry passing the next street in front of me I turned and rode around the block the other way so as to meet the head of the column I found there General Prentiss himself with a large escort He had halted his troops at Jackson for the night and had come on himself to Cape Girardeau leaving orders for his command to follow him in the morning I gave the General his orders which stopped him at Jackson but he was very much aggrieved at being placed under another brigadier general particularly as he believed himself to be the senior He had been a brigadier in command at Cairo while I was mustering officer at Springfield without any rank But we were nominated at the same time for the United States service and both our commissions bore date May seventeenth eighteen sixty one By virtue of my former army rank I was by law the senior General Prentiss failed to get orders to his troops to remain at Jackson and the next morning early they were reported as approaching Cape Girardeau I then ordered the General very peremptorily to countermarch his command and take it back to Jackson He obeyed the order but bade his command adieu when he got them to Jackson and went to saint Louis and reported himself This broke up the expedition But little harm was done as Jeff Thompson moved light and had no fixed place for even nominal headquarters He was as much at home in Arkansas as he was in Missouri and would keep out of the way of a superior force Prentiss was sent to another part of the State General Prentiss made a great mistake on the above occasion one that he would not have committed later in the war When I came to know him better I regretted it much In consequence of this occurrence he was off duty in the field when the principal campaign at the West was going on and his juniors received promotion while he was where none could be obtained He would have been next to myself in rank in the district of south east Missouri by virtue of his services in the Mexican war He was a brave and very earnest soldier No man in the service was more sincere in his devotion to the cause for which we were battling none more ready to make sacrifices or risk life in it On the fourth of September I removed my headquarters to Cairo and found Colonel Richard Oglesby in command of the post We had never met at least not to my knowledge After my promotion I had ordered my brigadier general s uniform from New York but it had not yet arrived so that I was in citizen s dress The Colonel had his office full of people mostly from the neighboring States of Missouri and Kentucky making complaints or asking favors He evidently did not catch my name when I was presented for on my taking a piece of paper from the table where he was seated and writing the order assuming command of the district of south east Missouri Colonel Richard J Oglesby to command the post at Bird s Point and handing it to him he put on an expression of surprise that looked a little as if he would like to have some one identify me But he surrendered the office without question The day after I assumed command at Cairo a man came to me who said he was a scout of General Fremont He reported that he had just come from Columbus a point on the Mississippi twenty miles below on the Kentucky side and that troops had started from there or were about to start to seize Paducah at the mouth of the Tennessee There was no time for delay I reported by telegraph to the department commander the information I had received and added that I was taking steps to get off that night to be in advance of the enemy in securing that important point There was a large number of steamers lying at Cairo and a good many boatmen were staying in the town It was the work of only a few hours to get the boats manned with coal aboard and steam up Troops were also designated to go aboard The distance from Cairo to Paducah is about forty five miles I did not wish to get there before daylight of the sixth and directed therefore that the boats should lie at anchor out in the stream until the time to start Not having received an answer to my first dispatch I again telegraphed to department headquarters that I should start for Paducah that night unless I received further orders Hearing nothing we started before midnight and arrived early the following morning anticipating the enemy by probably not over six or eight hours It proved very fortunate that the expedition against Jeff Thompson had been broken up Had it not been the enemy would have seized Paducah and fortified it to our very great annoyance When the National troops entered the town the citizens were taken by surprise I never after saw such consternation depicted on the faces of the people Men women and children came out of their doors looking pale and frightened at the presence of the invader They were expecting rebel troops that day In fact nearly four thousand men from Columbus were at that time within ten or fifteen miles of Paducah on their way to occupy the place I had but two regiments and one battery with me but the enemy did not know this and returned to Columbus I stationed my troops at the best points to guard the roads leading into the city left gunboats to guard the river fronts and by noon was ready to start on my return to Cairo Before leaving however I addressed a short printed proclamation to the citizens of Paducah assuring them of our peaceful intentions that we had come among them to protect them against the enemies of our country and that all who chose could continue their usual avocations with assurance of the protection of the government This was evidently a relief to them but the majority would have much preferred the presence of the other army I reinforced Paducah rapidly from the troops at Cape Girardeau and a day or two later General C F Smith a most accomplished soldier reported at Cairo and was assigned to the command of the post at the mouth of the Tennessee In a short time it was well fortified and a detachment was sent to occupy Smithland at the mouth of the Cumberland The State government of Kentucky at that time was rebel in sentiment but wanted to preserve an armed neutrality between the North and the South and the governor really seemed to think the State had a perfect right to maintain a neutral position The rebels already occupied two towns in the State Columbus and Hickman on the Mississippi and at the very moment the National troops were entering Paducah from the Ohio front General Lloyd Tilghman a Confederate with his staff and a small detachment of men were getting out in the other direction while as I have already said nearly four thousand Confederate troops were on Kentucky soil on their way to take possession of the town But in the estimation of the governor and of those who thought with him this did not justify the National authorities in invading the soil of Kentucky I informed the legislature of the State of what I was doing and my action was approved by the majority of that body On my return to Cairo I found authority from department headquarters for me to take Paducah if I felt strong enough but very soon after I was reprimanded from the same quarters for my correspondence with the legislature and warned against a repetition of the offence Soon after I took command at Cairo General Fremont entered into arrangements for the exchange of the prisoners captured at Camp Jackson in the month of May I received orders to pass them through my lines to Columbus as they presented themselves with proper credentials Quite a number of these prisoners I had been personally acquainted with before the war Such of them as I had so known were received at my headquarters as old acquaintances and ordinary routine business was not disturbed by their presence On one occasion when several were present in my office my intention to visit Cape Girardeau the next day to inspect the troops at that point was mentioned Something transpired which postponed my trip but a steamer employed by the government was passing a point some twenty or more miles above Cairo the next day when a section of rebel artillery with proper escort brought her to A major one of those who had been at my headquarters the day before came at once aboard and after some search made a direct demand for my delivery It was hard to persuade him that I was not there This officer was Major Barrett of saint Louis I had been acquainted with his family before the war CHAPTER XX GENERAL FREMONT IN COMMAND MOVEMENT AGAINST BELMONT BATTLE OF BELMONT A NARROW ESCAPE AFTER THE BATTLE From the occupation of Paducah up to the early part of November nothing important occurred with the troops under my command I was reinforced from time to time and the men were drilled and disciplined preparatory for the service which was sure to come By the first of November I had not fewer than twenty thousand men most of them under good drill and ready to meet any equal body of men who like themselves had not yet been in an engagement They were growing impatient at lying idle so long almost in hearing of the guns of the enemy they had volunteered to fight against I asked on one or two occasions to be allowed to move against Columbus It could have been taken soon after the occupation of Paducah but before November it was so strongly fortified that it would have required a large force and a long siege to capture it In the latter part of October General Fremont took the field in person and moved from Jefferson City against General Sterling Price who was then in the State of Missouri with a considerable command About the first of November I was directed from department headquarters to make a demonstration on both sides of the Mississippi River with the view of detaining the rebels at Columbus within their lines Before my troops could be got off I was notified from the same quarter that there were some three thousand of the enemy on the saint Francis River about fifty miles west or south west from Cairo and was ordered to send another force against them I dispatched Colonel Oglesby at once with troops sufficient to compete with the reported number of the enemy On the fifth word came from the same source that the rebels were about to detach a large force from Columbus to be moved by boats down the Mississippi and up the White River in Arkansas in order to reinforce Price and I was directed to prevent this movement if possible I accordingly sent a regiment from Bird s Point under Colonel W H L Wallace to overtake and reinforce Oglesby with orders to march to New Madrid a point some distance below Columbus on the Missouri side At the same time I directed General C F Smith to move all the troops he could spare from Paducah directly against Columbus halting them however a few miles from the town to await further orders from me Then I gathered up all the troops at Cairo and Fort Holt except suitable guards and moved them down the river on steamers convoyed by two gunboats accompanying them myself My force consisted of a little over three thousand men and embraced five regiments of infantry two guns and two companies of cavalry We dropped down the river on the sixth to within about six miles of Columbus debarked a few men on the Kentucky side and established pickets to connect with the troops from Paducah I had no orders which contemplated an attack by the National troops nor did I intend anything of the kind when I started out from Cairo but after we started I saw that the officers and men were elated at the prospect of at last having the opportunity of doing what they had volunteered to do fight the enemies of their country I did not see how I could maintain discipline or retain the confidence of my command if we should return to Cairo without an effort to do something Columbus besides being strongly fortified contained a garrison much more numerous than the force I had with me It would not do therefore to attack that point About two o clock on the morning of the seventh I learned that the enemy was crossing troops from Columbus to the west bank to be dispatched presumably after Oglesby I knew there was a small camp of Confederates at Belmont immediately opposite Columbus and I speedily resolved to push down the river land on the Missouri side capture Belmont break up the camp and return Accordingly the pickets above Columbus were drawn in at once and about daylight the boats moved out from shore In an hour we were debarking on the west bank of the Mississippi just out of range of the batteries at Columbus The ground on the west shore of the river opposite Columbus is low and in places marshy and cut up with sloughs The soil is rich and the timber large and heavy There were some small clearings between Belmont and the point where we landed but most of the country was covered with the native forests We landed in front of a cornfield When the debarkation commenced I took a regiment down the river to post it as a guard against surprise At that time I had no staff officer who could be trusted with that duty In the woods at a short distance below the clearing I found a depression dry at the time but which at high water became a slough or bayou I placed the men in the hollow gave them their instructions and ordered them to remain there until they were properly relieved These troops with the gunboats were to protect our transports Up to this time the enemy had evidently failed to divine our intentions From Columbus they could of course see our gunboats and transports loaded with troops But the force from Paducah was threatening them from the land side and it was hardly to be expected that if Columbus was our object we would separate our troops by a wide river They doubtless thought we meant to draw a large force from the east bank then embark ourselves land on the east bank and make a sudden assault on Columbus before their divided command could be united About eight o clock we started from the point of debarkation marching by the flank After moving in this way for a mile or a mile and a half I halted where there was marshy ground covered with a heavy growth of timber in our front and deployed a large part of my force as skirmishers By this time the enemy discovered that we were moving upon Belmont and sent out troops to meet us Soon after we had started in line his skirmishers were encountered and fighting commenced This continued growing fiercer and fiercer for about four hours the enemy being forced back gradually until he was driven into his camp Early in this engagement my horse was shot under me but I got another from one of my staff and kept well up with the advance until the river was reached The officers and men engaged at Belmont were then under fire for the first time Veterans could not have behaved better than they did up to the moment of reaching the rebel camp At this point they became demoralized from their victory and failed to reap its full reward The enemy had been followed so closely that when he reached the clear ground on which his camp was pitched he beat a hasty retreat over the river bank which protected him from our shots and from view This precipitate retreat at the last moment enabled the National forces to pick their way without hinderance through the abatis the only artificial defence the enemy had The moment the camp was reached our men laid down their arms and commenced rummaging the tents to pick up trophies Some of the higher officers were little better than the privates They galloped about from one cluster of men to another and at every halt delivered a short eulogy upon the Union cause and the achievements of the command All this time the troops we had been engaged with for four hours lay crouched under cover of the river bank ready to come up and surrender if summoned to do so but finding that they were not pursued they worked their way up the river and came up on the bank between us and our transports I saw at the same time two steamers coming from the Columbus side towards the west shore above us black or gray with soldiers from boiler deck to roof Some of my men were engaged in firing from captured guns at empty steamers down the river out of range cheering at every shot I tried to get them to turn their guns upon the loaded steamers above and not so far away My efforts were in vain At last I directed my staff officers to set fire to the camps This drew the fire of the enemy s guns located on the heights of Columbus They had abstained from firing before probably because they were afraid of hitting their own men or they may have supposed until the camp was on fire that it was still in the possession of their friends About this time too the men we had driven over the bank were seen in line up the river between us and our transports The alarm surrounded was given The guns of the enemy and the report of being surrounded brought officers and men completely under control At first some of the officers seemed to think that to be surrounded was to be placed in a hopeless position where there was nothing to do but surrender But when I announced that we had cut our way in and could cut our way out just as well it seemed a new revelation to officers and soldiers They formed line rapidly and we started back to our boats with the men deployed as skirmishers as they had been on entering camp The enemy was soon encountered but his resistance this time was feeble Again the Confederates sought shelter under the river banks We could not stop however to pick them up because the troops we had seen crossing the river had debarked by this time and were nearer our transports than we were It would be prudent to get them behind us but we were not again molested on our way to the boats From the beginning of the fighting our wounded had been carried to the houses at the rear near the place of debarkation I now set the troops to bringing their wounded to the boats After this had gone on for some little time I rode down the road without even a staff officer to visit the guard I had stationed over the approach to our transports I knew the enemy had crossed over from Columbus in considerable numbers and might be expected to attack us as we were embarking This guard would be encountered first and as they were in a natural intrenchment would be able to hold the enemy for a considerable time My surprise was great to find there was not a single man in the trench Riding back to the boat I found the officer who had commanded the guard and learned that he had withdrawn his force when the main body fell back At first I ordered the guard to return but finding that it would take some time to get the men together and march them back to their position I countermanded the order Then fearing that the enemy we had seen crossing the river below might be coming upon us unawares I rode out in the field to our front still entirely alone to observe whether the enemy was passing The field was grown up with corn so tall and thick as to cut off the view of even a person on horseback except directly along the rows Even in that direction owing to the overhanging blades of corn the view was not extensive I had not gone more than a few hundred yards when I saw a body of troops marching past me not fifty yards away I looked at them for a moment and then turned my horse towards the river and started back first in a walk and when I thought myself concealed from the view of the enemy as fast as my horse could carry me When at the river bank I still had to ride a few hundred yards to the point where the nearest transport lay The cornfield in front of our transports terminated at the edge of a dense forest Before I got back the enemy had entered this forest and had opened a brisk fire upon the boats Our men with the exception of details that had gone to the front after the wounded were now either aboard the transports or very near them Those who were not aboard soon got there and the boats pushed off I was the only man of the National army between the rebels and our transports The captain of a boat that had just pushed out but had not started recognized me and ordered the engineer not to start the engine he then had a plank run out for me My horse seemed to take in the situation There was no path down the bank and every one acquainted with the Mississippi River knows that its banks in a natural state do not vary at any great angle from the perpendicular My horse put his fore feet over the bank without hesitation or urging and with his hind feet well under him slid down the bank and trotted aboard the boat twelve or fifteen feet away over a single gang plank I dismounted and went at once to the upper deck The Mississippi River was low on the seventh of November eighteen sixty one so that the banks were higher than the heads of men standing on the upper decks of the steamers The rebels were some distance back from the river so that their fire was high and did us but little harm Our smoke stack was riddled with bullets but there were only three men wounded on the boats two of whom were soldiers When I first went on deck I entered the captain s room adjoining the pilot house and threw myself on a sofa I did not keep that position a moment but rose to go out on the deck to observe what was going on I had scarcely left when a musket ball entered the room struck the head of the sofa passed through it and lodged in the foot When the enemy opened fire on the transports our gunboats returned it with vigor They were well out in the stream and some distance down so that they had to give but very little elevation to their guns to clear the banks of the river Their position very nearly enfiladed the line of the enemy while he was marching through the cornfield The execution was very great as we could see at the time and as I afterwards learned more positively We were very soon out of range and went peacefully on our way to Cairo every man feeling that Belmont was a great victory and that he had contributed his share to it Our loss at Belmont was four hundred eighty five in killed wounded and missing About one hundred twenty five of our wounded fell into the hands of the enemy We returned with one hundred seventy five prisoners and two guns and spiked four other pieces The loss of the enemy as officially reported was six hundred forty two men killed wounded and missing We had engaged about twenty five hundred men exclusive of the guard left with the transports The enemy had about seven thousand but this includes the troops brought over from Columbus who were not engaged in the first defence of Belmont The two objects for which the battle of Belmont was fought were fully accomplished The enemy gave up all idea of detaching troops from Columbus His losses were very heavy for that period of the war Columbus was beset by people looking for their wounded or dead kin to take them home for medical treatment or burial I learned later when I had moved further south that Belmont had caused more mourning than almost any other battle up to that time The National troops acquired a confidence in themselves at Belmont that did not desert them through the war The day after the battle I met some officers from General Polk s command arranged for permission to bury our dead at Belmont and also commenced negotiations for the exchange of prisoners When our men went to bury their dead before they were allowed to land they were conducted below the point where the enemy had engaged our transports Some of the officers expressed a desire to see the field but the request was refused with the statement that we had no dead there While on the truce boat I mentioned to an officer whom I had known both at West Point and in the Mexican war that I was in the cornfield near their troops when they passed that I had been on horseback and had worn a soldier s overcoat at the time This officer was on General Polk s staff He said both he and the general had seen me and that Polk had said to his men There is a Yankee you may try your marksmanship on him if you wish but nobody fired at me Belmont was severely criticised in the North as a wholly unnecessary battle barren of results or the possibility of them from the beginning If it had not been fought Colonel Oglesby would probably have been captured or destroyed with his three thousand men Then I should have been culpable indeed CHAPTER XXI GENERAL HALLECK IN COMMAND COMMANDING THE DISTRICT OF CAIRO MOVEMENT ON FORT HENRY CAPTURE OF FORT HENRY While at Cairo I had frequent opportunities of meeting the rebel officers of the Columbus garrison They seemed to be very fond of coming up on steamers under flags of truce On two or three occasions I went down in like manner When one of their boats was seen coming up carrying a white flag a gun would be fired from the lower battery at Fort Holt throwing a shot across the bow as a signal to come no farther I would then take a steamer and with my staff and occasionally a few other officers go down to receive the party There were several officers among them whom I had known before both at West Point and in Mexico Seeing these officers who had been educated for the profession of arms both at school and in actual war which is a far more efficient training impressed me with the great advantage the South possessed over the North at the beginning of the rebellion They had from thirty to forty per cent of the educated soldiers of the Nation They had no standing army and consequently these trained soldiers had to find employment with the troops from their own States In this way what there was of military education and training was distributed throughout their whole army The whole loaf was leavened The North had a great number of educated and trained soldiers but the bulk of them were still in the army and were retained generally with their old commands and rank until the war had lasted many months In the Army of the Potomac there was what was known as the regular brigade in which from the commanding officer down to the youngest second lieutenant every one was educated to his profession So too with many of the batteries all the officers generally four in number to each were men educated for their profession Some of these went into battle at the beginning under division commanders who were entirely without military training This state of affairs gave me an idea which I expressed while at Cairo that the government ought to disband the regular army with the exception of the staff corps and notify the disbanded officers that they would receive no compensation while the war lasted except as volunteers The register should be kept up but the names of all officers who were not in the volunteer service at the close should be stricken from it On the ninth of November two days after the battle of Belmont Major General H W Halleck superseded General Fremont in command of the Department of the Missouri The limits of his command took in Arkansas and west Kentucky east to the Cumberland River From the battle of Belmont until early in February eighteen sixty two the troops under my command did little except prepare for the long struggle which proved to be before them The enemy at this time occupied a line running from the Mississippi River at Columbus to Bowling Green and Mill Springs Kentucky Each of these positions was strongly fortified as were also points on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers near the Tennessee state line The works on the Tennessee were called Fort Heiman and Fort Henry and that on the Cumberland was Fort Donelson At these points the two rivers approached within eleven miles of each other The lines of rifle pits at each place extended back from the water at least two miles so that the garrisons were in reality only seven miles apart These positions were of immense importance to the enemy and of course correspondingly important for us to possess ourselves of With Fort Henry in our hands we had a navigable stream open to us up to Muscle Shoals in Alabama The Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee at Eastport Mississippi and follows close to the banks of the river up to the shoals This road of vast importance to the enemy would cease to be of use to them for through traffic the moment Fort Henry became ours Fort Donelson was the gate to Nashville a place of great military and political importance and to a rich country extending far east in Kentucky These two points in our possession the enemy would necessarily be thrown back to the Memphis and Charleston road or to the boundary of the cotton states and as before stated that road would be lost to them for through communication The designation of my command had been changed after Halleck s arrival from the District of South east Missouri to the District of Cairo and the small district commanded by General C F Smith embracing the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers had been added to my jurisdiction Early in January eighteen sixty two I was directed by General McClellan through my department commander to make a reconnoissance in favor of Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell who commanded the Department of the Ohio with headquarters at Louisville and who was confronting General S B Buckner with a larger Confederate force at Bowling Green It was supposed that Buell was about to make some move against the enemy and my demonstration was intended to prevent the sending of troops from Columbus Fort Henry or Donelson to Buckner I at once ordered General Smith to send a force up the west bank of the Tennessee to threaten forts Heiman and Henry McClernand at the same time with a force of six thousand men was sent out into west Kentucky threatening Columbus with one column and the Tennessee River with another I went with McClernand s command The weather was very bad snow and rain fell the roads never good in that section were intolerable We were out more than a week splashing through the mud snow and rain the men suffering very much The object of the expedition was accomplished The enemy did not send reinforcements to Bowling Green and General George H Thomas fought and won the battle of Mill Springs before we returned As a result of this expedition General Smith reported that he thought it practicable to capture Fort Heiman This fort stood on high ground completely commanding Fort Henry on the opposite side of the river and its possession by us with the aid of our gunboats would insure the capture of Fort Henry This report of Smith s confirmed views I had previously held that the true line of operations for us was up the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers With us there the enemy would be compelled to fall back on the east and west entirely out of the State of Kentucky On the sixth of January before receiving orders for this expedition I had asked permission of the general commanding the department to go to see him at saint Louis My object was to lay this plan of campaign before him Now that my views had been confirmed by so able a general as Smith I renewed my request to go to saint Louis on what I deemed important military business The leave was granted but not graciously I had known General Halleck but very slightly in the old army not having met him either at West Point or during the Mexican war I was received with so little cordiality that I perhaps stated the object of my visit with less clearness than I might have done and I had not uttered many sentences before I was cut short as if my plan was preposterous I returned to Cairo very much crestfallen Flag officer Foote commanded the little fleet of gunboats then in the neighborhood of Cairo and though in another branch of the service was subject to the command of General Halleck He and I consulted freely upon military matters and he agreed with me perfectly as to the feasibility of the campaign up the Tennessee Notwithstanding the rebuff I had received from my immediate chief I therefore on the twenty eighth of January renewed the suggestion by telegraph that if permitted I could take and hold Fort Henry on the Tennessee This time I was backed by Flag officer Foote who sent a similar dispatch On the twenty ninth I wrote fully in support of the proposition On the first of February I received full instructions from department headquarters to move upon Fort Henry On the twod the expedition started In February eighteen sixty two there were quite a good many steamers laid up at Cairo for want of employment the Mississippi River being closed against navigation below that point There were also many men in the town whose occupation had been following the river in various capacities from captain down to deck hand But there were not enough of either boats or men to move at one time the seventeen thousand men I proposed to take with me up the Tennessee I loaded the boats with more than half the force however and sent General McClernand in command I followed with one of the later boats and found McClernand had stopped very properly nine miles below Fort Henry Seven gunboats under Flag officer Foote had accompanied the advance The transports we had with us had to return to Paducah to bring up a division from there with General C F Smith in command Before sending the boats back I wanted to get the troops as near to the enemy as I could without coming within range of their guns There was a stream emptying into the Tennessee on the east side apparently at about long range distance below the fort On account of the narrow water shed separating the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers at that point the stream must be insignificant at ordinary stages but when we were there in February it was a torrent It would facilitate the investment of Fort Henry materially if the troops could be landed south of that stream To test whether this could be done I boarded the gunboat Essex and requested Captain Wm Porter commanding it to approach the fort to draw its fire After we had gone some distance past the mouth of the stream we drew the fire of the fort which fell much short of us In consequence I had made up my mind to return and bring the troops to the upper side of the creek when the enemy opened upon us with a rifled gun that sent shot far beyond us and beyond the stream One shot passed very near where Captain Porter and I were standing struck the deck near the stern penetrated and passed through the cabin and so out into the river We immediately turned back and the troops were debarked below the mouth of the creek When the landing was completed I returned with the transports to Paducah to hasten up the balance of the troops I got back on the fifth with the advance the remainder following as rapidly as the steamers could carry them At ten o clock at night on the fifth the whole command was not yet up Being anxious to commence operations as soon as possible before the enemy could reinforce heavily I issued my orders for an advance at eleven A M on the sixth I felt sure that all the troops would be up by that time Fort Henry occupies a bend in the river which gave the guns in the water battery a direct fire down the stream The camp outside the fort was intrenched with rifle pits and outworks two miles back on the road to Donelson and Dover The garrison of the fort and camp was about twenty eight hundred with strong reinforcements from Donelson halted some miles out There were seventeen heavy guns in the fort The river was very high the banks being overflowed except where the bluffs come to the water s edge A portion of the ground on which Fort Henry stood was two feet deep in water Below the water extended into the woods several hundred yards back from the bank on the east side On the west bank Fort Heiman stood on high ground completely commanding Fort Henry The distance from Fort Henry to Donelson is but eleven miles The two positions were so important to the enemy AS HE SAW HIS INTEREST that it was natural to suppose that reinforcements would come from every quarter from which they could be got Prompt action on our part was imperative The plan was for the troops and gunboats to start at the same moment The troops were to invest the garrison and the gunboats to attack the fort at close quarters General Smith was to land a brigade of his division on the west bank during the night of the fifth and get it in rear of Heiman At the hour designated the troops and gunboats started General Smith found Fort Heiman had been evacuated before his men arrived The gunboats soon engaged the water batteries at very close quarters but the troops which were to invest Fort Henry were delayed for want of roads as well as by the dense forest and the high water in what would in dry weather have been unimportant beds of streams This delay made no difference in the result On our first appearance Tilghman had sent his entire command with the exception of about one hundred men left to man the guns in the fort to the outworks on the road to Dover and Donelson so as to have them out of range of the guns of our navy and before any attack on the sixth he had ordered them to retreat on Donelson He stated in his subsequent report that the defence was intended solely to give his troops time to make their escape Tilghman was captured with his staff and ninety men as well as the armament of the fort the ammunition and whatever stores were there Our cavalry pursued the retreating column towards Donelson and picked up two guns and a few stragglers but the enemy had so much the start that the pursuing force did not get in sight of any except the stragglers All the gunboats engaged were hit many times The damage however beyond what could be repaired by a small expenditure of money was slight except to the Essex A shell penetrated the boiler of that vessel and exploded it killing and wounding forty eight men nineteen of whom were soldiers who had been detailed to act with the navy On several occasions during the war such details were made when the complement of men with the navy was insufficient for the duty before them After the fall of Fort Henry Captain Phelps commanding the iron clad Carondelet at my request ascended the Tennessee River and thoroughly destroyed the bridge of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad CHAPTER XXII INVESTMENT OF FORT DONELSON THE NAVAL OPERATIONS ATTACK OF THE ENEMY ASSAULTING THE WORKS SURRENDER OF THE FORT I informed the department commander of our success at Fort Henry and that on the eighth I would take Fort Donelson But the rain continued to fall so heavily that the roads became impassable for artillery and wagon trains Then too it would not have been prudent to proceed without the gunboats At least it would have been leaving behind a valuable part of our available force On the seventh the day after the fall of Fort Henry I took my staff and the cavalry a part of one regiment and made a reconnoissance to within about a mile of the outer line of works at Donelson I had known General Pillow in Mexico and judged that with any force no matter how small I could march up to within gunshot of any intrenchments he was given to hold I said this to the officers of my staff at the time I knew that Floyd was in command but he was no soldier and I judged that he would yield to Pillow s pretensions I met as I expected no opposition in making the reconnoissance and besides learning the topography of the country on the way and around Fort Donelson found that there were two roads available for marching one leading to the village of Dover the other to Donelson Fort Donelson is two miles north or down the river from Dover The fort as it stood in eighteen sixty one embraced about one hundred acres of land On the east it fronted the Cumberland to the north it faced Hickman s creek a small stream which at that time was deep and wide because of the back water from the river on the south was another small stream or rather a ravine opening into the Cumberland This also was filled with back water from the river The fort stood on high ground some of it as much as a hundred feet above the Cumberland Strong protection to the heavy guns in the water batteries had been obtained by cutting away places for them in the bluff To the west there was a line of rifle pits some two miles back from the river at the farthest point This line ran generally along the crest of high ground but in one place crossed a ravine which opens into the river between the village and the fort The ground inside and outside of this intrenched line was very broken and generally wooded The trees outside of the rifle pits had been cut down for a considerable way out and had been felled so that their tops lay outwards from the intrenchments The limbs had been trimmed and pointed and thus formed an abatis in front of the greater part of the line Outside of this intrenched line and extending about half the entire length of it is a ravine running north and south and opening into Hickman creek at a point north of the fort The entire side of this ravine next to the works was one long abatis General Halleck commenced his efforts in all quarters to get reinforcements to forward to me immediately on my departure from Cairo General Hunter sent men freely from Kansas and a large division under General Nelson from Buell s army was also dispatched Orders went out from the War Department to consolidate fragments of companies that were being recruited in the Western States so as to make full companies and to consolidate companies into regiments General Halleck did not approve or disapprove of my going to Fort Donelson He said nothing whatever to me on the subject He informed Buell on the seventh that I would march against Fort Donelson the next day but on the tenth he directed me to fortify Fort Henry strongly particularly to the land side saying that he forwarded me intrenching tools for that purpose I received this dispatch in front of Fort Donelson I was very impatient to get to Fort Donelson because I knew the importance of the place to the enemy and supposed he would reinforce it rapidly I felt that fifteen thousand men on the eighth would be more effective than fifty thousand a month later I asked Flag officer Foote therefore to order his gunboats still about Cairo to proceed up the Cumberland River and not to wait for those gone to Eastport and Florence but the others got back in time and we started on the twelfth I had moved McClernand out a few miles the night before so as to leave the road as free as possible Just as we were about to start the first reinforcement reached me on transports It was a brigade composed of six full regiments commanded by Colonel Thayer of Nebraska As the gunboats were going around to Donelson by the Tennessee Ohio and Cumberland rivers I directed Thayer to turn about and go under their convoy I started from Fort Henry with fifteen thousand men including eight batteries and part of a regiment of cavalry and meeting with no obstruction to detain us the advance arrived in front of the enemy by noon That afternoon and the next day were spent in taking up ground to make the investment as complete as possible General Smith had been directed to leave a portion of his division behind to guard forts Henry and Heiman He left General Lew Wallace with twenty five hundred men With the remainder of his division he occupied our left extending to Hickman creek McClernand was on the right and covered the roads running south and south west from Dover His right extended to the back water up the ravine opening into the Cumberland south of the village The troops were not intrenched but the nature of the ground was such that they were just as well protected from the fire of the enemy as if rifle pits had been thrown up Our line was generally along the crest of ridges The artillery was protected by being sunk in the ground The men who were not serving the guns were perfectly covered from fire on taking position a little back from the crest The greatest suffering was from want of shelter It was midwinter and during the siege we had rain and snow thawing and freezing alternately It would not do to allow camp fires except far down the hill out of sight of the enemy and it would not do to allow many of the troops to remain there at the same time In the march over from Fort Henry numbers of the men had thrown away their blankets and overcoats There was therefore much discomfort and absolute suffering During the twelfth and thirteenth and until the arrival of Wallace and Thayer on the fourteenth the National forces composed of but fifteen thousand men without intrenchments confronted an intrenched army of twenty one thousand without conflict further than what was brought on by ourselves Only one gunboat had arrived There was a little skirmishing each day brought on by the movement of our troops in securing commanding positions but there was no actual fighting during this time except once on the thirteenth in front of McClernand s command That general had undertaken to capture a battery of the enemy which was annoying his men Without orders or authority he sent three regiments to make the assault The battery was in the main line of the enemy which was defended by his whole army present Of course the assault was a failure and of course the loss on our side was great for the number of men engaged In this assault Colonel William Morrison fell badly wounded Up to this time the surgeons with the army had no difficulty in finding room in the houses near our line for all the sick and wounded but now hospitals were overcrowded Owing however to the energy and skill of the surgeons the suffering was not so great as it might have been The hospital arrangements at Fort Donelson were as complete as it was possible to make them considering the inclemency of the weather and the lack of tents in a sparsely settled country where the houses were generally of but one or two rooms On the return of Captain Walke to Fort Henry on the tenth I had requested him to take the vessels that had accompanied him on his expedition up the Tennessee and get possession of the Cumberland as far up towards Donelson as possible He started without delay taking however only his own gunboat the Carondelet towed by the steamer Alps Captain Walke arrived a few miles below Donelson on the twelfth a little after noon About the time the advance of troops reached a point within gunshot of the fort on the land side he engaged the water batteries at long range On the thirteenth I informed him of my arrival the day before and of the establishment of most of our batteries requesting him at the same time to attack again that day so that I might take advantage of any diversion The attack was made and many shots fell within the fort creating some consternation as we now know The investment on the land side was made as complete as the number of troops engaged would admit of During the night of the thirteenth Flag officer Foote arrived with the iron clads saint Louis Louisville and Pittsburg and the wooden gunboats Tyler and Conestoga convoying Thayer s brigade On the morning of the fourteenth Thayer was landed Wallace whom I had ordered over from Fort Henry also arrived about the same time Up to this time he had been commanding a brigade belonging to the division of General C F Smith These troops were now restored to the division they belonged to and General Lew Wallace was assigned to the command of a division composed of the brigade of Colonel Thayer and other reinforcements that arrived the same day This new division was assigned to the centre giving the two flanking divisions an opportunity to close up and form a stronger line The plan was for the troops to hold the enemy within his lines while the gunboats should attack the water batteries at close quarters and silence his guns if possible Some of the gunboats were to run the batteries get above the fort and above the village of Dover I had ordered a reconnoissance made with the view of getting troops to the river above Dover in case they should be needed there That position attained by the gunboats it would have been but a question of time and a very short time too when the garrison would have been compelled to surrender By three in the afternoon of the fourteenth Flag officer Foote was ready and advanced upon the water batteries with his entire fleet After coming in range of the batteries of the enemy the advance was slow but a constant fire was delivered from every gun that could be brought to bear upon the fort I occupied a position on shore from which I could see the advancing navy The leading boat got within a very short distance of the water battery not further off I think than two hundred yards and I soon saw one and then another of them dropping down the river visibly disabled Then the whole fleet followed and the engagement closed for the day The gunboat which Flag officer Foote was on besides having been hit about sixty times several of the shots passing through near the waterline had a shot enter the pilot house which killed the pilot carried away the wheel and wounded the flag officer himself The tiller ropes of another vessel were carried away and she too dropped helplessly back Two others had their pilot houses so injured that they scarcely formed a protection to the men at the wheel The enemy had evidently been much demoralized by the assault but they were jubilant when they saw the disabled vessels dropping down the river entirely out of the control of the men on board Of course I only witnessed the falling back of our gunboats and felt sad enough at the time over the repulse Subsequent reports now published show that the enemy telegraphed a great victory to Richmond The sun went down on the night of the fourteenth of February eighteen sixty two leaving the army confronting Fort Donelson anything but comforted over the prospects The weather had turned intensely cold the men were without tents and could not keep up fires where most of them had to stay and as previously stated many had thrown away their overcoats and blankets Two of the strongest of our gunboats had been disabled presumably beyond the possibility of rendering any present assistance I retired this night not knowing but that I would have to intrench my position and bring up tents for the men or build huts under the cover of the hills On the morning of the fifteenth before it was yet broad day a messenger from Flag officer Foote handed me a note expressing a desire to see me on the flag ship and saying that he had been injured the day before so much that he could not come himself to me I at once made my preparations for starting I directed my adjutant general to notify each of the division commanders of my absence and instruct them to do nothing to bring on an engagement until they received further orders but to hold their positions From the heavy rains that had fallen for days and weeks preceding and from the constant use of the roads between the troops and the landing four to seven miles below these roads had become cut up so as to be hardly passable The intense cold of the night of the fourteenth fifteenth had frozen the ground solid This made travel on horseback even slower than through the mud but I went as fast as the roads would allow When I reached the fleet I found the flag ship was anchored out in the stream A small boat however awaited my arrival and I was soon on board with the flag officer He explained to me in short the condition in which he was left by the engagement of the evening before and suggested that I should intrench while he returned to Mound City with his disabled boats expressing at the time the belief that he could have the necessary repairs made and be back in ten days I saw the absolute necessity of his gunboats going into hospital and did not know but I should be forced to the alternative of going through a siege But the enemy relieved me from this necessity When I left the National line to visit Flag officer Foote I had no idea that there would be any engagement on land unless I brought it on myself The conditions for battle were much more favorable to us than they had been for the first two days of the investment From the twelfth to the fourteenth we had but fifteen thousand men of all arms and no gunboats Now we had been reinforced by a fleet of six naval vessels a large division of troops under General L Wallace and twenty five hundred men brought over from Fort Henry belonging to the division of C F Smith The enemy however had taken the initiative Just as I landed I met Captain Hillyer of my staff white with fear not for his personal safety but for the safety of the National troops He said the enemy had come out of his lines in full force and attacked and scattered McClernand s division which was in full retreat The roads as I have said were unfit for making fast time but I got to my command as soon as possible The attack had been made on the National right I was some four or five miles north of our left The line was about three miles long In reaching the point where the disaster had occurred I had to pass the divisions of Smith and Wallace I saw no sign of excitement on the portion of the line held by Smith Wallace was nearer the scene of conflict and had taken part in it He had at an opportune time sent Thayer s brigade to the support of McClernand and thereby contributed to hold the enemy within his lines I saw everything favorable for us along the line of our left and centre When I came to the right appearances were different The enemy had come out in full force to cut his way out and make his escape McClernand s division had to bear the brunt of the attack from this combined force His men had stood up gallantly until the ammunition in their cartridge boxes gave out There was abundance of ammunition near by lying on the ground in boxes but at that stage of the war it was not all of our commanders of regiments brigades or even divisions who had been educated up to the point of seeing that their men were constantly supplied with ammunition during an engagement When the men found themselves without ammunition they could not stand up against troops who seemed to have plenty of it The division broke and a portion fled but most of the men as they were not pursued only fell back out of range of the fire of the enemy It must have been about this time that Thayer pushed his brigade in between the enemy and those of our troops that were without ammunition At all events the enemy fell back within his intrenchments and was there when I got on the field I saw the men standing in knots talking in the most excited manner No officer seemed to be giving any directions The soldiers had their muskets but no ammunition while there were tons of it close at hand I heard some of the men say that the enemy had come out with knapsacks and haversacks filled with rations They seemed to think this indicated a determination on his part to stay out and fight just as long as the provisions held out I turned to Colonel J D Webster of my staff who was with me and said Some of our men are pretty badly demoralized but the enemy must be more so for he has attempted to force his way out but has fallen back the one who attacks first now will be victorious and the enemy will have to be in a hurry if he gets ahead of me I determined to make the assault at once on our left It was clear to my mind that the enemy had started to march out with his entire force except a few pickets and if our attack could be made on the left before the enemy could redistribute his forces along the line we would find but little opposition except from the intervening abatis I directed Colonel Webster to ride with me and call out to the men as we passed Fill your cartridge boxes quick and get into line the enemy is trying to escape and he must not be permitted to do so This acted like a charm The men only wanted some one to give them a command We rode rapidly to Smith s quarters when I explained the situation to him and directed him to charge the enemy s works in his front with his whole division saying at the same time that he would find nothing but a very thin line to contend with The general was off in an incredibly short time going in advance himself to keep his men from firing while they were working their way through the abatis intervening between them and the enemy The outer line of rifle pits was passed and the night of the fifteenth General Smith with much of his division bivouacked within the lines of the enemy There was now no doubt but that the Confederates must surrender or be captured the next day There seems from subsequent accounts to have been much consternation particularly among the officers of high rank in Dover during the night of the fifteenth General Floyd the commanding officer who was a man of talent enough for any civil position was no soldier and possibly did not possess the elements of one He was further unfitted for command for the reason that his conscience must have troubled him and made him afraid As Secretary of War he had taken a solemn oath to maintain the Constitution of the United States and to uphold the same against all its enemies He had betrayed that trust As Secretary of War he was reported through the northern press to have scattered the little army the country had so that the most of it could be picked up in detail when secession occurred About a year before leaving the Cabinet he had removed arms from northern to southern arsenals He continued in the Cabinet of President Buchanan until about the first of January eighteen sixty one while he was working vigilantly for the establishment of a confederacy made out of United States territory Well may he have been afraid to fall into the hands of National troops He would no doubt have been tried for misappropriating public property if not for treason had he been captured General Pillow next in command was conceited and prided himself much on his services in the Mexican war He telegraphed to General Johnston at Nashville after our men were within the rebel rifle pits and almost on the eve of his making his escape that the Southern troops had had great success all day Johnston forwarded the dispatch to Richmond While the authorities at the capital were reading it Floyd and Pillow were fugitives A council of war was held by the enemy at which all agreed that it would be impossible to hold out longer General Buckner who was third in rank in the garrison but much the most capable soldier seems to have regarded it a duty to hold the fort until the general commanding the department A S Johnston should get back to his headquarters at Nashville Buckner s report shows however that he considered Donelson lost and that any attempt to hold the place longer would be at the sacrifice of the command Being assured that Johnston was already in Nashville Buckner too agreed that surrender was the proper thing Floyd turned over the command to Pillow who declined it It then devolved upon Buckner who accepted the responsibility of the position Floyd and Pillow took possession of all the river transports at Dover and before morning both were on their way to Nashville with the brigade formerly commanded by Floyd and some other troops in all about three thousand Some marched up the east bank of the Cumberland others went on the steamers During the night Forrest also with his cavalry and some other troops about a thousand in all made their way out passing between our right and the river They had to ford or swim over the back water in the little creek just south of Dover Before daylight General Smith brought to me the following letter from General Buckner HEADQUARTERS FORT DONELSON February sixteen eighteen sixty two SIR In consideration of all the circumstances governing the present situation of affairs at this station I propose to the Commanding Officer of the Federal forces the appointment of Commissioners to agree upon terms of capitulation of the forces and fort under my command and in that view suggest an armistice until twelve o clock to day I am sir very respectfully Your ob t se v t S B BUCKNER Brig general C S A To Brigadier General U S Grant Com ding U S Forces Near Fort Donelson To this I responded as follows HEADQUARTERS ARMY IN THE FIELD Camp near Donelson February sixteen eighteen sixty two General S B BUCKNER Confederate Army SIR Yours of this date proposing armistice and appointment of Commissioners to settle terms of capitulation is just received No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted I propose to move immediately upon your works I am sir very respectfully Your ob t se v t U S GRANT Brig general To this I received the following reply HEADQUARTERS DOVER TENNESSEE February sixteen eighteen sixty two To Brig general l U S GRANT U S Army SIR The distribution of the forces under my command incident to an unexpected change of commanders and the overwhelming force under your command compel me notwithstanding the brilliant success of the Confederate arms yesterday to accept the ungenerous and unchivalrous terms which you propose I am sir Your very ob t se v t S B BUCKNER Brig general C S A General Buckner as soon as he had dispatched the first of the above letters sent word to his different commanders on the line of rifle pits notifying them that he had made a proposition looking to the surrender of the garrison and directing them to notify National troops in their front so that all fighting might be prevented White flags were stuck at intervals along the line of rifle pits but none over the fort As soon as the last letter from Buckner was received I mounted my horse and rode to Dover General Wallace I found had preceded me an hour or more I presume that seeing white flags exposed in his front he rode up to see what they meant and not being fired upon or halted he kept on until he found himself at the headquarters of General Buckner I had been at West Point three years with Buckner and afterwards served with him in the army so that we were quite well acquainted In the course of our conversation which was very friendly he said to me that if he had been in command I would not have got up to Donelson as easily as I did I told him that if he had been in command I should not have tried in the way I did I had invested their lines with a smaller force than they had to defend them and at the same time had sent a brigade full five thousand strong around by water I had relied very much upon their commander to allow me to come safely up to the outside of their works I asked General Buckner about what force he had to surrender He replied that he could not tell with any degree of accuracy that all the sick and weak had been sent to Nashville while we were about Fort Henry that Floyd and Pillow had left during the night taking many men with them and that Forrest and probably others had also escaped during the preceding night the number of casualties he could not tell but he said I would not find fewer than twelve thousand nor more than fifteen thousand He asked permission to send parties outside of the lines to bury his dead who had fallen on the fifteenth when they tried to get out I gave directions that his permit to pass our limits should be recognized I have no reason to believe that this privilege was abused but it familiarized our guards so much with the sight of Confederates passing to and fro that I have no doubt many got beyond our pickets unobserved and went on The most of the men who went in that way no doubt thought they had had war enough and left with the intention of remaining out of the army Some came to me and asked permission to go saying that they were tired of the war and would not be caught in the ranks again and I bade them go The actual number of Confederates at Fort Donelson can never be given with entire accuracy The largest number admitted by any writer on the Southern side is by Colonel Preston Johnston He gives the number at seventeen thousand But this must be an underestimate The commissary general of prisoners reported having issued rations to fourteen thousand six hundred twenty three Fort Donelson prisoners at Cairo as they passed that point General Pillow reported the killed and wounded at two thousand but he had less opportunity of knowing the actual numbers than the officers of McClernand s division for most of the killed and wounded fell outside their works in front of that division and were buried or cared for by Buckner after the surrender and when Pillow was a fugitive It is known that Floyd and Pillow escaped during the night of the fifteenth taking with them not less than three thousand men Forrest escaped with about one thousand and others were leaving singly and in squads all night It is probable that the Confederate force at Donelson on the fifteenth of February eighteen sixty two was twenty one thousand in round numbers On the day Fort Donelson fell I had twenty seven thousand men to confront the Confederate lines and guard the road four or five miles to the left over which all our supplies had to be drawn on wagons During the sixteenth after the surrender additional reinforcements arrived During the siege General Sherman had been sent to Smithland at the mouth of the Cumberland River to forward reinforcements and supplies to me At that time he was my senior in rank and there was no authority of law to assign a junior to command a senior of the same grade But every boat that came up with supplies or reinforcements brought a note of encouragement from Sherman asking me to call upon him for any assistance he could render and saying that if he could be of service at the front I might send for him and he would waive rank CHAPTER XXIII PROMOTED MAJOR GENERAL OF VOLUNTEERS UNOCCUPIED TERRITORY ADVANCE UPON NASHVILLE SITUATION OF THE TROOPS CONFEDERATE RETREAT RELIEVED OF THE COMMAND RESTORED TO THE COMMAND GENERAL SMITH The news of the fall of Fort Donelson caused great delight all over the North At the South particularly in Richmond the effect was correspondingly depressing I was promptly promoted to the grade of Major General of Volunteers and confirmed by the Senate All three of my division commanders were promoted to the same grade and the colonels who commanded brigades were made brigadier generals in the volunteer service My chief who was in saint Louis telegraphed his congratulations to General Hunter in Kansas for the services he had rendered in securing the fall of Fort Donelson by sending reinforcements so rapidly To Washington he telegraphed that the victory was due to General C F Smith promote him he said and the whole country will applaud On the nineteenth there was published at saint Louis a formal order thanking Flag officer Foote and myself and the forces under our command for the victories on the Tennessee and the Cumberland I received no other recognition whatever from General Halleck But General Cullum his chief of staff who was at Cairo wrote me a warm congratulatory letter on his own behalf I approved of General Smith s promotion highly as I did all the promotions that were made My opinion was and still is that immediately after the fall of Fort Donelson the way was opened to the National forces all over the South west without much resistance If one general who would have taken the responsibility had been in command of all the troops west of the Alleghanies he could have marched to Chattanooga Corinth Memphis and Vicksburg with the troops we then had and as volunteering was going on rapidly over the North there would soon have been force enough at all these centres to operate offensively against any body of the enemy that might be found near them Rapid movements and the acquisition of rebellious territory would have promoted volunteering so that reinforcements could have been had as fast as transportation could have been obtained to carry them to their destination On the other hand there were tens of thousands of strong able bodied young men still at their homes in the South western States who had not gone into the Confederate army in February eighteen sixty two and who had no particular desire to go If our lines had been extended to protect their homes many of them never would have gone Providence ruled differently Time was given the enemy to collect armies and fortify his new positions and twice afterwards he came near forcing his north western front up to the Ohio River I promptly informed the department commander of our success at Fort Donelson and that the way was open now to Clarksville and Nashville and that unless I received orders to the contrary I should take Clarksville on the twenty first and Nashville about the first of March Both these places are on the Cumberland River above Fort Donelson As I heard nothing from headquarters on the subject General C F Smith was sent to Clarksville at the time designated and found the place evacuated The capture of forts Henry and Donelson had broken the line the enemy had taken from Columbus to Bowling Green and it was known that he was falling back from the eastern point of this line and that Buell was following or at least advancing I should have sent troops to Nashville at the time I sent to Clarksville but my transportation was limited and there were many prisoners to be forwarded north None of the reinforcements from Buell s army arrived until the twenty fourth of February Then General Nelson came up with orders to report to me with two brigades he having sent one brigade to Cairo I knew General Buell was advancing on Nashville from the north and I was advised by scouts that the rebels were leaving that place and trying to get out all the supplies they could Nashville was at that time one of the best provisioned posts in the South I had no use for reinforcements now and thinking Buell would like to have his troops again I ordered Nelson to proceed to Nashville without debarking at Fort Donelson I sent a gunboat also as a convoy The Cumberland River was very high at the time the railroad bridge at Nashville had been burned and all river craft had been destroyed or would be before the enemy left Nashville is on the west bank of the Cumberland and Buell was approaching from the east I thought the steamers carrying Nelson s division would be useful in ferrying the balance of Buell s forces across I ordered Nelson to put himself in communication with Buell as soon as possible and if he found him more than two days off from Nashville to return below the city and await orders Buell however had already arrived in person at Edgefield opposite Nashville and Mitchell s division of his command reached there the same day Nelson immediately took possession of the city After Nelson had gone and before I had learned of Buell s arrival I sent word to department headquarters that I should go to Nashville myself on the twenty eighth if I received no orders to the contrary Hearing nothing I went as I had informed my superior officer I would do On arriving at Clarksville I saw a fleet of steamers at the shore the same that had taken Nelson s division and troops going aboard I landed and called on the commanding officer General C F Smith As soon as he saw me he showed an order he had just received from Buell in these words NASHVILLE February twenty five eighteen sixty two GENERAL C F SMITH Commanding U S Forces Clarksville GENERAL The landing of a portion of our troops contrary to my intentions on the south side of the river has compelled me to hold this side at every hazard If the enemy should assume the offensive and I am assured by reliable persons that in view of my position such is his intention my force present is altogether inadequate consisting of only fifteen thousand men I have to request you therefore to come forward with all the available force under your command So important do I consider the occasion that I think it necessary to give this communication all the force of orders and I send four boats the Diana Woodford John Rain and Autocrat to bring you up In five or six days my force will probably be sufficient to relieve you Very respectfully your ob t srv t D C BUELL Brigadier General Comd g P S The steamers will leave here at twelve o clock to night General Smith said this order was nonsense But I told him it was better to obey it The General replied of course I must obey and said his men were embarking as fast as they could I went on up to Nashville and inspected the position taken by Nelson s troops I did not see Buell during the day and wrote him a note saying that I had been in Nashville since early morning and had hoped to meet him On my return to the boat we met His troops were still east of the river and the steamers that had carried Nelson s division up were mostly at Clarksville to bring Smith s division I said to General Buell my information was that the enemy was retreating as fast as possible General Buell said there was fighting going on then only ten or twelve miles away I said Quite probably Nashville contained valuable stores of arms ammunition and provisions and the enemy is probably trying to carry away all he can The fighting is doubtless with the rear guard who are trying to protect the trains they are getting away with Buell spoke very positively of the danger Nashville was in of an attack from the enemy I said in the absence of positive information I believed my information was correct He responded that he knew Well I said I do not know but as I came by Clarksville General Smith s troops were embarking to join you Smith s troops were returned the same day The enemy were trying to get away from Nashville and not to return to it At this time General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded all the Confederate troops west of the Alleghany Mountains with the exception of those in the extreme south On the National side the forces confronting him were divided into at first three then four separate departments Johnston had greatly the advantage in having supreme command over all troops that could possibly be brought to bear upon one point while the forces similarly situated on the National side divided into independent commands could not be brought into harmonious action except by orders from Washington At the beginning of eighteen sixty two Johnston s troops east of the Mississippi occupied a line extending from Columbus on his left to Mill Springs on his right As we have seen Columbus both banks of the Tennessee River the west bank of the Cumberland and Bowling Green all were strongly fortified Mill Springs was intrenched The National troops occupied no territory south of the Ohio except three small garrisons along its bank and a force thrown out from Louisville to confront that at Bowling Green Johnston s strength was no doubt numerically inferior to that of the National troops but this was compensated for by the advantage of being sole commander of all the Confederate forces at the West and of operating in a country where his friends would take care of his rear without any detail of soldiers But when General George H Thomas moved upon the enemy at Mill Springs and totally routed him inflicting a loss of some three hundred killed and wounded and forts Henry and Heiman fell into the hands of the National forces with their armaments and about one hundred prisoners those losses seemed to dishearten the Confederate commander so much that he immediately commenced a retreat from Bowling Green on Nashville He reached this latter place on the fourteenth of February while Donelson was still besieged Buell followed with a portion of the Army of the Ohio but he had to march and did not reach the east bank of the Cumberland opposite Nashville until the twenty fourth of the month and then with only one division of his army The bridge at Nashville had been destroyed and all boats removed or disabled so that a small garrison could have held the place against any National troops that could have been brought against it within ten days after the arrival of the force from Bowling Green Johnston seemed to lie quietly at Nashville to await the result at Fort Donelson on which he had staked the possession of most of the territory embraced in the States of Kentucky and Tennessee It is true the two generals senior in rank at Fort Donelson were sending him encouraging dispatches even claiming great Confederate victories up to the night of the sixteenth when they must have been preparing for their individual escape Johnston made a fatal mistake in intrusting so important a command to Floyd who he must have known was no soldier even if he possessed the elements of one Pillow s presence as second was also a mistake If these officers had been forced upon him and designated for that particular command then he should have left Nashville with a small garrison under a trusty officer and with the remainder of his force gone to Donelson himself If he had been captured the result could not have been worse than it was Johnston s heart failed him upon the first advance of National troops He wrote to Richmond on the eighth of February I think the gunboats of the enemy will probably take Fort Donelson without the necessity of employing their land force in cooperation After the fall of that place he abandoned Nashville and Chattanooga without an effort to save either and fell back into northern Mississippi where six weeks later he was destined to end his career From the time of leaving Cairo I was singularly unfortunate in not receiving dispatches from General Halleck The order of the tenth of February directing me to fortify Fort Henry strongly particularly to the land side and saying that intrenching tools had been sent for that purpose reached me after Donelson was invested I received nothing direct which indicated that the department commander knew we were in possession of Donelson I was reporting regularly to the chief of staff who had been sent to Cairo soon after the troops left there to receive all reports from the front and to telegraph the substance to the saint Louis headquarters Cairo was at the southern end of the telegraph wire Another line was started at once from Cairo to Paducah and Smithland at the mouths of the Tennessee and Cumberland respectively My dispatches were all sent to Cairo by boat but many of those addressed to me were sent to the operator at the end of the advancing wire and he failed to forward them This operator afterwards proved to be a rebel he deserted his post after a short time and went south taking his dispatches with him A telegram from General McClellan to me of February sixteenth the day of the surrender directing me to report in full the situation was not received at my headquarters until the threed of March On the twod of March I received orders dated March first to move my command back to Fort Henry leaving only a small garrison at Donelson From Fort Henry expeditions were to be sent against Eastport Mississippi and Paris Tennessee We started from Donelson on the fourth and the same day I was back on the Tennessee River On March fourth I also received the following dispatch from General Halleck major general U S GRANT Fort Henry You will place major general C F Smith in command of expedition and remain yourself at Fort Henry Why do you not obey my orders to report strength and positions of your command H W HALLECK Major General I was surprised This was the first intimation I had received that General Halleck had called for information as to the strength of my command On the sixth he wrote to me again Your going to Nashville without authority and when your presence with your troops was of the utmost importance was a matter of very serious complaint at Washington so much so that I was advised to arrest you on your return This was the first I knew of his objecting to my going to Nashville That place was not beyond the limits of my command which it had been expressly declared in orders were not defined Nashville is west of the Cumberland River and I had sent troops that had reported to me for duty to occupy the place I turned over the command as directed and then replied to General Halleck courteously but asked to be relieved from further duty under him Later I learned that General Halleck had been calling lustily for more troops promising that he would do something important if he could only be sufficiently reinforced McClellan asked him what force he then had Halleck telegraphed me to supply the information so far as my command was concerned but I received none of his dispatches At last Halleck reported to Washington that he had repeatedly ordered me to give the strength of my force but could get nothing out of me that I had gone to Nashville beyond the limits of my command without his authority and that my army was more demoralized by victory than the army at Bull Run had been by defeat General McClellan on this information ordered that I should be relieved from duty and that an investigation should be made into any charges against me He even authorized my arrest Thus in less than two weeks after the victory at Donelson the two leading generals in the army were in correspondence as to what disposition should be made of me and in less than three weeks I was virtually in arrest and without a command On the thirteenth of March I was restored to command and on the seventeenth Halleck sent me a copy of an order from the War Department which stated that accounts of my misbehavior had reached Washington and directed him to investigate and report the facts He forwarded also a copy of a detailed dispatch from himself to Washington entirely exonerating me but he did not inform me that it was his own reports that had created all the trouble On the contrary he wrote to me Instead of relieving you I wish you as soon as your new army is in the field to assume immediate command and lead it to new victories In consequence I felt very grateful to him and supposed it was his interposition that had set me right with the government I never knew the truth until General Badeau unearthed the facts in his researches for his history of my campaigns General Halleck unquestionably deemed General C F Smith a much fitter officer for the command of all the forces in the military district than I was and to render him available for such command desired his promotion to antedate mine and those of the other division commanders It is probable that the general opinion was that Smith s long services in the army and distinguished deeds rendered him the more proper person for such command Indeed I was rather inclined to this opinion myself at that time and would have served as faithfully under Smith as he had done under me But this did not justify the dispatches which General Halleck sent to Washington or his subsequent concealment of them from me when pretending to explain the action of my superiors On receipt of the order restoring me to command I proceeded to Savannah on the Tennessee to which point my troops had advanced General Smith was delighted to see me and was unhesitating in his denunciation of the treatment I had received He was on a sick bed at the time from which he never came away alive His death was a severe loss to our western army His personal courage was unquestioned his judgment and professional acquirements were unsurpassed and he had the confidence of those he commanded as well as of those over him CHAPTER XXIV THE ARMY AT PITTSBURG LANDING INJURED BY A FALL THE CONFEDERATE ATTACK AT SHILOH THE FIRST DAY S FIGHT AT SHILOH GENERAL SHERMAN CONDITION OF THE ARMY CLOSE OF THE FIRST DAY S FIGHT THE SECOND DAY S FIGHT RETREAT AND DEFEAT OF THE CONFEDERATES When I reassumed command on the seventeenth of March I found the army divided about half being on the east bank of the Tennessee at Savannah while one division was at Crump s landing on the west bank about four miles higher up and the remainder at Pittsburg landing five miles above Crump s The enemy was in force at Corinth the junction of the two most important railroads in the Mississippi valley one connecting Memphis and the Mississippi River with the East and the other leading south to all the cotton states Still another railroad connects Corinth with Jackson in west Tennessee If we obtained possession of Corinth the enemy would have no railroad for the transportation of armies or supplies until that running east from Vicksburg was reached It was the great strategic position at the West between the Tennessee and the Mississippi rivers and between Nashville and Vicksburg I at once put all the troops at Savannah in motion for Pittsburg landing knowing that the enemy was fortifying at Corinth and collecting an army there under Johnston It was my expectation to march against that army as soon as Buell who had been ordered to reinforce me with the Army of the Ohio should arrive and the west bank of the river was the place to start from Pittsburg is only about twenty miles from Corinth and Hamburg landing four miles further up the river is a mile or two nearer I had not been in command long before I selected Hamburg as the place to put the Army of the Ohio when it arrived The roads from Pittsburg and Hamburg to Corinth converge some eight miles out This disposition of the troops would have given additional roads to march over when the advance commenced within supporting distance of each other Before I arrived at Savannah Sherman who had joined the Army of the Tennessee and been placed in command of a division had made an expedition on steamers convoyed by gunboats to the neighborhood of Eastport thirty miles south for the purpose of destroying the railroad east of Corinth The rains had been so heavy for some time before that the low lands had become impassable swamps Sherman debarked his troops and started out to accomplish the object of the expedition but the river was rising so rapidly that the back water up the small tributaries threatened to cut off the possibility of getting back to the boats and the expedition had to return without reaching the railroad The guns had to be hauled by hand through the water to get back to the boats On the seventeenth of March the army on the Tennessee River consisted of five divisions commanded respectively by Generals C F Smith McClernand L Wallace Hurlbut and Sherman General W H L Wallace was temporarily in command of Smith s division General Smith as I have said being confined to his bed Reinforcements were arriving daily and as they came up they were organized first into brigades then into a division and the command given to General Prentiss who had been ordered to report to me General Buell was on his way from Nashville with forty thousand veterans On the nineteenth of March he was at Columbia Tennessee eighty five miles from Pittsburg When all reinforcements should have arrived I expected to take the initiative by marching on Corinth and had no expectation of needing fortifications though this subject was taken into consideration McPherson my only military engineer was directed to lay out a line to intrench He did so but reported that it would have to be made in rear of the line of encampment as it then ran The new line while it would be nearer the river was yet too far away from the Tennessee or even from the creeks to be easily supplied with water and in case of attack these creeks would be in the hands of the enemy The fact is I regarded the campaign we were engaged in as an offensive one and had no idea that the enemy would leave strong intrenchments to take the initiative when he knew he would be attacked where he was if he remained This view however did not prevent every precaution being taken and every effort made to keep advised of all movements of the enemy Johnston s cavalry meanwhile had been well out towards our front and occasional encounters occurred between it and our outposts On the first of April this cavalry became bold and approached our lines showing that an advance of some kind was contemplated On the twod Johnston left Corinth in force to attack my army On the fourth his cavalry dashed down and captured a small picket guard of six or seven men stationed some five miles out from Pittsburg on the Corinth road Colonel Buckland sent relief to the guard at once and soon followed in person with an entire regiment and General Sherman followed Buckland taking the remainder of a brigade The pursuit was kept up for some three miles beyond the point where the picket guard had been captured and after nightfall Sherman returned to camp and reported to me by letter what had occurred At this time a large body of the enemy was hovering to the west of us along the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad My apprehension was much greater for the safety of Crump s landing than it was for Pittsburg I had no apprehension that the enemy could really capture either place But I feared it was possible that he might make a rapid dash upon Crump s and destroy our transports and stores most of which were kept at that point and then retreat before Wallace could be reinforced Lew Wallace s position I regarded as so well chosen that he was not removed At this time I generally spent the day at Pittsburg and returned to Savannah in the evening I was intending to remove my headquarters to Pittsburg but Buell was expected daily and would come in at Savannah I remained at this point therefore a few days longer than I otherwise should have done in order to meet him on his arrival The skirmishing in our front however had been so continuous from about the threed of April that I did not leave Pittsburg each night until an hour when I felt there would be no further danger before the morning On Friday the fourth the day of Buckland s advance I was very much injured by my horse falling with me and on me while I was trying to get to the front where firing had been heard The night was one of impenetrable darkness with rain pouring down in torrents nothing was visible to the eye except as revealed by the frequent flashes of lightning Under these circumstances I had to trust to the horse without guidance to keep the road I had not gone far however when I met General W H L Wallace and Colonel afterwards General McPherson coming from the direction of the front They said all was quiet so far as the enemy was concerned On the way back to the boat my horse s feet slipped from under him and he fell with my leg under his body The extreme softness of the ground from the excessive rains of the few preceding days no doubt saved me from a severe injury and protracted lameness As it was my ankle was very much injured so much so that my boot had to be cut off For two or three days after I was unable to walk except with crutches On the fifth General Nelson with a division of Buell s army arrived at Savannah and I ordered him to move up the east bank of the river to be in a position where he could be ferried over to Crump s landing or Pittsburg as occasion required I had learned that General Buell himself would be at Savannah the next day and desired to meet me on his arrival Affairs at Pittsburg landing had been such for several days that I did not want to be away during the day I determined therefore to take a very early breakfast and ride out to meet Buell and thus save time He had arrived on the evening of the fifth but had not advised me of the fact and I was not aware of it until some time after While I was at breakfast however heavy firing was heard in the direction of Pittsburg landing and I hastened there sending a hurried note to Buell informing him of the reason why I could not meet him at Savannah On the way up the river I directed the dispatch boat to run in close to Crump s landing so that I could communicate with General Lew Wallace I found him waiting on a boat apparently expecting to see me and I directed him to get his troops in line ready to execute any orders he might receive He replied that his troops were already under arms and prepared to move Up to that time I had felt by no means certain that Crump s landing might not be the point of attack On reaching the front however about eight A M I found that the attack on Pittsburg was unmistakable and that nothing more than a small guard to protect our transports and stores was needed at Crump s Captain Baxter a quartermaster on my staff was accordingly directed to go back and order General Wallace to march immediately to Pittsburg by the road nearest the river Captain Baxter made a memorandum of this order About one P M not hearing from Wallace and being much in need of reinforcements I sent two more of my staff Colonel McPherson and Captain Rowley to bring him up with his division They reported finding him marching towards Purdy Bethel or some point west from the river and farther from Pittsburg by several miles than when he started The road from his first position to Pittsburg landing was direct and near the river Between the two points a bridge had been built across Snake Creek by our troops at which Wallace s command had assisted expressly to enable the troops at the two places to support each other in case of need Wallace did not arrive in time to take part in the first day s fight General Wallace has since claimed that the order delivered to him by Captain Baxter was simply to join the right of the army and that the road over which he marched would have taken him to the road from Pittsburg to Purdy where it crosses Owl Creek on the right of Sherman but this is not where I had ordered him nor where I wanted him to go I never could see and do not now see why any order was necessary further than to direct him to come to Pittsburg landing without specifying by what route His was one of three veteran divisions that had been in battle and its absence was severely felt Later in the war General Wallace would not have made the mistake that he committed on the sixth of April eighteen sixty two I presume his idea was that by taking the route he did he would be able to come around on the flank or rear of the enemy and thus perform an act of heroism that would redound to the credit of his command as well as to the benefit of his country Some two or three miles from Pittsburg landing was a log meeting house called Shiloh It stood on the ridge which divides the waters of Snake and Lick creeks the former emptying into the Tennessee just north of Pittsburg landing and the latter south This point was the key to our position and was held by Sherman His division was at that time wholly raw no part of it ever having been in an engagement but I thought this deficiency was more than made up by the superiority of the commander McClernand was on Sherman s left with troops that had been engaged at forts Henry and Donelson and were therefore veterans so far as western troops had become such at that stage of the war Next to McClernand came Prentiss with a raw division and on the extreme left Stuart with one brigade of Sherman s division Hurlbut was in rear of Prentiss massed and in reserve at the time of the onset The division of General C F Smith was on the right also in reserve General Smith was still sick in bed at Savannah but within hearing of our guns His services would no doubt have been of inestimable value had his health permitted his presence The command of his division devolved upon Brigadier General W H L Wallace a most estimable and able officer a veteran too for he had served a year in the Mexican war and had been with his command at Henry and Donelson Wallace was mortally wounded in the first day s engagement and with the change of commanders thus necessarily effected in the heat of battle the efficiency of his division was much weakened The position of our troops made a continuous line from Lick Creek on the left to Owl Creek a branch of Snake Creek on the right facing nearly south and possibly a little west The water in all these streams was very high at the time and contributed to protect our flanks The enemy was compelled therefore to attack directly in front This he did with great vigor inflicting heavy losses on the National side but suffering much heavier on his own The Confederate assaults were made with such a disregard of losses on their own side that our line of tents soon fell into their hands The ground on which the battle was fought was undulating heavily timbered with scattered clearings the woods giving some protection to the troops on both sides There was also considerable underbrush A number of attempts were made by the enemy to turn our right flank where Sherman was posted but every effort was repulsed with heavy loss But the front attack was kept up so vigorously that to prevent the success of these attempts to get on our flanks the National troops were compelled several times to take positions to the rear nearer Pittsburg landing When the firing ceased at night the National line was all of a mile in rear of the position it had occupied in the morning In one of the backward moves on the sixth the division commanded by General Prentiss did not fall back with the others This left his flanks exposed and enabled the enemy to capture him with about twenty two hundred of his officers and men General Badeau gives four o clock of the sixth as about the time this capture took place He may be right as to the time but my recollection is that the hour was later General Prentiss himself gave the hour as half past five I was with him as I was with each of the division commanders that day several times and my recollection is that the last time I was with him was about half past four when his division was standing up firmly and the General was as cool as if expecting victory But no matter whether it was four or later the story that he and his command were surprised and captured in their camps is without any foundation whatever If it had been true as currently reported at the time and yet believed by thousands of people that Prentiss and his division had been captured in their beds there would not have been an all day struggle with the loss of thousands killed and wounded on the Confederate side With the single exception of a few minutes after the capture of Prentiss a continuous and unbroken line was maintained all day from Snake Creek or its tributaries on the right to Lick Creek or the Tennessee on the left above Pittsburg There was no hour during the day when there was not heavy firing and generally hard fighting at some point on the line but seldom at all points at the same time It was a case of Southern dash against Northern pluck and endurance Three of the five divisions engaged on Sunday were entirely raw and many of the men had only received their arms on the way from their States to the field Many of them had arrived but a day or two before and were hardly able to load their muskets according to the manual Their officers were equally ignorant of their duties Under these circumstances it is not astonishing that many of the regiments broke at the first fire In two cases as I now remember colonels led their regiments from the field on first hearing the whistle of the enemy s bullets In these cases the colonels were constitutional cowards unfit for any military position but not so the officers and men led out of danger by them Better troops never went upon a battle field than many of these officers and men afterwards proved themselves to be who fled panic stricken at the first whistle of bullets and shell at Shiloh During the whole of Sunday I was continuously engaged in passing from one part of the field to another giving directions to division commanders In thus moving along the line however I never deemed it important to stay long with Sherman Although his troops were then under fire for the first time their commander by his constant presence with them inspired a confidence in officers and men that enabled them to render services on that bloody battle field worthy of the best of veterans McClernand was next to Sherman and the hardest fighting was in front of these two divisions McClernand told me on that day the sixth that he profited much by having so able a commander supporting him A casualty to Sherman that would have taken him from the field that day would have been a sad one for the troops engaged at Shiloh And how near we came to this On the sixth Sherman was shot twice once in the hand once in the shoulder the ball cutting his coat and making a slight wound and a third ball passed through his hat In addition to this he had several horses shot during the day The nature of this battle was such that cavalry could not be used in front I therefore formed ours into line in rear to stop stragglers of whom there were many When there would be enough of them to make a show and after they had recovered from their fright they would be sent to reinforce some part of the line which needed support without regard to their companies regiments or brigades On one occasion during the day I rode back as far as the river and met General Buell who had just arrived I do not remember the hour but at that time there probably were as many as four or five thousand stragglers lying under cover of the river bluff panic stricken most of whom would have been shot where they lay without resistance before they would have taken muskets and marched to the front to protect themselves This meeting between General Buell and myself was on the dispatch boat used to run between the landing and Savannah It was brief and related specially to his getting his troops over the river As we left the boat together Buell s attention was attracted by the men lying under cover of the river bank I saw him berating them and trying to shame them into joining their regiments He even threatened them with shells from the gunboats near by But it was all to no effect Most of these men afterward proved themselves as gallant as any of those who saved the battle from which they had deserted I have no doubt that this sight impressed General Buell with the idea that a line of retreat would be a good thing just then If he had come in by the front instead of through the stragglers in the rear he would have thought and felt differently Could he have come through the Confederate rear he would have witnessed there a scene similar to that at our own The distant rear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge correctly what is going on in front Later in the war while occupying the country between the Tennessee and the Mississippi I learned that the panic in the Confederate lines had not differed much from that within our own Some of the country people estimated the stragglers from Johnston s army as high as twenty thousand Of course this was an exaggeration The situation at the close of Sunday was as follows along the top of the bluff just south of the log house which stood at Pittsburg landing Colonel J D Webster of my staff had arranged twenty or more pieces of artillery facing south or up the river This line of artillery was on the crest of a hill overlooking a deep ravine opening into the Tennessee Hurlbut with his division intact was on the right of this artillery extending west and possibly a little north McClernand came next in the general line looking more to the west His division was complete in its organization and ready for any duty Sherman came next his right extending to Snake Creek His command like the other two was complete in its organization and ready like its chief for any service it might be called upon to render All three divisions were as a matter of course more or less shattered and depleted in numbers from the terrible battle of the day The division of W H L Wallace as much from the disorder arising from changes of division and brigade commanders under heavy fire as from any other cause had lost its organization and did not occupy a place in the line as a division Prentiss command was gone as a division many of its members having been killed wounded or captured but it had rendered valiant services before its final dispersal and had contributed a good share to the defence of Shiloh The right of my line rested near the bank of Snake Creek a short distance above the bridge which had been built by the troops for the purpose of connecting Crump s landing and Pittsburg landing Sherman had posted some troops in a log house and out buildings which overlooked both the bridge over which Wallace was expected and the creek above that point In this last position Sherman was frequently attacked before night but held the point until he voluntarily abandoned it to advance in order to make room for Lew Wallace who came up after dark There was as I have said a deep ravine in front of our left The Tennessee River was very high and there was water to a considerable depth in the ravine Here the enemy made a last desperate effort to turn our flank but was repelled The gunboats Tyler and Lexington Gwin and Shirk commanding with the artillery under Webster aided the army and effectually checked their further progress Before any of Buell s troops had reached the west bank of the Tennessee firing had almost entirely ceased anything like an attempt on the part of the enemy to advance had absolutely ceased There was some artillery firing from an unseen enemy some of his shells passing beyond us but I do not remember that there was the whistle of a single musket ball heard As his troops arrived in the dusk General Buell marched several of his regiments part way down the face of the hill where they fired briskly for some minutes but I do not think a single man engaged in this firing received an injury The attack had spent its force General Lew Wallace with five thousand effective men arrived after firing had ceased for the day and was placed on the right Thus night came Wallace came and the advance of Nelson s division came but none unless night in time to be of material service to the gallant men who saved Shiloh on that first day against large odds Buell s loss on the sixth of April was two men killed and one wounded all members of the thirty sixth Indiana infantry The Army of the Tennessee lost on that day at least seven thousand men The presence of two or three regiments of Buell s army on the west bank before firing ceased had not the slightest effect in preventing the capture of Pittsburg landing So confident was I before firing had ceased on the sixth that the next day would bring victory to our arms if we could only take the initiative that I visited each division commander in person before any reinforcements had reached the field I directed them to throw out heavy lines of skirmishers in the morning as soon as they could see and push them forward until they found the enemy following with their entire divisions in supporting distance and to engage the enemy as soon as found To Sherman I told the story of the assault at Fort Donelson and said that the same tactics would win at Shiloh Victory was assured when Wallace arrived even if there had been no other support I was glad however to see the reinforcements of Buell and credit them with doing all there was for them to do During the night of the sixth the remainder of Nelson s division Buell s army crossed the river and were ready to advance in the morning forming the left wing Two other divisions Crittenden s and McCook s came up the river from Savannah in the transports and were on the west bank early on the seventh Buell commanded them in person My command was thus nearly doubled in numbers and efficiency During the night rain fell in torrents and our troops were exposed to the storm without shelter I made my headquarters under a tree a few hundred yards back from the river bank My ankle was so much swollen from the fall of my horse the Friday night preceding and the bruise was so painful that I could get no rest The drenching rain would have precluded the possibility of sleep without this additional cause Some time after midnight growing restive under the storm and the continuous pain I moved back to the log house under the bank This had been taken as a hospital and all night wounded men were being brought in their wounds dressed a leg or an arm amputated as the case might require and everything being done to save life or alleviate suffering The sight was more unendurable than encountering the enemy s fire and I returned to my tree in the rain The advance on the morning of the seventh developed the enemy in the camps occupied by our troops before the battle began more than a mile back from the most advanced position of the Confederates on the day before It is known now that they had not yet learned of the arrival of Buell s command Possibly they fell back so far to get the shelter of our tents during the rain and also to get away from the shells that were dropped upon them by the gunboats every fifteen minutes during the night The position of the Union troops on the morning of the seventh was as follows General Lew Wallace on the right Sherman on his left then McClernand and then Hurlbut Nelson of Buell s army was on our extreme left next to the river Crittenden was next in line after Nelson and on his right McCook followed and formed the extreme right of Buell s command My old command thus formed the right wing while the troops directly under Buell constituted the left wing of the army These relative positions were retained during the entire day or until the enemy was driven from the field In a very short time the battle became general all along the line This day everything was favorable to the Union side We had now become the attacking party The enemy was driven back all day as we had been the day before until finally he beat a precipitate retreat The last point held by him was near the road leading from the landing to Corinth on the left of Sherman and right of McClernand About three o clock being near that point and seeing that the enemy was giving way everywhere else I gathered up a couple of regiments or parts of regiments from troops near by formed them in line of battle and marched them forward going in front myself to prevent premature or long range firing At this point there was a clearing between us and the enemy favorable for charging although exposed I knew the enemy were ready to break and only wanted a little encouragement from us to go quickly and join their friends who had started earlier After marching to within musket range I stopped and let the troops pass The command CHARGE was given and was executed with loud cheers and with a run when the last of the enemy broke seven CHAPTER XXV STRUCK BY A BULLET PRECIPITATE RETREAT OF THE CONFEDERATES INTRENCHMENTS AT SHILOH GENERAL BUELL GENERAL JOHNSTON REMARKS ON SHILOH During this second day of the battle I had been moving from right to left and back to see for myself the progress made In the early part of the afternoon while riding with Colonel McPherson and Major Hawkins then my chief commissary we got beyond the left of our troops We were moving along the northern edge of a clearing very leisurely toward the river above the landing There did not appear to be an enemy to our right until suddenly a battery with musketry opened upon us from the edge of the woods on the other side of the clearing The shells and balls whistled about our ears very fast for about a minute I do not think it took us longer than that to get out of range and out of sight In the sudden start we made Major Hawkins lost his hat He did not stop to pick it up When we arrived at a perfectly safe position we halted to take an account of damages McPherson s horse was panting as if ready to drop On examination it was found that a ball had struck him forward of the flank just back of the saddle and had gone entirely through In a few minutes the poor beast dropped dead he had given no sign of injury until we came to a stop A ball had struck the metal scabbard of my sword just below the hilt and broken it nearly off before the battle was over it had broken off entirely There were three of us one had lost a horse killed one a hat and one a sword scabbard All were thankful that it was no worse After the rain of the night before and the frequent and heavy rains for some days previous the roads were almost impassable The enemy carrying his artillery and supply trains over them in his retreat made them still worse for troops following I wanted to pursue but had not the heart to order the men who had fought desperately for two days lying in the mud and rain whenever not fighting and I did eight not feel disposed to positively order Buell or any part of his command to pursue Although the senior in rank at the time I had been so only a few weeks Buell was and had been for some time past a department commander while I commanded only a district I did not meet Buell in person until too late to get troops ready and pursue with effect but had I seen him at the moment of the last charge I should have at least requested him to follow I rode forward several miles the day after the battle and found that the enemy had dropped much if not all of their provisions some ammunition and the extra wheels of their caissons lightening their loads to enable them to get off their guns About five miles out we found their field hospital abandoned An immediate pursuit must have resulted in the capture of a considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns Shiloh was the severest battle fought at the West during the war and but few in the East equalled it for hard determined fighting I saw an open field in our possession on the second day over which the Confederates had made repeated charges the day before so covered with dead that it would have been possible to walk across the clearing in any direction stepping on dead bodies without a foot touching the ground On our side National and Confederate troops were mingled together in about equal proportions but on the remainder of the field nearly all were Confederates On one part which had evidently not been ploughed for several years probably because the land was poor bushes had grown up some to the height of eight or ten feet There was not one of these left standing unpierced by bullets The smaller ones were all cut down Contrary to all my experience up to that time and to the experience of the army I was then commanding we were on the defensive We were without intrenchments or defensive advantages of any sort and more than half the army engaged the first day was without experience or even drill as soldiers The officers with them except the division commanders and possibly two or three of the brigade commanders were equally inexperienced in war The result was a Union victory that gave the men who achieved it great confidence in themselves ever after The enemy fought bravely but they had started out to defeat and destroy an army and capture a position They failed in both with very heavy loss in killed and wounded and must have gone back discouraged and convinced that the Yankee was not an enemy to be despised After the battle I gave verbal instructions to division commanders to let the regiments send out parties to bury their own dead and to detail parties under commissioned officers from each division to bury the Confederate dead in their respective fronts and to report the numbers so buried The latter part of these instructions was not carried out by all but they were by those sent from Sherman s division and by some of the parties sent out by McClernand The heaviest loss sustained by the enemy was in front of these two divisions The criticism has often been made that the Union troops should have been intrenched at Shiloh Up to that time the pick and spade had been but little resorted to at the West I had however taken this subject under consideration soon after re assuming command in the field and as already stated my only military engineer reported unfavorably Besides this the troops with me officers and men needed discipline and drill more than they did experience with the pick shovel and axe Reinforcements were arriving almost daily composed of troops that had been hastily thrown together into companies and regiments fragments of incomplete organizations the men and officers strangers to each other Under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications General Buell was a brave intelligent officer with as much professional pride and ambition of a commendable sort as I ever knew I had been two years at West Point with him and had served with him afterwards in garrison and in the Mexican war several years more He was not given in early life or in mature years to forming intimate acquaintances He was studious by habit and commanded the confidence and respect of all who knew him He was a strict disciplinarian and perhaps did not distinguish sufficiently between the volunteer who enlisted for the war and the soldier who serves in time of peace One system embraced men who risked life for a principle and often men of social standing competence or wealth and independence of character The other includes as a rule only men who could not do as well in any other occupation General Buell became an object of harsh criticism later some going so far as to challenge his loyalty No one who knew him ever believed him capable of a dishonorable act and nothing could be more dishonorable than to accept high rank and command in war and then betray the trust When I came into command of the army in eighteen sixty four I requested the Secretary of War to restore General Buell to duty After the war during the summer of eighteen sixty five I travelled considerably through the North and was everywhere met by large numbers of people Every one had his opinion about the manner in which the war had been conducted who among the generals had failed how and why Correspondents of the press were ever on hand to hear every word dropped and were not always disposed to report correctly what did not confirm their preconceived notions either about the conduct of the war or the individuals concerned in it The opportunity frequently occurred for me to defend General Buell against what I believed to be most unjust charges On one occasion a correspondent put in my mouth the very charge I had so often refuted of disloyalty This brought from General Buell a very severe retort which I saw in the New York World some time before I received the letter itself I could very well understand his grievance at seeing untrue and disgraceful charges apparently sustained by an officer who at the time was at the head of the army I replied to him but not through the press I kept no copy of my letter nor did I ever see it in print neither did I receive an answer General Albert Sidney Johnston who commanded the Confederate forces at the beginning of the battle was disabled by a wound on the afternoon of the first day This wound as I understood afterwards was not necessarily fatal or even dangerous But he was a man who would not abandon what he deemed an important trust in the face of danger and consequently continued in the saddle commanding until so exhausted by the loss of blood that he had to be taken from his horse and soon after died The news was not long in reaching our side and I suppose was quite an encouragement to the National soldiers I had known Johnston slightly in the Mexican war and later as an officer in the regular army He was a man of high character and ability His contemporaries at West Point and officers generally who came to know him personally later and who remained on our side expected him to prove the most formidable man to meet that the Confederacy would produce I once wrote that nothing occurred in his brief command of an army to prove or disprove the high estimate that had been placed upon his military ability but after studying the orders and dispatches of Johnston I am compelled to materially modify my views of that officer s qualifications as a soldier My judgment now is that he was vacillating and undecided in his actions All the disasters in Kentucky and Tennessee were so discouraging to the authorities in Richmond that Jefferson Davis wrote an unofficial letter to Johnston expressing his own anxiety and that of the public and saying that he had made such defence as was dictated by long friendship but that in the absence of a report he needed facts The letter was not a reprimand in direct terms but it was evidently as much felt as though it had been one General Johnston raised another army as rapidly as he could and fortified or strongly intrenched at Corinth He knew the National troops were preparing to attack him in his chosen position But he had evidently become so disturbed at the results of his operations that he resolved to strike out in an offensive campaign which would restore all that was lost and if successful accomplish still more We have the authority of his son and biographer for saying that his plan was to attack the forces at Shiloh and crush them then to cross the Tennessee and destroy the army of Buell and push the war across the Ohio River The design was a bold one but we have the same authority for saying that in the execution Johnston showed vacillation and indecision He left Corinth on the twod of April and was not ready to attack until the sixth The distance his army had to march was less than twenty miles Beauregard his second in command was opposed to the attack for two reasons first he thought if let alone the National troops would attack the Confederates in their intrenchments second we were in ground of our own choosing and would necessarily be intrenched Johnston not only listened to the objection of Beauregard to an attack but held a council of war on the subject on the morning of the fifth On the evening of the same day he was in consultation with some of his generals on the same subject and still again on the morning of the sixth During this last consultation and before a decision had been reached the battle began by the National troops opening fire on the enemy This seemed to settle the question as to whether there was to be any battle of Shiloh It also seems to me to settle the question as to whether there was a surprise I do not question the personal courage of General Johnston or his ability But he did not win the distinction predicted for him by many of his friends He did prove that as a general he was over estimated General Beauregard was next in rank to Johnston and succeeded to the command which he retained to the close of the battle and during the subsequent retreat on Corinth as well as in the siege of that place His tactics have been severely criticised by Confederate writers but I do not believe his fallen chief could have done any better under the circumstances Some of these critics claim that Shiloh was won when Johnston fell and that if he had not fallen the army under me would have been annihilated or captured IFS defeated the Confederates at Shiloh There is little doubt that we would have been disgracefully beaten IF all the shells and bullets fired by us had passed harmlessly over the enemy and IF all of theirs had taken effect Commanding generals are liable to be killed during engagements and the fact that when he was shot Johnston was leading a brigade to induce it to make a charge which had been repeatedly ordered is evidence that there was neither the universal demoralization on our side nor the unbounded confidence on theirs which has been claimed There was in fact no hour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat of the enemy although I was disappointed that reinforcements so near at hand did not arrive at an earlier hour The description of the battle of Shiloh given by Colonel Wm Preston Johnston is very graphic and well told The reader will imagine that he can see each blow struck a demoralized and broken mob of Union soldiers each blow sending the enemy more demoralized than ever towards the Tennessee River which was a little more than two miles away at the beginning of the onset If the reader does not stop to inquire why with such Confederate success for more than twelve hours of hard fighting the National troops were not all killed captured or driven into the river he will regard the pen picture as perfect But I witnessed the fight from the National side from eight o clock in the morning until night closed the contest I see but little in the description that I can recognize The Confederate troops fought well and deserve commendation enough for their bravery and endurance on the sixth of April without detracting from their antagonists or claiming anything more than their just dues The reports of the enemy show that their condition at the end of the first day was deplorable their losses in killed and wounded had been very heavy and their stragglers had been quite as numerous as on the National side with the difference that those of the enemy left the field entirely and were not brought back to their respective commands for many days On the Union side but few of the stragglers fell back further than the landing on the river and many of these were in line for duty on the second day The admissions of the highest Confederate officers engaged at Shiloh make the claim of a victory for them absurd The victory was not to either party until the battle was over It was then a Union victory in which the Armies of the Tennessee and the Ohio both participated But the Army of the Tennessee fought the entire rebel army on the sixth and held it at bay until near night and night alone closed the conflict and not the three regiments of Nelson s division The Confederates fought with courage at Shiloh but the particular skill claimed I could not and still cannot see though there is nothing to criticise except the claims put forward for it since But the Confederate claimants for superiority in strategy superiority in generalship and superiority in dash and prowess are not so unjust to the Union troops engaged at Shiloh as are many Northern writers The troops on both sides were American and united they need not fear any foreign foe It is possible that the Southern man started in with a little more dash than his Northern brother but he was correspondingly less enduring The endeavor of the enemy on the first day was simply to hurl their men against ours first at one point then at another sometimes at several points at once This they did with daring and energy until at night the rebel troops were worn out Our effort during the same time was to be prepared to resist assaults wherever made The object of the Confederates on the second day was to get away with as much of their army and material as possible Ours then was to drive them from our front and to capture or destroy as great a part as possible of their men and material We were successful in driving them back but not so successful in captures as if farther pursuit could have been made As it was we captured or recaptured on the second day about as much artillery as we lost on the first and leaving out the one great capture of Prentiss we took more prisoners on Monday than the enemy gained from us on Sunday On the sixth Sherman lost seven pieces of artillery McClernand six Prentiss eight and Hurlbut two batteries On the seventh Sherman captured seven guns McClernand three and the Army of the Ohio twenty At Shiloh the effective strength of the Union forces on the morning of the sixth was thirty three thousand men Lew Wallace brought five thousand more after nightfall Beauregard reported the enemy s strength at forty thousand nine hundred fifty five According to the custom of enumeration in the South this number probably excluded every man enlisted as musician or detailed as guard or nurse and all commissioned officers everybody who did not carry a musket or serve a cannon With us everybody in the field receiving pay from the government is counted Excluding the troops who fled panic stricken before they had fired a shot there was not a time during the sixth when we had more than twenty five thousand men in line On the seventh Buell brought twenty thousand more Of his remaining two divisions Thomas s did not reach the field during the engagement Wood s arrived before firing had ceased but not in time to be of much service Our loss in the two days fight was seventeen fifty four killed eight thousand four hundred eight wounded and twenty eight eighty five missing Of these twenty one oh three were in the Army of the Ohio Beauregard reported a total loss of ten thousand six hundred ninety nine of whom seventeen twenty eight were killed eight thousand twelve wounded and nine hundred fifty seven missing This estimate must be incorrect We buried by actual count more of the enemy s dead in front of the divisions of McClernand and Sherman alone than here reported and four thousand was the estimate of the burial parties of the whole field Beauregard reports the Confederate force on the sixth at over forty thousand and their total loss during the two days at ten thousand six hundred ninety nine and at the same time declares that he could put only twenty thousand men in battle on the morning of the seventh The navy gave a hearty support to the army at Shiloh as indeed it always did both before and subsequently when I was in command The nature of the ground was such however that on this occasion it could do nothing in aid of the troops until sundown on the first day The country was broken and heavily timbered cutting off all view of the battle from the river so that friends would be as much in danger from fire from the gunboats as the foe But about sundown when the National troops were back in their last position the right of the enemy was near the river and exposed to the fire of the two gun boats which was delivered with vigor and effect After nightfall when firing had entirely ceased on land the commander of the fleet informed himself approximately of the position of our troops and suggested the idea of dropping a shell within the lines of the enemy every fifteen minutes during the night This was done with effect as is proved by the Confederate reports Up to the battle of Shiloh I as well as thousands of other citizens believed that the rebellion against the Government would collapse suddenly and soon if a decisive victory could be gained over any of its armies Donelson and Henry were such victories An army of more than twenty one thousand men was captured or destroyed Bowling Green Columbus and Hickman Kentucky fell in consequence and Clarksville and Nashville Tennessee the last two with an immense amount of stores also fell into our hands The Tennessee and Cumberland rivers from their mouths to the head of navigation were secured But when Confederate armies were collected which not only attempted to hold a line farther south from Memphis to Chattanooga Knoxville and on to the Atlantic but assumed the offensive and made such a gallant effort to regain what had been lost then indeed I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest Up to that time it had been the policy of our army certainly of that portion commanded by me to protect the property of the citizens whose territory was invaded without regard to their sentiments whether Union or Secession After this however I regarded it as humane to both sides to protect the persons of those found at their homes but to consume everything that could be used to support or supply armies Protection was still continued over such supplies as were within lines held by us and which we expected to continue to hold but such supplies within the reach of Confederate armies I regarded as much contraband as arms or ordnance stores Their destruction was accomplished without bloodshed and tended to the same result as the destruction of armies I continued this policy to the close of the war Promiscuous pillaging however was discouraged and punished Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage under the direction of commissioned officers who should give receipts to owners if at home and turn the property over to officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be issued as if furnished from our Northern depots But much was destroyed without receipts to owners when it could not be brought within our lines and would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end The battle of Shiloh or Pittsburg landing has been perhaps less understood or to state the case more accurately more persistently misunderstood than any other engagement between National and Confederate troops during the entire rebellion Correct reports of the battle have been published notably by Sherman Badeau and in a speech before a meeting of veterans by General Prentiss but all of these appeared long subsequent to the close of the rebellion and after public opinion had been most erroneously formed I myself made no report to General Halleck further than was contained in a letter written immediately after the battle informing him that an engagement had been fought and announcing the result A few days afterwards General Halleck moved his headquarters to Pittsburg landing and assumed command of the troops in the field Although next to him in rank and nominally in command of my old district and army I was ignored as much as if I had been at the most distant point of territory within my jurisdiction and although I was in command of all the troops engaged at Shiloh I was not permitted to see one of the reports of General Buell or his subordinates in that battle until they were published by the War Department long after the event For this reason I never made a full official report of this engagement CHAPTER XXVI HALLECK ASSUMES COMMAND IN THE FIELD THE ADVANCE UPON CORINTH OCCUPATION OF CORINTH THE ARMY SEPARATED General Halleck arrived at Pittsburg landing on the eleventh of April and immediately assumed command in the field On the twenty first General Pope arrived with an army thirty thousand strong fresh from the capture of Island Number Ten in the Mississippi River He went into camp at Hamburg landing five miles above Pittsburg Halleck had now three armies the Army of the Ohio Buell commanding the Army of the Mississippi Pope commanding and the Army of the Tennessee His orders divided the combined force into the right wing reserve centre and left wing Major General George H Thomas who had been in Buell s army was transferred with his division to the Army of the Tennessee and given command of the right wing composed of all of that army except McClernand s and Lew Wallace s divisions McClernand was assigned to the command of the reserve composed of his own and Lew Wallace s divisions Buell commanded the centre the Army of the Ohio and Pope the left wing the Army of the Mississippi I was named second in command of the whole and was also supposed to be in command of the right wing and reserve Orders were given to all the commanders engaged at Shiloh to send in their reports without delay to department headquarters Those from officers of the Army of the Tennessee were sent through me but from the Army of the Ohio they were sent by General Buell without passing through my hands General Halleck ordered me verbally to send in my report but I positively declined on the ground that he had received the reports of a part of the army engaged at Shiloh without their coming through me He admitted that my refusal was justifiable under the circumstances but explained that he had wanted to get the reports off before moving the command and as fast as a report had come to him he had forwarded it to Washington Preparations were at once made upon the arrival of the new commander for an advance on Corinth Owl Creek on our right was bridged and expeditions were sent to the north west and west to ascertain if our position was being threatened from those quarters the roads towards Corinth were corduroyed and new ones made lateral roads were also constructed so that in case of necessity troops marching by different routes could reinforce each other All commanders were cautioned against bringing on an engagement and informed in so many words that it would be better to retreat than to fight By the thirtieth of April all preparations were complete the country west to the Mobile and Ohio railroad had been reconnoitred as well as the road to Corinth as far as Monterey twelve miles from Pittsburg Everywhere small bodies of the enemy had been encountered but they were observers and not in force to fight battles Corinth Mississippi lies in a south westerly direction from Pittsburg landing and about nineteen miles away as the bird would fly but probably twenty two by the nearest wagon road It is about four miles south of the line dividing the States of Tennessee and Mississippi and at the junction of the Mississippi and Chattanooga railroad with the Mobile and Ohio road which runs from Columbus to Mobile From Pittsburg to Corinth the land is rolling but at no point reaching an elevation that makes high hills to pass over In eighteen sixty two the greater part of the country was covered with forest with intervening clearings and houses Underbrush was dense in the low grounds along the creeks and ravines but generally not so thick on the high land as to prevent men passing through with ease There are two small creeks running from north of the town and connecting some four miles south where they form Bridge Creek which empties into the Tuscumbia River Corinth is on the ridge between these streams and is a naturally strong defensive position The creeks are insignificant in volume of water but the stream to the east widens out in front of the town into a swamp impassable in the presence of an enemy On the crest of the west bank of this stream the enemy was strongly intrenched Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold and consequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of We ought to have seized it immediately after the fall of Donelson and Nashville when it could have been taken without a battle but failing then it should have been taken without delay on the concentration of troops at Pittsburg landing after the battle of Shiloh In fact the arrival of Pope should not have been awaited There was no time from the battle of Shiloh up to the evacuation of Corinth when the enemy would not have left if pushed The demoralization among the Confederates from their defeats at Henry and Donelson their long marches from Bowling Green Columbus and Nashville and their failure at Shiloh in fact from having been driven out of Kentucky and Tennessee was so great that a stand for the time would have been impossible Beauregard made strenuous efforts to reinforce himself and partially succeeded He appealed to the people of the South west for new regiments and received a few A S Johnston had made efforts to reinforce in the same quarter before the battle of Shiloh but in a different way He had negroes sent out to him to take the place of teamsters company cooks and laborers in every capacity so as to put all his white men into the ranks The people while willing to send their sons to the field were not willing to part with their negroes It is only fair to state that they probably wanted their blacks to raise supplies for the army and for the families left at home Beauregard however was reinforced by Van Dorn immediately after Shiloh with seventeen thousand men Interior points less exposed were also depleted to add to the strength at Corinth With these reinforcements and the new regiments Beauregard had during the month of May eighteen sixty two a large force on paper but probably not much over fifty thousand effective men We estimated his strength at seventy thousand Our own was in round numbers one hundred twenty thousand The defensible nature of the ground at Corinth and the fortifications made fifty thousand then enough to maintain their position against double that number for an indefinite time but for the demoralization spoken of On the thirtieth of April the grand army commenced its advance from Shiloh upon Corinth The movement was a siege from the start to the close The National troops were always behind intrenchments except of course the small reconnoitring parties sent to the front to clear the way for an advance Even the commanders of these parties were cautioned not to bring on an engagement It is better to retreat than to fight The enemy were constantly watching our advance but as they were simply observers there were but few engagements that even threatened to become battles All the engagements fought ought to have served to encourage the enemy Roads were again made in our front and again corduroyed a line was intrenched and the troops were advanced to the new position Cross roads were constructed to these new positions to enable the troops to concentrate in case of attack The National armies were thoroughly intrenched all the way from the Tennessee River to Corinth For myself I was little more than an observer Orders were sent direct to the right wing or reserve ignoring me and advances were made from one line of intrenchments to another without notifying me My position was so embarrassing in fact that I made several applications during the siege to be relieved General Halleck kept his headquarters generally if not all the time with the right wing Pope being on the extreme left did not see so much of his chief and consequently got loose as it were at times On the threed of May he was at Seven Mile Creek with the main body of his command but threw forward a division to Farmington within four miles of Corinth His troops had quite a little engagement at Farmington on that day but carried the place with considerable loss to the enemy There would then have been no difficulty in advancing the centre and right so as to form a new line well up to the enemy but Pope was ordered back to conform with the general line On the eighth of May he moved again taking his whole force to Farmington and pushed out two divisions close to the rebel line Again he was ordered back By the fourth of May the centre and right wing reached Monterey twelve miles out Their advance was slow from there for they intrenched with every forward movement The left wing moved up again on the twenty fifth of May and intrenched itself close to the enemy The creek with the marsh before described separated the two lines Skirmishers thirty feet apart could have maintained either line at this point Our centre and right were at this time extended so that the right of the right wing was probably five miles from Corinth and four from the works in their front The creek which was a formidable obstacle for either side to pass on our left became a very slight obstacle on our right Here the enemy occupied two positions One of them as much as two miles out from his main line was on a commanding elevation and defended by an intrenched battery with infantry supports A heavy wood intervened between this work and the National forces In rear to the south there was a clearing extending a mile or more and south of this clearing a log house which had been loop holed and was occupied by infantry Sherman s division carried these two positions with some loss to himself but with probably greater to the enemy on the twenty eighth of May and on that day the investment of Corinth was complete or as complete as it was ever made Thomas right now rested west of the Mobile and Ohio railroad Pope s left commanded the Memphis and Charleston railroad east of Corinth Some days before I had suggested to the commanding general that I thought if he would move the Army of the Mississippi at night by the rear of the centre and right ready to advance at daylight Pope would find no natural obstacle in his front and I believed no serious artificial one The ground or works occupied by our left could be held by a thin picket line owing to the stream and swamp in front To the right the troops would have a dry ridge to march over I was silenced so quickly that I felt that possibly I had suggested an unmilitary movement Later probably on the twenty eighth of May General Logan whose command was then on the Mobile and Ohio railroad said to me that the enemy had been evacuating for several days and that if allowed he could go into Corinth with his brigade Trains of cars were heard coming in and going out of Corinth constantly Some of the men who had been engaged in various capacities on railroads before the war claimed that they could tell by putting their ears to the rail not only which way the trains were moving but which trains were loaded and which were empty They said loaded trains had been going out for several days and empty ones coming in Subsequent events proved the correctness of their judgment Beauregard published his orders for the evacuation of Corinth on the twenty sixth of May and fixed the twenty ninth for the departure of his troops and on the thirtieth of May General Halleck had his whole army drawn up prepared for battle and announced in orders that there was every indication that our left was to be attacked that morning Corinth had already been evacuated and the National troops marched on and took possession without opposition Everything had been destroyed or carried away The Confederate commander had instructed his soldiers to cheer on the arrival of every train to create the impression among the Yankees that reinforcements were arriving There was not a sick or wounded man left by the Confederates nor stores of any kind Some ammunition had been blown up not removed but the trophies of war were a few Quaker guns logs of about the diameter of ordinary cannon mounted on wheels of wagons and pointed in the most threatening manner towards us The possession of Corinth by the National troops was of strategic importance but the victory was barren in every other particular It was nearly bloodless It is a question whether the MORALE of the Confederate troops engaged at Corinth was not improved by the immunity with which they were permitted to remove all public property and then withdraw themselves On our side I know officers and men of the Army of the Tennessee and I presume the same is true of those of the other commands were disappointed at the result They could not see how the mere occupation of places was to close the war while large and effective rebel armies existed They believed that a well directed attack would at least have partially destroyed the army defending Corinth For myself I am satisfied that Corinth could have been captured in a two days campaign commenced promptly on the arrival of reinforcements after the battle of Shiloh General Halleck at once commenced erecting fortifications around Corinth on a scale to indicate that this one point must be held if it took the whole National army to do it All commanding points two or three miles to the south south east and south west were strongly fortified It was expected in case of necessity to connect these forts by rifle pits They were laid out on a scale that would have required one hundred thousand men to fully man them It was probably thought that a final battle of the war would be fought at that point These fortifications were never used Immediately after the occupation of Corinth by the National troops General Pope was sent in pursuit of the retreating garrison and General Buell soon followed Buell was the senior of the two generals and commanded the entire column The pursuit was kept up for some thirty miles but did not result in the capture of any material of war or prisoners unless a few stragglers who had fallen behind and were willing captives On the tenth of June the pursuing column was all back at Corinth The Army of the Tennessee was not engaged in any of these movements The Confederates were now driven out of West Tennessee and on the sixth of June after a well contested naval battle the National forces took possession of Memphis and held the Mississippi river from its source to that point The railroad from Columbus to Corinth was at once put in good condition and held by us We had garrisons at Donelson Clarksville and Nashville on the Cumberland River and held the Tennessee River from its mouth to Eastport New Orleans and Baton Rouge had fallen into the possession of the National forces so that now the Confederates at the west were narrowed down for all communication with Richmond to the single line of road running east from Vicksburg To dispossess them of this therefore became a matter of the first importance The possession of the Mississippi by us from Memphis to Baton Rouge was also a most important object It would be equal to the amputation of a limb in its weakening effects upon the enemy After the capture of Corinth a movable force of eighty thousand men besides enough to hold all the territory acquired could have been set in motion for the accomplishment of any great campaign for the suppression of the rebellion In addition to this fresh troops were being raised to swell the effective force But the work of depletion commenced Buell with the Army of the Ohio was sent east following the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad This he was ordered to repair as he advanced only to have it destroyed by small guerilla bands or other troops as soon as he was out of the way If he had been sent directly to Chattanooga as rapidly as he could march leaving two or three divisions along the line of the railroad from Nashville forward he could have arrived with but little fighting and would have saved much of the loss of life which was afterwards incurred in gaining Chattanooga Bragg would then not have had time to raise an army to contest the possession of middle and east Tennessee and Kentucky the battles of Stone River and Chickamauga would not necessarily have been fought Burnside would not have been besieged in Knoxville without the power of helping himself or escaping the battle of Chattanooga would not have been fought These are the negative advantages if the term negative is applicable which would probably have resulted from prompt movements after Corinth fell into the possession of the National forces The positive results might have been a bloodless advance to Atlanta to Vicksburg or to any other desired point south of Corinth in the interior of Mississippi CHAPTER XXVII HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO MEMPHIS ON THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS ESCAPING JACKSON COMPLAINTS AND REQUESTS HALLECK APPOINTED COMMANDER IN CHIEF RETURN TO CORINTH MOVEMENTS OF BRAGG SURRENDER OF CLARKSVILLE THE ADVANCE UPON CHATTANOOGA SHERIDAN COLONEL OF A MICHIGAN REGIMENT My position at Corinth with a nominal command and yet no command became so unbearable that I asked permission of Halleck to remove my headquarters to Memphis I had repeatedly asked between the fall of Donelson and the evacuation of Corinth to be relieved from duty under Halleck but all my applications were refused until the occupation of the town I then obtained permission to leave the department but General Sherman happened to call on me as I was about starting and urged me so strongly not to think of going that I concluded to remain My application to be permitted to remove my headquarters to Memphis was however approved and on the twenty first of June I started for that point with my staff and a cavalry escort of only a part of one company There was a detachment of two or three companies going some twenty five miles west to be stationed as a guard to the railroad I went under cover of this escort to the end of their march and the next morning proceeded to La Grange with no convoy but the few cavalry men I had with me From La Grange to Memphis the distance is forty seven miles There were no troops stationed between these two points except a small force guarding a working party which was engaged in repairing the railroad Not knowing where this party would be found I halted at La Grange General Hurlbut was in command there at the time and had his headquarters tents pitched on the lawn of a very commodious country house The proprietor was at home and learning of my arrival he invited General Hurlbut and me to dine with him I accepted the invitation and spent a very pleasant afternoon with my host who was a thorough Southern gentleman fully convinced of the justice of secession After dinner seated in the capacious porch he entertained me with a recital of the services he was rendering the cause He was too old to be in the ranks himself he must have been quite seventy then but his means enabled him to be useful in other ways In ordinary times the homestead where he was now living produced the bread and meat to supply the slaves on his main plantation in the low lands of Mississippi Now he raised food and forage on both places and thought he would have that year a surplus sufficient to feed three hundred families of poor men who had gone into the war and left their families dependent upon the patriotism of those better off The crops around me looked fine and I had at the moment an idea that about the time they were ready to be gathered the Yankee troops would be in the neighborhood and harvest them for the benefit of those engaged in the suppression of the rebellion instead of its support I felt however the greatest respect for the candor of my host and for his zeal in a cause he thoroughly believed in though our views were as wide apart as it is possible to conceive The twenty threed of June eighteen sixty two on the road from La Grange to Memphis was very warm even for that latitude and season With my staff and small escort I started at an early hour and before noon we arrived within twenty miles of Memphis At this point I saw a very comfortable looking white haired gentleman seated at the front of his house a little distance from the road I let my staff and escort ride ahead while I halted and for an excuse asked for a glass of water I was invited at once to dismount and come in I found my host very genial and communicative and staid longer than I had intended until the lady of the house announced dinner and asked me to join them The host however was not pressing so that I declined the invitation and mounting my horse rode on About a mile west from where I had been stopping a road comes up from the southeast joining that from La Grange to Memphis A mile west of this junction I found my staff and escort halted and enjoying the shade of forest trees on the lawn of a house located several hundred feet back from the road their horses hitched to the fence along the line of the road I too stopped and we remained there until the cool of the afternoon and then rode into Memphis The gentleman with whom I had stopped twenty miles from Memphis was a mister De Loche a man loyal to the Union He had not pressed me to tarry longer with him because in the early part of my visit a neighbor a doctor Smith had called and on being presented to me backed off the porch as if something had hit him mister De Loche knew that the rebel General Jackson was in that neighborhood with a detachment of cavalry His neighbor was as earnest in the southern cause as was mister De Loche in that of the Union The exact location of Jackson was entirely unknown to mister De Loche but he was sure that his neighbor would know it and would give information of my presence and this made my stay unpleasant to him after the call of doctor Smith I have stated that a detachment of troops was engaged in guarding workmen who were repairing the railroad east of Memphis On the day I entered Memphis Jackson captured a small herd of beef cattle which had been sent east for the troops so engaged The drovers were not enlisted men and he released them A day or two after one of these drovers came to my headquarters and relating the circumstances of his capture said Jackson was very much disappointed that he had not captured me that he was six or seven miles south of the Memphis and Charleston railroad when he learned that I was stopping at the house of mister De Loche and had ridden with his command to the junction of the road he was on with that from La Grange and Memphis where he learned that I had passed three quarters of an hour before He thought it would be useless to pursue with jaded horses a well mounted party with so much of a start Had he gone three quarters of a mile farther he would have found me with my party quietly resting under the shade of trees and without even arms in our hands with which to defend ourselves General Jackson of course did not communicate his disappointment at not capturing me to a prisoner a young drover but from the talk among the soldiers the facts related were learned A day or two later mister De Loche called on me in Memphis to apologize for his apparent incivility in not insisting on my staying for dinner He said that his wife accused him of marked discourtesy but that after the call of his neighbor he had felt restless until I got away I never met General Jackson before the war nor during it but have met him since at his very comfortable summer home at Manitou Springs Colorado I reminded him of the above incident and this drew from him the response that he was thankful now he had not captured me I certainly was very thankful too My occupation of Memphis as district headquarters did not last long The period however was marked by a few incidents which were novel to me Up to that time I had not occupied any place in the South where the citizens were at home in any great numbers Dover was within the fortifications at Fort Donelson and as far as I remember every citizen was gone There were no people living at Pittsburg landing and but very few at Corinth Memphis however was a populous city and there were many of the citizens remaining there who were not only thoroughly impressed with the justice of their cause but who thought that even the Yankee soldiery must entertain the same views if they could only be induced to make an honest confession It took hours of my time every day to listen to complaints and requests The latter were generally reasonable and if so they were granted but the complaints were not always or even often well founded Two instances will mark the general character First the officer who commanded at Memphis immediately after the city fell into the hands of the National troops had ordered one of the churches of the city to be opened to the soldiers Army chaplains were authorized to occupy the pulpit Second at the beginning of the war the Confederate Congress had passed a law confiscating all property of alien enemies at the South including the debts of Southerners to Northern men In consequence of this law when Memphis was occupied the provost marshal had forcibly collected all the evidences he could obtain of such debts Almost the first complaints made to me were these two outrages The gentleman who made the complaints informed me first of his own high standing as a lawyer a citizen and a Christian He was a deacon in the church which had been defiled by the occupation of Union troops and by a Union chaplain filling the pulpit He did not use the word defile but he expressed the idea very clearly He asked that the church be restored to the former congregation I told him that no order had been issued prohibiting the congregation attending the church He said of course the congregation could not hear a Northern clergyman who differed so radically with them on questions of government I told him the troops would continue to occupy that church for the present and that they would not be called upon to hear disloyal sentiments proclaimed from the pulpit This closed the argument on the first point Then came the second The complainant said that he wanted the papers restored to him which had been surrendered to the provost marshal under protest he was a lawyer and before the establishment of the Confederate States Government had been the attorney for a number of large business houses at the North that his government had confiscated all debts due alien enemies and appointed commissioners or officers to collect such debts and pay them over to the government but in his case owing to his high standing he had been permitted to hold these claims for collection the responsible officials knowing that he would account to the government for every dollar received He said that his government when it came in possession of all its territory would hold him personally responsible for the claims he had surrendered to the provost marshal His impudence was so sublime that I was rather amused than indignant I told him however that if he would remain in Memphis I did not believe the Confederate government would ever molest him He left no doubt as much amazed at my assurance as I was at the brazenness of his request On the eleventh of July General Halleck received telegraphic orders appointing him to the command of all the armies with headquarters in Washington His instructions pressed him to proceed to his new field of duty with as little delay as was consistent with the safety and interests of his previous command I was next in rank and he telegraphed me the same day to report at department headquarters at Corinth I was not informed by the dispatch that my chief had been ordered to a different field and did not know whether to move my headquarters or not I telegraphed asking if I was to take my staff with me and received word in reply This place will be your headquarters You can judge for yourself I left Memphis for my new field without delay and reached Corinth on the fifteenth of the month General Halleck remained until the seventeenth of July but he was very uncommunicative and gave me no information as to what I had been called to Corinth for When General Halleck left to assume the duties of general in chief I remained in command of the district of West Tennessee Practically I became a department commander because no one was assigned to that position over me and I made my reports direct to the general in chief but I was not assigned to the position of department commander until the twenty fifth of October General Halleck while commanding the Department of the Mississippi had had control as far east as a line drawn from Chattanooga north My district only embraced West Tennessee and Kentucky west of the Cumberland River Buell with the Army of the Ohio had as previously stated been ordered east towards Chattanooga with instructions to repair the Memphis and Charleston railroad as he advanced Troops had been sent north by Halleck along the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad to put it in repair as far as Columbus Other troops were stationed on the railroad from Jackson Tennessee to Grand Junction and still others on the road west to Memphis The remainder of the magnificent army of one hundred twenty thousand men which entered Corinth on the thirtieth of May had now become so scattered that I was put entirely on the defensive in a territory whose population was hostile to the Union One of the first things I had to do was to construct fortifications at Corinth better suited to the garrison that could be spared to man them The structures that had been built during the months of May and June were left as monuments to the skill of the engineer and others were constructed in a few days plainer in design but suited to the command available to defend them I disposed the troops belonging to the district in conformity with the situation as rapidly as possible The forces at Donelson Clarksville and Nashville with those at Corinth and along the railroad eastward I regarded as sufficient for protection against any attack from the west The Mobile and Ohio railroad was guarded from Rienzi south of Corinth to Columbus and the Mississippi Central railroad from Jackson Tennessee to Bolivar Grand Junction and La Grange on the Memphis railroad were abandoned South of the Army of the Tennessee and confronting it was Van Dorn with a sufficient force to organize a movable army of thirty five to forty thousand men after being reinforced by Price from Missouri This movable force could be thrown against either Corinth Bolivar or Memphis and the best that could be done in such event would be to weaken the points not threatened in order to reinforce the one that was Nothing could be gained on the National side by attacking elsewhere because the territory already occupied was as much as the force present could guard The most anxious period of the war to me was during the time the Army of the Tennessee was guarding the territory acquired by the fall of Corinth and Memphis and before I was sufficiently reinforced to take the offensive The enemy also had cavalry operating in our rear making it necessary to guard every point of the railroad back to Columbus on the security of which we were dependent for all our supplies Headquarters were connected by telegraph with all points of the command except Memphis and the Mississippi below Columbus With these points communication was had by the railroad to Columbus then down the river by boat To reinforce Memphis would take three or four days and to get an order there for troops to move elsewhere would have taken at least two days Memphis therefore was practically isolated from the balance of the command But it was in Sherman s hands Then too the troops were well intrenched and the gunboats made a valuable auxiliary During the two months after the departure of General Halleck there was much fighting between small bodies of the contending armies but these encounters were dwarfed by the magnitude of the main battles so as to be now almost forgotten except by those engaged in them Some of them however estimated by the losses on both sides in killed and wounded were equal in hard fighting to most of the battles of the Mexican war which attracted so much of the attention of the public when they occurred About the twenty threed of July Colonel Ross commanding at Bolivar was threatened by a large force of the enemy so that he had to be reinforced from Jackson and Corinth On the twenty seventh there was skirmishing on the Hatchie River eight miles from Bolivar On the thirtieth I learned from Colonel P H Sheridan who had been far to the south that Bragg in person was at Rome Georgia with his troops moving by rail by way of Mobile to Chattanooga and his wagon train marching overland to join him at Rome Price was at this time at Holly Springs Mississippi with a large force and occupied Grand Junction as an outpost I proposed to the general in chief to be permitted to drive him away but was informed that while I had to judge for myself the best use to make of my troops WAS NOT TO SCATTER THEM but hold them ready to reinforce Buell The movement of Bragg himself with his wagon trains to Chattanooga across country while his troops were transported over a long round about road to the same destination without need of guards except when in my immediate front demonstrates the advantage which troops enjoy while acting in a country where the people are friendly Buell was marching through a hostile region and had to have his communications thoroughly guarded back to a base of supplies More men were required the farther the National troops penetrated into the enemy s country I with an army sufficiently powerful to have destroyed Bragg was purely on the defensive and accomplishing no more than to hold a force far inferior to my own On the twod of August I was ordered from Washington to live upon the country on the resources of citizens hostile to the government so far as practicable I was also directed to handle rebels within our lines without gloves to imprison them or to expel them from their homes and from our lines I do not recollect having arrested and confined a citizen not a soldier during the entire rebellion I am aware that a great many were sent to northern prisons particularly to Joliet Illinois by some of my subordinates with the statement that it was my order I had all such released the moment I learned of their arrest and finally sent a staff officer north to release every prisoner who was said to be confined by my order There were many citizens at home who deserved punishment because they were soldiers when an opportunity was afforded to inflict an injury to the National cause This class was not of the kind that were apt to get arrested and I deemed it better that a few guilty men should escape than that a great many innocent ones should suffer On the fourteenth of August I was ordered to send two more divisions to Buell They were sent the same day by way of Decatur On the twenty twod Colonel Rodney Mason surrendered Clarksville with six companies of his regiment Colonel Mason was one of the officers who had led their regiments off the field at almost the first fire of the rebels at Shiloh He was by nature and education a gentleman and was terribly mortified at his action when the battle was over He came to me with tears in his eyes and begged to be allowed to have another trial I felt great sympathy for him and sent him with his regiment to garrison Clarksville and Donelson He selected Clarksville for his headquarters no doubt because he regarded it as the post of danger it being nearer the enemy But when he was summoned to surrender by a band of guerillas his constitutional weakness overcame him He inquired the number of men the enemy had and receiving a response indicating a force greater than his own he said if he could be satisfied of that fact he would surrender Arrangements were made for him to count the guerillas and having satisfied himself that the enemy had the greater force he surrendered and informed his subordinate at Donelson of the fact advising him to do the same The guerillas paroled their prisoners and moved upon Donelson but the officer in command at that point marched out to meet them and drove them away Among other embarrassments at the time of which I now write was the fact that the government wanted to get out all the cotton possible from the South and directed me to give every facility toward that end Pay in gold was authorized and stations on the Mississippi River and on the railroad in our possession had to be designated where cotton would be received This opened to the enemy not only the means of converting cotton into money which had a value all over the world and which they so much needed but it afforded them means of obtaining accurate and intelligent information in regard to our position and strength It was also demoralizing to the troops Citizens obtaining permits from the treasury department had to be protected within our lines and given facilities to get out cotton by which they realized enormous profits Men who had enlisted to fight the battles of their country did not like to be engaged in protecting a traffic which went to the support of an enemy they had to fight and the profits of which went to men who shared none of their dangers On the thirtieth of August Colonel M D Leggett near Bolivar with the twentieth and twenty ninth Ohio volunteer infantry was attacked by a force supposed to be about four thousand strong The enemy was driven away with a loss of more than one hundred men On the first of September the bridge guard at Medon was attacked by guerillas The guard held the position until reinforced when the enemy were routed leaving about fifty of their number on the field dead or wounded our loss being only two killed and fifteen wounded On the same day Colonel Dennis with a force of less than five hundred infantry and two pieces of artillery met the cavalry of the enemy in strong force a few miles west of Medon and drove them away with great loss Our troops buried one hundred seventy nine of the enemy s dead left upon the field Afterwards it was found that all the houses in the vicinity of the battlefield were turned into hospitals for the wounded Our loss as reported at the time was forty five killed and wounded On the twod of September I was ordered to send more reinforcements to Buell Jackson and Bolivar were yet threatened but I sent the reinforcements On the fourth I received direct orders to send Granger s division also to Louisville Kentucky General Buell had left Corinth about the tenth of June to march upon Chattanooga Bragg who had superseded Beauregard in command sent one division from Tupelo on the twenty seventh of June for the same place This gave Buell about seventeen days start If he had not been required to repair the railroad as he advanced the march could have been made in eighteen days at the outside and Chattanooga must have been reached by the National forces before the rebels could have possibly got there The road between Nashville and Chattanooga could easily have been put in repair by other troops so that communication with the North would have been opened in a short time after the occupation of the place by the National troops If Buell had been permitted to move in the first instance with the whole of the Army of the Ohio and that portion of the Army of the Mississippi afterwards sent to him he could have thrown four divisions from his own command along the line of road to repair and guard it Granger s division was promptly sent on the fourth of September I was at the station at Corinth when the troops reached that point and found General P H Sheridan with them I expressed surprise at seeing him and said that I had not expected him to go He showed decided disappointment at the prospect of being detained I felt a little nettled at his desire to get away and did not detain him Sheridan was a first lieutenant in the regiment in which I had served eleven years the fourth infantry and stationed on the Pacific coast when the war broke out He was promoted to a captaincy in May eighteen sixty one and before the close of the year managed in some way I do not know how to get East He went to Missouri Halleck had known him as a very successful young officer in managing campaigns against the Indians on the Pacific coast and appointed him acting quartermaster in south west Missouri There was no difficulty in getting supplies forward while Sheridan served in that capacity but he got into difficulty with his immediate superiors because of his stringent rules for preventing the use of public transportation for private purposes He asked to be relieved from further duty in the capacity in which he was engaged and his request was granted When General Halleck took the field in April eighteen sixty two Sheridan was assigned to duty on his staff During the advance on Corinth a vacancy occurred in the colonelcy of the twod Michigan cavalry Governor Blair of Michigan telegraphed General Halleck asking him to suggest the name of a professional soldier for the vacancy saying he would appoint a good man without reference to his State Sheridan was named and was so conspicuously efficient that when Corinth was reached he was assigned to command a cavalry brigade in the Army of the Mississippi He was in command at Booneville on the first of July with two small regiments when he was attacked by a force full three times as numerous as his own By very skilful manoeuvres and boldness of attack he completely routed the enemy For this he was made a brigadier general and became a conspicuous figure in the army about Corinth On this account I was sorry to see him leaving me His departure was probably fortunate for he rendered distinguished services in his new field Granger and Sheridan reached Louisville before Buell got there and on the night of their arrival Sheridan with his command threw up works around the railroad station for the defence of troops as they came from the front CHAPTER XXVIII ADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE PRICE ENTERS IUKA BATTLE OF IUKA At this time September fourth I had two divisions of the Army of the Mississippi stationed at Corinth Rienzi Jacinto and Danville There were at Corinth also Davies division and two brigades of McArthur s besides cavalry and artillery This force constituted my left wing of which Rosecrans was in command General Ord commanded the centre from Bethel to Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson to Bolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie River General Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with two of his brigades back at Brownsville at the crossing of the Hatchie River by the Memphis and Ohio railroad This made the most convenient arrangement I could devise for concentrating all my spare forces upon any threatened point All the troops of the command were within telegraphic communication of each other except those under Sherman By bringing a portion of his command to Brownsville from which point there was a railroad and telegraph back to Memphis communication could be had with that part of my command within a few hours by the use of couriers In case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth by this arrangement all the troops at Bolivar except a small guard could be sent by rail by the way of Jackson in less than twenty four hours while the troops from Brownsville could march up to Bolivar to take their place On the seventh of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and Price apparently upon Corinth One division was brought from Memphis to Bolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from this move of the enemy I was much concerned because my first duty after holding the territory acquired within my command was to prevent further reinforcing of Bragg in Middle Tennessee Already the Army of Northern Virginia had defeated the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland In the Centre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg marching parallel to him with a large Confederate force for the Ohio River I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at this time my entire force numbered less than fifty thousand men of all arms This included everything from Cairo south within my jurisdiction If I too should be driven back the Ohio River would become the line dividing the belligerents west of the Alleghanies while at the East the line was already farther north than when hostilities commenced at the opening of the war It is true Nashville was never given up after its first capture but it would have been isolated and the garrison there would have been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in West Tennessee had been compelled to fall back To say at the end of the second year of the war the line dividing the contestants at the East was pushed north of Maryland a State that had not seceded and at the West beyond Kentucky another State which had been always loyal would have been discouraging indeed As it was many loyal people despaired in the fall of eighteen sixty two of ever saving the Union The administration at Washington was much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear But I believe there was never a day when the President did not think that in some way or other a cause so just as ours would come out triumphant Up to the eleventh of September Rosecrans still had troops on the railroad east of Corinth but they had all been ordered in By the twelfth all were in except a small force under Colonel Murphy of the eighth Wisconsin He had been detained to guard the remainder of the stores which had not yet been brought in to Corinth On the thirteenth of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka a town about twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and Charleston railroad Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding the place He made no resistance but evacuated the town on the approach of the enemy I was apprehensive lest the object of the rebels might be to get troops into Tennessee to reinforce Bragg as it was afterwards ascertained to be The authorities at Washington including the general in chief of the army were very anxious as I have said about affairs both in East and Middle Tennessee and my anxiety was quite as great on their account as for any danger threatening my command I had not force enough at Corinth to attack Price even by stripping everything and there was danger that before troops could be got from other points he might be far on his way across the Tennessee To prevent this all spare forces at Bolivar and Jackson were ordered to Corinth and cars were concentrated at Jackson for their transportation Within twenty four hours from the transmission of the order the troops were at their destination although there had been a delay of four hours resulting from the forward train getting off the track and stopping all the others This gave a reinforcement of near eight thousand men General Ord in command General Rosecrans commanded the district of Corinth with a movable force of about nine thousand independent of the garrison deemed necessary to be left behind It was known that General Van Dorn was about a four days march south of us with a large force It might have been part of his plan to attack at Corinth Price coming from the east while he came up from the south My desire was to attack Price before Van Dorn could reach Corinth or go to his relief General Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka where his command was spread out along the Memphis and Charleston railroad eastward While there he had a most excellent map prepared showing all the roads and streams in the surrounding country He was also personally familiar with the ground so that I deferred very much to him in my plans for the approach We had cars enough to transport all of General Ord s command which was to go by rail to Burnsville a point on the road about seven miles west of Iuka From there his troops were to march by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from the north west while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his position south of Corinth by way of the Jacinto road A small force was to hold the Jacinto road where it turns to the north east while the main force moved on the Fulton road which comes into Iuka further east This plan was suggested by Rosecrans Bear Creek a few miles to the east of the Fulton road is a formidable obstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of bridges all of which in September eighteen sixty two had been destroyed in that vicinity The Tennessee to the north east not many miles away was also a formidable obstacle for an army followed by a pursuing force Ord was on the north west and even if a rebel movement had been possible in that direction it could have brought only temporary relief for it would have carried Price s army to the rear of the National forces and isolated it from all support It looked to me that if Price would remain in Iuka until we could get there his annihilation was inevitable On the morning of the eighteenth of September General Ord moved by rail to Burnsville and there left the cars and moved out to perform his part of the programme He was to get as near the enemy as possible during the day and intrench himself so as to hold his position until the next morning Rosecrans was to be up by the morning of the nineteenth on the two roads before described and the attack was to be from all three quarters simultaneously Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi to detain any cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a sudden dash into Corinth until I could be notified There was a telegraph wire along the railroad so there would be no delay in communication I detained cars and locomotives enough at Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord s command at once and if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of Iuka I could have thrown in reinforcements to the number of seven thousand or eight thousand before he could have arrived I remained at Burnsville with a detachment of about nine hundred men from Ord s command and communicated with my two wings by courier Ord met the advance of the enemy soon after leaving Burnsville Quite a sharp engagement ensued but he drove the rebels back with considerable loss including one general officer killed He maintained his position and was ready to attack by daylight the next morning I was very much disappointed at receiving a dispatch from Rosecrans after midnight from Jacinto twenty two miles from Iuka saying that some of his command had been delayed and that the rear of his column was not yet up as far as Jacinto He said however that he would still be at Iuka by two o clock the next day I did not believe this possible because of the distance and the condition of the roads which was bad besides troops after a forced march of twenty miles are not in a good condition for fighting the moment they get through It might do in marching to relieve a beleaguered garrison but not to make an assault I immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans dispatch and ordered him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound of guns to the south or south east He was instructed to notify his officers to be on the alert for any indications of battle During the nineteenth the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit sound either towards the point where Ord was or to Burnsville where I had remained A couple of hours before dark on the nineteenth Rosecrans arrived with the head of his column at garnets the point where the Jacinto road to Iuka leaves the road going east He here turned north without sending any troops to the Fulton road While still moving in column up the Jacinto road he met a force of the enemy and had his advance badly beaten and driven back upon the main road In this short engagement his loss was considerable for the number engaged and one battery was taken from him The wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to transmit sounds towards either Ord or me Neither he nor I nor any one in either command heard a gun that was fired upon the battle field After the engagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch announcing the result This was brought by a courier There was no road between Burnsville and the position then occupied by Rosecrans and the country was impassable for a man on horseback The courier bearing the message was compelled to move west nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to Burnsville This made it a late hour of the night before I learned of the battle that had taken place during the afternoon I at once notified Ord of the fact and ordered him to attack early in the morning The next morning Rosecrans himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with but little resistance Ord also went in according to orders without hearing a gun from the south of town but supposing the troops coming from the south west must be up by that time Rosecrans however had put no troops upon the Fulton road and the enemy had taken advantage of this neglect and retreated by that road during the night Word was soon brought to me that our troops were in Iuka I immediately rode into town and found that the enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry I ordered pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans command and went on with him a few miles in person He followed only a few miles after I left him and then went into camp and the pursuit was continued no further I was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka but I had so high an opinion of General Rosecrans that I found no fault at the time CHAPTER XXIX VAN DORN S MOVEMENTS BATTLE OF CORINTH COMMAND OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE 
4196-23924-0000	train-other-500	On the nineteenth of September
none	none	 General Geo H Thomas was ordered east 
4196-23924-0001	train-other-500	to reinforce Buell This threw the army at my command still more on the defensive The Memphis and Charleston railroad was abandoned except at Corinth
4196-23924-0002	train-other-500	and small forces were left at Chewalla and Grand Junction Soon afterwards the latter of these two places was given up and Bolivar became our most advanced position on the Mississippi Central railroad
4196-23924-0003	train-other-500	Our cavalry was kept well to the front and frequent expeditions were sent out to watch the movements of the enemy We were in a country where nearly all the people except the negroes
none	none	 were hostile to us and friendly to the cause we were trying to suppress It was easy therefore for the enemy to get early information of our every move 
4196-23924-0004	train-other-500	We on the contrary had to go after our information in force and then often returned without it
none	none	 On the twenty twod 
4196-23924-0005	train-other-500	Bolivar was threatened by a large force from south of Grand Junction supposed to be twenty regiments of infantry with cavalry and artillery I reinforced Bolivar
4196-23924-0006	train-other-500	and went to Jackson in person to superintend the movement of troops to whatever point the attack might be made upon The troops from Corinth were brought up in time to repel the threatened movement without a battle Our cavalry
none	none	 followed the enemy south of Davis mills in Mississippi 
4196-23924-0007	train-other-500	On the thirtieth I found that Van Dorn was apparently endeavoring to strike the Mississippi River above Memphis At the same time other points within my command were so threatened
4196-23924-0008	train-other-500	that it was impossible to concentrate a force to drive him away There was at this juncture a large Union force at Helena Arkansas which had it been within my command
4196-23924-0009	train-other-500	I could have ordered across the river to attack and break up the Mississippi Central railroad far to the south This would not only have called Van Dorn back but would have compelled the retention of a large rebel force
4196-23924-0010	train-other-500	far to the south to prevent a repetition of such raids on the enemy s line of supplies Geographical lines between the commands during the rebellion were not always well chosen
4196-23924-0011	train-other-500	or they were too rigidly adhered to Van Dorn did not attempt to get upon the line above Memphis as had apparently been his intention He was simply covering a deeper design
4196-23924-0012	train-other-500	one much more important to his cause By the first of October it was fully apparent that Corinth was to be attacked with great force and determination
none	none	 and that Van Dorn Lovell Price Villepigue 
4196-23924-0013	train-other-500	and Rust had joined their strength for this purpose There was some skirmishing outside of Corinth
none	none	 with the advance of the enemy on the threed 
4196-23924-0014	train-other-500	The rebels massed in the north west angle
none	none	 of the Memphis and Charleston and the Mobile and Ohio railroads and were thus between the troops at Corinth 
4196-23924-0015	train-other-500	and all possible reinforcements Any fresh troops for us must come by a circuitous route
none	none	 On the night of the threed accordingly I ordered General McPherson who was at Jackson to join Rosecrans at Corinth with reinforcements picked up along the line of the railroad equal to a brigade Hurlbut had been ordered from Bolivar 
4196-23924-0017	train-other-500	to march for the same destination and as Van Dorn was coming upon Corinth from the north west some of his men fell in
none	none	 with the advance of Hurlbut s and some skirmishing ensued on the evening of the threed On the fourth Van Dorn made a dashing attack 
4196-23924-0018	train-other-500	hoping no doubt to capture Rosecrans before his reinforcements could come up In that case the enemy himself could have occupied the defences of Corinth and held at bay all the Union troops that arrived
4196-23924-0019	train-other-500	In fact he could have taken the offensive against the reinforcements with three or four times their number and still left a sufficient garrison in the works about Corinth to hold them He came near success
none	none	 some of his troops penetrating the National lines at least once but the works that were built after Halleck s departure enabled Rosecrans to hold his position until the troops of both McPherson and Hurlbut approached 
4196-23924-0021	train-other-500	towards the rebel front and rear The enemy was finally driven back with great slaughter all their charges made with great gallantry were repulsed The loss on our side was heavy
none	none	 but nothing to compare with Van Dorn s McPherson came up with the train of cars bearing his command as close to the enemy as was prudent debarked on the rebel flank and got in to the support of Rosecrans 
4196-23924-0023	train-other-500	just after the repulse His approach as well as that of Hurlbut was known to the enemy and had a moral effect General Rosecrans however
4196-23924-0024	train-other-500	failed to follow up the victory although I had given specific orders in advance of the battle for him to pursue the moment the enemy was repelled He did not do so and I repeated the order after the battle
4196-23924-0025	train-other-500	In the first order he was notified that the force of four thousand men which was going to his assistance would be in great peril if the enemy was not pursued General Ord
4196-23924-0026	train-other-500	had joined Hurlbut on the fourth and being senior took command of his troops This force encountered the head of Van Dorn s retreating column just as it was crossing the Hatchie
4196-23924-0027	train-other-500	by a bridge some ten miles out from Corinth The bottom land here was swampy and bad for the operations of troops making a good place
none	none	 to get an enemy into Ord attacked the troops that had crossed the bridge and drove them back in a panic Many were killed and others were drowned by being pushed off the bridge in their hurried retreat 
4196-23924-0028	train-other-500	Ord followed and met the main force He was too weak in numbers to assault but he held the bridge and compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another bridge higher up the stream Ord was wounded in this engagement
4196-23924-0029	train-other-500	and the command devolved on Hurlbut Rosecrans did not start in pursuit till the morning of the fifth and then took the wrong road
4196-23924-0030	train-other-500	Moving in the enemy s country he travelled with a wagon train to carry his provisions and munitions of war His march was therefore slower than that of the enemy who was moving towards his supplies
4196-23924-0031	train-other-500	Two or three hours of pursuit on the day of battle without anything except what the men carried on their persons would have been worth more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possibly been
4196-23924-0032	train-other-500	Even when he did start if Rosecrans had followed the route taken by the enemy he would have come upon Van Dorn in a swamp with a stream in front and Ord holding the only bridge
none	none	 but he took the road leading north and towards Chewalla 
4196-23924-0033	train-other-500	instead of west and after having marched as far as the enemy had moved to get to the Hatchie he was as far from battle as when he started Hurlbut had not the numbers to meet any such force as Van Dorn s
4196-23924-0034	train-other-500	if they had been in any mood for fighting and he might have been in great peril I now regarded the time to accomplish anything by pursuit as past and after Rosecrans reached Jonesboro
4196-23924-0035	train-other-500	I ordered him to return He kept on to Ripley however and was persistent in wanting to go farther I thereupon ordered him to halt
none	none	 and submitted the matter to the general in chief 
4196-23924-0036	train-other-500	who allowed me to exercise my judgment in the matter but inquired why not pursue Upon this I ordered Rosecrans back Had he gone much farther he would have met a greater force than Van Dorn had at Corinth
4196-23924-0037	train-other-500	and behind intrenchments or on chosen ground and the probabilities are he would have lost his army The battle of Corinth was bloody
none	none	 our loss being three hundred fifteen killed eighteen twelve wounded and two hundred thirty two missing 
4196-23924-0038	train-other-500	The enemy lost many more
none	none	 Rosecrans reported fourteen twenty three dead and twenty two twenty five prisoners We fought behind breastworks which accounts in some degree for the disparity 
4196-23924-0039	train-other-500	Among the killed on our side was General Hackelman General Oglesby was badly it was for some time supposed mortally wounded I received a congratulatory letter from the President
none	none	 which expressed also his sorrow for the losses This battle was recognized by me as being a decided victory though not so complete as I had hoped for nor nearly so complete as I now think was within the easy grasp of the commanding officer at Corinth Since the war it is known that the result as it was was a crushing blow to the enemy 
4196-23924-0040	train-other-500	and felt by him much more than it was appreciated at the North The battle relieved me
none	none	 from any further anxiety for the safety of the territory within my jurisdiction 
4196-23924-0041	train-other-500	and soon after receiving reinforcements I suggested to the general in chief a forward movement against Vicksburg
none	none	 On the twenty threed of October I learned 
4196-23924-0042	train-other-500	of Pemberton s being in command at Holly Springs and much reinforced by conscripts and troops from Alabama and Texas The same day General Rosecrans was relieved from duty with my command and shortly after
4196-23924-0043	train-other-500	he succeeded Buell in the command of the army in Middle Tennessee I was delighted at the promotion of General Rosecrans to a separate command because I still believed
4196-23924-0044	train-other-500	that when independent of an immediate superior the qualities which I at that time credited him with possessing would show themselves As a subordinate I found that I could not make him do as I wished
4196-23924-0045	train-other-500	and had determined to relieve him from duty that very day At the close of the operations just described my force in round numbers was forty eight thousand five hundred
4196-23924-0046	train-other-500	Of these four thousand eight hundred were in Kentucky and Illinois seven thousand in Memphis nineteen thousand two hundred from Mound City south and seventeen thousand five hundred at Corinth
none	none	 General McClernand had been authorized from Washington to go north 
4196-23924-0047	train-other-500	and organize troops to be used in opening the Mississippi These new levies with other reinforcements now began to come in On the twenty fifth of October I was placed in command of the Department of the Tennessee
none	none	 Reinforcements continued to come from the north and by the twod of November 
4196-23924-0048	train-other-500	I was prepared to take the initiative This was a great relief after the two and a half months of continued defence over a large district of country

VAN DORN CAPTURES HOLLY SPRINGS COLLECTING FORAGE AND FOOD Vicksburg was important to the enemy because it occupied the first high ground coming close to the river below Memphis From there a railroad runs east connecting with other roads leading to all points of the Southern States A railroad also starts from the opposite side of the river extending west as far as Shreveport Louisiana Vicksburg was the only channel at the time of the events of which this chapter treats connecting the parts of the Confederacy divided by the Mississippi So long as it was held by the enemy the free navigation of the river was prevented Hence its importance Points on the river between Vicksburg and Port Hudson were held as dependencies but their fall was sure to follow the capture of the former place The campaign against Vicksburg commenced on the twod of November as indicated in a dispatch to the general in chief in the following words I have commenced a movement on Grand Junction with three divisions from Corinth and two from Bolivar Will leave here Jackson Tennessee to morrow and take command in person If found practicable I will go to Holly Springs and may be Grenada completing railroad and telegraph as I go At this time my command was holding the Mobile and Ohio railroad from about twenty five miles south of Corinth north to Columbus Kentucky the Mississippi Central from Bolivar north to its junction with the Mobile and Ohio the Memphis and Charleston from Corinth east to Bear Creek and the Mississippi River from Cairo to Memphis My entire command was no more than was necessary to hold these lines and hardly that if kept on the defensive By moving against the enemy and into his unsubdued or not yet captured territory driving their army before us these lines would nearly hold themselves thus affording a large force for field operations My moving force at that time was about thirty thousand men and I estimated the enemy confronting me under Pemberton at about the same number General McPherson commanded my left wing and General C S Hamilton the centre while Sherman was at Memphis with the right wing Pemberton was fortified at the Tallahatchie but occupied Holly Springs and Grand Junction on the Mississippi Central railroad On the eighth we occupied Grand Junction and La Grange throwing a considerable force seven or eight miles south along the line of the railroad The road from Bolivar forward was repaired and put in running order as the troops advanced Up to this time it had been regarded as an axiom in war that large bodies of troops must operate from a base of supplies which they always covered and guarded in all forward movements There was delay therefore in repairing the road back and in gathering and forwarding supplies to the front By my orders and in accordance with previous instructions from Washington all the forage within reach was collected under the supervision of the chief quartermaster and the provisions under the chief commissary receipts being given when there was any one to take them the supplies in any event to be accounted for as government stores The stock was bountiful but still it gave me no idea of the possibility of supplying a moving column in an enemy s country from the country itself It was at this point probably where the first idea of a Freedman s Bureau took its origin Orders of the government prohibited the expulsion of the negroes from the protection of the army when they came in voluntarily Humanity forbade allowing them to starve With such an army of them of all ages and both sexes as had congregated about Grand Junction amounting to many thousands it was impossible to advance There was no special authority for feeding them unless they were employed as teamsters cooks and pioneers with the army but only able bodied young men were suitable for such work This labor would support but a very limited percentage of them The plantations were all deserted the cotton and corn were ripe men women and children above ten years of age could be employed in saving these crops To do this work with contrabands or to have it done organization under a competent chief was necessary On inquiring for such a man Chaplain Eaton now and for many years the very able United States Commissioner of Education was suggested He proved as efficient in that field as he has since done in his present one I gave him all the assistants and guards he called for We together fixed the prices to be paid for the negro labor whether rendered to the government or to individuals The cotton was to be picked from abandoned plantations the laborers to receive the stipulated price my recollection is twelve and a half cents per pound for picking and ginning from the quartermaster he shipping the cotton north to be sold for the benefit of the government Citizens remaining on their plantations were allowed the privilege of having their crops saved by freedmen on the same terms At once the freedmen became self sustaining The money was not paid to them directly but was expended judiciously and for their benefit They gave me no trouble afterwards Later the freedmen were engaged in cutting wood along the Mississippi River to supply the large number of steamers on that stream A good price was paid for chopping wood used for the supply of government steamers steamers chartered and which the government had to supply with fuel Those supplying their own fuel paid a much higher price In this way a fund was created not only sufficient to feed and clothe all old and young male and female but to build them comfortable cabins hospitals for the sick and to supply them with many comforts they had never known before At this stage of the campaign against Vicksburg I was very much disturbed by newspaper rumors that General McClernand was to have a separate and independent command within mine to operate against Vicksburg by way of the Mississippi River Two commanders on the same field are always one too many and in this case I did not think the general selected had either the experience or the qualifications to fit him for so important a position I feared for the safety of the troops intrusted to him especially as he was to raise new levies raw troops to execute so important a trust But on the twelfth I received a dispatch from General Halleck saying that I had command of all the troops sent to my department and authorizing me to fight the enemy where I pleased The next day my cavalry was in Holly Springs and the enemy fell back south of the Tallahatchie Holly Springs I selected for my depot of supplies and munitions of war all of which at that time came by rail from Columbus Kentucky except the few stores collected about La Grange and Grand Junction This was a long line increasing in length as we moved south to maintain in an enemy s country On the fifteenth of November while I was still at Holly Springs I sent word to Sherman to meet me at Columbus We were but forty seven miles apart yet the most expeditious way for us to meet was for me to take the rail to Columbus and Sherman a steamer for the same place At that meeting besides talking over my general plans I gave him his orders to join me with two divisions and to march them down the Mississippi Central railroad if he could Sherman who was always prompt was up by the twenty ninth to Cottage Hill ten miles north of Oxford He brought three divisions with him leaving a garrison of only four regiments of infantry a couple of pieces of artillery and a small detachment of cavalry Further reinforcements he knew were on their way from the north to Memphis About this time General Halleck ordered troops from Helena Arkansas territory west of the Mississippi was not under my command then to cut the road in Pemberton s rear The expedition was under Generals Hovey and C C Washburn and was successful so far as reaching the railroad was concerned but the damage done was very slight and was soon repaired The Tallahatchie which confronted me was very high the railroad bridge destroyed and Pemberton strongly fortified on the south side A crossing would have been impossible in the presence of an enemy I sent the cavalry higher up the stream and they secured a crossing This caused the enemy to evacuate their position which was possibly accelerated by the expedition of Hovey and Washburn The enemy was followed as far south as Oxford by the main body of troops and some seventeen miles farther by McPherson s command Here the pursuit was halted to repair the railroad from the Tallahatchie northward in order to bring up supplies The piles on which the railroad bridge rested had been left standing The work of constructing a roadway for the troops was but a short matter and later rails were laid for cars During the delay at Oxford in repairing railroads I learned that an expedition down the Mississippi now was inevitable and desiring to have a competent commander in charge I ordered Sherman on the eighth of December back to Memphis to take charge The following were his orders Headquarters thirteenth Army Corps Department of the Tennessee OXFORD MISSISSIPPI December eighty one thousand eight hundred sixty two MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN Commanding Right Wing You will proceed with as little delay as possible to Memphis Tennessee taking with you one division of your present command On your arrival at Memphis you will assume command of all the troops there and that portion of General Curtis s forces at present east of the Mississippi River and organize them into brigades and divisions in your own army As soon as possible move with them down the river to the vicinity of Vicksburg and with the company operation of the gunboat fleet under command of Flag officer Porter proceed to the reduction of that place in such a manner as circumstances and your own judgment may dictate The amount of rations forage land transportation et cetera necessary to take will be left entirely with yourself The Quartermaster at saint Louis will be instructed to send you transportation for thirty thousand men should you still find yourself deficient your quartermaster will be authorized to make up the deficiency from such transports as may come into the port of Memphis On arriving in Memphis put yourself in communication with Admiral Porter and arrange with him for his company operation Inform me at the earliest practicable day of the time when you will embark and such plans as may then be matured I will hold the forces here in readiness to company operate with you in such manner as the movements of the enemy may make necessary Leave the District of Memphis in the command of an efficient officer and with a garrison of four regiments of infantry the siege guns and whatever cavalry may be there U S GRANT Major General This idea had presented itself to my mind earlier for on the threed of December I asked Halleck if it would not be well to hold the enemy south of the Yallabusha and move a force from Helena and Memphis on Vicksburg On the fifth again I suggested from Oxford to Halleck that if the Helena troops were at my command I though it would be possible to take them and the Memphis forces south of the mouth of the Yazoo River and thus secure Vicksburg and the State of Mississippi Halleck on the same day the fifth of December directed me not to attempt to hold the country south of the Tallahatchie but to collect twenty five thousand troops at Memphis by the twentieth for the Vicksburg expedition I sent Sherman with two divisions at once informed the general in chief of the fact and asked whether I should command the expedition down the river myself or send Sherman I was authorized to do as I though best for the accomplishment of the great object in view I sent Sherman and so informed General Halleck As stated my action in sending Sherman back was expedited by a desire to get him in command of the forces separated from my direct supervision I feared that delay might bring McClernand who was his senior and who had authority from the President and Secretary of War to exercise that particular command and independently I doubted McClernand s fitness and I had good reason to believe that in forestalling him I was by no means giving offence to those whose authority to command was above both him and me Neither my orders to General Sherman nor the correspondence between us or between General Halleck and myself contemplated at the time my going further south than the Yallabusha Pemberton s force in my front was the main part of the garrison of Vicksburg as the force with me was the defence of the territory held by us in West Tennessee and Kentucky I hoped to hold Pemberton in my front while Sherman should get in his rear and into Vicksburg The further north the enemy could be held the better It was understood however between General Sherman and myself that our movements were to be company operative if Pemberton could not be held away from Vicksburg I was to follow him but at that time it was not expected to abandon the railroad north of the Yallabusha With that point as a secondary base of supplies the possibility of moving down the Yazoo until communications could be opened with the Mississippi was contemplated It was my intention and so understood by Sherman and his command that if the enemy should fall back I would follow him even to the gates of Vicksburg I intended in such an event to hold the road to Grenada on the Yallabusha and cut loose from there expecting to establish a new base of supplies on the Yazoo or at Vicksburg itself with Grenada to fall back upon in case of failure It should be remembered that at the time I speak of it had not been demonstrated that an army could operate in an enemy s territory depending upon the country for supplies A halt was called at Oxford with the advance seventeen miles south of there to bring up the road to the latter point and to bring supplies of food forage and munitions to the front On the eighteenth of December I received orders from Washington to divide my command into four army corps with General McClernand to command one of them and to be assigned to that part of the army which was to operate down the Mississippi This interfered with my plans but probably resulted in my ultimately taking the command in person McClernand was at that time in Springfield Illinois The order was obeyed without any delay Dispatches were sent to him the same day in conformity On the twentieth General Van Dorn appeared at Holly Springs my secondary base of supplies captured the garrison of fifteen hundred men commanded by Colonel Murphy of the eighth Wisconsin regiment and destroyed all our munitions of war food and forage The capture was a disgraceful one to the officer commanding but not to the troops under him At the same time Forrest got on our line of railroad between Jackson Tennessee and Columbus Kentucky doing much damage to it This cut me off from all communication with the north for more than a week and it was more than two weeks before rations or forage could be issued from stores obtained in the regular way This demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining so long a line of road over which to draw supplies for an army moving in an enemy s country I determined therefore to abandon my campaign into the interior with Columbus as a base and returned to La Grange and Grand Junction destroying the road to my front and repairing the road to Memphis making the Mississippi river the line over which to draw supplies Pemberton was falling back at the same time The moment I received the news of Van Dorn s success I sent the cavalry at the front back to drive him from the country He had start enough to move north destroying the railroad in many places and to attack several small garrisons intrenched as guards to the railroad All these he found warned of his coming and prepared to receive him Van Dorn did not succeed in capturing a single garrison except the one at Holly Springs which was larger than all the others attacked by him put together Murphy was also warned of Van Dorn s approach but made no preparations to meet him He did not even notify his command Colonel Murphy was the officer who two months before had evacuated Iuka on the approach of the enemy General Rosecrans denounced him for the act and desired to have him tried and punished I sustained the colonel at the time because his command was a small one compared with that of the enemy not one tenth as large and I thought he had done well to get away without falling into their hands His leaving large stores to fall into Price s possession I looked upon as an oversight and excused it on the ground of inexperience in military matters He should however have destroyed them This last surrender demonstrated to my mind that Rosecrans judgment of Murphy s conduct at Iuka was correct The surrender of Holly Springs was most reprehensible and showed either the disloyalty of Colonel Murphy to the cause which he professed to serve or gross cowardice After the war was over I read from the diary of a lady who accompanied General Pemberton in his retreat from the Tallahatchie that the retreat was almost a panic The roads were bad and it was difficult to move the artillery and trains Why there should have been a panic I do not see No expedition had yet started down the Mississippi River Had I known the demoralized condition of the enemy or the fact that central Mississippi abounded so in all army supplies I would have been in pursuit of Pemberton while his cavalry was destroying the roads in my rear After sending cavalry to drive Van Dorn away my next order was to dispatch all the wagons we had under proper escort to collect and bring in all supplies of forage and food from a region of fifteen miles east and west of the road from our front back to Grand Junction leaving two months supplies for the families of those whose stores were taken I was amazed at the quantity of supplies the country afforded It showed that we could have subsisted off the country for two months instead of two weeks without going beyond the limits designated This taught me a lesson which was taken advantage of later in the campaign when our army lived twenty days with the issue of only five days rations by the commissary Our loss of supplies was great at Holly Springs but it was more than compensated for by those taken from the country and by the lesson taught The news of the capture of Holly Springs and the destruction of our supplies caused much rejoicing among the people remaining in Oxford They came with broad smiles on their faces indicating intense joy to ask what I was going to do now without anything for my soldiers to eat I told them that I was not disturbed that I had already sent troops and wagons to collect all the food and forage they could find for fifteen miles on each side of the road Countenances soon changed and so did the inquiry The next was What are WE to do My response was that we had endeavored to feed ourselves from our own northern resources while visiting them but their friends in gray had been uncivil enough to destroy what we had brought along and it could not be expected that men with arms in their hands would starve in the midst of plenty I advised them to emigrate east or west fifteen miles and assist in eating up what we left CHAPTER XXXI HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO HOLLY SPRINGS GENERAL M CLERNAND IN COMMAND ASSUMING COMMAND AT YOUNG S POINT OPERATIONS ABOVE VICKSBURG FORTIFICATIONS ABOUT VICKSBURG THE CANAL LAKE PROVIDENCE OPERATIONS AT YAZOO PASS This interruption in my communications north I was really cut off from communication with a great part of my own command during this time resulted in Sherman s moving from Memphis before McClernand could arrive for my dispatch of the eighteenth did not reach McClernand Pemberton got back to Vicksburg before Sherman got there The rebel positions were on a bluff on the Yazoo River some miles above its mouth The waters were high so that the bottoms were generally overflowed leaving only narrow causeways of dry land between points of debarkation and the high bluffs These were fortified and defended at all points The rebel position was impregnable against any force that could be brought against its front Sherman could not use one fourth of his force His efforts to capture the city or the high ground north of it were necessarily unavailing Sherman s attack was very unfortunate but I had no opportunity of communicating with him after the destruction of the road and telegraph to my rear on the twentieth He did not know but what I was in the rear of the enemy and depending on him to open a new base of supplies for the troops with me I had before he started from Memphis directed him to take with him a few small steamers suitable for the navigation of the Yazoo not knowing but that I might want them to supply me after cutting loose from my base at Grenada On the twenty threed I removed my headquarters back to Holly Springs The troops were drawn back gradually but without haste or confusion finding supplies abundant and no enemy following The road was not damaged south of Holly Springs by Van Dorn at least not to an extent to cause any delay As I had resolved to move headquarters to Memphis and to repair the road to that point I remained at Holly Springs until this work was completed On the tenth of January the work on the road from Holly Springs to Grand Junction and thence to Memphis being completed I moved my headquarters to the latter place During the campaign here described the losses mostly captures were about equal crediting the rebels with their Holly Springs capture which they could not hold When Sherman started on his expedition down the river he had twenty thousand men taken from Memphis and was reinforced by twelve thousand more at Helena Arkansas The troops on the west bank of the river had previously been assigned to my command McClernand having received the orders for his assignment reached the mouth of the Yazoo on the twod of January and immediately assumed command of all the troops with Sherman being a part of his own corps the thirteenth and all of Sherman s the fifteenth Sherman and Admiral Porter with the fleet had withdrawn from the Yazoo After consultation they decided that neither the army nor navy could render service to the cause where they were and learning that I had withdrawn from the interior of Mississippi they determined to return to the Arkansas River and to attack Arkansas Post about fifty miles up that stream and garrisoned by about five or six thousand men Sherman had learned of the existence of this force through a man who had been captured by the enemy with a steamer loaded with ammunition and other supplies intended for his command The man had made his escape McClernand approved this move reluctantly as Sherman says No obstacle was encountered until the gunboats and transports were within range of the fort After three days bombardment by the navy an assault was made by the troops and marines resulting in the capture of the place and in taking five thousand prisoners and seventeen guns I was at first disposed to disapprove of this move as an unnecessary side movement having no especial bearing upon the work before us but when the result was understood I regarded it as very important Five thousand Confederate troops left in the rear might have caused us much trouble and loss of property while navigating the Mississippi Immediately after the reduction of Arkansas Post and the capture of the garrison McClernand returned with his entire force to Napoleon at the mouth of the Arkansas River From here I received messages from both Sherman and Admiral Porter urging me to come and take command in person and expressing their distrust of McClernand s ability and fitness for so important and intricate an expedition On the seventeenth I visited McClernand and his command at Napoleon It was here made evident to me that both the army and navy were so distrustful of McClernand s fitness to command that while they would do all they could to insure success this distrust was an element of weakness It would have been criminal to send troops under these circumstances into such danger By this time I had received authority to relieve McClernand or to assign any person else to the command of the river expedition or to assume command in person I felt great embarrassment about McClernand He was the senior major general after myself within the department It would not do with his rank and ambition to assign a junior over him Nothing was left therefore but to assume the command myself I would have been glad to put Sherman in command to give him an opportunity to accomplish what he had failed in the December before but there seemed no other way out of the difficulty for he was junior to McClernand Sherman s failure needs no apology On the twentieth I ordered General McClernand with the entire command to Young s Point and Milliken s Bend while I returned to Memphis to make all the necessary preparation for leaving the territory behind me secure General Hurlbut with the sixteenth corps was left in command The Memphis and Charleston railroad was held while the Mississippi Central was given up Columbus was the only point between Cairo and Memphis on the river left with a garrison All the troops and guns from the posts on the abandoned railroad and river were sent to the front On the twenty ninth of January I arrived at Young s Point and assumed command the following day General McClernand took exception in a most characteristic way for him His correspondence with me on the subject was more in the nature of a reprimand than a protest It was highly insubordinate but I overlooked it as I believed for the good of the service General McClernand was a politician of very considerable prominence in his State he was a member of Congress when the secession war broke out he belonged to that political party which furnished all the opposition there was to a vigorous prosecution of the war for saving the Union there was no delay in his declaring himself for the Union at all hazards and there was no uncertain sound in his declaration of where he stood in the contest before the country He also gave up his seat in Congress to take the field in defence of the principles he had proclaimed The real work of the campaign and siege of Vicksburg now began The problem was to secure a footing upon dry ground on the east side of the river from which the troops could operate against Vicksburg The Mississippi River from Cairo south runs through a rich alluvial valley of many miles in width bound on the east by land running from eighty up to two or more hundred feet above the river On the west side the highest land except in a few places is but little above the highest water Through this valley the river meanders in the most tortuous way varying in direction to all points of the compass At places it runs to the very foot of the bluffs After leaving Memphis there are no such highlands coming to the water s edge on the east shore until Vicksburg is reached The intervening land is cut up by bayous filled from the river in high water many of them navigable for steamers All of them would be except for overhanging trees narrowness and tortuous course making it impossible to turn the bends with vessels of any considerable length Marching across this country in the face of an enemy was impossible navigating it proved equally impracticable The strategical way according to the rule therefore would have been to go back to Memphis establish that as a base of supplies fortify it so that the storehouses could be held by a small garrison and move from there along the line of railroad repairing as we advanced to the Yallabusha or to Jackson Mississippi At this time the North had become very much discouraged Many strong Union men believed that the war must prove a failure The elections of eighteen sixty two had gone against the party which was for the prosecution of the war to save the Union if it took the last man and the last dollar Voluntary enlistments had ceased throughout the greater part of the North and the draft had been resorted to to fill up our ranks It was my judgment at the time that to make a backward movement as long as that from Vicksburg to Memphis would be interpreted by many of those yet full of hope for the preservation of the Union as a defeat and that the draft would be resisted desertions ensue and the power to capture and punish deserters lost There was nothing left to be done but to go FORWARD TO A DECISIVE VICTORY This was in my mind from the moment I took command in person at Young s Point The winter of eighteen sixty two three was a noted one for continuous high water in the Mississippi and for heavy rains along the lower river To get dry land or rather land above the water to encamp the troops upon took many miles of river front We had to occupy the levees and the ground immediately behind This was so limited that one corps the seventeenth under General McPherson was at Lake Providence seventy miles above Vicksburg It was in January the troops took their position opposite Vicksburg The water was very high and the rains were incessant There seemed no possibility of a land movement before the end of March or later and it would not do to lie idle all this time The effect would be demoralizing to the troops and injurious to their health Friends in the North would have grown more and more discouraged and enemies in the same section more and more insolent in their gibes and denunciation of the cause and those engaged in it I always admired the South as bad as I thought their cause for the boldness with which they silenced all opposition and all croaking by press or by individuals within their control War at all times whether a civil war between sections of a common country or between nations ought to be avoided if possible with honor But once entered into it is too much for human nature to tolerate an enemy within their ranks to give aid and comfort to the armies of the opposing section or nation Vicksburg as stated before is on the first high land coming to the river s edge below that on which Memphis stands The bluff or high land follows the left bank of the Yazoo for some distance and continues in a southerly direction to the Mississippi River thence it runs along the Mississippi to Warrenton six miles below The Yazoo River leaves the high land a short distance below Haines Bluff and empties into the Mississippi nine miles above Vicksburg Vicksburg is built on this high land where the Mississippi washes the base of the hill Haines Bluff eleven miles from Vicksburg on the Yazoo River was strongly fortified The whole distance from there to Vicksburg and thence to Warrenton was also intrenched with batteries at suitable distances and rifle pits connecting them From Young s Point the Mississippi turns in a north easterly direction to a point just above the city when it again turns and runs south westerly leaving vessels which might attempt to run the blockade exposed to the fire of batteries six miles below the city before they were in range of the upper batteries Since then the river has made a cut off leaving what was the peninsula in front of the city an island North of the Yazoo was all a marsh heavily timbered cut up with bayous and much overflowed A front attack was therefore impossible and was never contemplated certainly not by me The problem then became how to secure a landing on high ground east of the Mississippi without an apparent retreat Then commenced a series of experiments to consume time and to divert the attention of the enemy of my troops and of the public generally I myself never felt great confidence that any of the experiments resorted to would prove successful Nevertheless I was always prepared to take advantage of them in case they did In eighteen sixty two General Thomas Williams had come up from New Orleans and cut a ditch ten or twelve feet wide and about as deep straight across from Young s Point to the river below The distance across was a little over a mile It was Williams expectation that when the river rose it would cut a navigable channel through but the canal started in an eddy from both ends and of course it only filled up with water on the rise without doing any execution in the way of cutting mister Lincoln had navigated the Mississippi in his younger days and understood well its tendency to change its channel in places from time to time He set much store accordingly by this canal General McClernand had been therefore directed before I went to Young s Point to push the work of widening and deepening this canal After my arrival the work was diligently pushed with about four thousand men as many as could be used to advantage until interrupted by a sudden rise in the river that broke a dam at the upper end which had been put there to keep the water out until the excavation was completed This was on the eighth of March Even if the canal had proven a success so far as to be navigable for steamers it could not have been of much advantage to us It runs in a direction almost perpendicular to the line of bluffs on the opposite side or east bank of the river As soon as the enemy discovered what we were doing he established a battery commanding the canal throughout its length This battery soon drove out our dredges two in number which were doing the work of thousands of men Had the canal been completed it might have proven of some use in running transports through under the cover of night to use below but they would yet have to run batteries though for a much shorter distance While this work was progressing we were busy in other directions trying to find an available landing on high ground on the east bank of the river or to make water ways to get below the city avoiding the batteries On the thirtieth of January the day after my arrival at the front I ordered General McPherson stationed with his corps at Lake Providence to cut the levee at that point If successful in opening a channel for navigation by this route it would carry us to the Mississippi River through the mouth of the Red River just above Port Hudson and four hundred miles below Vicksburg by the river Lake Providence is a part of the old bed of the Mississippi about a mile from the present channel It is six miles long and has its outlet through Bayou Baxter Bayou Macon and the Tensas Washita and Red Rivers The last three are navigable streams at all seasons Bayous Baxter and Macon are narrow and tortuous and the banks are covered with dense forests overhanging the channel They were also filled with fallen timber the accumulation of years The land along the Mississippi River from Memphis down is in all instances highest next to the river except where the river washes the bluffs which form the boundary of the valley through which it winds Bayou Baxter as it reaches lower land begins to spread out and disappears entirely in a cypress swamp before it reaches the Macon There was about two feet of water in this swamp at the time To get through it even with vessels of the lightest draft it was necessary to clear off a belt of heavy timber wide enough to make a passage way As the trees would have to be cut close to the bottom under water it was an undertaking of great magnitude On the fourth of February I visited General McPherson and remained with him several days The work had not progressed so far as to admit the water from the river into the lake but the troops had succeeded in drawing a small steamer of probably not over thirty tons capacity from the river into the lake With this we were able to explore the lake and bayou as far as cleared I saw then that there was scarcely a chance of this ever becoming a practicable route for moving troops through an enemy s country The distance from Lake Providence to the point where vessels going by that route would enter the Mississippi again is about four hundred and seventy miles by the main river The distance would probably be greater by the tortuous bayous through which this new route would carry us The enemy held Port Hudson below where the Red River debouches and all the Mississippi above to Vicksburg The Red River Washita and Tensas were as has been said all navigable streams on which the enemy could throw small bodies of men to obstruct our passage and pick off our troops with their sharpshooters I let the work go on believing employment was better than idleness for the men Then too it served as a cover for other efforts which gave a better prospect of success This work was abandoned after the canal proved a failure Lieutenant Colonel Wilson of my staff was sent to Helena Arkansas to examine and open a way through Moon Lake and the Yazoo Pass if possible Formerly there was a route by way of an inlet from the Mississippi River into Moon Lake a mile east of the river thence east through Yazoo Pass to Coldwater along the latter to the Tallahatchie which joins the Yallabusha about two hundred and fifty miles below Moon Lake and forms the Yazoo River These were formerly navigated by steamers trading with the rich plantations along their banks but the State of Mississippi had built a strong levee across the inlet some years before leaving the only entrance for vessels into this rich region the one by way of the mouth of the Yazoo several hundreds of miles below On the twod of February this dam or levee was cut The river being high the rush of water through the cut was so great that in a very short time the entire obstruction was washed away The bayous were soon filled and much of the country was overflowed This pass leaves the Mississippi River but a few miles below Helena On the twenty fourth General Ross with his brigade of about four thousand five hundred men on transports moved into this new water way The rebels had obstructed the navigation of Yazoo Pass and the Coldwater by felling trees into them Much of the timber in this region being of greater specific gravity than water and being of great size their removal was a matter of great labor but it was finally accomplished and on the eleventh of March Ross found himself accompanied by two gunboats under the command of Lieutenant Commander Watson Smith confronting a fortification at Greenwood where the Tallahatchie and Yallabusha unite and the Yazoo begins The bends of the rivers are such at this point as to almost form an island scarcely above water at that stage of the river This island was fortified and manned It was named Fort Pemberton after the commander at Vicksburg No land approach was accessible The troops therefore could render no assistance towards an assault further than to establish a battery on a little piece of ground which was discovered above water The gunboats however attacked on the eleventh and again on the thirteenth of March Both efforts were failures and were not renewed One gunboat was disabled and we lost six men killed and twenty five wounded The loss of the enemy was less Fort Pemberton was so little above the water that it was thought that a rise of two feet would drive the enemy out In hope of enlisting the elements on our side which had been so much against us up to this time a second cut was made in the Mississippi levee this time directly opposite Helena or six miles above the former cut It did not accomplish the desired result and Ross with his fleet started back On the twenty twod he met Quinby with a brigade at Yazoo Pass Quinby was the senior of Ross and assumed command He was not satisfied with returning to his former position without seeing for himself whether anything could be accomplished Accordingly Fort Pemberton was revisited by our troops but an inspection was sufficient this time without an attack Quinby with his command returned with but little delay In the meantime I was much exercised for the safety of Ross not knowing that Quinby had been able to join him Reinforcements were of no use in a country covered with water as they would have to remain on board of their transports Relief had to come from another quarter So I determined to get into the Yazoo below Fort Pemberton Steel s Bayou empties into the Yazoo River between Haines Bluff and its mouth It is narrow very tortuous and fringed with a very heavy growth of timber but it is deep It approaches to within one mile of the Mississippi at Eagle Bend thirty miles above Young s Point Steel s Bayou connects with Black Bayou Black Bayou with Deer Creek Deer Creek with Rolling Fork Rolling Fork with the Big Sunflower River and the Big Sunflower with the Yazoo River about ten miles above Haines Bluff in a right line but probably twenty or twenty five miles by the winding of the river All these waterways are of about the same nature so far as navigation is concerned until the Sunflower is reached this affords free navigation Admiral Porter explored this waterway as far as Deer Creek on the fourteenth of March and reported it navigable On the next day he started with five gunboats and four mortar boats I went with him for some distance The heavy overhanging timber retarded progress very much as did also the short turns in so narrow a stream The gunboats however ploughed their way through without other damage than to their appearance The transports did not fare so well although they followed behind The road was somewhat cleared for them by the gunboats In the evening I returned to headquarters to hurry up reinforcements Sherman went in person on the sixteenth taking with him Stuart s division of the fifteenth corps They took large river transports to Eagle Bend on the Mississippi where they debarked and marched across to Steel s Bayou where they re embarked on the transports The river steamers with their tall smokestacks and light guards extending out were so much impeded that the gunboats got far ahead Porter with his fleet got within a few hundred yards of where the sailing would have been clear and free from the obstructions caused by felling trees into the water when he encountered rebel sharp shooters and his progress was delayed by obstructions in his front He could do nothing with gunboats against sharpshooters The rebels learning his route had sent in about four thousand men many more than there were sailors in the fleet Sherman went back at the request of the admiral to clear out Black Bayou and to hurry up reinforcements which were far behind On the night of the nineteenth he received notice from the admiral that he had been attacked by sharp shooters and was in imminent peril Sherman at once returned through Black Bayou in a canoe and passed on until he met a steamer with the last of the reinforcements he had coming up They tried to force their way through Black Bayou with their steamer but finding it slow and tedious work debarked and pushed forward on foot It was night when they landed and intensely dark There was but a narrow strip of land above water and that was grown up with underbrush or cane The troops lighted their way through this with candles carried in their hands for a mile and a half when they came to an open plantation Here the troops rested until morning They made twenty one miles from this resting place by noon the next day and were in time to rescue the fleet Porter had fully made up his mind to blow up the gunboats rather than have them fall into the hands of the enemy More welcome visitors he probably never met than the boys in blue on this occasion The vessels were backed out and returned to their rendezvous on the Mississippi and thus ended in failure the fourth attempt to get in rear of Vicksburg CHAPTER XXXII THE BAYOUS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI CRITICISMS OF THE NORTHERN PRESS RUNNING THE BATTERIES LOSS OF THE INDIANOLA DISPOSITION OF THE TROOPS The original canal scheme was also abandoned on the twenty seventh of March The effort to make a waterway through Lake Providence and the connecting bayous was abandoned as wholly impracticable about the same time At Milliken s Bend and also at Young s Point bayous or channels start which connecting with other bayous passing Richmond Louisiana enter the Mississippi at Carthage twenty five or thirty miles above Grand Gulf The Mississippi levee cuts the supply of water off from these bayous or channels but all the rainfall behind the levee at these points is carried through these same channels to the river below In case of a crevasse in this vicinity the water escaping would find its outlet through the same channels The dredges and laborers from the canal having been driven out by overflow and the enemy s batteries I determined to open these other channels if possible If successful the effort would afford a route away from the enemy s batteries for our transports There was a good road back of the levees along these bayous to carry the troops artillery and wagon trains over whenever the water receded a little and after a few days of dry weather Accordingly with the abandonment of all the other plans for reaching a base heretofore described this new one was undertaken As early as the fourth of February I had written to Halleck about this route stating that I thought it much more practicable than the other undertaking the Lake Providence route and that it would have been accomplished with much less labor if commenced before the water had got all over the country The upper end of these bayous being cut off from a water supply further than the rainfall back of the levees was grown up with dense timber for a distance of several miles from their source It was necessary therefore to clear this out before letting in the water from the river This work was continued until the waters of the river began to recede and the road to Richmond Louisiana emerged from the water One small steamer and some barges were got through this channel but no further use could be made of it because of the fall in the river Beyond this it was no more successful than the other experiments with which the winter was whiled away All these failures would have been very discouraging if I had expected much from the efforts but I had not From the first the most I hoped to accomplish was the passage of transports to be used below Vicksburg without exposure to the long line of batteries defending that city This long dreary and for heavy and continuous rains and high water unprecedented winter was one of great hardship to all engaged about Vicksburg The river was higher than its natural banks from December eighteen sixty two to the following April The war had suspended peaceful pursuits in the South further than the production of army supplies and in consequence the levees were neglected and broken in many places and the whole country was covered with water Troops could scarcely find dry ground on which to pitch their tents Malarial fevers broke out among the men Measles and small pox also attacked them The hospital arrangements and medical attendance were so perfect however that the loss of life was much less than might have been expected Visitors to the camps went home with dismal stories to relate Northern papers came back to the soldiers with these stories exaggerated Because I would not divulge my ultimate plans to visitors they pronounced me idle incompetent and unfit to command men in an emergency and clamored for my removal They were not to be satisfied many of them with my simple removal but named who my successor should be McClernand Fremont Hunter and McClellan were all mentioned in this connection I took no steps to answer these complaints but continued to do my duty as I understood it to the best of my ability Every one has his superstitions One of mine is that in positions of great responsibility every one should do his duty to the best of his ability where assigned by competent authority without application or the use of influence to change his position While at Cairo I had watched with very great interest the operations of the Army of the Potomac looking upon that as the main field of the war I had no idea myself of ever having any large command nor did I suppose that I was equal to one but I had the vanity to think that as a cavalry officer I might succeed very well in the command of a brigade On one occasion in talking about this to my staff officers all of whom were civilians without any military education whatever I said that I would give anything if I were commanding a brigade of cavalry in the Army of the Potomac and I believed I could do some good Captain Hillyer spoke up and suggested that I make application to be transferred there to command the cavalry I then told him that I would cut my right arm off first and mentioned this superstition In time of war the President being by the Constitution Commander in chief of the Army and Navy is responsible for the selection of commanders He should not be embarrassed in making his selections I having been selected my responsibility ended with my doing the best I knew how If I had sought the place or obtained it through personal or political influence my belief is that I would have feared to undertake any plan of my own conception and would probably have awaited direct orders from my distant superiors Persons obtaining important commands by application or political influence are apt to keep a written record of complaints and predictions of defeat which are shown in case of disaster Somebody must be responsible for their failures With all the pressure brought to bear upon them both President Lincoln and General Halleck stood by me to the end of the campaign I had never met mister Lincoln but his support was constant At last the waters began to recede the roads crossing the peninsula behind the levees of the bayous were emerging from the waters the troops were all concentrated from distant points at Milliken s Bend preparatory to a final move which was to crown the long tedious and discouraging labors with success I had had in contemplation the whole winter the movement by land to a point below Vicksburg from which to operate subject only to the possible but not expected success of some one of the expedients resorted to for the purpose of giving us a different base This could not be undertaken until the waters receded I did not therefore communicate this plan even to an officer of my staff until it was necessary to make preparations for the start My recollection is that Admiral Porter was the first one to whom I mentioned it The company operation of the navy was absolutely essential to the success even to the contemplation of such an enterprise I had no more authority to command Porter than he had to command me It was necessary to have part of his fleet below Vicksburg if the troops went there Steamers to use as ferries were also essential The navy was the only escort and protection for these steamers all of which in getting below had to run about fourteen miles of batteries Porter fell into the plan at once and suggested that he had better superintend the preparation of the steamers selected to run the batteries as sailors would probably understand the work better than soldiers I was glad to accept his proposition not only because I admitted his argument but because it would enable me to keep from the enemy a little longer our designs Porter s fleet was on the east side of the river above the mouth of the Yazoo entirely concealed from the enemy by the dense forests that intervened Even spies could not get near him on account of the undergrowth and overflowed lands Suspicions of some mysterious movements were aroused Our river guards discovered one day a small skiff moving quietly and mysteriously up the river near the east shore from the direction of Vicksburg towards the fleet On overhauling the boat they found a small white flag not much larger than a handkerchief set up in the stern no doubt intended as a flag of truce in case of discovery The boat crew and passengers were brought ashore to me The chief personage aboard proved to be Jacob Thompson Secretary of the Interior under the administration of President Buchanan After a pleasant conversation of half an hour or more I allowed the boat and crew passengers and all to return to Vicksburg without creating a suspicion that there was a doubt in my mind as to the good faith of mister Thompson and his flag Admiral Porter proceeded with the preparation of the steamers for their hazardous passage of the enemy s batteries The great essential was to protect the boilers from the enemy s shot and to conceal the fires under the boilers from view This he accomplished by loading the steamers between the guards and boilers on the boiler deck up to the deck above with bales of hay and cotton and the deck in front of the boilers in the same way adding sacks of grain The hay and grain would be wanted below and could not be transported in sufficient quantity by the muddy roads over which we expected to march Before this I had been collecting from saint Louis and Chicago yawls and barges to be used as ferries when we got below By the sixteenth of April Porter was ready to start on his perilous trip The advance flagship Benton Porter commanding started at ten o clock at night followed at intervals of a few minutes by the Lafayette with a captured steamer the Price lashed to her side the Louisville Mound City Pittsburgh and Carondelet all of these being naval vessels Next came the transports Forest Queen Silver Wave and Henry Clay each towing barges loaded with coal to be used as fuel by the naval and transport steamers when below the batteries The gunboat Tuscumbia brought up the rear Soon after the start a battery between Vicksburg and Warrenton opened fire across the intervening peninsula followed by the upper batteries and then by batteries all along the line The gunboats ran up close under the bluffs delivering their fire in return at short distances probably without much effect They were under fire for more than two hours and every vessel was struck many times but with little damage to the gunboats The transports did not fare so well The Henry Clay was disabled and deserted by her crew Soon after a shell burst in the cotton packed about the boilers set the vessel on fire and burned her to the water s edge The burning mass however floated down to Carthage before grounding as did also one of the barges in tow The enemy were evidently expecting our fleet for they were ready to light up the river by means of bonfires on the east side and by firing houses on the point of land opposite the city on the Louisiana side The sight was magnificent but terrible I witnessed it from the deck of a river transport run out into the middle of the river and as low down as it was prudent to go My mind was much relieved when I learned that no one on the transports had been killed and but few if any wounded During the running of the batteries men were stationed in the holds of the transports to partially stop with cotton shot holes that might be made in the hulls All damage was afterwards soon repaired under the direction of Admiral Porter The experiment of passing batteries had been tried before this however during the war Admiral Farragut had run the batteries at Port Hudson with the flagship Hartford and one iron clad and visited me from below Vicksburg The thirteenth of February Admiral Porter had sent the gunboat Indianola Lieutenant Commander George Brown commanding below She met Colonel Ellet of the Marine brigade below Natchez on a captured steamer Two of the Colonel s fleet had previously run the batteries producing the greatest consternation among the people along the Mississippi from Vicksburg ten to the Red River The Indianola remained about the mouth of the Red River some days and then started up the Mississippi The Confederates soon raised the Queen of the West eleven and repaired her With this vessel and the ram Webb which they had had for some time in the Red River and two other steamers they followed the Indianola The latter was encumbered with barges of coal in tow and consequently could make but little speed against the rapid current of the Mississippi The Confederate fleet overtook her just above Grand Gulf and attacked her after dark on the twenty fourth of February The Indianola was superior to all the others in armament and probably would have destroyed them or driven them away but for her encumbrance As it was she fought them for an hour and a half but in the dark was struck seven or eight times by the ram and other vessels and was finally disabled and reduced to a sinking condition The armament was thrown overboard and the vessel run ashore Officers and crew then surrendered I had started McClernand with his corps of four divisions on the twenty ninth of March by way of Richmond Louisiana to New Carthage hoping that he might capture Grand Gulf before the balance of the troops could get there but the roads were very bad scarcely above water yet Some miles from New Carthage the levee to Bayou Vidal was broken in several places overflowing the roads for the distance of two miles Boats were collected from the surrounding bayous and some constructed on the spot from such material as could be collected to transport the troops across the overflowed interval By the sixth of April McClernand had reached New Carthage with one division and its artillery the latter ferried through the woods by these boats On the seventeenth I visited New Carthage in person and saw that the process of getting troops through in the way we were doing was so tedious that a better method must be devised The water was falling and in a few days there would not be depth enough to use boats nor would the land be dry enough to march over McClernand had already found a new route from Smith s plantation where the crevasse occurred to Perkins plantation eight to twelve miles below New Carthage This increased the march from Milliken s Bend from twenty seven to nearly forty miles Four bridges had to be built across bayous two of them each over six hundred feet long making about two thousand feet of bridging in all The river falling made the current in these bayous very rapid increasing the difficulty of building and permanently fastening these bridges but the ingenuity of the Yankee soldier was equal to any emergency The bridges were soon built of such material as could be found near by and so substantial were they that not a single mishap occurred in crossing all the army with artillery cavalry and wagon trains except the loss of one siege gun a thirty two pounder This if my memory serves me correctly broke through the only pontoon bridge we had in all our march across the peninsula These bridges were all built by McClernand s command under the supervision of Lieutenant Hains of the Engineer Corps I returned to Milliken s Bend on the eighteenth or nineteenth and on the twentieth issued the following final order for the movement of troops HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE MILLIKEN S BEND LOUISIANA April twenty eighteen sixty three Special Orders No one hundred ten VIII The following orders are published for the information and guidance of the Army in the Field in its present movement to obtain a foothold on the east bank of the Mississippi River from which Vicksburg can be approached by practicable roads First The Thirteenth army corps Major General John A McClernand commanding will constitute the right wing Second The Fifteenth army corps Major General W T Sherman commanding will constitute the left wing Third The Seventeenth army corps Major General James B McPherson commanding will constitute the centre Fourth The order of march to New Carthage will be from right to left Fifth Reserves will be formed by divisions from each army corps or an entire army corps will be held as a reserve as necessity may require When the reserve is formed by divisions each division will remain under the immediate command of its respective corps commander unless otherwise specially ordered for a particular emergency Sixth Troops will be required to bivouac until proper facilities can be afforded for the transportation of camp equipage Seventh In the present movement one tent will be allowed to each company for the protection of rations from rain one wall tent for each regimental headquarters one wall tent for each brigade headquarters and one wall tent for each division headquarters corps commanders having the books and blanks of their respective commands to provide for are authorized to take such tents as are absolutely necessary but not to exceed the number allowed by General Orders No one hundred sixty A G O series of eighteen sixty two Eighth All the teams of the three army corps under the immediate charge of the quartermasters bearing them on their returns will constitute a train for carrying supplies and ordnance and the authorized camp equipage of the army Ninth As fast as the Thirteenth army corps advances the Seventeenth army corps will take its place and it in turn will be followed in like manner by the Fifteenth army corps Tenth Two regiments from each army corps will be detailed by corps commanders to guard the lines from Richmond to New Carthage Eleventh General hospitals will be established by the medical director between Duckport and Milliken s Bend All sick and disabled soldiers will be left in these hospitals Surgeons in charge of hospitals will report convalescents as fast as they become fit for duty Each corps commander will detail an intelligent and good drill officer to remain behind and take charge of the convalescents of their respective corps officers so detailed will organize the men under their charge into squads and companies without regard to the regiments they belong to and in the absence of convalescent commissioned officers to command them will appoint non commissioned officers or privates The force so organized will constitute the guard of the line from Duckport to Milliken s Bend They will furnish all the guards and details required for general hospitals and with the contrabands that may be about the camps will furnish all the details for loading and unloading boats Twelfth The movement of troops from Milliken s Bend to New Carthage will be so conducted as to allow the transportation of ten days supply of rations and one half the allowance of ordnance required by previous orders Thirteenth Commanders are authorized and enjoined to collect all the beef cattle corn and other necessary supplies on the line of march but wanton destruction of property taking of articles useless for military purposes insulting citizens going into and searching houses without proper orders from division commanders are positively prohibited All such irregularities must be summarily punished Fourteenth Brigadier General J C Sullivan is appointed to the command of all the forces detailed for the protection of the line from here to New Carthage His particular attention is called to General Orders No sixty nine from Adjutant General s Office Washington of date March twenty eighteen sixty three By order of MAJOR GENERAL U S GRANT McClernand was already below on the Mississippi Two of McPherson s divisions were put upon the march immediately The third had not yet arrived from Lake Providence it was on its way to Milliken s Bend and was to follow on arrival Sherman was to follow McPherson Two of his divisions were at Duckport and Young s Point and the third under Steele was under orders to return from Greenville Mississippi where it had been sent to expel a rebel battery that had been annoying our transports It had now become evident that the army could not be rationed by a wagon train over the single narrow and almost impassable road between Milliken s Bend and Perkins plantation Accordingly six more steamers were protected as before to run the batteries and were loaded with supplies They took twelve barges in tow loaded also with rations On the night of the twenty twod of April they ran the batteries five getting through more or less disabled while one was sunk About half the barges got through with their needed freight When it was first proposed to run the blockade at Vicksburg with river steamers there were but two captains or masters who were willing to accompany their vessels and but one crew Volunteers were called for from the army men who had had experience in any capacity in navigating the western rivers Captains pilots mates engineers and deck hands enough presented themselves to take five times the number of vessels we were moving through this dangerous ordeal Most of them were from Logan s division composed generally of men from the southern part of Illinois and from Missouri All but two of the steamers were commanded by volunteers from the army and all but one so manned In this instance as in all others during the war I found that volunteers could be found in the ranks and among the commissioned officers to meet every call for aid whether mechanical or professional Colonel W S Oliver was master of transportation on this occasion by special detail CHAPTER XXXIII ATTACK ON GRAND GULF OPERATIONS BELOW VICKSBURG On the twenty fourth my headquarters were with the advance at Perkins plantation Reconnoissances were made in boats to ascertain whether there was high land on the east shore of the river where we might land above Grand Gulf There was none practicable Accordingly the troops were set in motion for Hard Times twenty two miles farther down the river and nearly opposite Grand Gulf The loss of two steamers and six barges reduced our transportation so that only ten thousand men could be moved by water Some of the steamers that had got below were injured in their machinery so that they were only useful as barges towed by those less severely injured All the troops therefore except what could be transported in one trip had to march The road lay west of Lake saint Joseph Three large bayous had to be crossed They were rapidly bridged in the same manner as those previously encountered twelve On the twenty seventh McClernand s corps was all at Hard Times and McPherson s was following closely I had determined to make the attempt to effect a landing on the east side of the river as soon as possible Accordingly on the morning of the twenty ninth McClernand was directed to embark all the troops from his corps that our transports and barges could carry About ten thousand men were so embarked The plan was to have the navy silence the guns at Grand Gulf and to have as many men as possible ready to debark in the shortest possible time under cover of the fire of the navy and carry the works by storm The following order was issued PERKINS PLANTATION LA April two hundred seventy one thousand eight hundred sixty three MAJOR GENERAL J A MCCLERNAND Commanding thirteenth A C Commence immediately the embarkation of your corps or so much of it as there is transportation for Have put aboard the artillery and every article authorized in orders limiting baggage except the men and hold them in readiness with their places assigned to be moved at a moment s warning All the troops you may have except those ordered to remain behind send to a point nearly opposite Grand Gulf where you see by special orders of this date General McPherson is ordered to send one division The plan of the attack will be for the navy to attack and silence all the batteries commanding the river Your corps will be on the river ready to run to and debark on the nearest eligible land below the promontory first brought to view passing down the river Once on shore have each commander instructed beforehand to form his men the best the ground will admit of and take possession of the most commanding points but avoid separating your command so that it cannot support itself The first object is to get a foothold where our troops can maintain themselves until such time as preparations can be made and troops collected for a forward movement Admiral Porter has proposed to place his boats in the position indicated to you a few days ago and to bring over with them such troops as may be below the city after the guns of the enemy are silenced It may be that the enemy will occupy positions back from the city out of range of the gunboats so as to make it desirable to run past Grand Gulf and land at Rodney In case this should prove the plan a signal will be arranged and you duly informed when the transports are to start with this view Or it may be expedient for the boats to run past but not the men In this case then the transports would have to be brought back to where the men could land and move by forced marches to below Grand Gulf re embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place There will be required then three signals one to indicate that the transports can run down and debark the troops at Grand Gulf one that the transports can run by without the troops and the last that the transports can run by with the troops on board Should the men have to march all baggage and artillery will be left to run the blockade If not already directed require your men to keep three days rations in their haversacks not to be touched until a movement commences U S GRANT Major General At eight o clock A M twenty ninth Porter made the attack with his entire strength present eight gunboats For nearly five and a half hours the attack was kept up without silencing a single gun of the enemy All this time McClernand s ten thousand men were huddled together on the transports in the stream ready to attempt a landing if signalled I occupied a tug from which I could see the effect of the battle on both sides within range of the enemy s guns but a small tug without armament was not calculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were being assailed themselves About half past one the fleet withdrew seeing their efforts were entirely unavailing The enemy ceased firing as soon as we withdrew I immediately signalled the Admiral and went aboard his ship The navy lost in this engagement eighteen killed and fifty six wounded A large proportion of these were of the crew of the flagship and most of those from a single shell which penetrated the ship s side and exploded between decks where the men were working their guns The sight of the mangled and dying men which met my eye as I boarded the ship was sickening Grand Gulf is on a high bluff where the river runs at the very foot of it It is as defensible upon its front as Vicksburg and at that time would have been just as impossible to capture by a front attack I therefore requested Porter to run the batteries with his fleet that night and to take charge of the transports all of which would be wanted below There is a long tongue of land from the Louisiana side extending towards Grand Gulf made by the river running nearly east from about three miles above and nearly in the opposite direction from that point for about the same distance below The land was so low and wet that it would not have been practicable to march an army across but for a levee I had had this explored before as well as the east bank below to ascertain if there was a possible point of debarkation north of Rodney It was found that the top of the levee afforded a good road to march upon Porter as was always the case with him not only acquiesced in the plan but volunteered to use his entire fleet as transports I had intended to make this request but he anticipated me At dusk when concealed from the view of the enemy at Grand Gulf McClernand landed his command on the west bank The navy and transports ran the batteries successfully The troops marched across the point of land under cover of night unobserved By the time it was light the enemy saw our whole fleet ironclads gunboats river steamers and barges quietly moving down the river three miles below them black or rather blue with National troops When the troops debarked the evening of the twenty ninth it was expected that we would have to go to Rodney about nine miles below to find a landing but that night a colored man came in who informed me that a good landing would be found at Bruinsburg a few miles above Rodney from which point there was a good road leading to Port Gibson some twelve miles in the interior The information was found correct and our landing was effected without opposition Sherman had not left his position above Vicksburg yet On the morning of the twenty seventh I ordered him to create a diversion by moving his corps up the Yazoo and threatening an attack on Haines Bluff My object was to compel Pemberton to keep as much force about Vicksburg as I could until I could secure a good footing on high land east of the river The move was eminently successful and as we afterwards learned created great confusion about Vicksburg and doubts about our real design Sherman moved the day of our attack on Grand Gulf the twenty ninth with ten regiments of his command and eight gunboats which Porter had left above Vicksburg He debarked his troops and apparently made every preparation to attack the enemy while the navy bombarded the main forts at Haines Bluff This move was made without a single casualty in either branch of the service On the first of May Sherman received orders from me sent from Hard Times the evening of the twenty ninth of April to withdraw from the front of Haines Bluff and follow McPherson with two divisions as fast as he could I had established a depot of supplies at Perkins plantation Now that all our gunboats were below Grand Gulf it was possible that the enemy might fit out boats in the Big Black with improvised armament and attempt to destroy these supplies McPherson was at Hard Times with a portion of his corps and the depot was protected by a part of his command The night of the twenty ninth I directed him to arm one of the transports with artillery and send it up to Perkins plantation as a guard and also to have the siege guns we had brought along moved there and put in position The embarkation below Grand Gulf took place at De Shroon s Louisiana six miles above Bruinsburg Mississippi Early on the morning of thirtieth of April McClernand s corps and one division of McPherson s corps were speedily landed When this was effected I felt a degree of relief scarcely ever equalled since Vicksburg was not yet taken it is true nor were its defenders demoralized by any of our previous moves I was now in the enemy s country with a vast river and the stronghold of Vicksburg between me and my base of supplies But I was on dry ground on the same side of the river with the enemy All the campaigns labors hardships and exposures from the month of December previous to this time that had been made and endured were for the accomplishment of this one object I had with me the thirteenth corps General McClernand commanding and two brigades of Logan s division of the seventeenth corps General McPherson commanding in all not more than twenty thousand men to commence the campaign with These were soon reinforced by the remaining brigade of Logan s division and Crocker s division of the seventeenth corps On the seventh of May I was further reinforced by Sherman with two divisions of his the fifteenth corps My total force was then about thirty three thousand men The enemy occupied Grand Gulf Haines Bluff and Jackson with a force of nearly sixty thousand men Jackson is fifty miles east of Vicksburg and is connected with it by a railroad My first problem was to capture Grand Gulf to use as a base Bruinsburg is two miles from high ground The bottom at that point is higher than most of the low land in the valley of the Mississippi and a good road leads to the bluff It was natural to expect the garrison from Grand Gulf to come out to meet us and prevent if they could our reaching this solid base Bayou Pierre enters the Mississippi just above Bruinsburg and as it is a navigable stream and was high at the time in order to intercept us they had to go by Port Gibson the nearest point where there was a bridge to cross upon This more than doubled the distance from Grand Gulf to the high land back of Bruinsburg No time was to be lost in securing this foothold Our transportation was not sufficient to move all the army across the river at one trip or even two but the landing of the thirteenth corps and one division of the seventeenth was effected during the day April thirtieth and early evening McClernand was advanced as soon as ammunition and two days rations to last five could be issued to his men The bluffs were reached an hour before sunset and McClernand was pushed on hoping to reach Port Gibson and save the bridge spanning the Bayou Pierre before the enemy could get there for crossing a stream in the presence of an enemy is always difficult Port Gibson too is the starting point of roads to Grand Gulf Vicksburg and Jackson McClernand s advance met the enemy about five miles west of Port Gibson at Thompson s plantation There was some firing during the night but nothing rising to the dignity of a battle until daylight The enemy had taken a strong natural position with most of the Grand Gulf garrison numbering about seven or eight thousand men under General Bowen His hope was to hold me in check until reinforcements under Loring could reach him from Vicksburg but Loring did not come in time to render much assistance south of Port Gibson Two brigades of McPherson s corps followed McClernand as fast as rations and ammunition could be issued and were ready to take position upon the battlefield whenever the thirteenth corps could be got out of the way The country in this part of Mississippi stands on edge as it were the roads running along the ridges except when they occasionally pass from one ridge to another Where there are no clearings the sides of the hills are covered with a very heavy growth of timber and with undergrowth and the ravines are filled with vines and canebrakes almost impenetrable This makes it easy for an inferior force to delay if not defeat a far superior one Near the point selected by Bowen to defend the road to Port Gibson divides taking two ridges which do not diverge more than a mile or two at the widest point These roads unite just outside the town This made it necessary for McClernand to divide his force It was not only divided but it was separated by a deep ravine of the character above described One flank could not reinforce the other except by marching back to the junction of the roads McClernand put the divisions of Hovey Carr and A J Smith upon the right hand branch and Osterhaus on the left I was on the field by ten A M and inspected both flanks in person On the right the enemy if not being pressed back was at least not repulsing our advance On the left however Osterhaus was not faring so well He had been repulsed with some loss As soon as the road could be cleared of McClernand s troops I ordered up McPherson who was close upon the rear of the thirteenth corps with two brigades of Logan s division This was about noon I ordered him to send one brigade General John E Smith s was selected to support Osterhaus and to move to the left and flank the enemy out of his position This movement carried the brigade over a deep ravine to a third ridge and when Smith s troops were seen well through the ravine Osterhaus was directed to renew his front attack It was successful and unattended by heavy loss The enemy was sent in full retreat on their right and their left followed before sunset While the movement to our left was going on McClernand who was with his right flank sent me frequent requests for reinforcements although the force with him was not being pressed I had been upon the ground and knew it did not admit of his engaging all the men he had We followed up our victory until night overtook us about two miles from Port Gibson then the troops went into bivouac for the night CHAPTER XXXIV CAPTURE OF PORT GIBSON GRIERSON S RAID OCCUPATION OF GRAND GULF MOVEMENT UP THE BIG BLACK BATTLE OF RAYMOND We started next morning for Port Gibson as soon as it was light enough to see the road We were soon in the town and I was delighted to find that the enemy had not stopped to contest our crossing further at the bridge which he had burned The troops were set to work at once to construct a bridge across the South Fork of the Bayou Pierre At this time the water was high and the current rapid What might be called a raft bridge was soon constructed from material obtained from wooden buildings stables fences et cetera which sufficed for carrying the whole army over safely Colonel J H Wilson a member of my staff planned and superintended the construction of this bridge going into the water and working as hard as any one engaged Officers and men generally joined in this work When it was finished the army crossed and marched eight miles beyond to the North Fork that day One brigade of Logan s division was sent down the stream to occupy the attention of a rebel battery which had been left behind with infantry supports to prevent our repairing the burnt railroad bridge Two of his brigades were sent up the bayou to find a crossing and reach the North Fork to repair the bridge there The enemy soon left when he found we were building a bridge elsewhere Before leaving Port Gibson we were reinforced by Crocker s division McPherson s corps which had crossed the Mississippi at Bruinsburg and come up without stopping except to get two days rations McPherson still had one division west of the Mississippi River guarding the road from Milliken s Bend to the river below until Sherman s command should relieve it On leaving Bruinsburg for the front I left my son Frederick who had joined me a few weeks before on board one of the gunboats asleep and hoped to get away without him until after Grand Gulf should fall into our hands but on waking up he learned that I had gone and being guided by the sound of the battle raging at Thompson s Hill called the Battle of Port Gibson found his way to where I was He had no horse to ride at the time and I had no facilities for even preparing a meal He therefore foraged around the best he could until we reached Grand Gulf mister C A Dana then an officer of the War Department accompanied me on the Vicksburg campaign and through a portion of the siege He was in the same situation as Fred so far as transportation and mess arrangements were concerned The first time I call to mind seeing either of them after the battle they were mounted on two enormous horses grown white from age each equipped with dilapidated saddles and bridles Our trains arrived a few days later after which we were all perfectly equipped My son accompanied me throughout the campaign and siege and caused no anxiety either to me or to his mother who was at home He looked out for himself and was in every battle of the campaign His age then not quite thirteen enabled him to take in all he saw and to retain a recollection of it that would not be possible in more mature years When the movement from Bruinsburg commenced we were without a wagon train The train still west of the Mississippi was carried around with proper escort by a circuitous route from Milliken s Bend to Hard Times seventy or more miles below and did not get up for some days after the battle of Port Gibson My own horses headquarters transportation servants mess chest and everything except what I had on was with this train General A J Smith happened to have an extra horse at Bruinsburg which I borrowed with a saddle tree without upholstering further than stirrups I had no other for nearly a week It was necessary to have transportation for ammunition Provisions could be taken from the country but all the ammunition that can be carried on the person is soon exhausted when there is much fighting I directed therefore immediately on landing that all the vehicles and draft animals whether horses mules or oxen in the vicinity should be collected and loaded to their capacity with ammunition Quite a train was collected during the thirtieth and a motley train it was In it could be found fine carriages loaded nearly to the top with boxes of cartridges that had been pitched in promiscuously drawn by mules with plough harness straw collars rope lines et cetera long coupled wagons with racks for carrying cotton bales drawn by oxen and everything that could be found in the way of transportation on a plantation either for use or pleasure The making out of provision returns was stopped for the time No formalities were to retard our progress until a position was secured when the time could be spared to observe them It was at Port Gibson I first heard through a Southern paper of the complete success of Colonel Grierson who was making a raid through central Mississippi He had started from La Grange April seventeenth with three regiments of about seventeen hundred men On the twenty first he had detached Colonel Hatch with one regiment to destroy the railroad between Columbus and Macon and then return to La Grange Hatch had a sharp fight with the enemy at Columbus and retreated along the railroad destroying it at Okalona and Tupelo and arriving in La Grange April twenty six Grierson continued his movement with about one thousand men breaking the Vicksburg and Meridian railroad and the New Orleans and Jackson railroad arriving at Baton Rouge May twod This raid was of great importance for Grierson had attracted the attention of the enemy from the main movement against Vicksburg During the night of the twod of May the bridge over the North Fork was repaired and the troops commenced crossing at five the next morning Before the leading brigade was over it was fired upon by the enemy from a commanding position but they were soon driven off It was evident that the enemy was covering a retreat from Grand Gulf to Vicksburg Every commanding position from this Grindstone crossing to Hankinson s ferry over the Big Black was occupied by the retreating foe to delay our progress McPherson however reached Hankinson s ferry before night seized the ferry boat and sent a detachment of his command across and several miles north on the road to Vicksburg When the junction of the road going to Vicksburg with the road from Grand Gulf to Raymond and Jackson was reached Logan with his division was turned to the left towards Grand Gulf I went with him a short distance from this junction McPherson had encountered the largest force yet met since the battle of Port Gibson and had a skirmish nearly approaching a battle but the road Logan had taken enabled him to come up on the enemy s right flank and they soon gave way McPherson was ordered to hold Hankinson s ferry and the road back to Willow Springs with one division McClernand who was now in the rear was to join in this as well as to guard the line back down the bayou I did not want to take the chances of having an enemy lurking in our rear On the way from the junction to Grand Gulf where the road comes into the one from Vicksburg to the same place six or seven miles out I learned that the last of the enemy had retreated past that place on their way to Vicksburg I left Logan to make the proper disposition of his troops for the night while I rode into the town with an escort of about twenty cavalry Admiral Porter had already arrived with his fleet The enemy had abandoned his heavy guns and evacuated the place When I reached Grand Gulf May threed I had not been with my baggage since the twenty seventh of April and consequently had had no change of underclothing no meal except such as I could pick up sometimes at other headquarters and no tent to cover me The first thing I did was to get a bath borrow some fresh underclothing from one of the naval officers and get a good meal on the flag ship Then I wrote letters to the general in chief informing him of our present position dispatches to be telegraphed from Cairo orders to General Sullivan commanding above Vicksburg and gave orders to all my corps commanders About twelve o clock at night I was through my work and started for Hankinson s ferry arriving there before daylight While at Grand Gulf I heard from Banks who was on the Red River and who said that he could not be at Port Hudson before the tenth of May and then with only fifteen thousand men Up to this time my intention had been to secure Grand Gulf as a base of supplies detach McClernand s corps to Banks and company operate with him in the reduction of Port Hudson The news from Banks forced upon me a different plan of campaign from the one intended To wait for his company operation would have detained me at least a month The reinforcements would not have reached ten thousand men after deducting casualties and necessary river guards at all high points close to the river for over three hundred miles The enemy would have strengthened his position and been reinforced by more men than Banks could have brought I therefore determined to move independently of Banks cut loose from my base destroy the rebel force in rear of Vicksburg and invest or capture the city Grand Gulf was accordingly given up as a base and the authorities at Washington were notified I knew well that Halleck s caution would lead him to disapprove of this course but it was the only one that gave any chance of success The time it would take to communicate with Washington and get a reply would be so great that I could not be interfered with until it was demonstrated whether my plan was practicable Even Sherman who afterwards ignored bases of supplies other than what were afforded by the country while marching through four States of the Confederacy with an army more than twice as large as mine at this time wrote me from Hankinson s ferry advising me of the impossibility of supplying our army over a single road He urged me to stop all troops till your army is partially supplied with wagons and then act as quick as possible for this road will be jammed as sure as life To this I replied I do not calculate upon the possibility of supplying the army with full rations from Grand Gulf I know it will be impossible without constructing additional roads What I do expect is to get up what rations of hard bread coffee and salt we can and make the country furnish the balance We started from Bruinsburg with an average of about two days rations and received no more from our own supplies for some days abundance was found in the mean time A delay would give the enemy time to reinforce and fortify McClernand s and McPherson s commands were kept substantially as they were on the night of the twod awaiting supplies sufficient to give them three days rations in haversacks Beef mutton poultry and forage were found in abundance Quite a quantity of bacon and molasses was also secured from the country but bread and coffee could not be obtained in quantity sufficient for all the men Every plantation however had a run of stone propelled by mule power to grind corn for the owners and their slaves All these were kept running while we were stopping day and night and when we were marching during the night at all plantations covered by the troops But the product was taken by the troops nearest by so that the majority of the command was destined to go without bread until a new base was established on the Yazoo above Vicksburg While the troops were awaiting the arrival of rations I ordered reconnoissances made by McClernand and McPherson with the view of leading the enemy to believe that we intended to cross the Big Black and attack the city at once On the sixth Sherman arrived at Grand Gulf and crossed his command that night and the next day Three days rations had been brought up from Grand Gulf for the advanced troops and were issued Orders were given for a forward movement the next day Sherman was directed to order up Blair who had been left behind to guard the road from Milliken s Bend to Hard Times with two brigades The quartermaster at Young s Point was ordered to send two hundred wagons with Blair and the commissary was to load them with hard bread coffee sugar salt and one hundred thousand pounds of salt meat On the threed Hurlbut who had been left at Memphis was ordered to send four regiments from his command to Milliken s Bend to relieve Blair s division and on the fifth he was ordered to send Lauman s division in addition the latter to join the army in the field The four regiments were to be taken from troops near the river so that there would be no delay During the night of the sixth McPherson drew in his troops north of the Big Black and was off at an early hour on the road to Jackson via Rocky Springs Utica and Raymond That night he and McClernand were both at Rocky Springs ten miles from Hankinson s ferry McPherson remained there during the eighth while McClernand moved to Big Sandy and Sherman marched from Grand Gulf to Hankinson s ferry The ninth McPherson moved to a point within a few miles west of Utica McClernand and Sherman remained where they were On the tenth McPherson moved to Utica Sherman to Big Sandy McClernand was still at Big Sandy The eleventh McClernand was at Five Mile Creek Sherman at Auburn McPherson five miles advanced from Utica May twelfth McClernand was at Fourteen Mile Creek Sherman at Fourteen Mile Creek McPherson at Raymond after a battle After McPherson crossed the Big Black at Hankinson s ferry Vicksburg could have been approached and besieged by the south side It is not probable however that Pemberton would have permitted a close besiegement The broken nature of the ground would have enabled him to hold a strong defensible line from the river south of the city to the Big Black retaining possession of the railroad back to that point It was my plan therefore to get to the railroad east of Vicksburg and approach from that direction Accordingly McPherson s troops that had crossed the Big Black were withdrawn and the movement east to Jackson commenced As has been stated before the country is very much broken and the roads generally confined to the tops of the hills The troops were moved one sometimes two corps at a time to reach designated points out parallel to the railroad and only from six to ten miles from it McClernand s corps was kept with its left flank on the Big Black guarding all the crossings Fourteen Mile Creek a stream substantially parallel with the railroad was reached and crossings effected by McClernand and Sherman with slight loss McPherson was to the right of Sherman extending to Raymond The cavalry was used in this advance in reconnoitring to find the roads to cover our advances and to find the most practicable routes from one command to another so they could support each other in case of an attack In making this move I estimated Pemberton s movable force at Vicksburg at about eighteen thousand men with smaller forces at Haines Bluff and Jackson It would not be possible for Pemberton to attack me with all his troops at one place and I determined to throw my army between his and fight him in detail This was done with success but I found afterwards that I had entirely under estimated Pemberton s strength Up to this point our movements had been made without serious opposition My line was now nearly parallel with the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad and about seven miles south of it The right was at Raymond eighteen miles from Jackson McPherson commanding Sherman in the centre on Fourteen Mile Creek his advance thrown across McClernand to the left also on Fourteen Mile Creek advance across and his pickets within two miles of Edward s station where the enemy had concentrated a considerable force and where they undoubtedly expected us to attack McClernand s left was on the Big Black In all our moves up to this time the left had hugged the Big Black closely and all the ferries had been guarded to prevent the enemy throwing a force on our rear McPherson encountered the enemy five thousand strong with two batteries under General Gregg about two miles out of Raymond This was about two P M Logan was in advance with one of his brigades He deployed and moved up to engage the enemy McPherson ordered the road in rear to be cleared of wagons and the balance of Logan s division and Crocker s which was still farther in rear to come forward with all dispatch The order was obeyed with alacrity Logan got his division in position for assault before Crocker could get up and attacked with vigor carrying the enemy s position easily sending Gregg flying from the field not to appear against our front again until we met at Jackson In this battle McPherson lost sixty six killed three hundred thirty nine wounded and thirty seven missing nearly or quite all from Logan s division The enemy s loss was one hundred killed three hundred five wounded besides four hundred fifteen taken prisoners I regarded Logan and Crocker as being as competent division commanders as could be found in or out of the army and both equal to a much higher command Crocker however was dying of consumption when he volunteered His weak condition never put him on the sick report when there was a battle in prospect as long as he could keep on his feet He died not long after the close of the rebellion CHAPTER XXXV MOVEMENT AGAINST JACKSON FALL OF JACKSON INTERCEPTING THE ENEMY BATTLE OF CHAMPION S HILL When the news reached me of McPherson s victory at Raymond about sundown my position was with Sherman I decided at once to turn the whole column towards Jackson and capture that place without delay Pemberton was now on my left with as I supposed about eighteen thousand men in fact as I learned afterwards with nearly fifty thousand A force was also collecting on my right at Jackson the point where all the railroads communicating with Vicksburg connect All the enemy s supplies of men and stores would come by that point As I hoped in the end to besiege Vicksburg I must first destroy all possibility of aid I therefore determined to move swiftly towards Jackson destroy or drive any force in that direction and then turn upon Pemberton But by moving against Jackson I uncovered my own communication So I finally decided to have none to cut loose altogether from my base and move my whole force eastward I then had no fears for my communications and if I moved quickly enough could turn upon Pemberton before he could attack me in the rear Accordingly all previous orders given during the day for movements on the thirteenth were annulled by new ones McPherson was ordered at daylight to move on Clinton ten miles from Jackson Sherman was notified of my determination to capture Jackson and work from there westward He was ordered to start at four in the morning and march to Raymond McClernand was ordered to march with three divisions by Dillon s to Raymond One was left to guard the crossing of the Big Black On the tenth I had received a letter from Banks on the Red River asking reinforcements Porter had gone to his assistance with a part of his fleet on the threed and I now wrote to him describing my position and declining to send any troops I looked upon side movements as long as the enemy held Port Hudson and Vicksburg as a waste of time and material General Joseph E Johnston arrived at Jackson in the night of the thirteenth from Tennessee and immediately assumed command of all the Confederate troops in Mississippi I knew he was expecting reinforcements from the south and east On the sixth I had written to General Halleck Information from the other side leaves me to believe the enemy are bringing forces from Tullahoma Up to this time my troops had been kept in supporting distances of each other as far as the nature of the country would admit Reconnoissances were constantly made from each corps to enable them to acquaint themselves with the most practicable routes from one to another in case a union became necessary McPherson reached Clinton with the advance early on the thirteenth and immediately set to work destroying the railroad Sherman s advance reached Raymond before the last of McPherson s command had got out of the town McClernand withdrew from the front of the enemy at Edward s station with much skill and without loss and reached his position for the night in good order On the night of the thirteenth McPherson was ordered to march at early dawn upon Jackson only fifteen miles away Sherman was given the same order but he was to move by the direct road from Raymond to Jackson which is south of the road McPherson was on and does not approach within two miles of it at the point where it crossed the line of intrenchments which at that time defended the city McClernand was ordered to move one division of his command to Clinton one division a few miles beyond Mississippi Springs following Sherman s line and a third to Raymond He was also directed to send his siege guns four in number with the troops going by Mississippi Springs McClernand s position was an advantageous one in any event With one division at Clinton he was in position to reinforce McPherson at Jackson rapidly if it became necessary the division beyond Mississippi Springs was equally available to reinforce Sherman the one at Raymond could take either road He still had two other divisions farther back now that Blair had come up available within a day at Jackson If this last command should not be wanted at Jackson they were already one day s march from there on their way to Vicksburg and on three different roads leading to the latter city But the most important consideration in my mind was to have a force confronting Pemberton if he should come out to attack my rear This I expected him to do as shown further on he was directed by Johnston to make this very move I notified General Halleck that I should attack the State capital on the fourteenth A courier carried the dispatch to Grand Gulf through an unprotected country Sherman and McPherson communicated with each other during the night and arranged to reach Jackson at about the same hour It rained in torrents during the night of the thirteenth and the fore part of the day of the fourteenth The roads were intolerable and in some places on Sherman s line where the land was low they were covered more than a foot deep with water But the troops never murmured By nine o clock Crocker of McPherson s corps who was now in advance came upon the enemy s pickets and speedily drove them in upon the main body They were outside of the intrenchments in a strong position and proved to be the troops that had been driven out of Raymond Johnston had been reinforced during the night by Georgia and South Carolina regiments so that his force amounted to eleven thousand men and he was expecting still more Sherman also came upon the rebel pickets some distance out from the town but speedily drove them in He was now on the south and south west of Jackson confronting the Confederates behind their breastworks while McPherson s right was nearly two miles north occupying a line running north and south across the Vicksburg railroad Artillery was brought up and reconnoissances made preparatory to an assault McPherson brought up Logan s division while he deployed Crocker s for the assault Sherman made similar dispositions on the right By eleven A M both were ready to attack Crocker moved his division forward preceded by a strong skirmish line These troops at once encountered the enemy s advance and drove it back on the main body when they returned to their proper regiment and the whole division charged routing the enemy completely and driving him into this main line This stand by the enemy was made more than two miles outside of his main fortifications McPherson followed up with his command until within range of the guns of the enemy from their intrenchments when he halted to bring his troops into line and reconnoitre to determine the next move It was now about noon While this was going on Sherman was confronting a rebel battery which enfiladed the road on which he was marching the Mississippi Springs road and commanded a bridge spanning a stream over which he had to pass By detaching right and left the stream was forced and the enemy flanked and speedily driven within the main line This brought our whole line in front of the enemy s line of works which was continuous on the north west and south sides from the Pearl River north of the city to the same river south I was with Sherman He was confronted by a force sufficient to hold us back Appearances did not justify an assault where we were I had directed Sherman to send a force to the right and to reconnoitre as far as to the Pearl River This force Tuttle s division not returning I rode to the right with my staff and soon found that the enemy had left that part of the line Tuttle s movement or McPherson s pressure had no doubt led Johnston to order a retreat leaving only the men at the guns to retard us while he was getting away Tuttle had seen this and passing through the lines without resistance came up in the rear of the artillerists confronting Sherman and captured them with ten pieces of artillery I rode immediately to the State House where I was soon followed by Sherman About the same time McPherson discovered that the enemy was leaving his front and advanced Crocker who was so close upon the enemy that they could not move their guns or destroy them He captured seven guns and moving on hoisted the National flag over the rebel capital of Mississippi Stevenson s brigade was sent to cut off the rebel retreat but was too late or not expeditious enough Our loss in this engagement was McPherson thirty seven killed two hundred twenty eight wounded Sherman four killed and twenty one wounded and missing The enemy lost eight hundred forty five killed wounded and captured Seventeen guns fell into our hands and the enemy destroyed by fire their store houses containing a large amount of commissary stores On this day Blair reached New Auburn and joined McClernand s fourth division He had with him two hundred wagons loaded with rations the only commissary supplies received during the entire campaign I slept that night in the room that Johnston was said to have occupied the night before About four in the afternoon I sent for the corps commanders and directed the dispositions to be made of their troops Sherman was to remain in Jackson until he destroyed that place as a railroad centre and manufacturing city of military supplies He did the work most effectually Sherman and I went together into a manufactory which had not ceased work on account of the battle nor for the entrance of Yankee troops Our presence did not seem to attract the attention of either the manager or the operatives most of whom were girls We looked on for a while to see the tent cloth which they were making roll out of the looms with C S A woven in each bolt There was an immense amount of cotton in bales stacked outside Finally I told Sherman I thought they had done work enough The operatives were told they could leave and take with them what cloth they could carry In a few minutes cotton and factory were in a blaze The proprietor visited Washington while I was President to get his pay for this property claiming that it was private He asked me to give him a statement of the fact that his property had been destroyed by National troops so that he might use it with Congress where he was pressing or proposed to press his claim I declined On the night of the thirteenth Johnston sent the following dispatch to Pemberton at Edward s station I have lately arrived and learn that Major General Sherman is between us with four divisions at Clinton It is important to establish communication that you may be reinforced If practicable come up in his rear at once To beat such a detachment would be of immense value All the troops you can quickly assemble should be brought Time is all important This dispatch was sent in triplicate by different messengers One of the messengers happened to be a loyal man who had been expelled from Memphis some months before by Hurlbut for uttering disloyal and threatening sentiments There was a good deal of parade about his expulsion ostensibly as a warning to those who entertained the sentiments he expressed but Hurlbut and the expelled man understood each other He delivered his copy of Johnston s dispatch to McPherson who forwarded it to me Receiving this dispatch on the fourteenth I ordered McPherson to move promptly in the morning back to Bolton the nearest point where Johnston could reach the road Bolton is about twenty miles west of Jackson I also informed McClernand of the capture of Jackson and sent him the following order It is evidently the design of the enemy to get north of us and cross the Big Black and beat us into Vicksburg We must not allow them to do this Turn all your forces towards Bolton station and make all dispatch in getting there Move troops by the most direct road from wherever they may be on the receipt of this order And to Blair I wrote Their design is evidently to cross the Big Black and pass down the peninsula between the Big Black and Yazoo rivers We must beat them Turn your troops immediately to Bolton take all the trains with you Smith s division and any other troops now with you will go to the same place If practicable take parallel roads so as to divide your troops and train Johnston stopped on the Canton road only six miles north of Jackson the night of the fourteenth He sent from there to Pemberton dispatches announcing the loss of Jackson and the following order As soon as the reinforcements are all up they must be united to the rest of the army I am anxious to see a force assembled that may be able to inflict a heavy blow upon the enemy Can Grant supply himself from the Mississippi Can you not cut him off from it and above all should he be compelled to fall back for want of supplies beat him The concentration of my troops was easy considering the character of the country McPherson moved along the road parallel with and near the railroad McClernand s command was one division Hovey s on the road McPherson had to take but with a start of four miles One Osterhaus was at Raymond on a converging road that intersected the other near Champion s Hill one Carr s had to pass over the same road with Osterhaus but being back at Mississippi Springs would not be detained by it the fourth Smith s with Blair s division was near Auburn with a different road to pass over McClernand faced about and moved promptly His cavalry from Raymond seized Bolton by half past nine in the morning driving out the enemy s pickets and capturing several men The night of the fifteenth Hovey was at Bolton Carr and Osterhaus were about three miles south but abreast facing west Smith was north of Raymond with Blair in his rear McPherson s command with Logan in front had marched at seven o clock and by four reached Hovey and went into camp Crocker bivouacked just in Hovey s rear on the Clinton road Sherman with two divisions was in Jackson completing the destruction of roads bridges and military factories I rode in person out to Clinton On my arrival I ordered McClernand to move early in the morning on Edward s station cautioning him to watch for the enemy and not bring on an engagement unless he felt very certain of success I naturally expected that Pemberton would endeavor to obey the orders of his superior which I have shown were to attack us at Clinton This indeed I knew he could not do but I felt sure he would make the attempt to reach that point It turned out however that he had decided his superior s plans were impracticable and consequently determined to move south from Edward s station and get between me and my base I however had no base having abandoned it more than a week before On the fifteenth Pemberton had actually marched south from Edward s station but the rains had swollen Baker s Creek which he had to cross so much that he could not ford it and the bridges were washed away This brought him back to the Jackson road on which there was a good bridge over Baker s Creek Some of his troops were marching until midnight to get there Receiving here early on the sixteenth a repetition of his order to join Johnston at Clinton he concluded to obey and sent a dispatch to his chief informing him of the route by which he might be expected About five o clock in the morning sixteenth two men who had been employed on the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad were brought to me They reported that they had passed through Pemberton s army in the night and that it was still marching east They reported him to have eighty regiments of infantry and ten batteries in all about twenty five thousand men I had expected to leave Sherman at Jackson another day in order to complete his work but getting the above information I sent him orders to move with all dispatch to Bolton and to put one division with an ammunition train on the road at once with directions to its commander to march with all possible speed until he came up to our rear Within an hour after receiving this order Steele s division was on the road At the same time I dispatched to Blair who was near Auburn to move with all speed to Edward s station McClernand was directed to embrace Blair in his command for the present Blair s division was a part of the fifteenth army corps Sherman s but as it was on its way to join its corps it naturally struck our left first now that we had faced about and were moving west The fifteenth corps when it got up would be on our extreme right McPherson was directed to get his trains out of the way of the troops and to follow Hovey s division as closely as possible McClernand had two roads about three miles apart converging at Edward s station over which to march his troops Hovey s division of his corps had the advance on a third road the Clinton still farther north McClernand was directed to move Blair s and A J Smith s divisions by the southernmost of these roads and Osterhaus and Carr by the middle road Orders were to move cautiously with skirmishers to the front to feel for the enemy Smith s division on the most southern road was the first to encounter the enemy s pickets who were speedily driven in Osterhaus on the middle road hearing the firing pushed his skirmishers forward found the enemy s pickets and forced them back to the main line About the same time Hovey encountered the enemy on the northern or direct wagon road from Jackson to Vicksburg McPherson was hastening up to join Hovey but was embarrassed by Hovey s trains occupying the roads I was still back at Clinton McPherson sent me word of the situation and expressed the wish that I was up By half past seven I was on the road and proceeded rapidly to the front ordering all trains that were in front of troops off the road When I arrived Hovey s skirmishing amounted almost to a battle McClernand was in person on the middle road and had a shorter distance to march to reach the enemy s position than McPherson I sent him word by a staff officer to push forward and attack These orders were repeated several times without apparently expediting McClernand s advance Champion s Hill where Pemberton had chosen his position to receive us whether taken by accident or design was well selected It is one of the highest points in that section and commanded all the ground in range On the east side of the ridge which is quite precipitous is a ravine running first north then westerly terminating at Baker s Creek It was grown up thickly with large trees and undergrowth making it difficult to penetrate with troops even when not defended The ridge occupied by the enemy terminated abruptly where the ravine turns westerly The left of the enemy occupied the north end of this ridge The Bolton and Edward s station wagon road turns almost due south at this point and ascends the ridge which it follows for about a mile then turning west descends by a gentle declivity to Baker s Creek nearly a mile away On the west side the slope of the ridge is gradual and is cultivated from near the summit to the creek There was when we were there a narrow belt of timber near the summit west of the road From Raymond there is a direct road to Edward s station some three miles west of Champion s Hill There is one also to Bolton From this latter road there is still another leaving it about three and a half miles before reaching Bolton and leads direct to the same station It was along these two roads that three divisions of McClernand s corps and Blair of Sherman s temporarily under McClernand were moving Hovey of McClernand s command was with McPherson farther north on the road from Bolton direct to Edward s station The middle road comes into the northern road at the point where the latter turns to the west and descends to Baker s Creek the southern road is still several miles south and does not intersect the others until it reaches Edward s station Pemberton s lines covered all these roads and faced east Hovey s line when it first drove in the enemy s pickets was formed parallel to that of the enemy and confronted his left By eleven o clock the skirmishing had grown into a hard contested battle Hovey alone before other troops could be got to assist him had captured a battery of the enemy But he was not able to hold his position and had to abandon the artillery McPherson brought up his troops as fast as possible Logan in front and posted them on the right of Hovey and across the flank of the enemy Logan reinforced Hovey with one brigade from his division with his other two he moved farther west to make room for Crocker who was coming up as rapidly as the roads would admit Hovey was still being heavily pressed and was calling on me for more reinforcements I ordered Crocker who was now coming up to send one brigade from his division McPherson ordered two batteries to be stationed where they nearly enfiladed the enemy s line and they did good execution From Logan s position now a direct forward movement carried him over open fields in rear of the enemy and in a line parallel with them He did make exactly this move attacking however the enemy through the belt of woods covering the west slope of the hill for a short distance Up to this time I had kept my position near Hovey where we were the most heavily pressed but about noon I moved with a part of my staff by our right around until I came up with Logan himself I found him near the road leading down to Baker s Creek He was actually in command of the only road over which the enemy could retreat Hovey reinforced by two brigades from McPherson s command confronted the enemy s left Crocker with two brigades covered their left flank McClernand two hours before had been within two miles and a half of their centre with two divisions and the two divisions Blair s and A J Smith s were confronting the rebel right Ransom with a brigade of McArthur s division of the seventeenth corps McPherson s had crossed the river at Grand Gulf a few days before and was coming up on their right flank Neither Logan nor I knew that we had cut off the retreat of the enemy Just at this juncture a messenger came from Hovey asking for more reinforcements There were none to spare I then gave an order to move McPherson s command by the left flank around to Hovey This uncovered the rebel line of retreat which was soon taken advantage of by the enemy During all this time Hovey reinforced as he was by a brigade from Logan and another from Crocker and by Crocker gallantly coming up with two other brigades on his right had made several assaults the last one about the time the road was opened to the rear The enemy fled precipitately This was between three and four o clock I rode forward or rather back to where the middle road intersects the north road and found the skirmishers of Carr s division just coming in Osterhaus was farther south and soon after came up with skirmishers advanced in like manner Hovey s division and McPherson s two divisions with him had marched and fought from early dawn and were not in the best condition to follow the retreating foe I sent orders to Osterhaus to pursue the enemy and to Carr whom I saw personally I explained the situation and directed him to pursue vigorously as far as the Big Black and to cross it if he could Osterhaus to follow him The pursuit was continued until after dark The battle of Champion s Hill lasted about four hours hard fighting preceded by two or three hours of skirmishing some of which almost rose to the dignity of battle Every man of Hovey s division and of McPherson s two divisions was engaged during the battle No other part of my command was engaged at all except that as described before Osterhaus s and A J Smith s divisions had encountered the rebel advanced pickets as early as half past seven Their positions were admirable for advancing upon the enemy s line McClernand with two divisions was within a few miles of the battle field long before noon and in easy hearing I sent him repeated orders by staff officers fully competent to explain to him the situation These traversed the wood separating us without escort and directed him to push forward but he did not come It is true in front of McClernand there was a small force of the enemy and posted in a good position behind a ravine obstructing his advance but if he had moved to the right by the road my staff officers had followed the enemy must either have fallen back or been cut off Instead of this he sent orders to Hovey who belonged to his corps to join on to his right flank Hovey was bearing the brunt of the battle at the time To obey the order he would have had to pull out from the front of the enemy and march back as far as McClernand had to advance to get into battle and substantially over the same ground Of course I did not permit Hovey to obey the order of his intermediate superior We had in this battle about fifteen thousand men absolutely engaged This excludes those that did not get up all of McClernand s command except Hovey Our loss was four hundred ten killed eighteen forty four wounded and one hundred eighty seven missing Hovey alone lost twelve hundred killed wounded and missing more than one third of his division Had McClernand come up with reasonable promptness or had I known the ground as I did afterwards I cannot see how Pemberton could have escaped with any organized force As it was he lost over three thousand killed and wounded and about three thousand captured in battle and in pursuit Loring s division which was the right of Pemberton s line was cut off from the retreating army and never got back into Vicksburg Pemberton himself fell back that night to the Big Black River His troops did not stop before midnight and many of them left before the general retreat commenced and no doubt a good part of them returned to their homes Logan alone captured thirteen hundred prisoners and eleven guns Hovey captured three hundred under fire and about seven hundred in all exclusive of five hundred sick and wounded whom he paroled thus making twelve hundred McPherson joined in the advance as soon as his men could fill their cartridge boxes leaving one brigade to guard our wounded The pursuit was continued as long as it was light enough to see the road The night of the sixteenth of May found McPherson s command bivouacked from two to six miles west of the battlefield along the line of the road to Vicksburg Carr and Osterhaus were at Edward s station and Blair was about three miles south east Hovey remained on the field where his troops had fought so bravely and bled so freely Much war material abandoned by the enemy was picked up on the battle field among it thirty pieces of artillery I pushed through the advancing column with my staff and kept in advance until after night Finding ourselves alone we stopped and took possession of a vacant house As no troops came up we moved back a mile or more until we met the head of the column just going into bivouac on the road We had no tents so we occupied the porch of a house which had been taken for a rebel hospital and which was filled with wounded and dying who had been brought from the battle field we had just left While a battle is raging one can see his enemy mowed down by the thousand or the ten thousand with great composure but after the battle these scenes are distressing and one is naturally disposed to do as much to alleviate the suffering of an enemy as a friend CHAPTER XXXVI BATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE CROSSING THE BIG BLACK INVESTMENT OF VICKSBURG ASSAULTING THE WORKS We were now assured of our position between Johnston and Pemberton without a possibility of a junction of their forces Pemberton might have made a night march to the Big Black crossed the bridge there and by moving north on the west side have eluded us and finally returned to Johnston But this would have given us Vicksburg It would have been his proper move however and the one Johnston would have made had he been in Pemberton s place In fact it would have been in conformity with Johnston s orders to Pemberton Sherman left Jackson with the last of his troops about noon on the sixteenth and reached Bolton twenty miles west before halting His rear guard did not get in until two A M the seventeenth but renewed their march by daylight He paroled his prisoners at Jackson and was forced to leave his own wounded in care of surgeons and attendants At Bolton he was informed of our victory He was directed to commence the march early next day and to diverge from the road he was on to Bridgeport on the Big Black River some eleven miles above the point where we expected to find the enemy Blair was ordered to join him there with the pontoon train as early as possible This movement brought Sherman s corps together and at a point where I hoped a crossing of the Big Black might be effected and Sherman s corps used to flank the enemy out of his position in our front thus opening a crossing for the remainder of the army I informed him that I would endeavor to hold the enemy in my front while he crossed the river The advance division Carr s McClernand s corps resumed the pursuit at half past three A M on the seventeenth followed closely by Osterhaus McPherson bringing up the rear with his corps As I expected the enemy was found in position on the Big Black The point was only six miles from that where my advance had rested for the night and was reached at an early hour Here the river makes a turn to the west and has washed close up to the high land the east side is a low bottom sometimes overflowed at very high water but was cleared and in cultivation A bayou runs irregularly across this low land the bottom of which however is above the surface of the Big Black at ordinary stages When the river is full water runs through it converting the point of land into an island The bayou was grown up with timber which the enemy had felled into the ditch At this time there was a foot or two of water in it The rebels had constructed a parapet along the inner bank of this bayou by using cotton bales from the plantation close by and throwing dirt over them The whole was thoroughly commanded from the height west of the river At the upper end of the bayou there was a strip of uncleared land which afforded a cover for a portion of our men Carr s division was deployed on our right Lawler s brigade forming his extreme right and reaching through these woods to the river above Osterhaus division was deployed to the left of Carr and covered the enemy s entire front McPherson was in column on the road the head close by ready to come in wherever he could be of assistance While the troops were standing as here described an officer from Banks staff came up and presented me with a letter from General Halleck dated the eleventh of May It had been sent by the way of New Orleans to Banks to be forwarded to me It ordered me to return to Grand Gulf and to company operate from there with Banks against Port Hudson and then to return with our combined forces to besiege Vicksburg I told the officer that the order came too late and that Halleck would not give it now if he knew our position The bearer of the dispatch insisted that I ought to obey the order and was giving arguments to support his position when I heard great cheering to the right of our line and looking in that direction saw Lawler in his shirt sleeves leading a charge upon the enemy I immediately mounted my horse and rode in the direction of the charge and saw no more of the officer who delivered the dispatch I think not even to this day The assault was successful But little resistance was made The enemy fled from the west bank of the river burning the bridge behind him and leaving the men and guns on the east side to fall into our hands Many tried to escape by swimming the river Some succeeded and some were drowned in the attempt Eighteen guns were captured and seventeen fifty one prisoners Our loss was thirty nine killed two hundred thirty seven wounded and three missing The enemy probably lost but few men except those captured and drowned But for the successful and complete destruction of the bridge I have but little doubt that we should have followed the enemy so closely as to prevent his occupying his defences around Vicksburg As the bridge was destroyed and the river was high new bridges had to be built It was but little after nine o clock A M when the capture took place As soon as work could be commenced orders were given for the construction of three bridges One was taken charge of by Lieutenant Hains of the Engineer Corps one by General McPherson himself and one by General Ransom a most gallant and intelligent volunteer officer My recollection is that Hains built a raft bridge McPherson a pontoon using cotton bales in large numbers for pontoons and that Ransom felled trees on opposite banks of the river cutting only on one side of the tree so that they would fall with their tops interlacing in the river without the trees being entirely severed from their stumps A bridge was then made with these trees to support the roadway Lumber was taken from buildings cotton gins and wherever found for this purpose By eight o clock in the morning of the eighteenth all three bridges were complete and the troops were crossing Sherman reached Bridgeport about noon of the seventeenth and found Blair with the pontoon train already there A few of the enemy were intrenched on the west bank but they made little resistance and soon surrendered Two divisions were crossed that night and the third the following morning On the eighteenth I moved along the Vicksburg road in advance of the troops and as soon as possible joined Sherman My first anxiety was to secure a base of supplies on the Yazoo River above Vicksburg Sherman s line of march led him to the very point on Walnut Hills occupied by the enemy the December before when he was repulsed Sherman was equally anxious with myself Our impatience led us to move in advance of the column and well up with the advanced skirmishers There were some detached works along the crest of the hill These were still occupied by the enemy or else the garrison from Haines Bluff had not all got past on their way to Vicksburg At all events the bullets of the enemy whistled by thick and fast for a short time In a few minutes Sherman had the pleasure of looking down from the spot coveted so much by him the December before on the ground where his command had lain so helpless for offensive action He turned to me saying that up to this minute he had felt no positive assurance of success This however he said was the end of one of the greatest campaigns in history and I ought to make a report of it at once Vicksburg was not yet captured and there was no telling what might happen before it was taken but whether captured or not this was a complete and successful campaign I do not claim to quote Sherman s language but the substance only My reason for mentioning this incident will appear further on McPherson after crossing the Big Black came into the Jackson and Vicksburg road which Sherman was on but to his rear He arrived at night near the lines of the enemy and went into camp McClernand moved by the direct road near the railroad to Mount Albans and then turned to the left and put his troops on the road from Baldwin s ferry to Vicksburg This brought him south of McPherson I now had my three corps up the works built for the defence of Vicksburg on three roads one to the north one to the east and one to the south east of the city By the morning of the nineteenth the investment was as complete as my limited number of troops would allow Sherman was on the right and covered the high ground from where it overlooked the Yazoo as far south east as his troops would extend McPherson joined on to his left and occupied ground on both sides of the Jackson road McClernand took up the ground to his left and extended as far towards Warrenton as he could keeping a continuous line On the nineteenth there was constant skirmishing with the enemy while we were getting into better position The enemy had been much demoralized by his defeats at Champion s Hill and the Big Black and I believed he would not make much effort to hold Vicksburg Accordingly at two o clock I ordered an assault It resulted in securing more advanced positions for all our troops where they were fully covered from the fire of the enemy The twentieth and twenty first were spent in strengthening our position and in making roads in rear of the army from Yazoo River or Chickasaw Bayou Most of the army had now been for three weeks with only five days rations issued by the commissary They had an abundance of food however but began to feel the want of bread I remember that in passing around to the left of the line on the twenty first a soldier recognizing me said in rather a low voice but yet so that I heard him Hard tack In a moment the cry was taken up all along the line Hard tack Hard tack I told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever since the arrival of the troops in building a road over which to supply them with everything they needed The cry was instantly changed to cheers By the night of the twenty first all the troops had full rations issued to them The bread and coffee were highly appreciated I now determined on a second assault Johnston was in my rear only fifty miles away with an army not much inferior in numbers to the one I had with me and I knew he was being reinforced There was danger of his coming to the assistance of Pemberton and after all he might defeat my anticipations of capturing the garrison if indeed he did not prevent the capture of the city The immediate capture of Vicksburg would save sending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere and would set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State But the first consideration of all was the troops believed they could carry the works in their front and would not have worked so patiently in the trenches if they had not been allowed to try The attack was ordered to commence on all parts of the line at ten o clock A M on the twenty twod with a furious cannonade from every battery in position All the corps commanders set their time by mine so that all might open the engagement at the same minute The attack was gallant and portions of each of the three corps succeeded in getting up to the very parapets of the enemy and in planting their battle flags upon them but at no place were we able to enter General McClernand reported that he had gained the enemy s intrenchments at several points and wanted reinforcements I occupied a position from which I believed I could see as well as he what took place in his front and I did not see the success he reported But his request for reinforcements being repeated I could not ignore it and sent him Quinby s division of the seventeenth corps Sherman and McPherson were both ordered to renew their assaults as a diversion in favor of McClernand This last attack only served to increase our casualties without giving any benefit whatever As soon as it was dark our troops that had reached the enemy s line and been obliged to remain there for security all day were withdrawn and thus ended the last assault upon Vicksburg CHAPTER XXXVII SIEGE OF VICKSBURG I now determined upon a regular siege to out camp the enemy as it were and to incur no more losses The experience of the twenty twod convinced officers and men that this was best and they went to work on the defences and approaches with a will With the navy holding the river the investment of Vicksburg was complete As long as we could hold our position the enemy was limited in supplies of food men and munitions of war to what they had on hand These could not last always The crossing of troops at Bruinsburg commenced April thirtieth On the eighteenth of May the army was in rear of Vicksburg On the nineteenth just twenty days after the crossing the city was completely invested and an assault had been made five distinct battles besides continuous skirmishing had been fought and won by the Union forces the capital of the State had fallen and its arsenals military manufactories and everything useful for military purposes had been destroyed an average of about one hundred and eighty miles had been marched by the troops engaged but five days rations had been issued and no forage over six thousand prisoners had been captured and as many more of the enemy had been killed or wounded twenty seven heavy cannon and sixty one field pieces had fallen into our hands and four hundred miles of the river from Vicksburg to Port Hudson had become ours The Union force that had crossed the Mississippi River up to this time was less than forty three thousand men One division of these Blair s only arrived in time to take part in the battle of Champion s Hill but was not engaged there and one brigade Ransom s of McPherson s corps reached the field after the battle The enemy had at Vicksburg Grand Gulf Jackson and on the roads between these places over sixty thousand men They were in their own country where no rear guards were necessary The country is admirable for defence but difficult for the conduct of an offensive campaign All their troops had to be met We were fortunate to say the least in meeting them in detail at Port Gibson seven or eight thousand at Raymond five thousand at Jackson from eight to eleven thousand at Champion s Hill twenty five thousand at the Big Black four thousand A part of those met at Jackson were all that was left of those encountered at Raymond They were beaten in detail by a force smaller than their own upon their own ground Our loss up to this time was KILLED WOUNDED MISSING Port Gibson one hundred thirty one seven hundred nineteen twenty five South Fork Bayou Pierre one Skirmishes May three one nine Fourteen Mile Creek six twenty four Raymond sixty six three hundred thirty nine thirty nine Jackson forty two two hundred fifty one seven Champion s Hill four hundred ten eighteen forty four one hundred eighty seven Big Black thirty nine two hundred thirty seven three Bridgeport one Total six hundred ninety five three thousand four hundred twenty five two hundred fifty nine Of the wounded many were but slightly so and continued on duty Not half of them were disabled for any length of time After the unsuccessful assault of the twenty twod the work of the regular siege began Sherman occupied the right starting from the river above Vicksburg McPherson the centre McArthur s division now with him and McClernand the left holding the road south to Warrenton Lauman s division arrived at this time and was placed on the extreme left of the line In the interval between the assaults of the nineteenth and twenty twod roads had been completed from the Yazoo River and Chickasaw Bayou around the rear of the army to enable us to bring up supplies of food and ammunition ground had been selected and cleared on which the troops were to be encamped and tents and cooking utensils were brought up The troops had been without these from the time of crossing the Mississippi up to this time All was now ready for the pick and spade Prentiss and Hurlbut were ordered to send forward every man that could be spared Cavalry especially was wanted to watch the fords along the Big Black and to observe Johnston I knew that Johnston was receiving reinforcements from Bragg who was confronting Rosecrans in Tennessee Vicksburg was so important to the enemy that I believed he would make the most strenuous efforts to raise the siege even at the risk of losing ground elsewhere My line was more than fifteen miles long extending from Haines Bluff to Vicksburg thence to Warrenton The line of the enemy was about seven In addition to this having an enemy at Canton and Jackson in our rear who was being constantly reinforced we required a second line of defence facing the other way I had not troops enough under my command to man these General Halleck appreciated the situation and without being asked forwarded reinforcements with all possible dispatch The ground about Vicksburg is admirable for defence On the north it is about two hundred feet above the Mississippi River at the highest point and very much cut up by the washing rains the ravines were grown up with cane and underbrush while the sides and tops were covered with a dense forest Farther south the ground flattens out somewhat and was in cultivation But here too it was cut up by ravines and small streams The enemy s line of defence followed the crest of a ridge from the river north of the city eastward then southerly around to the Jackson road full three miles back of the city thence in a southwesterly direction to the river Deep ravines of the description given lay in front of these defences As there is a succession of gullies cut out by rains along the side of the ridge the line was necessarily very irregular To follow each of these spurs with intrenchments so as to command the slopes on either side would have lengthened their line very much Generally therefore or in many places their line would run from near the head of one gully nearly straight to the head of another and an outer work triangular in shape generally open in the rear was thrown up on the point with a few men in this outer work they commanded the approaches to the main line completely The work to be done to make our position as strong against the enemy as his was against us was very great The problem was also complicated by our wanting our line as near that of the enemy as possible We had but four engineer officers with us Captain Prime of the Engineer Corps was the chief and the work at the beginning was mainly directed by him His health soon gave out when he was succeeded by Captain Comstock also of the Engineer Corps To provide assistants on such a long line I directed that all officers who had graduated at West Point where they had necessarily to study military engineering should in addition to their other duties assist in the work The chief quartermaster and the chief commissary were graduates The chief commissary now the Commissary General of the Army begged off however saying that there was nothing in engineering that he was good for unless he would do for a sap roller As soldiers require rations while working in the ditches as well as when marching and fighting and as we would be sure to lose him if he was used as a sap roller I let him off The general is a large man weighs two hundred and twenty pounds and is not tall We had no siege guns except six thirty two pounders and there were none at the West to draw from Admiral Porter however supplied us with a battery of navy guns of large calibre and with these and the field artillery used in the campaign the siege began The first thing to do was to get the artillery in batteries where they would occupy commanding positions then establish the camps under cover from the fire of the enemy but as near up as possible and then construct rifle pits and covered ways to connect the entire command by the shortest route The enemy did not harass us much while we were constructing our batteries Probably their artillery ammunition was short and their infantry was kept down by our sharpshooters who were always on the alert and ready to fire at a head whenever it showed itself above the rebel works In no place were our lines more than six hundred yards from the enemy It was necessary therefore to cover our men by something more than the ordinary parapet To give additional protection sand bags bullet proof were placed along the tops of the parapets far enough apart to make loop holes for musketry On top of these logs were put By these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty without fear of annoyance from sharpshooters The enemy used in their defence explosive musket balls no doubt thinking that bursting over our men in the trenches they would do some execution but I do not remember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one of these shells When they were hit and the ball exploded the wound was terrible In these cases a solid ball would have hit as well Their use is barbarous because they produce increased suffering without any corresponding advantage to those using them The enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men because we had an inexhaustible supply of ammunition to draw upon and used it freely Splinters from the timber would have made havoc among the men behind There were no mortars with the besiegers except what the navy had in front of the city but wooden ones were made by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found boring them out for six or twelve pound shells and binding them with strong iron bands These answered as cochorns and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy The labor of building the batteries and intrenching was largely done by the pioneers assisted by negroes who came within our lines and who were paid for their work but details from the troops had often to be made The work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible and when an advanced position was secured and covered from the fire of the enemy the batteries were advanced By the thirtieth of June there were two hundred and twenty guns in position mostly light field pieces besides a battery of heavy guns belonging to manned and commanded by the navy We were now as strong for defence against the garrison of Vicksburg as they were against us but I knew that Johnston was in our rear and was receiving constant reinforcements from the east He had at this time a larger force than I had had at any time prior to the battle of Champion s Hill As soon as the news of the arrival of the Union army behind Vicksburg reached the North floods of visitors began to pour in Some came to gratify curiosity some to see sons or brothers who had passed through the terrible ordeal members of the Christian and Sanitary Associations came to minister to the wants of the sick and the wounded Often those coming to see a son or brother would bring a dozen or two of poultry They did not know how little the gift would be appreciated Many of the soldiers had lived so much on chickens ducks and turkeys without bread during the march that the sight of poultry if they could get bacon almost took away their appetite But the intention was good Among the earliest arrivals was the Governor of Illinois with most of the State officers I naturally wanted to show them what there was of most interest In Sherman s front the ground was the most broken and most wooded and more was to be seen without exposure I therefore took them to Sherman s headquarters and presented them Before starting out to look at the lines possibly while Sherman s horse was being saddled there were many questions asked about the late campaign about which the North had been so imperfectly informed There was a little knot around Sherman and another around me and I heard Sherman repeating in the most animated manner what he had said to me when we first looked down from Walnut Hills upon the land below on the eighteenth of May adding Grant is entitled to every bit of the credit for the campaign I opposed it I wrote him a letter about it But for this speech it is not likely that Sherman s opposition would have ever been heard of His untiring energy and great efficiency during the campaign entitle him to a full share of all the credit due for its success He could not have done more if the plan had been his own thirteen On the twenty sixth of May I sent Blair s division up the Yazoo to drive out a force of the enemy supposed to be between the Big Black and the Yazoo The country was rich and full of supplies of both food and forage Blair was instructed to take all of it The cattle were to be driven in for the use of our army and the food and forage to be consumed by our troops or destroyed by fire all bridges were to be destroyed and the roads rendered as nearly impassable as possible Blair went forty five miles and was gone almost a week His work was effectually done I requested Porter at this time to send the marine brigade a floating nondescript force which had been assigned to his command and which proved very useful up to Haines Bluff to hold it until reinforcements could be sent On the twenty sixth I also received a letter from Banks asking me to reinforce him with ten thousand men at Port Hudson Of course I could not comply with his request nor did I think he needed them He was in no danger of an attack by the garrison in his front and there was no army organizing in his rear to raise the siege On the threed of June a brigade from Hurlbut s command arrived General Kimball commanding It was sent to Mechanicsburg some miles north east of Haines Bluff and about midway between the Big Black and the Yazoo A brigade of Blair s division and twelve hundred cavalry had already on Blair s return from the Yazoo been sent to the same place with instructions to watch the crossings of the Big Black River to destroy the roads in his Blair s front and to gather or destroy all supplies On the seventh of June our little force of colored and white troops across the Mississippi at Milliken s Bend were attacked by about three thousand men from Richard Taylor s trans Mississippi command With the aid of the gunboats they were speedily repelled I sent Mower s brigade over with instructions to drive the enemy beyond the Tensas Bayou and we had no further trouble in that quarter during the siege This was the first important engagement of the war in which colored troops were under fire These men were very raw having all been enlisted since the beginning of the siege but they behaved well On the eighth of June a full division arrived from Hurlbut s command under General Sooy Smith It was sent immediately to Haines Bluff and General C C Washburn was assigned to the general command at that point On the eleventh a strong division arrived from the Department of the Missouri under General Herron which was placed on our left This cut off the last possible chance of communication between Pemberton and Johnston as it enabled Lauman to close up on McClernand s left while Herron intrenched from Lauman to the water s edge At this point the water recedes a few hundred yards from the high land Through this opening no doubt the Confederate commanders had been able to get messengers under cover of night On the fourteenth General Parke arrived with two divisions of Burnside s corps and was immediately dispatched to Haines Bluff These latter troops Herron s and Parke s were the reinforcements already spoken of sent by Halleck in anticipation of their being needed They arrived none too soon I now had about seventy one thousand men More than half were disposed across the peninsula between the Yazoo at Haines Bluff and the Big Black with the division of Osterhaus watching the crossings of the latter river farther south and west from the crossing of the Jackson road to Baldwin s ferry and below There were eight roads leading into Vicksburg along which and their immediate sides our work was specially pushed and batteries advanced but no commanding point within range of the enemy was neglected On the seventeenth I received a letter from General Sherman and one on the eighteenth from General McPherson saying that their respective commands had complained to them of a fulsome congratulatory order published by General McClernand to the thirteenth corps which did great injustice to the other troops engaged in the campaign This order had been sent North and published and now papers containing it had reached our camps The order had not been heard of by me and certainly not by troops outside of McClernand s command until brought in this way I at once wrote to McClernand directing him to send me a copy of this order He did so and I at once relieved him from the command of the thirteenth army corps and ordered him back to Springfield Illinois The publication of his order in the press was in violation of War Department orders and also of mine CHAPTER XXXVIII JOHNSTON S MOVEMENTS FORTIFICATIONS AT HAINES BLUFF EXPLOSION OF THE MINE EXPLOSION OF THE SECOND MINE PREPARING FOR THE ASSAULT THE FLAG OF TRUCE MEETING WITH PEMBERTON NEGOTIATIONS FOR SURRENDER ACCEPTING THE TERMS SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG On the twenty twod of June positive information was received that Johnston had crossed the Big Black River for the purpose of attacking our rear to raise the siege and release Pemberton The correspondence between Johnston and Pemberton shows that all expectation of holding Vicksburg had by this time passed from Johnston s mind I immediately ordered Sherman to the command of all the forces from Haines Bluff to the Big Black River This amounted now to quite half the troops about Vicksburg Besides these Herron and A J Smith s divisions were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to reinforce Sherman Haines Bluff had been strongly fortified on the land side and on all commanding points from there to the Big Black at the railroad crossing batteries had been constructed The work of connecting by rifle pits where this was not already done was an easy task for the troops that were to defend them We were now looking west besieging Pemberton while we were also looking east to defend ourselves against an expected siege by Johnston But as against the garrison of Vicksburg we were as substantially protected as they were against us Where we were looking east and north we were strongly fortified and on the defensive Johnston evidently took in the situation and wisely I think abstained from making an assault on us because it would simply have inflicted loss on both sides without accomplishing any result We were strong enough to have taken the offensive against him but I did not feel disposed to take any risk of losing our hold upon Pemberton s army while I would have rejoiced at the opportunity of defending ourselves against an attack by Johnston From the twenty threed of May the work of fortifying and pushing forward our position nearer to the enemy had been steadily progressing At three points on the Jackson road in front of Leggett s brigade a sap was run up to the enemy s parapet and by the twenty fifth of June we had it undermined and the mine charged The enemy had countermined but did not succeed in reaching our mine At this particular point the hill on which the rebel work stands rises abruptly Our sap ran close up to the outside of the enemy s parapet In fact this parapet was also our protection The soldiers of the two sides occasionally conversed pleasantly across this barrier sometimes they exchanged the hard bread of the Union soldiers for the tobacco of the Confederates at other times the enemy threw over hand grenades and often our men catching them in their hands returned them Our mine had been started some distance back down the hill consequently when it had extended as far as the parapet it was many feet below it This caused the failure of the enemy in his search to find and destroy it On the twenty fifth of June at three o clock all being ready the mine was exploded A heavy artillery fire all along the line had been ordered to open with the explosion The effect was to blow the top of the hill off and make a crater where it stood The breach was not sufficient to enable us to pass a column of attack through In fact the enemy having failed to reach our mine had thrown up a line farther back where most of the men guarding that point were placed There were a few men however left at the advance line and others working in the countermine which was still being pushed to find ours All that were there were thrown into the air some of them coming down on our side still alive I remember one colored man who had been under ground at work when the explosion took place who was thrown to our side He was not much hurt but terribly frightened Some one asked him how high he had gone up Dun no massa but t ink bout t ree mile was his reply General Logan commanded at this point and took this colored man to his quarters where he did service to the end of the siege As soon as the explosion took place the crater was seized by two regiments of our troops who were near by under cover where they had been placed for the express purpose The enemy made a desperate effort to expel them but failed and soon retired behind the new line From here however they threw hand grenades which did some execution The compliment was returned by our men but not with so much effect The enemy could lay their grenades on the parapet which alone divided the contestants and roll them down upon us while from our side they had to be thrown over the parapet which was at considerable elevation During the night we made efforts to secure our position in the crater against the missiles of the enemy so as to run trenches along the outer base of their parapet right and left but the enemy continued throwing their grenades and brought boxes of field ammunition shells the fuses of which they would light with portfires and throw them by hand into our ranks We found it impossible to continue this work Another mine was consequently started which was exploded on the first of July destroying an entire rebel redan killing and wounding a considerable number of its occupants and leaving an immense chasm where it stood No attempt to charge was made this time the experience of the twenty fifth admonishing us Our loss in the first affair was about thirty killed and wounded The enemy must have lost more in the two explosions than we did in the first We lost none in the second From this time forward the work of mining and pushing our position nearer to the enemy was prosecuted with vigor and I determined to explode no more mines until we were ready to explode a number at different points and assault immediately after We were up now at three different points one in front of each corps to where only the parapet of the enemy divided us At this time an intercepted dispatch from Johnston to Pemberton informed me that Johnston intended to make a determined attack upon us in order to relieve the garrison at Vicksburg I knew the garrison would make no formidable effort to relieve itself The picket lines were so close to each other where there was space enough between the lines to post pickets that the men could converse On the twenty first of June I was informed through this means that Pemberton was preparing to escape by crossing to the Louisiana side under cover of night that he had employed workmen in making boats for that purpose that the men had been canvassed to ascertain if they would make an assault on the Yankees to cut their way out that they had refused and almost mutinied because their commander would not surrender and relieve their sufferings and had only been pacified by the assurance that boats enough would be finished in a week to carry them all over The rebel pickets also said that houses in the city had been pulled down to get material to build these boats with Afterwards this story was verified on entering the city we found a large number of very rudely constructed boats All necessary steps were at once taken to render such an attempt abortive Our pickets were doubled Admiral Porter was notified so that the river might be more closely watched material was collected on the west bank of the river to be set on fire and light up the river if the attempt was made and batteries were established along the levee crossing the peninsula on the Louisiana side Had the attempt been made the garrison of Vicksburg would have been drowned or made prisoners on the Louisiana side General Richard Taylor was expected on the west bank to company operate in this movement I believe but he did not come nor could he have done so with a force sufficient to be of service The Mississippi was now in our possession from its source to its mouth except in the immediate front of Vicksburg and of Port Hudson We had nearly exhausted the country along a line drawn from Lake Providence to opposite Bruinsburg The roads west were not of a character to draw supplies over for any considerable force By the first of July our approaches had reached the enemy s ditch at a number of places At ten points we could move under cover to within from five to one hundred yards of the enemy Orders were given to make all preparations for assault on the sixth of July The debouches were ordered widened to afford easy egress while the approaches were also to be widened to admit the troops to pass through four abreast Plank and bags filled with cotton packed in tightly were ordered prepared to enable the troops to cross the ditches On the night of the first of July Johnston was between Brownsville and the Big Black and wrote Pemberton from there that about the seventh of the month an attempt would be made to create a diversion to enable him to cut his way out Pemberton was a prisoner before this message reached him On July first Pemberton seeing no hope of outside relief addressed the following letter to each of his four division commanders Unless the siege of Vicksburg is raised or supplies are thrown in it will become necessary very shortly to evacuate the place I see no prospect of the former and there are many great if not insuperable obstacles in the way of the latter You are therefore requested to inform me with as little delay as possible as to the condition of your troops and their ability to make the marches and undergo the fatigues necessary to accomplish a successful evacuation Two of his generals suggested surrender and the other two practically did the same They expressed the opinion that an attempt to evacuate would fail Pemberton had previously got a message to Johnston suggesting that he should try to negotiate with me for a release of the garrison with their arms Johnston replied that it would be a confession of weakness for him to do so but he authorized Pemberton to use his name in making such an arrangement On the threed about ten o clock A M white flags appeared on a portion of the rebel works Hostilities along that part of the line ceased at once Soon two persons were seen coming towards our lines bearing a white flag They proved to be General Bowen a division commander and Colonel Montgomery aide de camp to Pemberton bearing the following letter to me I have the honor to propose an armistice for hours with the view to arranging terms for the capitulation of Vicksburg To this end if agreeable to you I will appoint three commissioners to meet a like number to be named by yourself at such place and hour to day as you may find convenient I make this proposition to save the further effusion of blood which must otherwise be shed to a frightful extent feeling myself fully able to maintain my position for a yet indefinite period This communication will be handed you under a flag of truce by Major General John S Bowen It was a glorious sight to officers and soldiers on the line where these white flags were visible and the news soon spread to all parts of the command The troops felt that their long and weary marches hard fighting ceaseless watching by night and day in a hot climate exposure to all sorts of weather to diseases and worst of all to the gibes of many Northern papers that came to them saying all their suffering was in vain that Vicksburg would never be taken were at last at an end and the Union sure to be saved Bowen was received by General A J Smith and asked to see me I had been a neighbor of Bowen s in Missouri and knew him well and favorably before the war but his request was refused He then suggested that I should meet Pemberton To this I sent a verbal message saying that if Pemberton desired it I would meet him in front of McPherson s corps at three o clock that afternoon I also sent the following written reply to Pemberton s letter Your note of this date is just received proposing an armistice for several hours for the purpose of arranging terms of capitulation through commissioners to be appointed et cetera The useless effusion of blood you propose stopping by this course can be ended at any time you may choose by the unconditional surrender of the city and garrison Men who have shown so much endurance and courage as those now in Vicksburg will always challenge the respect of an adversary and I can assure you will be treated with all the respect due to prisoners of war I do not favor the proposition of appointing commissioners to arrange the terms of capitulation because I have no terms other than those indicated above At three o clock Pemberton appeared at the point suggested in my verbal message accompanied by the same officers who had borne his letter of the morning Generals Ord McPherson Logan and A J Smith and several officers of my staff accompanied me Our place of meeting was on a hillside within a few hundred feet of the rebel lines Near by stood a stunted oak tree which was made historical by the event It was but a short time before the last vestige of its body root and limb had disappeared the fragments taken as trophies Since then the same tree has furnished as many cords of wood in the shape of trophies as The True Cross Pemberton and I had served in the same division during part of the Mexican War I knew him very well therefore and greeted him as an old acquaintance He soon asked what terms I proposed to give his army if it surrendered My answer was the same as proposed in my reply to his letter Pemberton then said rather snappishly The conference might as well end and turned abruptly as if to leave I said Very well General Bowen I saw was very anxious that the surrender should be consummated His manner and remarks while Pemberton and I were talking showed this He now proposed that he and one of our generals should have a conference I had no objection to this as nothing could be made binding upon me that they might propose Smith and Bowen accordingly had a conference during which Pemberton and I moving a short distance away towards the enemy s lines were in conversation After a while Bowen suggested that the Confederate army should be allowed to march out with the honors of war carrying their small arms and field artillery This was promptly and unceremoniously rejected The interview here ended I agreeing however to send a letter giving final terms by ten o clock that night Word was sent to Admiral Porter soon after the correspondence with Pemberton commenced so that hostilities might be stopped on the part of both army and navy It was agreed on my paging with Pemberton that they should not be renewed until our correspondence ceased When I returned to my headquarters I sent for all the corps and division commanders with the army immediately confronting Vicksburg Half the army was from eight to twelve miles off waiting for Johnston I informed them of the contents of Pemberton s letters of my reply and the substance of the interview and that I was ready to hear any suggestion but would hold the power of deciding entirely in my own hands This was the nearest approach to a council of war I ever held Against the general and almost unanimous judgment of the council I sent the following letter In conformity with agreement of this afternoon I will submit the following proposition for the surrender of the City of Vicksburg public stores et cetera On your accepting the terms proposed I will march in one division as a guard and take possession at eight A M to morrow As soon as rolls can be made out and paroles be signed by officers and men you will be allowed to march out of our lines the officers taking with them their side arms and clothing and the field staff and cavalry officers one horse each The rank and file will be allowed all their clothing but no other property If these conditions are accepted any amount of rations you may deem necessary can be taken from the stores you now have and also the necessary cooking utensils for preparing them Thirty wagons also counting two two horse or mule teams as one will be allowed to transport such articles as cannot be carried along The same conditions will be allowed to all sick and wounded officers and soldiers as fast as they become able to travel The paroles for these latter must be signed however whilst officers present are authorized to sign the roll of prisoners By the terms of the cartel then in force prisoners captured by either army were required to be forwarded as soon as possible to either Aiken s landing below Dutch Gap on the James River or to Vicksburg there to be exchanged or paroled until they could be exchanged There was a Confederate commissioner at Vicksburg authorized to make the exchange I did not propose to take him a prisoner but to leave him free to perform the functions of his office Had I insisted upon an unconditional surrender there would have been over thirty thousand men to transport to Cairo very much to the inconvenience of the army on the Mississippi Thence the prisoners would have had to be transported by rail to Washington or Baltimore thence again by steamer to Aiken s all at very great expense At Aiken s they would have had to be paroled because the Confederates did not have Union prisoners to give in exchange Then again Pemberton s army was largely composed of men whose homes were in the South west I knew many of them were tired of the war and would get home just as soon as they could A large number of them had voluntarily come into our lines during the siege and requested to be sent north where they could get employment until the war was over and they could go to their homes Late at night I received the following reply to my last letter I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this date proposing terms of capitulation for this garrison and post In the main your terms are accepted but in justice both to the honor and spirit of my troops manifested in the defence of Vicksburg I have to submit the following amendments which if acceded to by you will perfect the agreement between us At ten o clock A M to morrow I propose to evacuate the works in and around Vicksburg and to surrender the city and garrison under my command by marching out with my colors and arms stacking them in front of my present lines After which you will take possession Officers to retain their side arms and personal property and the rights and property of citizens to be respected This was received after midnight My reply was as follows I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of threed July The amendment proposed by you cannot be acceded to in full It will be necessary to furnish every officer and man with a parole signed by himself which with the completion of the roll of prisoners will necessarily take some time Again I can make no stipulations with regard to the treatment of citizens and their private property While I do not propose to cause them any undue annoyance or loss I cannot consent to leave myself under any restraint by stipulations The property which officers will be allowed to take with them will be as stated in my proposition of last evening that is officers will be allowed their private baggage and side arms and mounted officers one horse each If you mean by your proposition for each brigade to march to the front of the lines now occupied by it and stack arms at ten o clock A M and then return to the inside and there remain as prisoners until properly paroled I will make no objection to it Should no notification be received of your acceptance of my terms by nine o clock A M I shall regard them as having been rejected and shall act accordingly Should these terms be accepted white flags should be displayed along your lines to prevent such of my troops as may not have been notified from firing upon your men Pemberton promptly accepted these terms During the siege there had been a good deal of friendly sparring between the soldiers of the two armies on picket and where the lines were close together All rebels were known as Johnnies all Union troops as Yanks Often Johnny would call Well Yank when are you coming into town The reply was sometimes We propose to celebrate the fourth of July there Sometimes it would be We always treat our prisoners with kindness and do not want to hurt them or We are holding you as prisoners of war while you are feeding yourselves The garrison from the commanding general down undoubtedly expected an assault on the fourth They knew from the temper of their men it would be successful when made and that would be a greater humiliation than to surrender Besides it would be attended with severe loss to them The Vicksburg paper which we received regularly through the courtesy of the rebel pickets said prior to the fourth in speaking of the Yankee boast that they would take dinner in Vicksburg that day that the best receipt for cooking a rabbit was First ketch your rabbit The paper at this time and for some time previous was printed on the plain side of wall paper The last number was issued on the fourth and announced that we had caught our rabbit I have no doubt that Pemberton commenced his correspondence on the third with a two fold purpose first to avoid an assault which he knew would be successful and second to prevent the capture taking place on the great national holiday the anniversary of the Declaration of American Independence Holding out for better terms as he did he defeated his aim in the latter particular At the appointed hour the garrison of Vicksburg marched out of their works and formed line in front stacked arms and marched back in good order Our whole army present witnessed this scene without cheering Logan s division which had approached nearest the rebel works was the first to march in and the flag of one of the regiments of his division was soon floating over the court house Our soldiers were no sooner inside the lines than the two armies began to fraternize Our men had had full rations from the time the siege commenced to the close The enemy had been suffering particularly towards the last I myself saw our men taking bread from their haversacks and giving it to the enemy they had so recently been engaged in starving out It was accepted with avidity and with thanks Pemberton says in his report If it should be asked why the fourth of July was selected as the day for surrender the answer is obvious I believed that upon that day I should obtain better terms Well aware of the vanity of our foe I knew they would attach vast importance to the entrance on the fourth of July into the stronghold of the great river and that to gratify their national vanity they would yield then what could not be extorted from them at any other time This does not support my view of his reasons for selecting the day he did for surrendering But it must be recollected that his first letter asking terms was received about ten o clock A M July threed It then could hardly be expected that it would take twenty four hours to effect a surrender He knew that Johnston was in our rear for the purpose of raising the siege and he naturally would want to hold out as long as he could He knew his men would not resist an assault and one was expected on the fourth In our interview he told me he had rations enough to hold out for some time my recollection is two weeks It was this statement that induced me to insert in the terms that he was to draw rations for his men from his own supplies On the fourth of July General Holmes with an army of eight or nine thousand men belonging to the trans Mississippi department made an attack upon Helena Arkansas He was totally defeated by General Prentiss who was holding Helena with less than forty two hundred soldiers Holmes reported his loss at sixteen thirty six of which one hundred seventy three were killed but as Prentiss buried four hundred Holmes evidently understated his losses The Union loss was fifty seven killed one hundred twenty seven wounded and between thirty and forty missing This was the last effort on the part of the Confederacy to raise the siege of Vicksburg On the third as soon as negotiations were commenced I notified Sherman and directed him to be ready to take the offensive against Johnston drive him out of the State and destroy his army if he could Steele and Ord were directed at the same time to be in readiness to join Sherman as soon as the surrender took place Of this Sherman was notified I rode into Vicksburg with the troops and went to the river to exchange congratulations with the navy upon our joint victory At that time I found that many of the citizens had been living under ground The ridges upon which Vicksburg is built and those back to the Big Black are composed of a deep yellow clay of great tenacity Where roads and streets are cut through perpendicular banks are left and stand as well as if composed of stone The magazines of the enemy were made by running passage ways into this clay at places where there were deep cuts Many citizens secured places of safety for their families by carving out rooms in these embankments A door way in these cases would be cut in a high bank starting from the level of the road or street and after running in a few feet a room of the size required was carved out of the clay the dirt being removed by the door way In some instances I saw where two rooms were cut out for a single family with a door way in the clay wall separating them Some of these were carpeted and furnished with considerable elaboration In these the occupants were fully secure from the shells of the navy which were dropped into the city night and dav without intermission I returned to my old headquarters outside in the afternoon and did not move into the town until the sixth On the afternoon of the fourth I sent Captain Wm M Dunn of my staff to Cairo the nearest point where the telegraph could be reached with a dispatch to the general in chief It was as follows The enemy surrendered this morning The only terms allowed is their parole as prisoners of war This I regard as a great advantage to us at this moment It saves probably several days in the capture and leaves troops and transports ready for immediate service Sherman with a large force moves immediately on Johnston to drive him from the State I will send troops to the relief of Banks and return the ninth army corps to Burnside This news with the victory at Gettysburg won the same day lifted a great load of anxiety from the minds of the President his Cabinet and the loyal people all over the North The fate of the Confederacy was sealed when Vicksburg fell Much hard fighting was to be done afterwards and many precious lives were to be sacrificed but the MORALE was with the supporters of the Union ever after I at the same time wrote to General Banks informing him of the fall and sending him a copy of the terms also saying I would send him all the troops he wanted to insure the capture of the only foothold the enemy now had on the Mississippi River General Banks had a number of copies of this letter printed or at least a synopsis of it and very soon a copy fell into the hands of General Gardner who was then in command of Port Hudson Gardner at once sent a letter to the commander of the National forces saying that he had been informed of the surrender of Vicksburg and telling how the information reached him He added that if this was true it was useless for him to hold out longer General Banks gave him assurances that Vicksburg had been surrendered and General Gardner surrendered unconditionally on the ninth of July Port Hudson with nearly six thousand prisoners fifty one guns five thousand small arms and other stores fell into the hands of the Union forces from that day to the close of the rebellion the Mississippi River from its source to its mouth remained in the control of the National troops Pemberton and his army were kept in Vicksburg until the whole could be paroled The paroles were in duplicate by organization one copy for each Federals and Confederates and signed by the commanding officers of the companies or regiments Duplicates were also made for each soldier and signed by each individually one to be retained by the soldier signing and one to be retained by us Several hundred refused to sign their paroles preferring to be sent to the North as prisoners to being sent back to fight again Others again kept out of the way hoping to escape either alternative Pemberton appealed to me in person to compel these men to sign their paroles but I declined It also leaked out that many of the men who had signed their paroles intended to desert and go to their homes as soon as they got out of our lines Pemberton hearing this again appealed to me to assist him He wanted arms for a battalion to act as guards in keeping his men together while being marched to a camp of instruction where he expected to keep them until exchanged This request was also declined It was precisely what I expected and hoped that they would do I told him however that I would see that they marched beyond our lines in good order By the eleventh just one week after the surrender the paroles were completed and the Confederate garrison marched out Many deserted and fewer of them were ever returned to the ranks to fight again than would have been the case had the surrender been unconditional and the prisoners sent to the James River to be paroled As soon as our troops took possession of the city guards were established along the whole line of parapet from the river above to the river below The prisoners were allowed to occupy their old camps behind the intrenchments No restraint was put upon them except by their own commanders They were rationed about as our own men and from our supplies The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause When they passed out of the works they had so long and so gallantly defended between lines of their late antagonists not a cheer went up not a remark was made that would give pain Really I believe there was a feeling of sadness just then in the breasts of most of the Union soldiers at seeing the dejection of their late antagonists The day before the departure the following order was issued Paroled prisoners will be sent out of here to morrow They will be authorized to cross at the railroad bridge and move from there to Edward s Ferry fourteen and on by way of Raymond Instruct the commands to be orderly and quiet as these prisoners pass to make no offensive remarks and not to harbor any who fall out of ranks after they have passed CHAPTER XXXIX RETROSPECT OF THE CAMPAIGN SHERMAN S MOVEMENTS PROPOSED MOVEMENT UPON MOBILE A PAINFUL ACCIDENT ORDERED TO REPORT AT CAIRO The capture of Vicksburg with its garrison ordnance and ordnance stores and the successful battles fought in reaching them gave new spirit to the loyal people of the North New hopes for the final success of the cause of the Union were inspired The victory gained at Gettysburg upon the same day added to their hopes Now the Mississippi River was entirely in the possession of the National troops for the fall of Vicksburg gave us Port Hudson at once The army of northern Virginia was driven out of Pennsylvania and forced back to about the same ground it occupied in eighteen sixty one The Army of the Tennessee united with the Army of the Gulf dividing the Confederate States completely The first dispatch I received from the government after the fall of Vicksburg was in these words I fear your paroling the prisoners at Vicksburg without actual delivery to a proper agent as required by the seventh article of the cartel may be construed into an absolute release and that the men will immediately be placed in the ranks of the enemy Such has been the case elsewhere If these prisoners have not been allowed to depart you will detain them until further orders Halleck did not know that they had already been delivered into the hands of Major Watts Confederate commissioner for the exchange of prisoners At Vicksburg thirty one thousand six hundred prisoners were surrendered together with one hundred seventy two cannon about sixty thousand muskets and a large amount of ammunition The small arms of the enemy were far superior to the bulk of ours Up to this time our troops at the West had been limited to the old United States flint lock muskets changed into percussion or the Belgian musket imported early in the war almost as dangerous to the person firing it as to the one aimed at and a few new and improved arms These were of many different calibers a fact that caused much trouble in distributing ammunition during an engagement The enemy had generally new arms which had run the blockade and were of uniform caliber After the surrender I authorized all colonels whose regiments were armed with inferior muskets to place them in the stack of captured arms and replace them with the latter A large number of arms turned in to the Ordnance Department as captured were thus arms that had really been used by the Union army in the capture of Vicksburg In this narrative I have not made the mention I should like of officers dead and alive whose services entitle them to special mention Neither have I made that mention of the navy which its services deserve Suffice it to say the close of the siege of Vicksburg found us with an army unsurpassed in proportion to its numbers taken as a whole of officers and men A military education was acquired which no other school could have given Men who thought a company was quite enough for them to command properly at the beginning would have made good regimental or brigade commanders most of the brigade commanders were equal to the command of a division and one Ransom would have been equal to the command of a corps at least Logan and Crocker ended the campaign fitted to command independent armies General F P Blair joined me at Milliken s Bend a full fledged general without having served in a lower grade He commanded a division in the campaign I had known Blair in Missouri where I had voted against him in eighteen fifty eight when he ran for Congress I knew him as a frank positive and generous man true to his friends even to a fault but always a leader I dreaded his coming I knew from experience that it was more difficult to command two generals desiring to be leaders than it was to command one army officered intelligently and with subordination It affords me the greatest pleasure to record now my agreeable disappointment in respect to his character There was no man braver than he nor was there any who obeyed all orders of his superior in rank with more unquestioning alacrity He was one man as a soldier another as a politician The navy under Porter was all it could be during the entire campaign Without its assistance the campaign could not have been successfully made with twice the number of men engaged It could not have been made at all in the way it was with any number of men without such assistance The most perfect harmony reigned between the two arms of the service There never was a request made that I am aware of either of the flag officer or any of his subordinates that was not promptly complied with The campaign of Vicksburg was suggested and developed by circumstances The elections of eighteen sixty two had gone against the prosecution of the war Voluntary enlistments had nearly ceased and the draft had been resorted to this was resisted and a defeat or backward movement would have made its execution impossible A forward movement to a decisive victory was necessary Accordingly I resolved to get below Vicksburg unite with Banks against Port Hudson make New Orleans a base and with that base and Grand Gulf as a starting point move our combined forces against Vicksburg Upon reaching Grand Gulf after running its batteries and fighting a battle I received a letter from Banks informing me that he could not be at Port Hudson under ten days and then with only fifteen thousand men The time was worth more than the reinforcements I therefore determined to push into the interior of the enemy s country With a large river behind us held above and below by the enemy rapid movements were essential to success Jackson was captured the day after a new commander had arrived and only a few days before large reinforcements were expected A rapid movement west was made the garrison of Vicksburg was met in two engagements and badly defeated and driven back into its stronghold and there successfully besieged It looks now as though Providence had directed the course of the campaign while the Army of the Tennessee executed the decree Upon the surrender of the garrison of Vicksburg there were three things that required immediate attention The first was to send a force to drive the enemy from our rear and out of the State The second was to send reinforcements to Banks near Port Hudson if necessary to complete the triumph of opening the Mississippi from its source to its mouth to the free navigation of vessels bearing the Stars and Stripes The third was to inform the authorities at Washington and the North of the good news to relieve their long suspense and strengthen their confidence in the ultimate success of the cause they had so much at heart Soon after negotiations were opened with General Pemberton for the surrender of the city I notified Sherman whose troops extended from Haines Bluff on the left to the crossing of the Vicksburg and Jackson road over the Big Black on the right and directed him to hold his command in readiness to advance and drive the enemy from the State as soon as Vicksburg surrendered Steele and Ord were directed to be in readiness to join Sherman in his move against General Johnston and Sherman was advised of this also Sherman moved promptly crossing the Big Black at three different points with as many columns all concentrating at Bolton twenty miles west of Jackson Johnston heard of the surrender of Vicksburg almost as soon as it occurred and immediately fell back on Jackson On the eighth of July Sherman was within ten miles of Jackson and on the eleventh was close up to the defences of the city and shelling the town The siege was kept up until the morning of the seventeenth when it was found that the enemy had evacuated during the night The weather was very hot the roads dusty and the water bad Johnston destroyed the roads as he passed and had so much the start that pursuit was useless but Sherman sent one division Steele s to Brandon fourteen miles east of Jackson The National loss in the second capture of Jackson was less than one thousand men killed wounded and missing The Confederate loss was probably less except in captured More than this number fell into our hands as prisoners Medicines and food were left for the Confederate wounded and sick who had to be left behind A large amount of rations was issued to the families that remained in Jackson Medicine and food were also sent to Raymond for the destitute families as well as the sick and wounded as I thought it only fair that we should return to these people some of the articles we had taken while marching through the country I wrote to Sherman Impress upon the men the importance of going through the State in an orderly manner abstaining from taking anything not absolutely necessary for their subsistence while travelling They should try to create as favorable an impression as possible upon the people Provisions and forage when called for by them were issued to all the people from Bruinsburg to Jackson and back to Vicksburg whose resources had been taken for the supply of our army Very large quantities of groceries and provisions were so issued Sherman was ordered back to Vicksburg and his troops took much the same position they had occupied before from the Big Black to Haines Bluff Having cleaned up about Vicksburg and captured or routed all regular Confederate forces for more than a hundred miles in all directions I felt that the troops that had done so much should be allowed to do more before the enemy could recover from the blow he had received and while important points might be captured without bloodshed I suggested to the General in chief the idea of a campaign against Mobile starting from Lake Pontchartrain Halleck preferred another course The possession of the trans Mississippi by the Union forces seemed to possess more importance in his mind than almost any campaign east of the Mississippi I am well aware that the President was very anxious to have a foothold in Texas to stop the clamor of some of the foreign governments which seemed to be seeking a pretext to interfere in the war at least so far as to recognize belligerent rights to the Confederate States This however could have been easily done without wasting troops in western Louisiana and eastern Texas by sending a garrison at once to Brownsville on the Rio Grande Halleck disapproved of my proposition to go against Mobile so that I was obliged to settle down and see myself put again on the defensive as I had been a year before in west Tennessee It would have been an easy thing to capture Mobile at the time I proposed to go there Having that as a base of operations troops could have been thrown into the interior to operate against General Bragg s army This would necessarily have compelled Bragg to detach in order to meet this fire in his rear If he had not done this the troops from Mobile could have inflicted inestimable damage upon much of the country from which his army and Lee s were yet receiving their supplies I was so much impressed with this idea that I renewed my request later in July and again about the first of August and proposed sending all the troops necessary asking only the assistance of the navy to protect the debarkation of troops at or near Mobile I also asked for a leave of absence to visit New Orleans particularly if my suggestion to move against Mobile should be approved Both requests were refused So far as my experience with General Halleck went it was very much easier for him to refuse a favor than to grant one But I did not regard this as a favor It was simply in line of duty though out of my department The General in chief having decided against me the depletion of an army which had won a succession of great victories commenced as had been the case the year before after the fall of Corinth when the army was sent where it would do the least good By orders I sent to Banks a force of four thousand men returned the ninth corps to Kentucky and when transportation had been collected started a division of five thousand men to Schofield in Missouri where Price was raiding the State I also detached a brigade under Ransom to Natchez to garrison that place permanently This latter move was quite fortunate as to the time when Ransom arrived there The enemy happened to have a large number about five thousand head of beef cattle there on the way from Texas to feed the Eastern armies and also a large amount of munitions of war which had probably come through Texas from the Rio Grande and which were on the way to Lee s and other armies in the East The troops that were left with me around Vicksburg were very busily and unpleasantly employed in making expeditions against guerilla bands and small detachments of cavalry which infested the interior and in destroying mills bridges and rolling stock on the railroads The guerillas and cavalry were not there to fight but to annoy and therefore disappeared on the first approach of our troops The country back of Vicksburg was filled with deserters from Pemberton s army and it was reported many from Johnston s also The men determined not to fight again while the war lasted Those who lived beyond the reach of the Confederate army wanted to get to their homes Those who did not wanted to get North where they could work for their support till the war was over Besides all this there was quite a peace feeling for the time being among the citizens of that part of Mississippi but this feeling soon subsided It is not probable that Pemberton got off with over four thousand of his army to the camp where he proposed taking them and these were in a demoralized condition On the seventh of August I further depleted my army by sending the thirteenth corps General Ord commanding to Banks Besides this I received orders to company operate with the latter general in movements west of the Mississippi Having received this order I went to New Orleans to confer with Banks about the proposed movement All these movements came to naught During this visit I reviewed Banks army a short distance above Carrollton The horse I rode was vicious and but little used and on my return to New Orleans ran away and shying at a locomotive in the street fell probably on me I was rendered insensible and when I regained consciousness I found myself in a hotel near by with several doctors attending me My leg was swollen from the knee to the thigh and the swelling almost to the point of bursting extended along the body up to the arm pit The pain was almost beyond endurance I lay at the hotel something over a week without being able to turn myself in bed I had a steamer stop at the nearest point possible and was carried to it on a litter I was then taken to Vicksburg where I remained unable to move for some time afterwards While I was absent General Sherman declined to assume command because he said it would confuse the records but he let all the orders be made in my name and was glad to render any assistance he could No orders were issued by my staff certainly no important orders except upon consultation with and approval of Sherman On the thirteenth of September while I was still in New Orleans Halleck telegraphed to me to send all available forces to Memphis and thence to Tuscumbia to company operate with Rosecrans for the relief of Chattanooga On the fifteenth he telegraphed again for all available forces to go to Rosecrans This was received on the twenty seventh I was still confined to my bed unable to rise from it without assistance but I at once ordered Sherman to send one division to Memphis as fast as transports could be provided The division of McPherson s corps which had got off and was on the way to join Steele in Arkansas was recalled and sent likewise to report to Hurlbut at Memphis Hurlbut was directed to forward these two divisions with two others from his own corps at once and also to send any other troops that might be returning there Halleck suggested that some good man like Sherman or McPherson should be sent to Memphis to take charge of the troops going east On this I sent Sherman as being I thought the most suitable person for an independent command and besides he was entitled to it if it had to be given to any one He was directed to take with him another division of his corps This left one back but having one of McPherson s divisions he had still the equivalent Before the receipt by me of these orders the battle of Chickamauga had been fought and Rosecrans forced back into Chattanooga The administration as well as the General in chief was nearly frantic at the situation of affairs there mister Charles A Dana an officer of the War Department was sent to Rosecrans headquarters I do not know what his instructions were but he was still in Chattanooga when I arrived there at a later period It seems that Halleck suggested that I should go to Nashville as soon as able to move and take general direction of the troops moving from the west I received the following dispatch dated October threed It is the wish of the Secretary of War that as soon as General Grant is able he will come to Cairo and report by telegraph I was still very lame but started without delay Arriving at Columbus on the sixteenth I reported by telegraph Your dispatch from Cairo of the threed directing me to report from Cairo was received at eleven point thirty on the tenth Left the same day with staff and headquarters and am here en route for Cairo END OF VOLUME I PERSONAL MEMOIRS

SECRETARY STANTON GENERAL ROSECRANS COMMANDING MILITARY DIVISION OF MISSISSIPPI ANDREW JOHNSON S ADDRESS ARRIVAL AT CHATTANOOGA The reply to my telegram of October sixteen eighteen sixty three from Cairo announcing my arrival at that point came on the morning of the seventeenth directing me to proceed immediately to the Galt House Louisville where I would meet an officer of the War Department with my instructions I left Cairo within an hour or two after the receipt of this dispatch going by rail via Indianapolis Just as the train I was on was starting out of the depot at Indianapolis a messenger came running up to stop it saying the Secretary of War was coming into the station and wanted to see me I had never met mister Stanton up to that time though we had held frequent conversations over the wires the year before when I was in Tennessee Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the War Department and my headquarters to be connected and we would hold a conversation for an hour or two On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio whom I had never met though he and my father had been old acquaintances mister Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis and accompanied me to Louisville Up to this time no hint had been given me of what was wanted after I left Vicksburg except the suggestion in one of Halleck s dispatches that I had better go to Nashville and superintend the operation of troops sent to relieve Rosecrans Soon after we started the Secretary handed me two orders saying that I might take my choice of them The two were identical in all but one particular Both created the Military Division of Mississippi giving me the command composed of the Departments of the Ohio the Cumberland and the Tennessee and all the territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi River north of Banks s command in the south west One order left the department commanders as they were while the other relieved Rosecrans and assigned Thomas to his place I accepted the latter We reached Louisville after night and if I remember rightly in a cold drizzling rain The Secretary of War told me afterwards that he caught a cold on that occasion from which he never expected to recover He never did A day was spent in Louisville the Secretary giving me the military news at the capital and talking about the disappointment at the results of some of the campaigns By the evening of the day after our arrival all matters of discussion seemed exhausted and I left the hotel to spend the evening away both missus Grant who was with me and myself having relatives living in Louisville In the course of the evening mister Stanton received a dispatch from mister C A Dana then in Chattanooga informing him that unless prevented Rosecrans would retreat and advising peremptory orders against his doing so As stated before after the fall of Vicksburg I urged strongly upon the government the propriety of a movement against Mobile General Rosecrans had been at Murfreesboro Tennessee with a large and well equipped army from early in the year eighteen sixty three with Bragg confronting him with a force quite equal to his own at first considering it was on the defensive But after the investment of Vicksburg Bragg s army was largely depleted to strengthen Johnston in Mississippi who was being reinforced to raise the siege I frequently wrote General Halleck suggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg By so doing he would either detain the latter s troops where they were or lay Chattanooga open to capture General Halleck strongly approved the suggestion and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly ordered Rosecrans to advance but that the latter had constantly failed to comply with the order and at last after having held a council of war had replied in effect that it was a military maxim not to fight two decisive battles at the same time If true the maxim was not applicable in this case It would be bad to be defeated in two decisive battles fought the same day but it would not be bad to win them I however was fighting no battle and the siege of Vicksburg had drawn from Rosecrans front so many of the enemy that his chances of victory were much greater than they would be if he waited until the siege was over when these troops could be returned Rosecrans was ordered to move against the army that was detaching troops to raise the siege Finally he did move on the twenty fourth of June but ten days afterwards Vicksburg surrendered and the troops sent from Bragg were free to return It was at this time that I recommended to the general in chief the movement against Mobile I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberland was in being depleted continually not only by ordinary casualties but also by having to detach troops to hold its constantly extending line over which to draw supplies while the enemy in front was as constantly being strengthened Mobile was important to the enemy and in the absence of a threatening force was guarded by little else than artillery If threatened by land and from the water at the same time the prize would fall easily or troops would have to be sent to its defence Those troops would necessarily come from Bragg My judgment was overruled and the troops under my command were dissipated over other parts of the country where it was thought they could render the most service Soon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble and required assistance The emergency was now too immediate to allow us to give this assistance by making an attack in rear of Bragg upon Mobile It was therefore necessary to reinforce directly and troops were sent from every available point Rosecrans had very skilfully manoeuvred Bragg south of the Tennessee River and through and beyond Chattanooga If he had stopped and intrenched and made himself strong there all would have been right and the mistake of not moving earlier partially compensated But he pushed on with his forces very much scattered until Bragg s troops from Mississippi began to join him Then Bragg took the initiative Rosecrans had to fall back in turn and was able to get his army together at Chickamauga some miles south east of Chattanooga before the main battle was brought on The battle was fought on the nineteenth and twentieth of September and Rosecrans was badly defeated with a heavy loss in artillery and some sixteen thousand men killed wounded and captured The corps under Major General George H Thomas stood its ground while Rosecrans with Crittenden and McCook returned to Chattanooga Thomas returned also but later and with his troops in good order Bragg followed and took possession of Missionary Ridge overlooking Chattanooga He also occupied Lookout Mountain west of the town which Rosecrans had abandoned and with it his control of the river and the river road as far back as Bridgeport The National troops were now strongly intrenched in Chattanooga Valley with the Tennessee River behind them and the enemy occupying commanding heights to the east and west with a strong line across the valley from mountain to mountain and with Chattanooga Creek for a large part of the way in front of their line On the twenty ninth Halleck telegraphed me the above results and directed all the forces that could be spared from my department to be sent to Rosecrans Long before this dispatch was received Sherman was on his way and McPherson was moving east with most of the garrison of Vicksburg A retreat at that time would have been a terrible disaster It would not only have been the loss of a most important strategic position to us but it would have been attended with the loss of all the artillery still left with the Army of the Cumberland and the annihilation of that army itself either by capture or demoralization All supplies for Rosecrans had to be brought from Nashville The railroad between this base and the army was in possession of the government up to Bridgeport the point at which the road crosses to the south side of the Tennessee River but Bragg holding Lookout and Raccoon mountains west of Chattanooga commanded the railroad the river and the shortest and best wagon roads both south and north of the Tennessee between Chattanooga and Bridgeport The distance between these two places is but twenty six miles by rail but owing to the position of Bragg all supplies for Rosecrans had to be hauled by a circuitous route north of the river and over a mountainous country increasing the distance to over sixty miles This country afforded but little food for his animals nearly ten thousand of which had already starved and not enough were left to draw a single piece of artillery or even the ambulances to convey the sick The men had been on half rations of hard bread for a considerable time with but few other supplies except beef driven from Nashville across the country The region along the road became so exhausted of food for the cattle that by the time they reached Chattanooga they were much in the condition of the few animals left alive there on the lift Indeed the beef was so poor that the soldiers were in the habit of saying with a faint facetiousness that they were living on half rations of hard bread and BEEF DRIED ON THE HOOF Nothing could be transported but food and the troops were without sufficient shoes or other clothing suitable for the advancing season What they had was well worn The fuel within the Federal lines was exhausted even to the stumps of trees There were no teams to draw it from the opposite bank where it was abundant The only way of supplying fuel for some time before my arrival had been to cut trees on the north bank of the river at a considerable distance up the stream form rafts of it and float it down with the current effecting a landing on the south side within our lines by the use of paddles or poles It would then be carried on the shoulders of the men to their camps If a retreat had occurred at this time it is not probable that any of the army would have reached the railroad as an organized body if followed by the enemy On the receipt of mister Dana s dispatch mister Stanton sent for me Finding that I was out he became nervous and excited inquiring of every person he met including guests of the house whether they knew where I was and bidding them find me and send me to him at once About eleven o clock I returned to the hotel and on my way when near the house every person met was a messenger from the Secretary apparently partaking of his impatience to see me I hastened to the room of the Secretary and found him pacing the floor rapidly in his dressing gown Saying that the retreat must be prevented he showed me the dispatch I immediately wrote an order assuming command of the Military Division of the Mississippi and telegraphed it to General Rosecrans I then telegraphed to him the order from Washington assigning Thomas to the command of the Army of the Cumberland and to Thomas that he must hold Chattanooga at all hazards informing him at the same time that I would be at the front as soon as possible A prompt reply was received from Thomas saying We will hold the town till we starve I appreciated the force of this dispatch later when I witnessed the condition of affairs which prompted it It looked indeed as if but two courses were open one to starve the other to surrender or be captured On the morning of the twentieth of October I started with my staff and proceeded as far as Nashville At that time it was not prudent to travel beyond that point by night so I remained in Nashville until the next morning Here I met for the first time Andrew Johnson Military Governor of Tennessee He delivered a speech of welcome His composure showed that it was by no means his maiden effort It was long and I was in torture while he was delivering it fearing something would be expected from me in response I was relieved however the people assembled having apparently heard enough At all events they commenced a general hand shaking which although trying where there is so much of it was a great relief to me in this emergency From Nashville I telegraphed to Burnside who was then at Knoxville that important points in his department ought to be fortified so that they could be held with the least number of men to Admiral Porter at Cairo that Sherman s advance had passed Eastport Mississippi that rations were probably on their way from saint Louis by boat for supplying his army and requesting him to send a gunboat to convoy them and to Thomas suggesting that large parties should be put at work on the wagon road then in use back to Bridgeport On the morning of the twenty first we took the train for the front reaching Stevenson Alabama after dark Rosecrans was there on his way north He came into my car and we held a brief interview in which he described very clearly the situation at Chattanooga and made some excellent suggestions as to what should be done My only wonder was that he had not carried them out We then proceeded to Bridgeport where we stopped for the night From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper and over Waldron s Ridge to Chattanooga There had been much rain and the roads were almost impassable from mud knee deep in places and from wash outs on the mountain sides I had been on crutches since the time of my fall in New Orleans and had to be carried over places where it was not safe to cross on horseback The roads were strewn with the debris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mules and horses At Jasper some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport there was a halt General O O Howard had his headquarters there From this point I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundred rounds of ammunition for his artillery and small arms We stopped for the night at a little hamlet some ten or twelve miles farther on The next day we reached Chattanooga a little before dark I went directly to General Thomas s headquarters and remaining there a few days until I could establish my own During the evening most of the general officers called in to pay their respects and to talk about the condition of affairs They pointed out on the map the line marked with a red or blue pencil which Rosecrans had contemplated falling back upon If any of them had approved the move they did not say so to me I found General W F Smith occupying the position of chief engineer of the Army of the Cumberland I had known Smith as a cadet at West Point but had no recollection of having met him after my graduation in eighteen forty three up to this time He explained the situation of the two armies and the topography of the country so plainly that I could see it without an inspection I found that he had established a saw mill on the banks of the river by utilizing an old engine found in the neighborhood and by rafting logs from the north side of the river above had got out the lumber and completed pontoons and roadway plank for a second bridge one flying bridge being there already He was also rapidly getting out the materials and constructing the boats for a third bridge In addition to this he had far under way a steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport whenever we might get possession of the river This boat consisted of a scow made of the plank sawed out at the mill housed in and a stern wheel attached which was propelled by a second engine taken from some shop or factory I telegraphed to Washington this night notifying General Halleck of my arrival and asking to have General Sherman assigned to the command of the Army of the Tennessee headquarters in the field The request was at once complied with CHAPTER XLI ASSUMING THE COMMAND AT CHATTANOOGA OPENING A LINE OF SUPPLIES BATTLE OF WAUHATCHIE ON THE PICKET LINE The next day the twenty fourth I started out to make a personal inspection taking Thomas and Smith with me besides most of the members of my personal staff We crossed to the north side of the river and moving to the north of detached spurs of hills reached the Tennessee at Brown s Ferry some three miles below Lookout Mountain unobserved by the enemy Here we left our horses back from the river and approached the water on foot There was a picket station of the enemy on the opposite side of about twenty men in full view and we were within easy range They did not fire upon us nor seem to be disturbed by our presence They must have seen that we were all commissioned officers But I suppose they looked upon the garrison of Chattanooga as prisoners of war feeding or starving themselves and thought it would be inhuman to kill any of them except in self defence That night I issued orders for opening the route to Bridgeport a cracker line as the soldiers appropriately termed it They had been so long on short rations that my first thought was the establishment of a line over which food might reach them Chattanooga is on the south bank of the Tennessee where that river runs nearly due west It is at the northern end of a valley five or six miles in width through which Chattanooga Creek runs To the east of the valley is Missionary Ridge rising from five to eight hundred feet above the creek and terminating somewhat abruptly a half mile or more before reaching the Tennessee On the west of the valley is Lookout Mountain twenty two hundred feet above tide water Just below the town the Tennessee makes a turn to the south and runs to the base of Lookout Mountain leaving no level ground between the mountain and river The Memphis and Charleston Railroad passes this point where the mountain stands nearly perpendicular East of Missionary Ridge flows the South Chickamauga River west of Lookout Mountain is Lookout Creek and west of that Raccoon Mountains Lookout Mountain at its northern end rises almost perpendicularly for some distance then breaks off in a gentle slope of cultivated fields to near the summit where it ends in a palisade thirty or more feet in height On the gently sloping ground between the upper and lower palisades there is a single farmhouse which is reached by a wagon road from the valley east The intrenched line of the enemy commenced on the north end of Missionary Ridge and extended along the crest for some distance south thence across Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain Lookout Mountain was also fortified and held by the enemy who also kept troops in Lookout valley west and on Raccoon Mountain with pickets extending down the river so as to command the road on the north bank and render it useless to us In addition to this there was an intrenched line in Chattanooga valley extending from the river east of the town to Lookout Mountain to make the investment complete Besides the fortifications on Mission Ridge there was a line at the base of the hill with occasional spurs of rifle pits half way up the front The enemy s pickets extended out into the valley towards the town so far that the pickets of the two armies could converse At one point they were separated only by the narrow creek which gives its name to the valley and town and from which both sides drew water The Union lines were shorter than those of the enemy Thus the enemy with a vastly superior force was strongly fortified to the east south and west and commanded the river below Practically the Army of the Cumberland was besieged The enemy had stopped with his cavalry north of the river the passing of a train loaded with ammunition and medical supplies The Union army was short of both not having ammunition enough for a day s fighting General Halleck had long before my coming into this new field ordered parts of the eleventh and twelfth corps commanded respectively by Generals Howard and Slocum Hooker in command of the whole from the Army of the Potomac to reinforce Rosecrans It would have been folly to send them to Chattanooga to help eat up the few rations left there They were consequently left on the railroad where supplies could be brought to them Before my arrival Thomas ordered their concentration at Bridgeport General W F Smith had been so instrumental in preparing for the move which I was now about to make and so clear in his judgment about the manner of making it that I deemed it but just to him that he should have command of the troops detailed to execute the design although he was then acting as a staff officer and was not in command of troops On the twenty fourth of October after my return to Chattanooga the following details were made General Hooker who was now at Bridgeport was ordered to cross to the south side of the Tennessee and march up by Whitesides and Wauhatchie to Brown s Ferry General Palmer with a division of the fourteenth corps Army of the Cumberland was ordered to move down the river on the north side by a back road until opposite Whitesides then cross and hold the road in Hooker s rear after he had passed Four thousand men were at the same time detailed to act under General Smith directly from Chattanooga Eighteen hundred of them under General Hazen were to take sixty pontoon boats and under cover of night float by the pickets of the enemy at the north base of Lookout down to Brown s Ferry then land on the south side and capture or drive away the pickets at that point Smith was to march with the remainder of the detail also under cover of night by the north bank of the river to Brown s Ferry taking with him all the material for laying the bridge as soon as the crossing was secured On the twenty sixth Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport and commenced his eastward march At three o clock on the morning of the twenty seventh Hazen moved into the stream with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred brave and well equipped men Smith started enough in advance to be near the river when Hazen should arrive There are a number of detached spurs of hills north of the river at Chattanooga back of which is a good road parallel to the stream sheltered from the view from the top of Lookout It was over this road Smith marched At five o clock Hazen landed at Brown s Ferry surprised the picket guard and captured most of it By seven o clock the whole of Smith s force was ferried over and in possession of a height commanding the ferry This was speedily fortified while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge By ten o clock the bridge was laid and our extreme right now in Lookout valley was fortified and connected with the rest of the army The two bridges over the Tennessee River a flying one at Chattanooga and the new one at Brown s Ferry with the road north of the river covered from both the fire and the view of the enemy made the connection complete Hooker found but slight obstacles in his way and on the afternoon of the twenty eighth emerged into Lookout valley at Wauhatchie Howard marched on to Brown s Ferry while Geary who commanded a division in the twelfth corps stopped three miles south The pickets of the enemy on the river below were now cut off and soon came in and surrendered The river was now opened to us from Lookout valley to Bridgeport Between Brown s Ferry and Kelly s Ferry the Tennessee runs through a narrow gorge in the mountains which contracts the stream so much as to increase the current beyond the capacity of an ordinary steamer to stem it To get up these rapids steamers must be cordelled that is pulled up by ropes from the shore But there is no difficulty in navigating the stream from Bridgeport to Kelly s Ferry The latter point is only eight miles from Chattanooga and connected with it by a good wagon road which runs through a low pass in the Raccoon Mountains on the south side of the river to Brown s Ferry thence on the north side to the river opposite Chattanooga There were several steamers at Bridgeport and abundance of forage clothing and provisions On the way to Chattanooga I had telegraphed back to Nashville for a good supply of vegetables and small rations which the troops had been so long deprived of Hooker had brought with him from the east a full supply of land transportation His animals had not been subjected to hard work on bad roads without forage but were in good condition In five days from my arrival in Chattanooga the way was open to Bridgeport and with the aid of steamers and Hooker s teams in a week the troops were receiving full rations It is hard for any one not an eye witness to realize the relief this brought The men were soon reclothed and also well fed an abundance of ammunition was brought up and a cheerfulness prevailed not before enjoyed in many weeks Neither officers nor men looked upon themselves any longer as doomed The weak and languid appearance of the troops so visible before disappeared at once I do not know what the effect was on the other side but assume it must have been correspondingly depressing mister Davis had visited Bragg but a short time before and must have perceived our condition to be about as Bragg described it in his subsequent report These dispositions he said faithfully sustained insured the enemy s speedy evacuation of Chattanooga for want of food and forage Possessed of the shortest route to his depot and the one by which reinforcements must reach him we held him at our mercy and his destruction was only a question of time But the dispositions were not faithfully sustained and I doubt not but thousands of men engaged in trying to sustain them now rejoice that they were not There was no time during the rebellion when I did not think and often say that the South was more to be benefited by its defeat than the North The latter had the people the institutions and the territory to make a great and prosperous nation The former was burdened with an institution abhorrent to all civilized people not brought up under it and one which degraded labor kept it in ignorance and enervated the governing class With the outside world at war with this institution they could not have extended their territory The labor of the country was not skilled nor allowed to become so The whites could not toil without becoming degraded and those who did were denominated poor white trash The system of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the people poor The non slaveholders would have left the country and the small slaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbor Soon the slaves would have outnumbered the masters and not being in sympathy with them would have risen in their might and exterminated them The war was expensive to the South as well as to the North both in blood and treasure but it was worth all it cost The enemy was surprised by the movements which secured to us a line of supplies He appreciated its importance and hastened to try to recover the line from us His strength on Lookout Mountain was not equal to Hooker s command in the valley below From Missionary Ridge he had to march twice the distance we had from Chattanooga in order to reach Lookout Valley but on the night of the twenty eighth and twenty ninth an attack was made on Geary at Wauhatchie by Longstreet s corps When the battle commenced Hooker ordered Howard up from Brown s Ferry He had three miles to march to reach Geary On his way he was fired upon by rebel troops from a foot hill to the left of the road and from which the road was commanded Howard turned to the left charged up the hill and captured it before the enemy had time to intrench taking many prisoners Leaving sufficient men to hold this height he pushed on to reinforce Geary Before he got up Geary had been engaged for about three hours against a vastly superior force The night was so dark that the men could not distinguish one from another except by the light of the flashes of their muskets In the darkness and uproar Hooker s teamsters became frightened and deserted their teams The mules also became frightened and breaking loose from their fastenings stampeded directly towards the enemy The latter no doubt took this for a charge and stampeded in turn By four o clock in the morning the battle had entirely ceased and our cracker line was never afterward disturbed In securing possession of Lookout Valley Smith lost one man killed and four or five wounded The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry captured In the night engagement of the twenty eighth ninth Hooker lost four hundred sixteen killed and wounded I never knew the loss of the enemy but our troops buried over one hundred and fifty of his dead and captured more than a hundred After we had secured the opening of a line over which to bring our supplies to the army I made a personal inspection to see the situation of the pickets of the two armies As I have stated Chattanooga Creek comes down the centre of the valley to within a mile or such a matter of the town of Chattanooga then bears off westerly then north westerly and enters the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain This creek from its mouth up to where it bears off west lay between the two lines of pickets and the guards of both armies drew their water from the same stream As I would be under short range fire and in an open country I took nobody with me except I believe a bugler who stayed some distance to the rear I rode from our right around to our left When I came to the camp of the picket guard of our side I heard the call Turn out the guard for the commanding general I replied Never mind the guard and they were dismissed and went back to their tents Just back of these and about equally distant from the creek were the guards of the Confederate pickets The sentinel on their post called out in like manner Turn out the guard for the commanding general and I believe added General Grant Their line in a moment front faced to the north facing me and gave a salute which I returned The most friendly relations seemed to exist between the pickets of the two armies At one place there was a tree which had fallen across the stream and which was used by the soldiers of both armies in drawing water for their camps General Longstreet s corps was stationed there at the time and wore blue of a little different shade from our uniform Seeing a soldier in blue on this log I rode up to him commenced conversing with him and asked whose corps he belonged to He was very polite and touching his hat to me said he belonged to General Longstreet s corps I asked him a few questions but not with a view of gaining any particular information all of which he answered and I rode off CHAPTER XLII CONDITION OF THE ARMY REBUILDING THE RAILROAD GENERAL BURNSIDE S SITUATION ORDERS FOR BATTLE PLANS FOR THE ATTACK HOOKER S POSITION SHERMAN S MOVEMENTS Having got the Army of the Cumberland in a comfortable position I now began to look after the remainder of my new command Burnside was in about as desperate a condition as the Army of the Cumberland had been only he was not yet besieged He was a hundred miles from the nearest possible base Big South Fork of the Cumberland River and much farther from any railroad we had possession of The roads back were over mountains and all supplies along the line had long since been exhausted His animals too had been starved and their carcasses lined the road from Cumberland Gap and far back towards Lexington Ky East Tennessee still furnished supplies of beef bread and forage but it did not supply ammunition clothing medical supplies or small rations such as coffee sugar salt and rice Sherman had started from Memphis for Corinth on the eleventh of October His instructions required him to repair the road in his rear in order to bring up supplies The distance was about three hundred and thirty miles through a hostile country His entire command could not have maintained the road if it had been completed The bridges had all been destroyed by the enemy and much other damage done A hostile community lived along the road guerilla bands infested the country and more or less of the cavalry of the enemy was still in the West Often Sherman s work was destroyed as soon as completed and he only a short distance away The Memphis and Charleston Railroad strikes the Tennessee River at Eastport Mississippi Knowing the difficulty Sherman would have to supply himself from Memphis I had previously ordered supplies sent from saint Louis on small steamers to be convoyed by the navy to meet him at Eastport These he got I now ordered him to discontinue his work of repairing roads and to move on with his whole force to Stevenson Alabama without delay This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over Muscle Shoals it was delivered at Iuka on the twenty seventh In this Sherman was notified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland East Tennessee and might be going to Nashville in which event his troops were in the best position to beat them there Sherman with his characteristic promptness abandoned the work he was engaged upon and pushed on at once On the first of November he crossed the Tennessee at Eastport and that day was in Florence Alabama with the head of column while his troops were still crossing at Eastport with Blair bringing up the rear Sherman s force made an additional army with cavalry artillery and trains all to be supplied by the single track road from Nashville All indications pointed also to the probable necessity of supplying Burnside s command in East Tennessee twenty five thousand more by the same route A single track could not do this I gave therefore an order to Sherman to halt General G M Dodge s command of about eight thousand men at Athens and subsequently directed the latter to arrange his troops along the railroad from Decatur north towards Nashville and to rebuild that road The road from Nashville to Decatur passes over a broken country cut up with innumerable streams many of them of considerable width and with valleys far below the road bed All the bridges over these had been destroyed and the rails taken up and twisted by the enemy All the cars and locomotives not carried off had been destroyed as effectually as they knew how to destroy them All bridges and culverts had been destroyed between Nashville and Decatur and thence to Stevenson where the Memphis and Charleston and the Nashville and Chattanooga roads unite The rebuilding of this road would give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply the army From Bridgeport a short distance farther east the river supplements the road General Dodge besides being a most capable soldier was an experienced railroad builder He had no tools to work with except those of the pioneers axes picks and spades With these he was able to intrench his men and protect them against surprises by small parties of the enemy As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completed back to Nashville the first matter to consider after protecting his men was the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country He had his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find or all they needed and all the cattle for beef and such other food as could be found Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills along the line of the army When these were not near enough to the troops for protection they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road Blacksmith shops with all the iron and steel found in them were moved up in like manner Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making the tools necessary in railroad and bridge building Axemen were put to work getting out timber for bridges and cutting fuel for locomotives when the road should be completed Car builders were set to work repairing the locomotives and cars Thus every branch of railroad building making tools to work with and supplying the workmen with food was all going on at once and without the aid of a mechanic or laborer except what the command itself furnished But rails and cars the men could not make without material and there was not enough rolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its full capacity There were no rails except those in use To supply these deficiencies I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had at Vicksburg to be sent to Nashville and all the cars he had except ten I also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river and on the Memphis and Charleston road and ordered the cars locomotives and rails from all the railroads except the Memphis and Charleston to Nashville The military manager of railroads also was directed to furnish more rolling stock and as far as he could bridge material General Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days after receiving his orders The number of bridges to rebuild was one hundred and eighty two many of them over deep and wide chasms the length of road repaired was one hundred and two miles The enemy s troops which it was thought were either moving against Burnside or were going to Nashville went no farther than Cleveland Their presence there however alarmed the authorities at Washington and on account of our helpless condition at Chattanooga caused me much uneasiness Dispatches were constantly coming urging me to do something for Burnside s relief calling attention to the importance of holding East Tennessee saying the President was much concerned for the protection of the loyal people in that section et cetera We had not at Chattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery much less a supply train Reinforcements could not help Burnside because he had neither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them hardly indeed bread and meat for the men he had There was no relief possible for him except by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and about Chattanooga On the fourth of November Longstreet left our front with about fifteen thousand troops besides Wheeler s cavalry five thousand more to go against Burnside The situation seemed desperate and was more aggravating because nothing could be done until Sherman should get up The authorities at Washington were now more than ever anxious for the safety of Burnside s army and plied me with dispatches faster than ever urging that something should be done for his relief On the seventh before Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville I ordered Thomas peremptorily to attack the enemy s right so as to force the return of the troops that had gone up the valley I directed him to take mules officers horses or animals wherever he could get them to move the necessary artillery But he persisted in the declaration that he could not move a single piece of artillery and could not see how he could possibly comply with the order Nothing was left to be done but to answer Washington dispatches as best I could urge Sherman forward although he was making every effort to get forward and encourage Burnside to hold on assuring him that in a short time he should be relieved All of Burnside s dispatches showed the greatest confidence in his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out He even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he held south and west of Knoxville so as to draw the enemy farther from his base and make it more difficult for him to get back to Chattanooga when the battle should begin Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon but from there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains Burnside s suggestion therefore was a good one and it was adopted On the fourteenth I telegraphed him Sherman s advance has reached Bridgeport His whole force will be ready to move from there by Tuesday at farthest If you can hold Longstreet in check until he gets up or by skirmishing and falling back can avoid serious loss to yourself and gain time I will be able to force the enemy back from here and place a force between Longstreet and Bragg that must inevitably make the former take to the mountain passes by every available road to get to his supplies Sherman would have been here before this but for high water in Elk River driving him some thirty miles up that river to cross And again later in the day indicating my plans for his relief as follows Your dispatch and Dana s just received Being there you can tell better how to resist Longstreet s attack than I can direct With your showing you had better give up Kingston at the last moment and save the most productive part of your possessions Every arrangement is now made to throw Sherman s force across the river just at and below the mouth of Chickamauga Creek as soon as it arrives Thomas will attack on his left at the same time and together it is expected to carry Missionary Ridge and from there push a force on to the railroad between Cleveland and Dalton Hooker will at the same time attack and if he can carry Lookout Mountain The enemy now seems to be looking for an attack on his left flank This favors us To further confirm this Sherman s advance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton The remainder of his force will pass over a new road just made from Whiteside to Kelly s Ferry thus being concealed from the enemy and leave him to suppose the whole force is going up Lookout Valley Sherman s advance has only just reached Bridgeport The rear will only reach there on the sixteenth This will bring it to the nineteenth as the earliest day for making the combined movement as desired Inform me if you think you can sustain yourself until this time I can hardly conceive of the enemy breaking through at Kingston and pushing for Kentucky If they should however a new problem would be left for solution Thomas has ordered a division of cavalry to the vicinity of Sparta I will ascertain if they have started and inform you It will be entirely out of the question to send you ten thousand men not because they cannot be spared but how would they be fed after they got even one day east from here Longstreet for some reason or other stopped at Loudon until the thirteenth That being the terminus of his railroad communications it is probable he was directed to remain there awaiting orders He was in a position threatening Knoxville and at the same time where he could be brought back speedily to Chattanooga The day after Longstreet left Loudon Sherman reached Bridgeport in person and proceeded on to see me that evening the fourteenth and reached Chattanooga the next day My orders for battle were all prepared in advance of Sherman s arrival fifteen except the dates which could not be fixed while troops to be engaged were so far away The possession of Lookout Mountain was of no special advantage to us now Hooker was instructed to send Howard s corps to the north side of the Tennessee thence up behind the hills on the north side and to go into camp opposite Chattanooga with the remainder of the command Hooker was at a time to be afterwards appointed to ascend the western slope between the upper and lower palisades and so get into Chattanooga valley The plan of battle was for Sherman to attack the enemy s right flank form a line across it extend our left over South Chickamauga River so as to threaten or hold the railroad in Bragg s rear and thus force him either to weaken his lines elsewhere or lose his connection with his base at Chickamauga Station Hooker was to perform like service on our right His problem was to get from Lookout Valley to Chattanooga Valley in the most expeditious way possible cross the latter valley rapidly to Rossville south of Bragg s line on Missionary Ridge form line there across the ridge facing north with his right flank extended to Chickamauga Valley east of the ridge thus threatening the enemy s rear on that flank and compelling him to reinforce this also Thomas with the Army of the Cumberland occupied the centre and was to assault while the enemy was engaged with most of his forces on his two flanks To carry out this plan Sherman was to cross the Tennessee at Brown s Ferry and move east of Chattanooga to a point opposite the north end of Mission Ridge and to place his command back of the foot hills out of sight of the enemy on the ridge There are two streams called Chickamauga emptying into the Tennessee River east of Chattanooga North Chickamauga taking its rise in Tennessee flowing south and emptying into the river some seven or eight miles east while the South Chickamauga which takes its rise in Georgia flows northward and empties into the Tennessee some three or four miles above the town There were now one hundred and sixteen pontoons in the North Chickamauga River their presence there being unknown to the enemy At night a division was to be marched up to that point and at two o clock in the morning moved down with the current thirty men in each boat A few were to land east of the mouth of the South Chickamauga capture the pickets there and then lay a bridge connecting the two banks of the river The rest were to land on the south side of the Tennessee where Missionary Ridge would strike it if prolonged and a sufficient number of men to man the boats were to push to the north side to ferry over the main body of Sherman s command while those left on the south side intrenched themselves Thomas was to move out from his lines facing the ridge leaving enough of Palmer s corps to guard against an attack down the valley Lookout Valley being of no present value to us and being untenable by the enemy if we should secure Missionary Ridge Hooker s orders were changed His revised orders brought him to Chattanooga by the established route north of the Tennessee He was then to move out to the right to Rossville Hooker s position in Lookout Valley was absolutely essential to us so long as Chattanooga was besieged It was the key to our line for supplying the army But it was not essential after the enemy was dispersed from our front or even after the battle for this purpose was begun Hooker s orders therefore were designed to get his force past Lookout Mountain and Chattanooga Valley and up to Missionary Ridge By crossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come into Chattanooga Valley in rear of the line held by the enemy across the valley and would necessarily force its evacuation Orders were accordingly given to march by this route But days before the battle began the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of action were all considered The passage over the mountain was a difficult one to make in the face of an enemy It might consume so much time as to lose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where they were more wanted After reaching Chattanooga Valley the creek of the same name quite a formidable stream to get an army over had to be crossed I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep Lookout Mountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge By marching Hooker to the north side of the river thence up the stream and recrossing at the town he could be got in position at any named time when in this new position he would have Chattanooga Creek behind him and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause the evacuation by the enemy of his line across the valley and on Lookout Mountain Hooker s order was changed accordingly As explained elsewhere the original order had to be reverted to because of a flood in the river rendering the bridge at Brown s Ferry unsafe for the passage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring all the troops together against Missionary Ridge The next day after Sherman s arrival I took him with Generals Thomas and Smith and other officers to the north side of the river and showed them the ground over which Sherman had to march and pointed out generally what he was expected to do I as well as the authorities in Washington was still in a great state of anxiety for Burnside s safety Burnside himself I believe was the only one who did not share in this anxiety Nothing could be done for him however until Sherman s troops were up As soon therefore as the inspection was over Sherman started for Bridgeport to hasten matters rowing a boat himself I believe from Kelly s Ferry Sherman had left Bridgeport the night of the fourteenth reached Chattanooga the evening of the fifteenth made the above described inspection on the morning of the sixteenth and started back the same evening to hurry up his command fully appreciating the importance of time His march was conducted with as much expedition as the roads and season would admit of By the twentieth he was himself at Brown s Ferry with the head of column but many of his troops were far behind and one division Ewing s was at Trenton sent that way to create the impression that Lookout was to be taken from the south Sherman received his orders at the ferry and was asked if he could not be ready for the assault the following morning News had been received that the battle had been commenced at Knoxville Burnside had been cut off from telegraphic communications The President the Secretary of War and General Halleck were in an agony of suspense My suspense was also great but more endurable because I was where I could soon do something to relieve the situation It was impossible to get Sherman s troops up for the next day I then asked him if they could not be got up to make the assault on the morning of the twenty twod and ordered Thomas to move on that date But the elements were against us It rained all the twentieth and twenty first The river rose so rapidly that it was difficult to keep the pontoons in place General Orlando B Willcox a division commander under Burnside was at this time occupying a position farther up the valley than Knoxville about Maynardville and was still in telegraphic communication with the North A dispatch was received from him saying that he was threatened from the east The following was sent in reply If you can communicate with General Burnside say to him that our attack on Bragg will commence in the morning If successful such a move will be made as I think will relieve East Tennessee if he can hold out Longstreet passing through our lines to Kentucky need not cause alarm He would find the country so bare that he would lose his transportation and artillery before reaching Kentucky and would meet such a force before he got through that he could not return Meantime Sherman continued his crossing without intermission as fast as his troops could be got up The crossing had to be effected in full view of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain Once over however the troops soon disappeared behind the detached hill on the north side and would not come to view again either to watchmen on Lookout Mountain or Missionary Ridge until they emerged between the hills to strike the bank of the river But when Sherman s advance reached a point opposite the town of Chattanooga Howard who it will be remembered had been concealed behind the hills on the north side took up his line of march to join the troops on the south side His crossing was in full view both from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout and the enemy of course supposed these troops to be Sherman s This enabled Sherman to get to his assigned position without discovery CHAPTER XLIII PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE ENEMY SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN GENERAL HOOKER S FIGHT On the twentieth when so much was occurring to discourage rains falling so heavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown s Ferry and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge news coming of a battle raging at Knoxville of Willcox being threatened by a force from the east a letter was received from Bragg which contained these words As there may still be some non combatants in Chattanooga I deem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their early withdrawal Of course I understood that this was a device intended to deceive but I did not know what the intended deception was On the twenty twod however a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leaving our front and on that day Buckner s division was sent to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville and another division started to follow but was recalled The object of Bragg s letter no doubt was in some way to detain me until Knoxville could be captured and his troops there be returned to Chattanooga During the night of the twenty first the rest of the pontoon boats completed one hundred and sixteen in all were carried up to and placed in North Chickamauga The material for the roadway over these was deposited out of view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of the Tennessee where the north end of the bridge was to rest Hearing nothing from Burnside and hearing much of the distress in Washington on his account I could no longer defer operations for his relief I determined therefore to do on the twenty threed with the Army of the Cumberland what had been intended to be done on the twenty fourth The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made very strong for defence during the months it had been besieged The line was about a mile from the town and extended from Citico Creek a small stream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into the Tennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga on the left to Chattanooga Creek on the right All commanding points on the line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery The important elevations within the line had all been carefully fortified and supplied with a proper armament Among the elevations so fortified was one to the east of the town named Fort Wood It owed its importance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town and Missionary Ridge where most of the strength of the enemy was Fort Wood had in it twenty two pieces of artillery most of which would reach the nearer points of the enemy s line On the morning of the twenty threed Thomas according to instructions moved Granger s corps of two divisions Sheridan and T J Wood commanding to the foot of Fort Wood and formed them into line as if going on parade Sheridan on the right Wood to the left extending to or near Citico Creek Palmer commanding the fourteenth corps held that part of our line facing south and southwest He supported Sheridan with one division Baird s while his other division under Johnson remained in the trenches under arms ready to be moved to any point Howard s corps was moved in rear of the centre The picket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other At two o clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance By this time the clouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his elevated position all that was going on The signal for advance was given by a booming of cannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line The rebel pickets were soon driven back upon the main guards which occupied minor and detached heights between the main ridge and our lines These too were carried before halting and before the enemy had time to reinforce their advance guards But it was not without loss on both sides This movement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one we occupied in the morning and the one which the enemy had occupied up to this time The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the other way During the following night they were made strong We lost in this preliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded while the enemy probably lost quite as heavily including the prisoners that were captured With the exception of the firing of artillery kept up from Missionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in this ended the fighting for the first day The advantage was greatly on our side now and if I could only have been assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should have rested more easily But we were doing the best we could for him and the cause By the night of the twenty threed Sherman s command was in a position to move though one division Osterhaus s had not yet crossed the river at Brown s Ferry The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered it impossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops to cross but I was determined to move that night even without this division Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report to Hooker if he could not cross by eight o clock on the morning of the twenty fourth Because of the break in the bridge Hooker s orders were again changed but this time only back to those first given to him General W F Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of the Military Division To him were given the general direction of moving troops by the boats from North Chickamauga laying the bridge after they reached their position and generally all the duties pertaining to his office of chief engineer During the night General Morgan L Smith s division was marched to the point where the pontoons were and the brigade of Giles A Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manning the boats and surprising the enemy s pickets on the south bank of the river During this night also General J M Brannan chief of artillery moved forty pieces of artillery belonging to the Army of the Cumberland and placed them on the north side of the river so as to command the ground opposite to aid in protecting the approach to the point where the south end of the bridge was to rest He had to use Sherman s artillery horses for this purpose Thomas having none At two o clock in the morning November twenty fourth Giles A Smith pushed out from the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats each loaded with thirty brave and well armed men The boats with their precious freight dropped down quietly with the current to avoid attracting the attention of any one who could convey information to the enemy until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga Here a few boats were landed the troops debarked and a rush was made upon the picket guard known to be at that point The guard were surprised and twenty of their number captured The remainder of the troops effected a landing at the point where the bridge was to start with equally good results The work of ferrying over Sherman s command from the north side of the Tennessee was at once commenced using the pontoons for the purpose A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist The rest of M L Smith s division came first then the division of John E Smith The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching their position By daylight the two entire divisions were over and well covered by the works they had built The work of laying the bridge on which to cross the artillery and cavalry was now begun The ferrying over the infantry was continued with the steamer and the pontoons taking the pontoons however as fast as they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge By a little past noon the bridge was completed as well as one over the South Chickamauga connecting the troops left on that side with their comrades below and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of the Tennessee Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge By one o clock he started with M L Smith on his left keeping nearly the course of Chickamauga River J E Smith next to the right and a little to the rear and Ewing still farther to the right and also a little to the rear of J E Smith s command in column ready to deploy to the right if an enemy should come from that direction A good skirmish line preceded each of these columns Soon the foot of the hill was reached the skirmishers pushed directly up followed closely by their supports By half past three Sherman was in possession of the height without having sustained much loss A brigade from each division was now brought up and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand The enemy did not seem to be aware of this movement until the top of the hill was gained There had been a drizzling rain during the day and the clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of Missionary Ridge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley But now the enemy opened fire upon their assailants and made several attempts with their skirmishers to drive them away but without avail Later in the day a more determined attack was made but this too failed and Sherman was left to fortify what he had gained Sherman s cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge was completed and by half past three the whole of it was over both bridges and on its way to strike the enemy s communications at Chickamauga Station All of Sherman s command was now south of the Tennessee During the afternoon General Giles A Smith was severely wounded and carried from the field Thomas having done on the twenty threed what was expected of him on the twenty fourth there was nothing for him to do this day except to strengthen his position Howard however effected a crossing of Citico Creek and a junction with Sherman and was directed to report to him With two or three regiments of his command he moved in the morning along the banks of the Tennessee and reached the point where the bridge was being laid He went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and moving himself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadway put upon it Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm between them which was now narrow and in a few minutes closed While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga Hooker was engaged on the west He had three divisions Osterhaus s of the fifteenth corps Army of the Tennessee Geary s twelfth corps Army of the Potomac and Cruft s fourteenth corps Army of the Cumberland Geary was on the right at Wauhatchie Cruft at the centre and Osterhaus near Brown s Ferry These troops were all west of Lookout Creek The enemy had the east bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched and three brigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked These brigades occupied the summit of the mountain General Carter L Stevenson was in command of the whole Why any troops except artillery with a small infantry guard were kept on the mountain top I do not see A hundred men could have held the summit which is a palisade for more than thirty feet down against the assault of any number of men from the position Hooker occupied The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker s command was rugged heavily timbered and full of chasms making it difficult to advance with troops even in the absence of an opposing force Farther up the ground becomes more even and level and was in cultivation On the east side the slope is much more gradual and a good wagon road zigzagging up it connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit Early on the morning of the twenty fourth Hooker moved Geary s division supported by a brigade of Cruft s up Lookout Creek to effect a crossing The remainder of Cruft s division was to seize the bridge over the creek near the crossing of the railroad Osterhaus was to move up to the bridge and cross it The bridge was seized by Gross s brigade after a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it This attracted the enemy so that Geary s movement farther up was not observed A heavy mist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of the mountain He crossed the creek almost unobserved and captured the picket of over forty men on guard near by He then commenced ascending the mountain directly in his front By this time the enemy was seen coming down from their camps on the mountain slope and filing into their rifle pits to contest the crossing of the bridge By eleven o clock the bridge was complete Osterhaus was up and after some sharp skirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killed and captured While the operations at the bridge were progressing Geary was pushing up the hill over great obstacles resisted by the enemy directly in his front and in face of the guns on top of the mountain The enemy seeing their left flank and rear menaced gave way and were followed by Cruft and Osterhaus Soon these were up abreast of Geary and the whole command pushed up the hill driving the enemy in advance By noon Geary had gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain with his right close up to the base of the upper palisade but there were strong fortifications in his front The rest of the command coming up a line was formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek Thomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob Hooker s advance now made our line a continuous one It was in full view extending from the Tennessee River where Sherman had crossed up Chickamauga River to the base of Mission Ridge over the top of the north end of the ridge to Chattanooga Valley then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more across the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek thence up the slope of Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade The day was hazy so that Hooker s operations were not visible to us except at moments when the clouds would rise But the sound of his artillery and musketry was heard incessantly The enemy on his front was partially fortified but was soon driven out of his works During the afternoon the clouds which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hide whatever was going on from the view of those below settled down and made it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time At four o clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable By a little after five direct communication was established and a brigade of troops was sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him These troops had to cross Chattanooga Creek and met with some opposition but soon overcame it and by night the commander General Carlin reported to Hooker and was assigned to his left I now telegraphed to Washington The fight to day progressed favorably Sherman carried the end of Missionary Ridge and his right is now at the tunnel and his left at Chickamauga Creek Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain and now hold the eastern slope and a point high up Hooker reports two thousand prisoners taken besides which a small number have fallen into our hands from Missionary Ridge The next day the President replied Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here Well done Many thanks to all Remember Burnside And Halleck also telegraphed I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans I fear that Burnside is hard pushed and that any further delay may prove fatal I know you will do all in your power to relieve him The division of Jefferson C Davis Army of the Cumberland had been sent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they were deposited in the river and to prevent all ingress or egress of citizens On the night of the twenty fourth his division having crossed with Sherman occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plain to the north base of Missionary Ridge Firing continued to a late hour in the night but it was not connected with an assault at any point CHAPTER XLIV BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA A GALLANT CHARGE COMPLETE ROUT OF THE ENEMY PURSUIT OF THE CONFEDERATES GENERAL BRAGG REMARKS ON CHATTANOOGA At twelve o clock at night when all was quiet I began to give orders for the next day and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside Sherman was directed to attack at daylight Hooker was ordered to move at the same hour and endeavor to intercept the enemy s retreat if he still remained if he had gone then to move directly to Rossville and operate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge As I was with him on Orchard Knob he would not move without further orders from me The morning of the twenty fifth opened clear and bright and the whole field was in full view from the top of Orchard Knob It remained so all day Bragg s headquarters were in full view and officers presumably staff officers could be seen coming and going constantly The point of ground which Sherman had carried on the twenty fourth was almost disconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy A low pass over which there is a wagon road crossing the hill and near which there is a railroad tunnel intervenes between the two hills The problem now was to get to the main ridge The enemy was fortified on the point and back farther where the ground was still higher was a second fortification commanding the first Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough to see and by sunrise his command was in motion Three brigades held the hill already gained Morgan L Smith moved along the east base of Missionary Ridge Loomis along the west base supported by two brigades of John E Smith s division and Corse with his brigade was between the two moving directly towards the hill to be captured The ridge is steep and heavily wooded on the east side where M L Smith s troops were advancing but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the west side The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of the rebel works Morgan L Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemy off from the railroad bridge and the means of bringing up supplies by rail from Chickamauga Station where the main depot was located The enemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from the position we had gained but without success The contest lasted for two hours Corse a brave and efficient commander was badly wounded in this assault Sherman now threatened both Bragg s flank and his stores and made it necessary for him to weaken other points of his line to strengthen his right From the position I occupied I could see column after column of Bragg s forces moving against Sherman Every Confederate gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces was concentrated upon him J E Smith with two brigades charged up the west side of the ridge to the support of Corse s command over open ground and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry and reached the very parapet of the enemy He lay here for a time but the enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank he was compelled to fall back followed by the foe A few hundred yards brought Smith s troops into a wood where they were speedily reformed when they charged and drove the attacking party back to his intrenchments Seeing the advance repulse and second advance of J E Smith from the position I occupied I directed Thomas to send a division to reinforce him Baird s division was accordingly sent from the right of Orchard Knob It had to march a considerable distance directly under the eye of the enemy to reach its position Bragg at once commenced massing in the same direction This was what I wanted But it had now got to be late in the afternoon and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossing the ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville and compelling Bragg to mass in that direction also The enemy had evacuated Lookout Mountain during the night as I expected he would In crossing the valley he burned the bridge over Chattanooga Creek and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him Hooker was off bright and early with no obstructions in his front but distance and the destruction above named He was detained four hours crossing Chattanooga Creek and thus was lost the immediate advantage I expected from his forces His reaching Bragg s flank and extending across it was to be the signal for Thomas s assault of the ridge But Sherman s condition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief could not be delayed any longer Sheridan s and Wood s divisions had been lying under arms from early morning ready to move the instant the signal was given I now directed Thomas to order the charge at once sixteen I watched eagerly to see the effect and became impatient at last that there was no indication of any charge being made The centre of the line which was to make the charge was near where Thomas and I stood but concealed from view by an intervening forest Turning to Thomas to inquire what caused the delay I was surprised to see Thomas J Wood one of the division commanders who was to make the charge standing talking to him I spoke to General Wood asking him why he did not charge as ordered an hour before He replied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it but that he had been ready all day to move at a moment s notice I told him to make the charge at once He was off in a moment and in an incredibly short time loud cheering was heard and he and Sheridan were driving the enemy s advance before them towards Missionary Ridge The Confederates were strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in front of us and had a second line half way down and another at the base Our men drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle pits so rapidly and followed them so closely that rebel and Union troops went over the first line of works almost at the same time Many rebels were captured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higher up the hill Those that were not captured retreated and were pursued The retreating hordes being between friends and pursuers caused the enemy to fire high to avoid killing their own men In fact on that occasion the Union soldier nearest the enemy was in the safest position Without awaiting further orders or stopping to reform on our troops went to the second line of works over that and on for the crest thus effectually carrying out my orders of the eighteenth for the battle and of the twenty fourth seventeen for this charge I watched their progress with intense interest The fire along the rebel line was terrific Cannon and musket balls filled the air but the damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition expended The pursuit continued until the crest was reached and soon our men were seen climbing over the Confederate barriers at different points in front of both Sheridan s and Wood s divisions The retreat of the enemy along most of his line was precipitate and the panic so great that Bragg and his officers lost all control over their men Many were captured and thousands threw away their arms in their flight Sheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at a point above where the enemy crossed He met some resistance from troops occupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge probably to cover the retreat of the main body and of the artillery and trains It was now getting dark but Sheridan without halting on that account pushed his men forward up this second hill slowly and without attracting the attention of the men placed to defend it while he detached to the right and left to surround the position The enemy discovered the movement before these dispositions were complete and beat a hasty retreat leaving artillery wagon trains and many prisoners in our hands To Sheridan s prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland and the nation are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners artillery and small arms that day Except for his prompt pursuit so much in this way would not have been accomplished While the advance up Mission Ridge was going forward General Thomas with staff General Gordon Granger commander of the corps making the assault and myself and staff occupied Orchard Knob from which the entire field could be observed The moment the troops were seen going over the last line of rebel defences I ordered Granger to join his command and mounting my horse I rode to the front General Thomas left about the same time Sheridan on the extreme right was already in pursuit of the enemy east of the ridge Wood who commanded the division to the left of Sheridan accompanied his men on horseback in the charge but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit To the left in Baird s front where Bragg s troops had massed against Sherman the resistance was more stubborn and the contest lasted longer I ordered Granger to follow the enemy with Wood s division but he was so much excited and kept up such a roar of musketry in the direction the enemy had taken that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had got well out of the way The enemy confronting Sherman now seeing everything to their left giving way fled also Sherman however was not aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall when he received orders to pursue at daylight in the morning As soon as Sherman discovered that the enemy had left his front he directed his reserves Davis s division of the Army of the Cumberland to push over the pontoon bridge at the mouth of the Chickamauga and to move forward to Chickamauga Station He ordered Howard to move up the stream some two miles to where there was an old bridge repair it during the night and follow Davis at four o clock in the morning Morgan L Smith was ordered to reconnoitre the tunnel to see if that was still held Nothing was found there but dead bodies of men of both armies The rest of Sherman s command was directed to follow Howard at daylight in the morning to get on to the railroad towards Graysville Hooker as stated was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destruction of the bridge at that point He got his troops over with the exception of the artillery by fording the stream at a little after three o clock Leaving his artillery to follow when the bridge should be reconstructed he pushed on with the remainder of his command At Rossville he came upon the flank of a division of the enemy which soon commenced a retreat along the ridge This threw them on Palmer They could make but little resistance in the position they were caught in and as many of them as could do so escaped Many however were captured Hooker s position during the night of the twenty fifth was near Rossville extending east of the ridge Palmer was on his left on the road to Graysville During the night I telegraphed to Willcox that Bragg had been defeated and that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could hold out to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory and informed him that forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside Before the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for the relief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear Thomas was directed to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanooga loaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition Granger s corps was to move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of the Holston and up that to Knoxville accompanied by the boat In addition to the supplies transported by boat the men were to carry forty rounds of ammunition in their cartridge boxes and four days rations in haversacks In the battle of Chattanooga troops from the Army of the Potomac from the Army of the Tennessee and from the Army of the Cumberland participated In fact the accidents growing out of the heavy rains and the sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that the organizations were not kept together under their respective commanders during the battle Hooker on the right had Geary s division of the twelfth corps Army of the Potomac Osterhaus s division of the fifteenth corps Army of the Tennessee and Cruft s division of the Army of the Cumberland Sherman had three divisions of his own army Howard s corps from the Army of the Potomac and Jefferson C Davis s division of the Army of the Cumberland There was no jealousy hardly rivalry Indeed I doubt whether officers or men took any note at the time of the fact of this intermingling of commands All saw a defiant foe surrounding them and took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him and it made no difference where the troops came from so that the end was accomplished The victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds considering the advantage the enemy had of position and was accomplished more easily than was expected by reason of Bragg s making several grave mistakes first in sending away his ablest corps commander with over twenty thousand troops second in sending away a division of troops on the eve of battle third in placing so much of a force on the plain in front of his impregnable position It was known that mister Jefferson Davis had visited Bragg on Missionary Ridge a short time before my reaching Chattanooga It was reported and believed that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference between Bragg and Longstreet and finding this difficult to do planned the campaign against Knoxville to be conducted by the latter general I had known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war the latter very well We had been three years at West Point together and after my graduation for a time in the same regiment Then we served together in the Mexican War I had known Bragg in Mexico and met him occasionally subsequently I could well understand how there might be an irreconcilable difference between them Bragg was a remarkably intelligent and well informed man professionally and otherwise He was also thoroughly upright But he was possessed of an irascible temper and was naturally disputatious A man of the highest moral character and the most correct habits yet in the old army he was in frequent trouble As a subordinate he was always on the lookout to catch his commanding officer infringing his prerogatives as a post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightest neglect even of the most trivial order I have heard in the old army an anecdote very characteristic of Bragg On one occasion when stationed at a post of several companies commanded by a field officer he was himself commanding one of the companies and at the same time acting as post quartermaster and commissary He was first lieutenant at the time but his captain was detached on other duty As commander of the company he made a requisition upon the quartermaster himself for something he wanted As quartermaster he declined to fill the requisition and endorsed on the back of it his reasons for so doing As company commander he responded to this urging that his requisition called for nothing but what he was entitled to and that it was the duty of the quartermaster to fill it As quartermaster he still persisted that he was right In this condition of affairs Bragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer of the post The latter when he saw the nature of the matter referred exclaimed My God mister Bragg you have quarrelled with every officer in the army and now you are quarrelling with yourself Longstreet was an entirely different man He was brave honest intelligent a very capable soldier subordinate to his superiors just and kind to his subordinates but jealous of his own rights which he had the courage to maintain He was never on the lookout to detect a slight but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given It may be that Longstreet was not sent to Knoxville for the reason stated but because mister Davis had an exalted opinion of his own military genius and thought he saw a chance of killing two birds with one stone On several occasions during the war he came to the relief of the Union army by means of his SUPERIOR MILITARY GENIUS I speak advisedly when I saw mister Davis prided himself on his military capacity He says so himself virtually in his answer to the notice of his nomination to the Confederate presidency Some of his generals have said so in their writings since the downfall of the Confederacy My recollection is that my first orders for the battle of Chattanooga were as fought Sherman was to get on Missionary Ridge as he did Hooker to cross the north end of Lookout Mountain as he did sweep across Chattanooga Valley and get across the south end of the ridge near Rossville When Hooker had secured that position the Army of the Cumberland was to assault in the centre Before Sherman arrived however the order was so changed as that Hooker was directed to come to Chattanooga by the north bank of the Tennessee River The waters in the river owing to heavy rains rose so fast that the bridge at Brown s Ferry could not be maintained in a condition to be used in crossing troops upon it For this reason Hooker s orders were changed by telegraph back to what they were originally NOTE From this point on this volume was written with the exception of the campaign in the Wilderness which had been previously written by General Grant after his great illness in April and the present arrangement of the subject matter was made by him between the tenth and eighteenth of July eighteen eighty five CHAPTER XLV THE RELIEF OF KNOXVILLE HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO NASHVILLE VISITING KNOXVILLE CIPHER CIPHER DISPATCHES WITHHOLDING ORDERS Chattanooga now being secure to the National troops beyond any doubt I immediately turned my attention to relieving Knoxville about the situation of which the President in particular was very anxious Prior to the battles I had made preparations for sending troops to the relief of Burnside at the very earliest moment after securing Chattanooga We had there two little steamers which had been built and fitted up from the remains of old boats and put in condition to run General Thomas was directed to have one of these boats loaded with rations and ammunition and move up the Tennessee River to the mouth of the Holston keeping the boat all the time abreast of the troops General Granger with the fourth corps reinforced to make twenty thousand men was to start the moment Missionary Ridge was carried and under no circumstances were the troops to return to their old camps With the provisions carried and the little that could be got in the country it was supposed he could hold out until Longstreet was driven away after which event East Tennessee would furnish abundance of food for Burnside s army and his own also While following the enemy on the twenty sixth and again on the morning of the twenty seventh part of the time by the road to Ringgold I directed Thomas verbally not to start Granger until he received further orders from me advising him that I was going to the front to more fully see the situation I was not right sure but that Bragg s troops might be over their stampede by the time they reached Dalton In that case Bragg might think it well to take the road back to Cleveland move thence towards Knoxville and uniting with Longstreet make a sudden dash upon Burnside When I arrived at Ringgold however on the twenty seventh I saw that the retreat was most earnest The enemy had been throwing away guns caissons and small arms abandoning provisions and altogether seemed to be moving like a disorganized mob with the exception of Cleburne s division which was acting as rear guard to cover the retreat When Hooker moved from Rossville toward Ringgold Palmer s division took the road to Graysville and Sherman moved by the way of Chickamauga Station toward the same point As soon as I saw the situation at Ringgold I sent a staff officer back to Chattanooga to advise Thomas of the condition of affairs and direct him by my orders to start Granger at once Feeling now that the troops were already on the march for the relief of Burnside I was in no hurry to get back but stayed at Ringgold through the day to prepare for the return of our troops Ringgold is in a valley in the mountains situated between East Chickamauga Creek and Taylor s Ridge and about twenty miles south east from Chattanooga I arrived just as the artillery that Hooker had left behind at Chattanooga Creek got up His men were attacking Cleburne s division which had taken a strong position in the adjacent hills so as to cover the retreat of the Confederate army through a narrow gorge which presents itself at that point Just beyond the gorge the valley is narrow and the creek so tortuous that it has to be crossed a great many times in the course of the first mile This attack was unfortunate and cost us some men unnecessarily Hooker captured however three pieces of artillery and two hundred thirty prisoners and one hundred thirty rebel dead were left upon the field I directed General Hooker to collect the flour and wheat in the neighboring mills for the use of the troops and then to destroy the mills and all other property that could be of use to the enemy but not to make any wanton destruction At this point Sherman came up having reached Graysville with his troops where he found Palmer had preceded him Palmer had picked up many prisoners and much abandoned property on the route I went back in the evening to Graysville with Sherman remained there over night and did not return to Chattanooga until the following night the twenty ninth I then found that Thomas had not yet started Granger thus having lost a full day which I deemed of so much importance in determining the fate of Knoxville Thomas and Granger were aware that on the twenty threed of the month Burnside had telegraphed that his supplies would last for ten or twelve days and during that time he could hold out against Longstreet but if not relieved within the time indicated he would be obliged to surrender or attempt to retreat To effect a retreat would have been an impossibility He was already very low in ammunition and with an army pursuing he would not have been able to gather supplies Finding that Granger had not only not started but was very reluctant to go he having decided for himself that it was a very bad move to make I sent word to General Sherman of the situation and directed him to march to the relief of Knoxville I also gave him the problem that we had to solve that Burnside had now but four to six days supplies left and that he must be relieved within that time Sherman fortunately had not started on his return from Graysville having sent out detachments on the railroad which runs from Dalton to Cleveland and Knoxville to thoroughly destroy that road and these troops had not yet returned to camp I was very loath to send Sherman because his men needed rest after their long march from Memphis and hard fighting at Chattanooga But I had become satisfied that Burnside would not be rescued if his relief depended upon General Granger s movements Sherman had left his camp on the north side of the Tennessee River near Chattanooga on the night of the twenty threed the men having two days cooked rations in their haversacks Expecting to be back in their tents by that time and to be engaged in battle while out they took with them neither overcoats nor blankets The weather was already cold and at night they must have suffered more or less The two days rations had already lasted them five days and they were now to go through a country which had been run over so much by Confederate troops that there was but little probability of finding much food They did however succeed in capturing some flour They also found a good deal of bran in some of the mills which the men made up into bread and in this and other ways they eked out an existence until they could reach Knoxville I was so very anxious that Burnside should get news of the steps being taken for his relief and thus induce him to hold out a little longer if it became necessary that I determined to send a message to him I therefore sent a member of my staff Colonel J H Wilson to get into Knoxville if he could report to Burnside the situation fully and give him all the encouragement possible mister Charles A Dana was at Chattanooga during the battle and had been there even before I assumed command mister Dana volunteered to accompany Colonel Wilson and did accompany him I put the information of what was being done for the relief of Knoxville into writing and directed that in some way or other it must be secretly managed so as to have a copy of this fall into the hands of General Longstreet They made the trip safely General Longstreet did learn of Sherman s coming in advance of his reaching there and Burnside was prepared to hold out even for a longer time if it had been necessary Burnside had stretched a boom across the Holston River to catch scows and flats as they floated down On these by previous arrangements with the loyal people of East Tennessee were placed flour and corn with forage and provisions generally and were thus secured for the use of the Union troops They also drove cattle into Knoxville by the east side which was not covered by the enemy so that when relief arrived Burnside had more provisions on hand than when he had last reported Our total loss not including Burnside s in all these engagements amounted to seven hundred fifty seven killed four thousand five hundred twenty nine wounded and three hundred thirty missing We captured six thousand one hundred forty two prisoners about fifty per cent more than the enemy reported for their total loss forty pieces of artillery sixty nine artillery carriages and caissons and over seven thousand stands of small arms The enemy s loss in arms was probably much greater than here reported because we picked up a great many that were found abandoned I had at Chattanooga in round numbers about sixty thousand men Bragg had about half this number but his position was supposed to be impregnable It was his own fault that he did not have more men present He had sent Longstreet away with his corps swelled by reinforcements up to over twenty thousand men thus reducing his own force more than one third and depriving himself of the presence of the ablest general of his command He did this too after our troops had opened a line of communication by way of Brown s and Kelly s ferries with Bridgeport thus securing full rations and supplies of every kind and also when he knew reinforcements were coming to me Knoxville was of no earthly use to him while Chattanooga was in our hands If he should capture Chattanooga Knoxville with its garrison would have fallen into his hands without a struggle I have never been able to see the wisdom of this move Then too after Sherman had arrived and when Bragg knew that he was on the north side of the Tennessee River he sent Buckner s division to reinforce Longstreet He also started another division a day later but our attack having commenced before it reached Knoxville Bragg ordered it back It had got so far however that it could not return to Chattanooga in time to be of service there It is possible this latter blunder may have been made by Bragg having become confused as to what was going on on our side Sherman had as already stated crossed to the north side of the Tennessee River at Brown s Ferry in full view of Bragg s troops from Lookout Mountain a few days before the attack They then disappeared behind foot hills and did not come to the view of the troops on Missionary Ridge until they met their assault Bragg knew it was Sherman s troops that had crossed and they being so long out of view may have supposed that they had gone up the north bank of the Tennessee River to the relief of Knoxville and that Longstreet was therefore in danger But the first great blunder detaching Longstreet cannot be accounted for in any way I know of If he had captured Chattanooga East Tennessee would have fallen without a struggle It would have been a victory for us to have got our army away from Chattanooga safely It was a manifold greater victory to drive away the besieging army a still greater one to defeat that army in his chosen ground and nearly annihilate it The probabilities are that our loss in killed was the heavier as we were the attacking party The enemy reported his loss in killed at three hundred sixty one but as he reported his missing at four thousand one hundred forty six while we held over six thousand of them as prisoners and there must have been hundreds if not thousands who deserted but little reliance can be placed on this report There was certainly great dissatisfaction with Bragg on the part of the soldiers for his harsh treatment of them and a disposition to get away if they could Then too Chattanooga following in the same half year with Gettysburg in the East and Vicksburg in the West there was much the same feeling in the South at this time that there had been in the North the fall and winter before If the same license had been allowed the people and press in the South that was allowed in the North Chattanooga would probably have been the last battle fought for the preservation of the Union General William F Smith s services in these battles had been such that I thought him eminently entitled to promotion I was aware that he had previously been named by the President for promotion to the grade of major general but that the Senate had rejected the nomination I was not aware of the reasons for this course and therefore strongly recommended him for a major generalcy My recommendation was heeded and the appointment made Upon the raising of the siege of Knoxville I of course informed the authorities at Washington the President and Secretary of War of the fact which caused great rejoicing there The President especially was rejoiced that Knoxville had been relieved eighteen without further bloodshed The safety of Burnside s army and the loyal people of East Tennessee had been the subject of much anxiety to the President for several months during which time he was doing all he could to relieve the situation sending a new commander nineteen with a few thousand troops by the way of Cumberland Gap and telegraphing me daily almost hourly to remember Burnside do something for Burnside and other appeals of like tenor He saw no escape for East Tennessee until after our victory at Chattanooga Even then he was afraid that Burnside might be out of ammunition in a starving condition or overpowered and his anxiety was still intense until he heard that Longstreet had been driven from the field Burnside followed Longstreet only to Strawberry Plains some twenty miles or more east and then stopped believing that Longstreet would leave the State The latter did not do so however but stopped only a short distance farther on and subsisted his army for the entire winter off East Tennessee Foster now relieved Burnside Sherman made disposition of his troops along the Tennessee River in accordance with instructions I left Thomas in command at Chattanooga and about the twentieth of December moved my headquarters to Nashville Tennessee Nashville was the most central point from which to communicate with my entire military division and also with the authorities at Washington While remaining at Chattanooga I was liable to have my telegraphic communications cut so as to throw me out of communication with both my command and Washington Nothing occurred at Nashville worthy of mention during the winter twenty so I set myself to the task of having troops in positions from which they could move to advantage and in collecting all necessary supplies so as to be ready to claim a due share of the enemy s attention upon the appearance of the first good weather in the spring I expected to retain the command I then had and prepared myself for the campaign against Atlanta I also had great hopes of having a campaign made against Mobile from the Gulf I expected after Atlanta fell to occupy that place permanently and to cut off Lee s army from the West by way of the road running through Augusta to Atlanta and thence south west I was preparing to hold Atlanta with a small garrison and it was my expectation to push through to Mobile if that city was in our possession if not to Savannah and in this manner to get possession of the only east and west railroad that would then be left to the enemy But the spring campaign against Mobile was not made The Army of the Ohio had been getting supplies over Cumberland Gap until their animals had nearly all starved I now determined to go myself to see if there was any possible chance of using that route in the spring and if not to abandon it Accordingly I left Nashville in the latter part of December by rail for Chattanooga From Chattanooga I took one of the little steamers previously spoken of as having been built there and putting my horses aboard went up to the junction of the Clinch with the Tennessee From that point the railroad had been repaired up to Knoxville and out east to Strawberry Plains I went by rail therefore to Knoxville where I remained for several days General John G Foster was then commanding the Department of the Ohio It was an intensely cold winter the thermometer being down as low as zero every morning for more than a week while I was at Knoxville and on my way from there on horseback to Lexington Kentucky the first point where I could reach rail to carry me back to my headquarters at Nashville The road over Cumberland Gap and back of it was strewn with debris of broken wagons and dead animals much as I had found it on my first trip to Chattanooga over Waldron s Ridge The road had been cut up to as great a depth as clay could be by mules and wagons and in that condition frozen so that the ride of six days from Strawberry Plains to Lexington over these holes and knobs in the road was a very cheerless one and very disagreeable I found a great many people at home along that route both in Tennessee and Kentucky and almost universally intensely loyal They would collect in little places where we would stop of evenings to see me generally hearing of my approach before we arrived The people naturally expected to see the commanding general the oldest person in the party I was then forty one years of age while my medical director was gray haired and probably twelve or more years my senior The crowds would generally swarm around him and thus give me an opportunity of quietly dismounting and getting into the house It also gave me an opportunity of hearing passing remarks from one spectator to another about their general Those remarks were apt to be more complimentary to the cause than to the appearance of the supposed general owing to his being muffled up and also owing to the travel worn condition we were all in after a hard day s ride I was back in Nashville by the thirteenth of January eighteen sixty four When I started on this trip it was necessary for me to have some person along who could turn dispatches into cipher and who could also read the cipher dispatches which I was liable to receive daily and almost hourly Under the rules of the War Department at that time mister Stanton had taken entire control of the matter of regulating the telegraph and determining how it should be used and of saying who and who alone should have the ciphers The operators possessed of the ciphers as well as the ciphers used were practically independent of the commanders whom they were serving immediately under and had to report to the War Department through General Stager all the dispatches which they received or forwarded I was obliged to leave the telegraphic operator back at Nashville because that was the point at which all dispatches to me would come to be forwarded from there As I have said it was necessary for me also to have an operator during this inspection who had possession of this cipher to enable me to telegraph to my division and to the War Department without my dispatches being read by all the operators along the line of wires over which they were transmitted Accordingly I ordered the cipher operator to turn over the key to Captain Cyrus B Comstock of the Corps of Engineers whom I had selected as a wise and discreet man who certainly could be trusted with the cipher if the operator at my headquarters could The operator refused point blank to turn over the key to Captain Comstock as directed by me stating that his orders from the War Department were not to give it to anybody the commanding general or any one else I told him I would see whether he would or not He said that if he did he would be punished I told him if he did not he most certainly would be punished Finally seeing that punishment was certain if he refused longer to obey my order and being somewhat remote even if he was not protected altogether from the consequences of his disobedience to his orders from the War Department he yielded When I returned from Knoxville I found quite a commotion The operator had been reprimanded very severely and ordered to be relieved I informed the Secretary of War or his assistant secretary in charge of the telegraph Stager that the man could not be relieved for he had only obeyed my orders It was absolutely necessary for me to have the cipher and the man would most certainly have been punished if he had not delivered it that they would have to punish me if they punished anybody or words to that effect This was about the only thing approaching a disagreeable difference between the Secretary of War and myself that occurred until the war was over when we had another little spat Owing to his natural disposition to assume all power and control in all matters that he had anything whatever to do with he boldly took command of the armies and while issuing no orders on the subject prohibited any order from me going out of the adjutant general s office until he had approved it This was done by directing the adjutant general to hold any orders that came from me to be issued from the adjutant general s office until he had examined them and given his approval He never disturbed himself either in examining my orders until it was entirely convenient for him so that orders which I had prepared would often lie there three or four days before he would sanction them I remonstrated against this in writing and the Secretary apologetically restored me to my rightful position of General in Chief of the Army But he soon lapsed again and took control much as before After the relief of Knoxville Sherman had proposed to Burnside that he should go with him to drive Longstreet out of Tennessee but Burnside assured him that with the troops which had been brought by Granger and which were to be left he would be amply prepared to dispose of Longstreet without availing himself of this offer As before stated Sherman s command had left their camps north of the Tennessee near Chattanooga with two days rations in their haversacks without coats or blankets and without many wagons expecting to return to their camps by the end of that time The weather was now cold and they were suffering but still they were ready to make the further sacrifice had it been required for the good of the cause which had brought them into service Sherman having accomplished the object for which he was sent marched back leisurely to his old camp on the Tennessee River CHAPTER XLVI OPERATIONS IN MISSISSIPPI LONGSTREET IN EAST TENNESSEE COMMISSIONED LIEUTENANT GENERAL COMMANDING THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES FIRST INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN Soon after his return from Knoxville I ordered Sherman to distribute his forces from Stevenson to Decatur and thence north to Nashville Sherman suggested that he be permitted to go back to Mississippi to the limits of his own department and where most of his army still remained for the purpose of clearing out what Confederates might still be left on the east bank of the Mississippi River to impede its navigation by our boats He expected also to have the company operation of Banks to do the same thing on the west shore Of course I approved heartily About the tenth of January Sherman was back in Memphis where Hurlbut commanded and got together his Memphis men or ordered them collected and sent to Vicksburg He then went to Vicksburg and out to where McPherson was in command and had him organize his surplus troops so as to give him about twenty thousand men in all Sherman knew that General Bishop Polk was occupying Meridian with his headquarters and had two divisions of infantry with a considerable force of cavalry scattered west of him He determined therefore to move directly upon Meridian I had sent some twenty five hundred cavalry under General Sooy Smith to Sherman s department and they had mostly arrived before Sherman got to Memphis Hurlbut had seven thousand cavalry and Sherman ordered him to reinforce Smith so as to give the latter a force of about seven thousand with which to go against Forrest who was then known to be south east from Memphis Smith was ordered to move about the first of February While Sherman was waiting at Vicksburg for the arrival of Hurlbut with his surplus men he sent out scouts to ascertain the position and strength of the enemy and to bring back all the information they could gather When these scouts returned it was through them that he got the information of General Polk s being at Meridian and of the strength and disposition of his command Forrest had about four thousand cavalry with him composed of thoroughly well disciplined men who under so able a leader were very effective Smith s command was nearly double that of Forrest but not equal man to man for the lack of a successful experience such as Forrest s men had had The fact is troops who have fought a few battles and won and followed up their victories improve upon what they were before to an extent that can hardly be counted by percentage The difference in result is often decisive victory instead of inglorious defeat This same difference too is often due to the way troops are officered and for the particular kind of warfare which Forrest had carried on neither army could present a more effective officer than he was Sherman got off on the threed of February and moved out on his expedition meeting with no opposition whatever until he crossed the Big Black and with no great deal of opposition after that until he reached Jackson Mississippi This latter place he reached on the sixth or seventh Brandon on the eighth and Morton on the ninth Up to this time he moved in two columns to enable him to get a good supply of forage et cetera and expedite the march Here however there were indications of the concentration of Confederate infantry and he was obliged to keep his army close together He had no serious engagement but he met some of the enemy who destroyed a few of his wagons about Decatur Mississippi where by the way Sherman himself came near being picked up He entered Meridian on the fourteenth of the month the enemy having retreated toward Demopolis Alabama He spent several days in Meridian in thoroughly destroying the railroad to the north and south and also for the purpose of hearing from Sooy Smith who he supposed had met Forrest before this time and he hoped had gained a decisive victory because of a superiority of numbers Hearing nothing of him however he started on his return trip to Vicksburg There he learned that Smith while waiting for a few of his men who had been ice bound in the Ohio River instead of getting off on the first as expected had not left until the eleventh Smith did meet Forrest but the result was decidedly in Forrest s favor Sherman had written a letter to Banks proposing a company operative movement with him against Shreveport subject to my approval I disapproved of Sherman s going himself because I had other important work for him to do but consented that he might send a few troops to the aid of Banks though their time to remain absent must be limited We must have them for the spring campaign The trans Mississippi movement proved abortive My eldest son who had accompanied me on the Vicksburg campaign and siege had while there contracted disease which grew worse until he had grown so dangerously ill that on the twenty fourth of January I obtained permission to go to saint Louis where he was staying at the time to see him hardly expecting to find him alive on my arrival While I was permitted to go I was not permitted to turn over my command to any one else but was directed to keep the headquarters with me and to communicate regularly with all parts of my division and with Washington just as though I had remained at Nashville When I obtained this leave I was at Chattanooga having gone there again to make preparations to have the troops of Thomas in the southern part of Tennessee company operate with Sherman s movement in Mississippi I directed Thomas and Logan who was at Scottsboro Alabama to keep up a threatening movement to the south against J E Johnston who had again relieved Bragg for the purpose of making him keep as many troops as possible there I learned through Confederate sources that Johnston had already sent two divisions in the direction of Mobile presumably to operate against Sherman and two more divisions to Longstreet in East Tennessee Seeing that Johnston had depleted in this way I directed Thomas to send at least ten thousand men besides Stanley s division which was already to the east into East Tennessee and notified Schofield who was now in command in East Tennessee of this movement of troops into his department and also of the reinforcements Longstreet had received My object was to drive Longstreet out of East Tennessee as a part of the preparations for my spring campaign About this time General Foster who had been in command of the Department of the Ohio after Burnside until Schofield relieved him twenty one advised me that he thought it would be a good thing to keep Longstreet just where he was that he was perfectly quiet in East Tennessee and if he was forced to leave there his whole well equipped army would be free to go to any place where it could effect the most for their cause I thought the advice was good and adopting that view countermanded the orders for pursuit of Longstreet On the twelfth of February I ordered Thomas to take Dalton and hold it if possible and I directed him to move without delay Finding that he had not moved on the seventeenth I urged him again to start telling him how important it was that the object of the movement was to company operate with Sherman who was moving eastward and might be in danger Then again on the twenty first he not yet having started I asked him if he could not start the next day He finally got off on the twenty twod or twenty threed The enemy fell back from his front without a battle but took a new position quite as strong and farther to the rear Thomas reported that he could not go any farther because it was impossible with his poor teams nearly starved to keep up supplies until the railroads were repaired He soon fell back Schofield also had to return for the same reason He could not carry supplies with him and Longstreet was between him and the supplies still left in the country Longstreet in his retreat would be moving towards his supplies while our forces following would be receding from theirs On the twod of March however I learned of Sherman s success which eased my mind very much The next day the threed I was ordered to Washington The bill restoring the grade of lieutenant general of the army had passed through Congress and became a law on the twenty sixth of February My nomination had been sent to the Senate on the first of March and confirmed the next day the twod I was ordered to Washington on the threed to receive my commission and started the day following that The commission was handed to me on the ninth It was delivered to me at the Executive Mansion by President Lincoln in the presence of his Cabinet my eldest son those of my staff who were with me and and a few other visitors The President in presenting my commission read from a paper stating however as a preliminary and prior to the delivery of it that he had drawn that up on paper knowing my disinclination to speak in public and handed me a copy in advance so that I might prepare a few lines of reply The President said General Grant the nation s appreciation of what you have done and its reliance upon you for what remains to be done in the existing great struggle are now presented with this commission constituting you lieutenant general in the Army of the United States With this high honor devolves upon you also a corresponding responsibility As the country herein trusts you so under God it will sustain you I scarcely need to add that with what I here speak for the nation goes my own hearty personal concurrence To this I replied mister President I accept the commission with gratitude for the high honor conferred With the aid of the noble armies that have fought in so many fields for our common country it will be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your expectations I feel the full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me and I know that if they are met it will be due to those armies and above all to the favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men On the tenth I visited the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac at Brandy Station then returned to Washington and pushed west at once to make my arrangements for turning over the commands there and giving general directions for the preparations to be made for the spring campaign It had been my intention before this to remain in the West even if I was made lieutenant general but when I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain that here was the point for the commanding general to be No one else could probably resist the pressure that would be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans and pursue others I determined therefore before I started back to have Sherman advanced to my late position McPherson to Sherman s in command of the department and Logan to the command of McPherson s corps These changes were all made on my recommendation and without hesitation My commission as lieutenant general was given to me on the ninth of March eighteen sixty four On the following day as already stated I visited General Meade commanding the Army of the Potomac at his headquarters at Brandy Station north of the Rapidan I had known General Meade slightly in the Mexican war but had not met him since until this visit I was a stranger to most of the Army of the Potomac I might say to all except the officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican war There had been some changes ordered in the organization of that army before my promotion One was the consolidation of five corps into three thus throwing some officers of rank out of important commands Meade evidently thought that I might want to make still one more change not yet ordered He said to me that I might want an officer who had served with me in the West mentioning Sherman specially to take his place If so he begged me not to hesitate about making the change He urged that the work before us was of such vast importance to the whole nation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should stand in the way of selecting the right men for all positions For himself he would serve to the best of his ability wherever placed I assured him that I had no thought of substituting any one for him As to Sherman he could not be spared from the West This incident gave me even a more favorable opinion of Meade than did his great victory at Gettysburg the July before It is men who wait to be selected and not those who seek from whom we may always expect the most efficient service Meade s position afterwards proved embarrassing to me if not to him He was commanding an army and for nearly a year previous to my taking command of all the armies was in supreme command of the Army of the Potomac except from the authorities at Washington All other general officers occupying similar positions were independent in their commands so far as any one present with them was concerned I tried to make General Meade s position as nearly as possible what it would have been if I had been in Washington or any other place away from his command I therefore gave all orders for the movements of the Army of the Potomac to Meade to have them executed To avoid the necessity of having to give orders direct I established my headquarters near his unless there were reasons for locating them elsewhere This sometimes happened and I had on occasions to give orders direct to the troops affected On the eleventh I returned to Washington and on the day after orders were published by the War Department placing me in command of all the armies I had left Washington the night before to return to my old command in the West and to meet Sherman whom I had telegraphed to join me in Nashville Sherman assumed command of the military division of the Mississippi on the eighteenth of March and we left Nashville together for Cincinnati I had Sherman accompany me that far on my way back to Washington so that we could talk over the matters about which I wanted to see him without losing any more time from my new command than was necessary The first point which I wished to discuss was particularly about the company operation of his command with mine when the spring campaign should commence There were also other and minor points minor as compared with the great importance of the question to be decided by sanguinary war the restoration to duty of officers who had been relieved from important commands namely McClellan Burnside and Fremont in the East and Buell McCook Negley and Crittenden in the West Some time in the winter of eighteen sixty three sixty four I had been invited by the general in chief to give my views of the campaign I thought advisable for the command under me now Sherman s General J E Johnston was defending Atlanta and the interior of Georgia with an army the largest part of which was stationed at Dalton about thirty eight miles south of Chattanooga Dalton is at the junction of the railroad from Cleveland with the one from Chattanooga to Atlanta There could have been no difference of opinion as to the first duty of the armies of the military division of the Mississippi Johnston s army was the first objective and that important railroad centre Atlanta the second At the time I wrote General Halleck giving my views of the approaching campaign and at the time I met General Sherman it was expected that General Banks would be through with the campaign which he had been ordered upon before my appointment to the command of all the armies and would be ready to company operate with the armies east of the Mississippi his part in the programme being to move upon Mobile by land while the navy would close the harbor and assist to the best of its ability twenty two The plan therefore was for Sherman to attack Johnston and destroy his army if possible to capture Atlanta and hold it and with his troops and those of Banks to hold a line through to Mobile or at least to hold Atlanta and command the railroad running east and west and the troops from one or other of the armies to hold important points on the southern road the only east and west road that would be left in the possession of the enemy This would cut the Confederacy in two again as our gaining possession of the Mississippi River had done before Banks was not ready in time for the part assigned to him and circumstances that could not be foreseen determined the campaign which was afterwards made the success and grandeur of which has resounded throughout all lands In regard to restoring officers who had been relieved from important commands to duty again I left Sherman to look after those who had been removed in the West while I looked out for the rest I directed however that he should make no assignment until I could speak to the Secretary of War about the matter I shortly after recommended to the Secretary the assignment of General Buell to duty I received the assurance that duty would be offered to him and afterwards the Secretary told me that he had offered Buell an assignment and that the latter had declined it saying that it would be degradation to accept the assignment offered I understood afterwards that he refused to serve under either Sherman or Canby because he had ranked them both Both graduated before him and ranked him in the old army Sherman ranked him as a brigadier general All of them ranked me in the old army and Sherman and Buell did as brigadiers The worst excuse a soldier can make for declining service is that he once ranked the commander he is ordered to report to On the twenty threed of March I was back in Washington and on the twenty sixth took up my headquarters at Culpeper Court House a few miles south of the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac Although hailing from Illinois myself the State of the President I never met mister Lincoln until called to the capital to receive my commission as lieutenant general I knew him however very well and favorably from the accounts given by officers under me at the West who had known him all their lives I had also read the remarkable series of debates between Lincoln and Douglas a few years before when they were rival candidates for the United States Senate I was then a resident of Missouri and by no means a Lincoln man in that contest but I recognized then his great ability In my first interview with mister Lincoln alone he stated to me that he had never professed to be a military man or to know how campaigns should be conducted and never wanted to interfere in them but that procrastination on the part of commanders and the pressure from the people at the North and Congress WHICH WAS ALWAYS WITH HIM forced him into issuing his series of Military Orders one two three et cetera He did not know but they were all wrong and did know that some of them were All he wanted or had ever wanted was some one who would take the responsibility and act and call on him for all the assistance needed pledging himself to use all the power of the government in rendering such assistance Assuring him that I would do the best I could with the means at hand and avoid as far as possible annoying him or the War Department our first interview ended The Secretary of War I had met once before only but felt that I knew him better While commanding in West Tennessee we had occasionally held conversations over the wires at night when they were not being otherwise used He and General Halleck both cautioned me against giving the President my plans of campaign saying that he was so kind hearted so averse to refusing anything asked of him that some friend would be sure to get from him all he knew I should have said that in our interview the President told me he did not want to know what I proposed to do But he submitted a plan of campaign of his own which he wanted me to hear and then do as I pleased about He brought out a map of Virginia on which he had evidently marked every position occupied by the Federal and Confederate armies up to that time He pointed out on the map two streams which empty into the Potomac and suggested that the army might be moved on boats and landed between the mouths of these streams We would then have the Potomac to bring our supplies and the tributaries would protect our flanks while we moved out I listened respectfully but did not suggest that the same streams would protect Lee s flanks while he was shutting us up I did not communicate my plans to the President nor did I to the Secretary of War or to General Halleck March the twenty sixth my headquarters were as stated at Culpeper and the work of preparing for an early campaign commenced CHAPTER XLVII THE MILITARY SITUATION PLANS FOR THE CAMPAIGN SHERIDAN ASSIGNED TO COMMAND OF THE CAVALRY FLANK MOVEMENTS FORREST AT FORT PILLOW GENERAL BANKS S EXPEDITION COLONEL MOSBY AN INCIDENT OF THE WILDERNESS CAMPAIGN When I assumed command of all the armies the situation was about this the Mississippi River was guarded from saint Louis to its mouth the line of the Arkansas was held thus giving us all the North west north of that river A few points in Louisiana not remote from the river were held by the Federal troops as was also the mouth of the Rio Grande East of the Mississippi we held substantially all north of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad as far east as Chattanooga thence along the line of the Tennessee and Holston rivers taking in nearly all of the State of Tennessee West Virginia was in our hands and that part of old Virginia north of the Rapidan and east of the Blue Ridge we also held On the sea coast we had Fortress Monroe and Norfolk in Virginia Plymouth Washington and New Berne in North Carolina Beaufort Folly and Morris islands Hilton Head Port Royal and Fort Pulaski in South Carolina and Georgia Fernandina saint Augustine Key West and Pensacola in Florida The balance of the Southern territory an empire in extent was still in the hands of the enemy Sherman who had succeeded me in the command of the military division of the Mississippi commanded all the troops in the territory west of the Alleghanies and north of Natchez with a large movable force about Chattanooga His command was subdivided into four departments but the commanders all reported to Sherman and were subject to his orders This arrangement however insured the better protection of all lines of communication through the acquired territory for the reason that these different department commanders could act promptly in case of a sudden or unexpected raid within their respective jurisdictions without awaiting the orders of the division commander In the East the opposing forces stood in substantially the same relations towards each other as three years before or when the war began they were both between the Federal and Confederate capitals It is true footholds had been secured by us on the sea coast in Virginia and North Carolina but beyond that no substantial advantage had been gained by either side Battles had been fought of as great severity as had ever been known in war over ground from the James River and Chickahominy near Richmond to Gettysburg and Chambersburg in Pennsylvania with indecisive results sometimes favorable to the National army sometimes to the Confederate army but in every instance I believe claimed as victories for the South by the Southern press if not by the Southern generals The Northern press as a whole did not discourage these claims a portion of it always magnified rebel success and belittled ours while another portion most sincerely earnest in their desire for the preservation of the Union and the overwhelming success of the Federal armies would nevertheless generally express dissatisfaction with whatever victories were gained because they were not more complete That portion of the Army of the Potomac not engaged in guarding lines of communication was on the northern bank of the Rapidan The Army of Northern Virginia confronting it on the opposite bank of the same river was strongly intrenched and commanded by the acknowledged ablest general in the Confederate army The country back to the James River is cut up with many streams generally narrow deep and difficult to cross except where bridged The region is heavily timbered and the roads narrow and very bad after the least rain Such an enemy was not of course unprepared with adequate fortifications at convenient intervals all the way back to Richmond so that when driven from one fortified position they would always have another farther to the rear to fall back into To provision an army campaigning against so formidable a foe through such a country from wagons alone seemed almost impossible System and discipline were both essential to its accomplishment The Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments though four of them in the West had been concentrated into a single military division The Army of the Potomac was a separate command and had no territorial limits There were thus seventeen distinct commanders Before this time these various armies had acted separately and independently of each other giving the enemy an opportunity often of depleting one command not pressed to reinforce another more actively engaged I determined to stop this To this end I regarded the Army of the Potomac as the centre and all west to Memphis along the line described as our position at the time and north of it the right wing the Army of the James under General Butler as the left wing and all the troops south as a force in rear of the enemy Some of these latter were occupying positions from which they could not render service proportionate to their numerical strength All such were depleted to the minimum necessary to hold their positions as a guard against blockade runners where they could not do this their positions were abandoned altogether In this way ten thousand men were added to the Army of the James from South Carolina alone with General Gillmore in command It was not contemplated that General Gillmore should leave his department but as most of his troops were taken presumably for active service he asked to accompany them and was permitted to do so Officers and soldiers on furlough of whom there were many thousands were ordered to their proper commands concentration was the order of the day and to have it accomplished in time to advance at the earliest moment the roads would permit was the problem As a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac or to act in support of it the ninth army corps over twenty thousand strong under General Burnside had been rendezvoused at Annapolis Maryland This was an admirable position for such a reinforcement The corps could be brought at the last moment as a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac or it could be thrown on the sea coast south of Norfolk in Virginia or North Carolina to operate against Richmond from that direction In fact Burnside and the War Department both thought the ninth corps was intended for such an expedition up to the last moment My general plan now was to concentrate all the force possible against the Confederate armies in the field There were but two such as we have seen east of the Mississippi River and facing north The Army of Northern Virginia General Robert E Lee commanding was on the south bank of the Rapidan confronting the Army of the Potomac the second under General Joseph E Johnston was at Dalton Georgia opposed to Sherman who was still at Chattanooga Beside these main armies the Confederates had to guard the Shenandoah Valley a great storehouse to feed their armies from and their line of communications from Richmond to Tennessee Forrest a brave and intrepid cavalry general was in the West with a large force making a larger command necessary to hold what we had gained in Middle and West Tennessee We could not abandon any territory north of the line held by the enemy because it would lay the Northern States open to invasion But as the Army of the Potomac was the principal garrison for the protection of Washington even while it was moving on Lee so all the forces to the west and the Army of the James guarded their special trusts when advancing from them as well as when remaining at them Better indeed for they forced the enemy to guard his own lines and resources at a greater distance from ours and with a greater force Little expeditions could not so well be sent out to destroy a bridge or tear up a few miles of railroad track burn a storehouse or inflict other little annoyances Accordingly I arranged for a simultaneous movement all along the line Sherman was to move from Chattanooga Johnston s army and Atlanta being his objective points twenty three Crook commanding in West Virginia was to move from the mouth of the Gauley River with a cavalry force and some artillery the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to be his objective Either the enemy would have to keep a large force to protect their communications or see them destroyed and a large amount of forage and provision which they so much needed fall into our hands Sigel was in command in the Valley of Virginia He was to advance up the valley covering the North from an invasion through that channel as well while advancing as by remaining near Harper s Ferry Every mile he advanced also gave us possession of stores on which Lee relied Butler was to advance by the James River having Richmond and Petersburg as his objective Before the advance commenced I visited Butler at Fort Monroe This was the first time I had ever met him Before giving him any order as to the part he was to play in the approaching campaign I invited his views They were very much such as I intended to direct and as I did direct twenty four in writing before leaving General W F Smith who had been promoted to the rank of major general shortly after the battle of Chattanooga on my recommendation had not yet been confirmed I found a decided prejudice against his confirmation by a majority of the Senate but I insisted that his services had been such that he should be rewarded My wishes were now reluctantly complied with and I assigned him to the command of one of the corps under General Butler I was not long in finding out that the objections to Smith s promotion were well founded In one of my early interviews with the President I expressed my dissatisfaction with the little that had been accomplished by the cavalry so far in the war and the belief that it was capable of accomplishing much more than it had done if under a thorough leader I said I wanted the very best man in the army for that command Halleck was present and spoke up saying How would Sheridan do I replied The very man I want The President said I could have anybody I wanted Sheridan was telegraphed for that day and on his arrival was assigned to the command of the cavalry corps with the Army of the Potomac This relieved General Alfred Pleasonton It was not a reflection on that officer however for I did not know but that he had been as efficient as any other cavalry commander Banks in the Department of the Gulf was ordered to assemble all the troops he had at New Orleans in time to join in the general move Mobile to be his objective At this time I was not entirely decided as to whether I should move the Army of the Potomac by the right flank of the enemy or by his left Each plan presented advantages twenty five If by his right my left the Potomac Chesapeake Bay and tributaries would furnish us an easy hauling distance of every position the army could occupy from the Rapidan to the James River But Lee could if he chose detach or move his whole army north on a line rather interior to the one I would have to take in following A movement by his left our right would obviate this but all that was done would have to be done with the supplies and ammunition we started with All idea of adopting this latter plan was abandoned when the limited quantity of supplies possible to take with us was considered The country over which we would have to pass was so exhausted of all food or forage that we would be obliged to carry everything with us While these preparations were going on the enemy was not entirely idle In the West Forrest made a raid in West Tennessee up to the northern border capturing the garrison of four or five hundred men at Union City and followed it up by an attack on Paducah Kentucky on the banks of the Ohio While he was able to enter the city he failed to capture the forts or any part of the garrison On the first intelligence of Forrest s raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against him and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself into Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him before he got my order Forrest however fell back rapidly and attacked the troops at Fort Pillow a station for the protection of the navigation of the Mississippi River The garrison consisted of a regiment of colored troops infantry and a detachment of Tennessee cavalry These troops fought bravely but were overpowered I will leave Forrest in his dispatches to tell what he did with them The river was dyed he says with the blood of the slaughtered for two hundred yards The approximate loss was upward of five hundred killed but few of the officers escaping My loss was about twenty killed It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northern people that negro soldiers cannot cope with Southerners Subsequently Forrest made a report in which he left out the part which shocks humanity to read At the East also the rebels were busy I had said to Halleck that Plymouth and Washington North Carolina were unnecessary to hold It would be better to have the garrisons engaged there added to Butler s command If success attended our arms both places and others too would fall into our hands naturally These places had been occupied by Federal troops before I took command of the armies and I knew that the Executive would be reluctant to abandon them and therefore explained my views but before my views were carried out the rebels captured the garrison at Plymouth I then ordered the abandonment of Washington but directed the holding of New Berne at all hazards This was essential because New Berne was a port into which blockade runners could enter General Banks had gone on an expedition up the Red River long before my promotion to general command I had opposed the movement strenuously but acquiesced because it was the order of my superior at the time By direction of Halleck I had reinforced Banks with a corps of about ten thousand men from Sherman s command This reinforcement was wanted back badly before the forward movement commenced But Banks had got so far that it seemed best that he should take Shreveport on the Red River and turn over the line of that river to Steele who commanded in Arkansas to hold instead of the line of the Arkansas Orders were given accordingly and with the expectation that the campaign would be ended in time for Banks to return A J Smith s command to where it belonged and get back to New Orleans himself in time to execute his part in the general plan But the expedition was a failure Banks did not get back in time to take part in the programme as laid down Nor was Smith returned until long after the movements of May eighteen sixty four had been begun The services of forty thousand veteran troops over and above the number required to hold all that was necessary in the Department of the Gulf were thus paralyzed It is but just to Banks however to say that his expedition was ordered from Washington and he was in no way responsible except for the conduct of it I make no criticism on this point He opposed the expedition By the twenty seventh of April spring had so far advanced as to justify me in fixing a day for the great move On that day Burnside left Annapolis to occupy Meade s position between Bull Run and the Rappahannock Meade was notified and directed to bring his troops forward to his advance On the following day Butler was notified of my intended advance on the fourth of May and he was directed to move the night of the same day and get as far up the James River as possible by daylight and push on from there to accomplish the task given him He was also notified that reinforcements were being collected in Washington City which would be forwarded to him should the enemy fall back into the trenches at Richmond The same day Sherman was directed to get his forces up ready to advance on the fifth Sigel was in Winchester and was notified to move in conjunction with the others The criticism has been made by writers on the campaign from the Rapidan to the James River that all the loss of life could have been obviated by moving the army there on transports Richmond was fortified and intrenched so perfectly that one man inside to defend was more than equal to five outside besieging or assaulting To get possession of Lee s army was the first great object With the capture of his army Richmond would necessarily follow It was better to fight him outside of his stronghold than in it If the Army of the Potomac had been moved bodily to the James River by water Lee could have moved a part of his forces back to Richmond called Beauregard from the south to reinforce it and with the balance moved on to Washington Then too I ordered a move simultaneous with that of the Army of the Potomac up the James River by a formidable army already collected at the mouth of the river While my headquarters were at Culpeper from the twenty sixth of March to the fourth of May I generally visited Washington once a week to confer with the Secretary of War and President On the last occasion a few days before moving a circumstance occurred which came near postponing my part in the campaign altogether Colonel John S Mosby had for a long time been commanding a partisan corps or regiment which operated in the rear of the Army of the Potomac On my return to the field on this occasion as the train approached Warrenton Junction a heavy cloud of dust was seen to the east of the road as if made by a body of cavalry on a charge Arriving at the junction the train was stopped and inquiries made as to the cause of the dust There was but one man at the station and he informed us that Mosby had crossed a few minutes before at full speed in pursuit of Federal cavalry Had he seen our train coming no doubt he would have let his prisoners escape to capture the train I was on a special train if I remember correctly without any guard Since the close of the war I have come to know Colonel Mosby personally and somewhat intimately He is a different man entirely from what I had supposed He is slender not tall wiry and looks as if he could endure any amount of physical exercise He is able and thoroughly honest and truthful There were probably but few men in the South who could have commanded successfully a separate detachment in the rear of an opposing army and so near the border of hostilities as long as he did without losing his entire command On this same visit to Washington I had my last interview with the President before reaching the James River He had of course become acquainted with the fact that a general movement had been ordered all along the line and seemed to think it a new feature in war I explained to him that it was necessary to have a great number of troops to guard and hold the territory we had captured and to prevent incursions into the Northern States These troops could perform this service just as well by advancing as by remaining still and by advancing they would compel the enemy to keep detachments to hold them back or else lay his own territory open to invasion His answer was Oh yes I see that As we say out West if a man can t skin he must hold a leg while somebody else does There was a certain incident connected with the Wilderness campaign of which it may not be out of place to speak and to avoid a digression further on I will mention it here A few days before my departure from Culpeper the Honorable E B Washburne visited me there and remained with my headquarters for some distance south through the battle in the Wilderness and I think to Spottsylvania He was accompanied by a mister Swinton whom he presented as a literary gentleman who wished to accompany the army with a view of writing a history of the war when it was over He assured me and I have no doubt Swinton gave him the assurance that he was not present as a correspondent of the press I expressed an entire willingness to have him Swinton accompany the army and would have allowed him to do so as a correspondent restricted however in the character of the information he could give We received Richmond papers with about as much regularity as if there had been no war and knew that our papers were received with equal regularity by the Confederates It was desirable therefore that correspondents should not be privileged spies of the enemy within our lines Probably mister Swinton expected to be an invited guest at my headquarters and was disappointed that he was not asked to become so At all events he was not invited and soon I found that he was corresponding with some paper I have now forgotten which one thus violating his word either expressed or implied He knew of the assurance Washburne had given as to the character of his mission I never saw the man from the day of our introduction to the present that I recollect He accompanied us however for a time at least The second night after crossing the Rapidan the night of the fifth of May Colonel W R Rowley of my staff was acting as night officer at my headquarters A short time before midnight I gave him verbal instructions for the night Three days later I read in a Richmond paper a verbatim report of these instructions A few nights still later after the first and possibly after the second day s fighting in the Wilderness General Meade came to my tent for consultation bringing with him some of his staff officers Both his staff and mine retired to the camp fire some yards in front of the tent thinking our conversation should be private There was a stump a little to one side and between the front of the tent and camp fire One of my staff Colonel T S Bowers saw what he took to be a man seated on the ground and leaning against the stump listening to the conversation between Meade and myself He called the attention of Colonel Rowley to it The latter immediately took the man by the shoulder and asked him in language more forcible than polite what he was doing there The man proved to be Swinton the historian and his replies to the question were evasive and unsatisfactory and he was warned against further eaves dropping The next I heard of mister Swinton was at Cold Harbor General Meade came to my headquarters saying that General Burnside had arrested Swinton who at some previous time had given great offence and had ordered him to be shot that afternoon I promptly ordered the prisoner to be released but that he must be expelled from the lines of the army not to return again on pain of punishment CHAPTER XLVIII COMMENCEMENT OF THE GRAND CAMPAIGN GENERAL BUTLER S POSITION SHERIDAN S FIRST RAID The armies were now all ready to move for the accomplishment of a single object They were acting as a unit so far as such a thing was possible over such a vast field Lee with the capital of the Confederacy was the main end to which all were working Johnston with Atlanta was an important obstacle in the way of our accomplishing the result aimed at and was therefore almost an independent objective It was of less importance only because the capture of Johnston and his army would not produce so immediate and decisive a result in closing the rebellion as would the possession of Richmond Lee and his army All other troops were employed exclusively in support of these two movements This was the plan and I will now endeavor to give as concisely as I can the method of its execution outlining first the operations of minor detached but company operative columns As stated before Banks failed to accomplish what he had been sent to do on the Red River and eliminated the use of forty thousand veterans whose cooperation in the grand campaign had been expected ten thousand with Sherman and thirty thousand against Mobile Sigel s record is almost equally brief He moved out it is true according to programme but just when I was hoping to hear of good work being done in the valley I received instead the following announcement from Halleck Sigel is in full retreat on Strasburg He will do nothing but run never did anything else The enemy had intercepted him about New Market and handled him roughly leaving him short six guns and some nine hundred men out of his six thousand The plan had been for an advance of Sigel s forces in two columns Though the one under his immediate command failed ingloriously the other proved more fortunate Under Crook and Averell his western column advanced from the Gauley in West Virginia at the appointed time and with more happy results They reached the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at Dublin and destroyed a depot of supplies besides tearing up several miles of road and burning the bridge over New River Having accomplished this they recrossed the Alleghanies to Meadow Bluffs and there awaited further orders Butler embarked at Fort Monroe with all his command except the cavalry and some artillery which moved up the south bank of the James River His steamers moved first up Chesapeake Bay and York River as if threatening the rear of Lee s army At midnight they turned back and Butler by daylight was far up the James River He seized City Point and Bermuda Hundred early in the day without loss and no doubt very much to the surprise of the enemy This was the accomplishment of the first step contemplated in my instructions to Butler He was to act from here looking to Richmond as his objective point I had given him to understand that I should aim to fight Lee between the Rapidan and Richmond if he would stand but should Lee fall back into Richmond I would follow up and make a junction of the armies of the Potomac and the James on the James River He was directed to secure a footing as far up the south side of the river as he could at as early a date as possible Butler was in position by the sixth of May and had begun intrenching and on the seventh he sent out his cavalry from Suffolk to cut the Weldon Railroad He also sent out detachments to destroy the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond but no great success attended these latter efforts He made no great effort to establish himself on that road and neglected to attack Petersburg which was almost defenceless About the eleventh he advanced slowly until he reached the works at Drury s Bluff about half way between Bermuda Hundred and Richmond In the mean time Beauregard had been gathering reinforcements On the sixteenth he attacked Butler with great vigor and with such success as to limit very materially the further usefulness of the Army of the James as a distinct factor in the campaign I afterward ordered a portion of it to join the Army of the Potomac leaving a sufficient force with Butler to man his works hold securely the footing he had already gained and maintain a threatening front toward the rear of the Confederate capital The position which General Butler had chosen between the two rivers the James and Appomattox was one of great natural strength one where a large area of ground might be thoroughly inclosed by means of a single intrenched line and that a very short one in comparison with the extent of territory which it thoroughly protected His right was protected by the James River his left by the Appomattox and his rear by their junction the two streams uniting near by The bends of the two streams shortened the line that had been chosen for intrenchments while it increased the area which the line inclosed Previous to ordering any troops from Butler I sent my chief engineer General Barnard from the Army of the Potomac to that of the James to inspect Butler s position and ascertain whether I could again safely make an order for General Butler s movement in company operation with mine now that I was getting so near Richmond or if I could not whether his position was strong enough to justify me in withdrawing some of his troops and having them brought round by water to White House to join me and reinforce the Army of the Potomac General Barnard reported the position very strong for defensive purposes and that I could do the latter with great security but that General Butler could not move from where he was in company operation to produce any effect He said that the general occupied a place between the James and Appomattox rivers which was of great strength and where with an inferior force he could hold it for an indefinite length of time against a superior but that he could do nothing offensively I then asked him why Butler could not move out from his lines and push across the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to the rear and on the south side of Richmond He replied that it was impracticable because the enemy had substantially the same line across the neck of land that General Butler had He then took out his pencil and drew a sketch of the locality remarking that the position was like a bottle and that Butler s line of intrenchments across the neck represented the cork that the enemy had built an equally strong line immediately in front of him across the neck and it was therefore as if Butler was in a bottle He was perfectly safe against an attack but as Barnard expressed it the enemy had corked the bottle and with a small force could hold the cork in its place This struck me as being very expressive of his position particularly when I saw the hasty sketch which General Barnard had drawn and in making my subsequent report I used that expression without adding quotation marks never thinking that anything had been said that would attract attention as this did very much to the annoyance no doubt of General Butler and I know very much to my own I found afterwards that this was mentioned in the notes of General Badeau s book which when they were shown to me I asked to have stricken out yet it was retained there though against my wishes I make this statement here because although I have often made it before it has never been in my power until now to place it where it will correct history and I desire to rectify all injustice that I may have done to individuals particularly to officers who were gallantly serving their country during the trying period of the war for the preservation of the Union General Butler certainly gave his very earnest support to the war and he gave his own best efforts personally to the suppression of the rebellion The further operations of the Army of the James can best be treated of in connection with those of the Army of the Potomac the two being so intimately associated and connected as to be substantially one body in which the individuality of the supporting wing is merged Before giving the reader a summary of Sherman s great Atlanta campaign which must conclude my description of the various company operative movements preparatory to proceeding with that of the operations of the centre I will briefly mention Sheridan s first raid upon Lee s communications which though an incident of the operations on the main line and not specifically marked out in the original plan attained in its brilliant execution and results all the proportions of an independent campaign By thus anticipating in point of time I will be able to more perfectly observe the continuity of events occurring in my immediate front when I shall have undertaken to describe our advance from the Rapidan On the eighth of May just after the battle of the Wilderness and when we were moving on Spottsylvania I directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac pass around the left of Lee s army and attack his cavalry to cut the two roads one running west through Gordonsville Charlottesville and Lynchburg the other to Richmond and when compelled to do so for want of forage and rations to move on to the James River and draw these from Butler s supplies This move took him past the entire rear of Lee s army These orders were also given in writing through Meade The object of this move was three fold First if successfully executed and it was he would annoy the enemy by cutting his line of supplies and telegraphic communications and destroy or get for his own use supplies in store in the rear and coming up Second he would draw the enemy s cavalry after him and thus better protect our flanks rear and trains than by remaining with the army Third his absence would save the trains drawing his forage and other supplies from Fredericksburg which had now become our base He started at daylight the next morning and accomplished more than was expected It was sixteen days before he got back to the Army of the Potomac The course Sheridan took was directly to Richmond Before night Stuart commanding the Confederate cavalry came on to the rear of his command But the advance kept on crossed the North Anna and at Beaver Dam a station on the Virginia Central Railroad recaptured four hundred Union prisoners on their way to Richmond destroyed the road and used and destroyed a large amount of subsistence and medical stores Stuart seeing that our cavalry was pushing towards Richmond abandoned the pursuit on the morning of the tenth and by a detour and an exhausting march interposed between Sheridan and Richmond at Yellow Tavern only about six miles north of the city Sheridan destroyed the railroad and more supplies at Ashland and on the eleventh arrived in Stuart s front A severe engagement ensued in which the losses were heavy on both sides but the rebels were beaten their leader mortally wounded and some guns and many prisoners were captured Sheridan passed through the outer defences of Richmond and could no doubt have passed through the inner ones But having no supports near he could not have remained After caring for his wounded he struck for the James River below the city to communicate with Butler and to rest his men and horses as well as to get food and forage for them He moved first between the Chickahominy and the James but in the morning the twelfth he was stopped by batteries at Mechanicsville He then turned to cross to the north side of the Chickahominy by Meadow Bridge He found this barred and the defeated Confederate cavalry reorganized occupying the opposite side The panic created by his first entrance within the outer works of Richmond having subsided troops were sent out to attack his rear He was now in a perilous position one from which but few generals could have extricated themselves The defences of Richmond manned were to the right the Chickahominy was to the left with no bridge remaining and the opposite bank guarded to the rear was a force from Richmond This force was attacked and beaten by Wilson s and Gregg s divisions while Sheridan turned to the left with the remaining division and hastily built a bridge over the Chickahominy under the fire of the enemy forced a crossing and soon dispersed the Confederates he found there The enemy was held back from the stream by the fire of the troops not engaged in bridge building On the thirteenth Sheridan was at Bottom s Bridge over the Chickahominy On the fourteenth he crossed this stream and on that day went into camp on the James River at Haxall s Landing He at once put himself into communication with General Butler who directed all the supplies he wanted to be furnished Sheridan had left the Army of the Potomac at Spottsylvania but did not know where either this or Lee s army was now Great caution therefore had to be exercised in getting back On the seventeenth after resting his command for three days he started on his return He moved by the way of White House The bridge over the Pamunkey had been burned by the enemy but a new one was speedily improvised and the cavalry crossed over it On the twenty twod he was at Aylett s on the Matapony where he learned the position of the two armies On the twenty fourth he joined us on the march from North Anna to Cold Harbor in the vicinity of Chesterfield Sheridan in this memorable raid passed entirely around Lee s army encountered his cavalry in four engagements and defeated them in all recaptured four hundred Union prisoners and killed and captured many of the enemy destroyed and used many supplies and munitions of war destroyed miles of railroad and telegraph and freed us from annoyance by the cavalry of the enemy for more than two weeks CHAPTER XLIX SHERMAN S CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA SIEGE OF ATLANTA DEATH OF GENERAL MCPHERSON ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ANDERSONVILLE CAPTURE OF ATLANTA After separating from Sherman in Cincinnati I went on to Washington as already stated while he returned to Nashville to assume the duties of his new command His military division was now composed of four departments and embraced all the territory west of the Alleghany Mountains and east of the Mississippi River together with the State of Arkansas in the trans Mississippi The most easterly of these was the Department of the Ohio General Schofield commanding the next was the Department of the Cumberland General Thomas commanding the third the Department of the Tennessee General McPherson commanding and General Steele still commanded the trans Mississippi or Department of Arkansas The last named department was so far away that Sherman could not communicate with it very readily after starting on his spring campaign and it was therefore soon transferred from his military division to that of the Gulf where General Canby who had relieved General Banks was in command The movements of the armies as I have stated in a former chapter were to be simultaneous I fixing the day to start when the season should be far enough advanced it was hoped for the roads to be in a condition for the troops to march General Sherman at once set himself to work preparing for the task which was assigned him to accomplish in the spring campaign McPherson lay at Huntsville with about twenty four thousand men guarding those points of Tennessee which were regarded as most worth holding Thomas with over sixty thousand men of the Army of the Cumberland was at Chattanooga and Schofield with about fourteen thousand men was at Knoxville With these three armies numbering about one hundred thousand men in all Sherman was to move on the day fixed for the general advance with a view of destroying Johnston s army and capturing Atlanta He visited each of these commands to inform himself as to their condition and it was found to be speaking generally good One of the first matters to turn his attention to was that of getting before the time arrived for starting an accumulation of supplies forward to Chattanooga sufficiently large to warrant a movement He found when he got to that place that the trains over the single track railroad which was frequently interrupted for a day or two at a time were only sufficient to meet the daily wants of the troops without bringing forward any surplus of any kind He found however that trains were being used to transport all the beef cattle horses for the cavalry and even teams that were being brought to the front He at once changed all this and required beef cattle teams cavalry horses and everything that could travel even the troops to be marched and used the road exclusively for transporting supplies In this way he was able to accumulate an abundance before the time finally fixed upon for the move the fourth of May As I have said already Johnston was at Dalton which was nearly one fourth of the way between Chattanooga and Atlanta The country is mountainous all the way to Atlanta abounding in mountain streams some of them of considerable volume Dalton is on ground where water drains towards Atlanta and into one of the main streams rising north east from there and flowing south west this being the general direction which all the main streams of that section take with smaller tributaries entering into them Johnston had been preparing himself for this campaign during the entire winter The best positions for defence had been selected all the way from Dalton back to Atlanta and very strongly intrenched so that as he might be forced to fall back from one position he would have another to fall into in his rear His position at Dalton was so very strongly intrenched that no doubt he expected or at least hoped to hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any further With a less skilful general and one disposed to take no risks I have no doubt that he would have succeeded Sherman s plan was to start Schofield who was farthest back a few days in advance from Knoxville having him move on the direct road to Dalton Thomas was to move out to Ringgold It had been Sherman s intention to cross McPherson over the Tennessee River at Huntsville or Decatur and move him south from there so as to have him come into the road running from Chattanooga to Atlanta a good distance to the rear of the point Johnston was occupying but when that was contemplated it was hoped that McPherson alone would have troops enough to cope with Johnston if the latter should move against him while unsupported by the balance of the army In this he was disappointed Two of McPherson s veteran divisions had re enlisted on the express provision that they were to have a furlough This furlough had not yet expired and they were not back Then again Sherman had lent Banks two divisions under A J Smith the winter before to company operate with the trans Mississippi forces and this with the express pledge that they should be back by a time specified so as to be prepared for this very campaign It is hardly necessary to say they were not returned That department continued to absorb troops to no purpose to the end of the war This left McPherson so weak that the part of the plan above indicated had to be changed He was therefore brought up to Chattanooga and moved from there on a road to the right of Thomas the two coming together about Dalton The three armies were abreast all ready to start promptly on time Sherman soon found that Dalton was so strongly fortified that it was useless to make any attempt to carry it by assault and even to carry it by regular approaches was impracticable There was a narrowing up in the mountain between the National and Confederate armies through which a stream a wagon road and a railroad ran Besides the stream had been dammed so that the valley was a lake Through this gorge the troops would have to pass McPherson was therefore sent around by the right to come out by the way of Snake Creek Gap into the rear of the enemy This was a surprise to Johnston and about the thirteenth he decided to abandon his position at Dalton On the fifteenth there was very hard fighting about Resaca but our cavalry having been sent around to the right got near the road in the enemy s rear Again Johnston fell back our army pursuing The pursuit was continued to Kingston which was reached on the nineteenth with very little fighting except that Newton s division overtook the rear of Johnston s army and engaged it Sherman was now obliged to halt for the purpose of bringing up his railroad trains He was depending upon the railroad for all of his supplies and as of course the railroad was wholly destroyed as Johnston fell back it had to be rebuilt This work was pushed forward night and day and caused much less delay than most persons would naturally expect in a mountainous country where there were so many bridges to be rebuilt The campaign to Atlanta was managed with the most consummate skill the enemy being flanked out of one position after another all the way there It is true this was not accomplished without a good deal of fighting some of it very hard fighting rising to the dignity of very important battles neither were single positions gained in a day On the contrary weeks were spent at some and about Atlanta more than a month was consumed It was the twenty threed of May before the road was finished up to the rear of Sherman s army and the pursuit renewed This pursuit brought him up to the vicinity of Allatoona This place was very strongly intrenched and naturally a very defensible position An assault upon it was not thought of but preparations were made to flank the enemy out of it This was done by sending a large force around our right by the way of Dallas to reach the rear of the enemy Before reaching there however they found the enemy fortified in their way and there resulted hard fighting for about a week at a place called New Hope Church On the left our troops also were fortified and as close up to the enemy as they could get They kept working still farther around to the left toward the railroad This was the case more particularly with the cavalry By the fourth of June Johnston found that he was being hemmed in so rapidly that he drew off and Allatoona was left in our possession Allatoona being an important place was strongly intrenched for occupation by our troops before advancing farther and made a secondary base of supplies The railroad was finished up to that point the intrenchments completed storehouses provided for food and the army got in readiness for a further advance The rains however were falling in such torrents that it was impossible to move the army by the side roads which they would have to move upon in order to turn Johnston out of his new position While Sherman s army lay here General F P Blair returned to it bringing with him the two divisions of veterans who had been on furlough Johnston had fallen back to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain where strong intrenchments awaited him At this latter place our troops made an assault upon the enemy s lines after having got their own lines up close to him and failed sustaining considerable loss But during the progress of the battle Schofield was gaining ground to the left and the cavalry on his left were gaining still more toward the enemy s rear These operations were completed by the threed of July when it was found that Johnston had evacuated the place He was pursued at once Sherman had made every preparation to abandon the railroad leaving a strong guard in his intrenchments He had intended moving out with twenty days rations and plenty of ammunition to come in on the railroad again at the Chattahoochee River Johnston frustrated this plan by himself starting back as above stated This time he fell back to the Chattahoochee About the fifth of July he was besieged again Sherman getting easy possession of the Chattahoochee River both above and below him The enemy was again flanked out of his position or so frightened by flanking movements that on the night of the ninth he fell back across the river Here Johnston made a stand until the seventeenth when Sherman s old tactics prevailed again and the final movement toward Atlanta began Johnston was now relieved of the command and Hood superseded him Johnston s tactics in this campaign do not seem to have met with much favor either in the eyes of the administration at Richmond or of the people of that section of the South in which he was commanding The very fact of a change of commanders being ordered under such circumstances was an indication of a change of policy and that now they would become the aggressors the very thing our troops wanted For my own part I think that Johnston s tactics were right Anything that could have prolonged the war a year beyond the time that it did finally close would probably have exhausted the North to such an extent that they might then have abandoned the contest and agreed to a separation Atlanta was very strongly intrenched all the way around in a circle about a mile and a half outside of the city In addition to this there were advanced intrenchments which had to be taken before a close siege could be commenced Sure enough as indicated by the change of commanders the enemy was about to assume the offensive On the twentieth he came out and attacked the Army of the Cumberland most furiously Hooker s corps and Newton s and Johnson s divisions were the principal ones engaged in this contest which lasted more than an hour but the Confederates were then forced to fall back inside their main lines The losses were quite heavy on both sides On this day General Gresham since our Postmaster General was very badly wounded During the night Hood abandoned his outer lines and our troops were advanced The investment had not been relinquished for a moment during the day During the night of the twenty first Hood moved out again passing by our left flank which was then in motion to get a position farther in rear of him and a desperate battle ensued which lasted most of the day of the twenty twod At first the battle went very much in favor of the Confederates our troops being somewhat surprised While our troops were advancing they were struck in flank and their flank was enveloped But they had become too thorough veterans to be thrown into irreparable confusion by an unexpected attack when off their guard and soon they were in order and engaging the enemy with the advantage now of knowing where their antagonist was The field of battle continued to expand until it embraced about seven miles of ground Finally however and before night the enemy was driven back into the city twenty six It was during this battle that McPherson while passing from one column to another was instantly killed In his death the army lost one of its ablest purest and best generals Garrard had been sent out with his cavalry to get upon the railroad east of Atlanta and to cut it in the direction of Augusta He was successful in this and returned about the time of the battle Rousseau had also come up from Tennessee with a small division of cavalry having crossed the Tennessee River about Decatur and made a raid into Alabama Finally when hard pressed he had come in striking the railroad in rear of Sherman and reported to him about this time The battle of the twenty twod is usually known as the Battle of Atlanta although the city did not fall into our hands until the twod of September Preparations went on as before to flank the enemy out of his position The work was tedious and the lines that had to be maintained were very long Our troops were gradually worked around to the east until they struck the road between Decatur and Atlanta These lines were strongly fortified as were those to the north and west of the city all as close up to the enemy s lines as practicable in order to hold them with the smallest possible number of men the design being to detach an army to move by our right and try to get upon the railroad down south of Atlanta On the twenty seventh the movement by the right flank commenced On the twenty eighth the enemy struck our right flank General Logan commanding with great vigor Logan intrenched himself hastily and by that means was enabled to resist all assaults and inflict a great deal of damage upon the enemy These assaults were continued to the middle of the afternoon and resumed once or twice still later in the day The enemy s losses in these unsuccessful assaults were fearful During that evening the enemy in Logan s front withdrew into the town This now left Sherman s army close up to the Confederate lines extending from a point directly east of the city around by the north and west of it for a distance of fully ten miles the whole of this line being intrenched and made stronger every day they remained there In the latter part of July Sherman sent Stoneman to destroy the railroads to the south about Macon He was then to go east and if possible release our prisoners about Andersonville There were painful stories current at the time about the great hardships these prisoners had to endure in the way of general bad treatment in the way in which they were housed and in the way in which they were fed Great sympathy was felt for them and it was thought that even if they could be turned loose upon the country it would be a great relief to them But the attempt proved a failure McCook who commanded a small brigade was first reported to have been captured but he got back having inflicted a good deal of damage upon the enemy He had also taken some prisoners but encountering afterwards a largely superior force of the enemy he was obliged to drop his prisoners and get back as best he could with what men he had left He had lost several hundred men out of his small command On the fourth of August Colonel Adams commanding a little brigade of about a thousand men returned reporting Stoneman and all but himself as lost I myself had heard around Richmond of the capture of Stoneman and had sent Sherman word which he received The rumor was confirmed there also from other sources A few days after Colonel Adams s return Colonel Capron also got in with a small detachment and confirmed the report of the capture of Stoneman with something less than a thousand men It seems that Stoneman finding the escape of all his force was impossible had made arrangements for the escape of two divisions He covered the movement of these divisions to the rear with a force of about seven hundred men and at length surrendered himself and this detachment to the commanding Confederate In this raid however much damage was inflicted upon the enemy by the destruction of cars locomotives army wagons manufactories of military supplies et cetera On the fourth and fifth Sherman endeavored to get upon the railroad to our right where Schofield was in command but these attempts failed utterly General Palmer was charged with being the cause of this failure to a great extent by both General Sherman and General Schofield but I am not prepared to say this although a question seems to have arisen with Palmer as to whether Schofield had any right to command him If he did raise this question while an action was going on that act alone was exceedingly reprehensible About the same time Wheeler got upon our railroad north of Resaca and destroyed it nearly up to Dalton This cut Sherman off from communication with the North for several days Sherman responded to this attack on his lines of communication by directing one upon theirs Kilpatrick started on the night of the eighteenth of August to reach the Macon road about Jonesboro He succeeded in doing so passed entirely around the Confederate lines of Atlanta and was back again in his former position on our left by the twenty twod These little affairs however contributed but very little to the grand result They annoyed it is true but any damage thus done to a railroad by any cavalry expedition is soon repaired Sherman made preparations for a repetition of his tactics that is for a flank movement with as large a force as could be got together to some point in the enemy s rear Sherman commenced this last movement on the twenty fifth of August and on the first of September was well up towards the railroad twenty miles south of Atlanta Here he found Hardee intrenched ready to meet him A battle ensued but he was unable to drive Hardee away before night set in Under cover of the night however Hardee left of his own accord That night Hood blew up his military works such as he thought would be valuable in our hands and decamped The next morning at daylight General H W Slocum who was commanding north of the city moved in and took possession of Atlanta and notified Sherman Sherman then moved deliberately back taking three days to reach the city and occupied a line extending from Decatur on the left to Atlanta in the centre with his troops extending out of the city for some distance to the right The campaign had lasted about four months and was one of the most memorable in history There was but little if anything in the whole campaign now that it is over to criticise at all and nothing to criticise severely It was creditable alike to the general who commanded and the army which had executed it Sherman had on this campaign some bright wide awake division and brigade commanders whose alertness added a host to the efficiency of his command The troops now went to work to make themselves comfortable and to enjoy a little rest after their arduous campaign The city of Atlanta was turned into a military base The citizens were all compelled to leave Sherman also very wisely prohibited the assembling of the army of sutlers and traders who always follow in the wake of an army in the field if permitted to do so from trading with the citizens and getting the money of the soldiers for articles of but little use to them and for which they are made to pay most exorbitant prices He limited the number of these traders to one for each of his three armies The news of Sherman s success reached the North instantaneously and set the country all aglow This was the first great political campaign for the Republicans in their canvass of eighteen sixty four It was followed later by Sheridan s campaign in the Shenandoah Valley and these two campaigns probably had more effect in settling the election of the following November than all the speeches all the bonfires and all the parading with banners and bands of music in the North CHAPTER L GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC CROSSING THE RAPIDAN ENTERING THE WILDERNESS BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS Soon after midnight May threed fourth the Army of the Potomac moved out from its position north Rapidan to start upon that memorable campaign destined to result in the capture of the Confederate capital and the army defending it This was not to be accomplished however without as desperate fighting as the world has ever witnessed not to be consummated in a day a week a month single season The losses inflicted and endured were destined to be severe but the armies now confronting each other had already been in deadly conflict for a period of three years with immense losses in killed by death from sickness captured and wounded and neither had made any real progress accomplishing the final end It is true the Confederates had so far held their capital and they claimed this to be their sole object But previously they had boldly proclaimed their intention to capture Philadelphia New York and the National Capital and had made several attempts to do so and once or twice had come fearfully near making their boast good too near for complacent contemplation by the loyal North They had also come near losing their own capital on at least one occasion So here was a stand off The campaign now begun was destined to result in heavier losses to both armies in a given time than any previously suffered but the carnage was to be limited to a single year and to accomplish all that had been anticipated or desired at the beginning in that time We had to have hard fighting to achieve this The two armies had been confronting each other so long without any decisive result that they hardly knew which could whip Ten days rations with a supply of forage and ammunition were taken in wagons Beef cattle were driven with the trains and butchered as wanted Three days rations in addition in haversacks and fifty rounds of cartridges were carried on the person of each soldier The country over which the army had to operate from the Rapidan to the crossing of the James River is rather flat and is cut by numerous streams which make their way to the Chesapeake Bay The crossings of these streams by the army were generally made not far above tide water and where they formed a considerable obstacle to the rapid advance of troops even when the enemy did not appear in opposition The country roads were narrow and poor Most of the country is covered with a dense forest in places like the Wilderness and along the Chickahominy almost impenetrable even for infantry except along the roads All bridges were naturally destroyed before the National troops came to them The Army of the Potomac was composed of three infantry and one cavalry corps commanded respectively by Generals W S Hancock G K Warren twenty seven John Sedgwick and P H Sheridan The artillery was commanded by General Henry J Hunt This arm was in such abundance that the fourth of it could not be used to advantage in such a country as we were destined to pass through The surplus was much in the way taking up as it did so much of the narrow and bad roads and consuming so much of the forage and other stores brought up by the trains The fifth corps General Warren commanding was in advance on the right and marched directly for Germania Ford preceded by one division of cavalry under General J H Wilson General Sedgwick followed Warren with the sixth corps Germania Ford was nine or ten miles below the right of Lee s line Hancock with the twod corps moved by another road farther east directly upon Ely s Ford six miles below Germania preceded by Gregg s division of cavalry and followed by the artillery Torbert s division of cavalry was left north of the Rapidan for the time to picket the river and prevent the enemy from crossing and getting into our rear The cavalry seized the two crossings before daylight drove the enemy s pickets guarding them away and by six o clock A M had the pontoons laid ready for the crossing of the infantry and artillery This was undoubtedly a surprise to Lee The fact that the movement was unopposed proves this Burnside with the ninth corps was left back at Warrenton guarding the railroad from Bull Run forward to preserve control of it in case our crossing the Rapidan should be long delayed He was instructed however to advance at once on receiving notice that the army had crossed and a dispatch was sent to him a little after one P M giving the information that our crossing had been successful The country was heavily wooded at all the points of crossing particularly on the south side of the river The battle field from the crossing of the Rapidan until the final movement from the Wilderness toward Spottsylvania was of the same character There were some clearings and small farms within what might be termed the battle field but generally the country was covered with a dense forest The roads were narrow and bad All the conditions were favorable for defensive operations There are two roads good for that part of Virginia running from Orange Court House to the battle field The most southerly of these roads is known as the Orange Court House Plank Road the northern one as the Orange Turnpike There are also roads from east of the battle field running to Spottsylvania Court House one from Chancellorsville branching at Aldrich s the western branch going by Piney Branch Church Alsop s thence by the Brock Road to Spottsylvania the east branch goes by Gates s thence to Spottsylvania The Brock Road runs from Germania Ford through the battle field and on to the Court House As Spottsylvania is approached the country is cut up with numerous roads some going to the town direct and others crossing so as to connect the farms with roads going there Lee s headquarters were at Orange Court House From there to Fredericksburg he had the use of the two roads above described running nearly parallel to the Wilderness This gave him unusual facilities for that country for concentrating his forces to his right These roads strike the road from Germania Ford in the Wilderness As soon as the crossing of the infantry was assured the cavalry pushed forward Wilson s division by Wilderness Tavern to Parker s store on the Orange Plank Road Gregg to the left towards Chancellorsville Warren followed Wilson and reached the Wilderness Tavern by noon took position there and intrenched Sedgwick followed Warren He was across the river and in camp on the south bank on the right of Warren by sundown Hancock with the twod corps moved parallel with Warren and camped about six miles east of him Before night all the troops and by the evening of the fifth the trains of more than four thousand wagons were safely on the south side of the river There never was a corps better organized than was the quartermaster s corps with the Army of the Potomac in eighteen sixty four With a wagon train that would have extended from the Rapidan to Richmond stretched along in single file and separated as the teams necessarily would be when moving we could still carry only three days forage and about ten to twelve days rations besides a supply of ammunition To overcome all difficulties the chief quartermaster General Rufus Ingalls had marked on each wagon the corps badge with the division color and the number of the brigade At a glance the particular brigade to which any wagon belonged could be told The wagons were also marked to note the contents if ammunition whether for artillery or infantry if forage whether grain or hay if rations whether bread pork beans rice sugar coffee or whatever it might be Empty wagons were never allowed to follow the army or stay in camp As soon as a wagon was empty it would return to the base of supply for a load of precisely the same article that had been taken from it Empty trains were obliged to leave the road free for loaded ones Arriving near the army they would be parked in fields nearest to the brigades they belonged to Issues except of ammunition were made at night in all cases By this system the hauling of forage for the supply train was almost wholly dispensed with They consumed theirs at the depots I left Culpeper Court House after all the troops had been put in motion and passing rapidly to the front crossed the Rapidan in advance of Sedgwick s corps and established headquarters for the afternoon and night in a deserted house near the river Orders had been given long before this movement began to cut down the baggage of officers and men to the lowest point possible Notwithstanding this I saw scattered along the road from Culpeper to Germania Ford wagon loads of new blankets and overcoats thrown away by the troops to lighten their knapsacks an improvidence I had never witnessed before Lee while his pickets and signal corps must have discovered at a very early hour on the morning of the fourth of May that the Army of the Potomac was moving evidently did not learn until about one o clock in the afternoon by what route we would confront his army This I judge from the fact that at one point fifteen P M an hour and a quarter after Warren had reached Old Wilderness Tavern our officers took off rebel signals which when translated were seen to be an order to his troops to occupy their intrenchments at Mine Run Here at night dispatches were received announcing that Sherman Butler and Crook had moved according to programme On discovering the advance of the Army of the Potomac Lee ordered Hill Ewell and Longstreet each commanding corps to move to the right to attack us Hill on the Orange Plank Road Longstreet to follow on the same road Longstreet was at this time middle of the afternoon at Gordonsville twenty or more miles away Ewell was ordered by the Orange Pike He was near by and arrived some four miles east of Mine Run before bivouacking for the night My orders were given through General Meade for an early advance on the morning of the fifth Warren was to move to Parker s store and Wilson s cavalry then at Parker s store to move on to Craig s meeting house Sedgwick followed Warren closing in on his right The Army of the Potomac was facing to the west though our advance was made to the south except when facing the enemy Hancock was to move south westward to join on the left of Warren his left to reach to Shady Grove Church At six o clock before reaching Parker s store Warren discovered the enemy He sent word back to this effect and was ordered to halt and prepare to meet and attack him Wright with his division of Sedgwick s corps was ordered by any road he could find to join on to Warren s right and Getty with his division also of Sedgwick s corps was ordered to move rapidly by Warren s rear and get on his left This was the speediest way to reinforce Warren who was confronting the enemy on both the Orange plank and turnpike roads Burnside had moved promptly on the fourth on receiving word that the Army of the Potomac had safely crossed the Rapidan By making a night march although some of his troops had to march forty miles to reach the river he was crossing with the head of his column early on the morning of the fifth Meade moved his headquarters on to Old Wilderness Tavern four miles south of the river as soon as it was light enough to see the road I remained to hasten Burnside s crossing and to put him in position Burnside at this time was not under Meade s command and was his senior in rank Getting information of the proximity of the enemy I informed Meade and without waiting to see Burnside at once moved forward my headquarters to where Meade was It was my plan then as it was on all other occasions to take the initiative whenever the enemy could be drawn from his intrenchments if we were not intrenched ourselves Warren had not yet reached the point where he was to halt when he discovered the enemy near by Neither party had any advantage of position Warren was therefore ordered to attack as soon as he could prepare for it At nine o clock Hancock was ordered to come up to the support of Getty He himself arrived at Getty s front about noon but his troops were yet far in the rear Getty was directed to hold his position at all hazards until relieved About this hour Warren was ready and attacked with favorable though not decisive results Getty was somewhat isolated from Warren and was in a precarious condition for a time Wilson with his division of cavalry was farther south and was cut off from the rest of the army At two o clock Hancock s troops began to arrive and immediately he was ordered to join Getty and attack the enemy But the heavy timber and narrow roads prevented him from getting into position for attack as promptly as he generally did when receiving such orders At four o clock he again received his orders to attack and General Getty received orders from Meade a few minutes later to attack whether Hancock was ready or not He met the enemy under Heth within a few hundred yards Hancock immediately sent two divisions commanded by Birney and Mott and later two brigades Carroll s and Owen s to the support of Getty This was timely and saved Getty During the battle Getty and Carroll were wounded but remained on the field One of Birney s most gallant brigade commanders Alexander Hays was killed I had been at West Point with Hays for three years and had served with him through the Mexican war a portion of the time in the same regiment He was a most gallant officer ready to lead his command wherever ordered With him it was Come boys not Go Wadsworth s division and Baxter s brigade of the twod division were sent to reinforce Hancock and Getty but the density of the intervening forest was such that there being no road to march upon they did not get up with the head of column until night and bivouacked where they were without getting into position During the afternoon Sheridan sent Gregg s division of cavalry to Todd s Tavern in search of Wilson This was fortunate He found Wilson engaged with a superior force under General Rosser supported by infantry and falling back before it Together they were strong enough to turn the tables upon the enemy and themselves become aggressive They soon drove the rebel cavalry back beyond Corbin s Bridge Fighting between Hancock and Hill continued until night put a close to it Neither side made any special progress After the close of the battle of the fifth of May my orders were given for the following morning We knew Longstreet with twelve thousand men was on his way to join Hill s right near the Brock Road and might arrive during the night I was anxious that the rebels should not take the initiative in the morning and therefore ordered Hancock to make an assault at four point thirty o clock Meade asked to have the hour changed to six Deferring to his wishes as far as I was willing the order was modified and five was fixed as the hour to move Hancock had now fully one half of the Army of the Potomac Wadsworth with his division which had arrived the night before lay in a line perpendicular to that held by Hill and to the right of Hancock He was directed to move at the same time and to attack Hill s left Burnside who was coming up with two divisions was directed to get in between Warren and Wadsworth and attack as soon as he could get in position to do so Sedgwick and Warren were to make attacks in their front to detain as many of the enemy as they could and to take advantage of any attempt to reinforce Hill from that quarter Burnside was ordered if he should succeed in breaking the enemy s centre to swing around to the left and envelop the right of Lee s army Hancock was informed of all the movements ordered Burnside had three divisions but one of them a colored division was sent to guard the wagon train and he did not see it again until July Lee was evidently very anxious that there should be no battle on his right until Longstreet got up This is evident from the fact that notwithstanding the early hour at which I had ordered the assault both for the purpose of being the attacking party and to strike before Longstreet got up Lee was ahead in his assault on our right His purpose was evident but he failed Hancock was ready to advance by the hour named but learning in time that Longstreet was moving a part of his corps by the Catharpin Road thus threatening his left flank sent a division of infantry commanded by General Barlow with all his artillery to cover the approaches by which Longstreet was expected This disposition was made in time to attack as ordered Hancock moved by the left of the Orange Plank Road and Wadsworth by the right of it The fighting was desperate for about an hour when the enemy began to break up in great confusion I believed then and see no reason to change that opinion now that if the country had been such that Hancock and his command could have seen the confusion and panic in the lines of the enemy it would have been taken advantage of so effectually that Lee would not have made another stand outside of his Richmond defences Gibbon commanded Hancock s left and was ordered to attack but was not able to accomplish much On the morning of the sixth Sheridan was sent to connect with Hancock s left and attack the enemy s cavalry who were trying to get on our left and rear He met them at the intersection of the Furnace and Brock roads and at Todd s Tavern and defeated them at both places Later he was attacked and again the enemy was repulsed Hancock heard the firing between Sheridan and Stuart and thinking the enemy coming by that road still further reinforced his position guarding the entrance to the Brock Road Another incident happened during the day to further induce Hancock to weaken his attacking column Word reached him that troops were seen moving towards him from the direction of Todd s Tavern and Brooke s brigade was detached to meet this new enemy but the troops approaching proved to be several hundred convalescents coming from Chancellorsville by the road Hancock had advanced upon to join their respective commands At six point fifty o clock A M Burnside who had passed Wilderness Tavern at six o clock was ordered to send a division to the support of Hancock but to continue with the remainder of his command in the execution of his previous order The difficulty of making a way through the dense forests prevented Burnside from getting up in time to be of any service on the forenoon of the sixth Hancock followed Hill s retreating forces in the morning a mile or more He maintained this position until along in the afternoon Longstreet came upon him The retreating column of Hill meeting reinforcements that had not yet been engaged became encouraged and returned with them They were enabled from the density of the forest to approach within a few hundred yards of our advance before being discovered Falling upon a brigade of Hancock s corps thrown to the advance they swept it away almost instantly The enemy followed up his advantage and soon came upon Mott s division which fell back in great confusion Hancock made dispositions to hold his advanced position but after holding it for a time fell back into the position that he had held in the morning which was strongly intrenched In this engagement the intrepid Wadsworth while trying to rally his men was mortally wounded and fell into the hands of the enemy The enemy followed up but made no immediate attack The Confederate General Jenkins was killed and Longstreet seriously wounded in this engagement Longstreet had to leave the field not to resume command for many weeks His loss was a severe one to Lee and compensated in a great measure for the mishap or misapprehensions which had fallen to our lot during the day After Longstreet s removal from the field Lee took command of his right in person He was not able however to rally his men to attack Hancock s position and withdrew from our front for the purpose of reforming Hancock sent a brigade to clear his front of all remnants that might be left of Longstreet s or Hill s commands This brigade having been formed at right angles to the intrenchments held by Hancock s command swept down the whole length of them from left to right A brigade of the enemy was encountered in this move but it broke and disappeared without a contest Firing was continued after this but with less fury Burnside had not yet been able to get up to render any assistance But it was now only about nine in the morning and he was getting into position on Hancock s right At four point fifteen in the afternoon Lee attacked our left His line moved up to within a hundred yards of ours and opened a heavy fire This status was maintained for about half an hour Then a part of Mott s division and Ward s brigade of Birney s division gave way and retired in disorder The enemy under R H Anderson took advantage of this and pushed through our line planting their flags on a part of the intrenchments not on fire But owing to the efforts of Hancock their success was but temporary Carroll of Gibbon s division moved at a double quick with his brigade and drove back the enemy inflicting great loss Fighting had continued from five in the morning sometimes along the whole line at other times only in places The ground fought over had varied in width but averaged three quarters of a mile The killed and many of the severely wounded of both armies lay within this belt where it was impossible to reach them The woods were set on fire by the bursting shells and the conflagration raged The wounded who had not strength to move themselves were either suffocated or burned to death Finally the fire communicated with our breastworks in places Being constructed of wood they burned with great fury But the battle still raged our men firing through the flames until it became too hot to remain longer Lee was now in distress His men were in confusion and his personal efforts failed to restore order These facts however were learned subsequently or we would have taken advantage of his condition and no doubt gained a decisive success His troops were withdrawn now but I revoked the order which I had given previously to this assault for Hancock to attack because his troops had exhausted their ammunition and did not have time to replenish from the train which was at some distance Burnside Sedgwick and Warren had all kept up an assault during all this time but their efforts had no other effect than to prevent the enemy from reinforcing his right from the troops in their front I had on the fifth ordered all the bridges over the Rapidan to be taken up except one at Germania Ford The troops on Sedgwick s right had been sent to enforce our left This left our right in danger of being turned and us of being cut off from all present base of supplies Sedgwick had refused his right and intrenched it for protection against attack But late in the afternoon of the sixth Early came out from his lines in considerable force and got in upon Sedgwick s right notwithstanding the precautions taken and created considerable confusion Early captured several hundred prisoners among them two general officers The defence however was vigorous and night coming on the enemy was thrown into as much confusion as our troops engaged were Early says in his Memoirs that if we had discovered the confusion in his lines we might have brought fresh troops to his great discomfort Many officers who had not been attacked by Early continued coming to my headquarters even after Sedgwick had rectified his lines a little farther to the rear with news of the disaster fully impressed with the idea that the enemy was pushing on and would soon be upon me During the night all of Lee s army withdrew within their intrenchments On the morning of the seventh General Custer drove the enemy s cavalry from Catharpin Furnace to Todd s Tavern Pickets and skirmishers were sent along our entire front to find the position of the enemy Some went as far as a mile and a half before finding him But Lee showed no disposition to come out of his Works There was no battle during the day and but little firing except in Warren s front he being directed about noon to make a reconnoissance in force This drew some sharp firing but there was no attempt on the part of Lee to drive him back This ended the Battle of the Wilderness CHAPTER LI AFTER THE BATTLE TELEGRAPH AND SIGNAL SERVICE MOVEMENT BY THE LEFT FLANK More desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this continent than that of the fifth and sixth of May Our victory consisted in having successfully crossed a formidable stream almost in the face of an enemy and in getting the army together as a unit We gained an advantage on the morning of the sixth which if it had been followed up must have proven very decisive In the evening the enemy gained an advantage but was speedily repulsed As we stood at the close the two armies were relatively in about the same condition to meet each other as when the river divided them But the fact of having safely crossed was a victory Our losses in the Wilderness were very severe Those of the Confederates must have been even more so but I have no means of speaking with accuracy upon this point The Germania Ford bridge was transferred to Ely s Ford to facilitate the transportation of the wounded to Washington It may be as well here as elsewhere to state two things connected with all movements of the Army of the Potomac first in every change of position or halt for the night whether confronting the enemy or not the moment arms were stacked the men intrenched themselves For this purpose they would build up piles of logs or rails if they could be found in their front and dig a ditch throwing the dirt forward on the timber Thus the digging they did counted in making a depression to stand in and increased the elevation in front of them It was wonderful how quickly they could in this way construct defences of considerable strength When a halt was made with the view of assaulting the enemy or in his presence these would be strengthened or their positions changed under the direction of engineer officers The second was the use made of the telegraph and signal corps Nothing could be more complete than the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent men Insulated wires insulated so that they would transmit messages in a storm on the ground or under water were wound upon reels making about two hundred pounds weight of wire to each reel Two men and one mule were detailed to each reel The pack saddle on which this was carried was provided with a rack like a sawbuck placed crosswise of the saddle and raised above it so that the reel with its wire would revolve freely There was a wagon supplied with a telegraph operator battery and telegraph instruments for each division each corps each army and one for my headquarters There were wagons also loaded with light poles about the size and length of a wall tent pole supplied with an iron spike in one end used to hold the wires up when laid so that wagons and artillery would not run over them The mules thus loaded were assigned to brigades and always kept with the command they were assigned to The operators were also assigned to particular headquarters and never changed except by special orders The moment the troops were put in position to go into camp all the men connected with this branch of service would proceed to put up their wires A mule loaded with a coil of wire would be led to the rear of the nearest flank of the brigade he belonged to and would be led in a line parallel thereto while one man would hold an end of the wire and uncoil it as the mule was led off When he had walked the length of the wire the whole of it would be on the ground This would be done in rear of every brigade at the same time The ends of all the wires would then be joined making a continuous wire in the rear of the whole army The men attached to brigades or divisions would all commence at once raising the wires with their telegraph poles This was done by making a loop in the wire and putting it over the spike and raising the pole to a perpendicular position At intervals the wire would be attached to trees or some other permanent object so that one pole was sufficient at a place In the absence of such a support two poles would have to be used at intervals placed at an angle so as to hold the wire firm in its place While this was being done the telegraph wagons would take their positions near where the headquarters they belonged to were to be established and would connect with the wire Thus in a few minutes longer time than it took a mule to walk the length of its coil telegraphic communication would be effected between all the headquarters of the army No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph The signal service was used on the march The men composing this corps were assigned to specified commands When movements were made they would go in advance or on the flanks and seize upon high points of ground giving a commanding view of the country if cleared or would climb tall trees on the highest points if not cleared and would denote by signals the positions of different parts of our own army and often the movements of the enemy They would also take off the signals of the enemy and transmit them It would sometimes take too long a time to make translations of intercepted dispatches for us to receive any benefit from them But sometimes they gave useful information On the afternoon of the seventh I received news from Washington announcing that Sherman had probably attacked Johnston that day and that Butler had reached City Point safely and taken it by surprise on the fifth I had given orders for a movement by the left flank fearing that Lee might move rapidly to Richmond to crush Butler before I could get there My order for this movement was as follows HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U S May seven eighteen sixty four six point thirty A M MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding A P Make all preparations during the day for a night march to take position at Spottsylvania C H with one army corps at Todd s Tavern with one and another near the intersection of the Piney Branch and Spottsylvania road with the road from Alsop s to Old Court House If this move is made the trains should be thrown forward early in the morning to the Ny River I think it would be advisable in making the change to leave Hancock where he is until Warren passes him He could then follow and become the right of the new line Burnside will move to Piney Branch Church Sedgwick can move along the pike to Chancellorsville and on to his destination Burnside will move on the plank road to the intersection of it with the Orange and Fredericksburg plank road then follow Sedgwick to his place of destination All vehicles should be got out of hearing of the enemy before the troops move and then move off quietly It is more than probable that the enemy concentrate for a heavy attack on Hancock this afternoon In case they do we must be prepared to resist them and follow up any success we may gain with our whole force Such a result would necessarily modify these instructions All the hospitals should be moved to day to Chancellorsville U S GRANT Lieut General During the seventh Sheridan had a fight with the rebel cavalry at Todd s Tavern but routed them thus opening the way for the troops that were to go by that route at night Soon after dark Warren withdrew from the front of the enemy and was soon followed by Sedgwick Warren s march carried him immediately behind the works where Hancock s command lay on the Brock Road With my staff and a small escort of cavalry I preceded the troops Meade with his staff accompanied me The greatest enthusiasm was manifested by Hancock s men as we passed by No doubt it was inspired by the fact that the movement was south It indicated to them that they had passed through the beginning of the end in the battle just fought The cheering was so lusty that the enemy must have taken it for a night attack At all events it drew from him a furious fusillade of artillery and musketry plainly heard but not felt by us Meade and I rode in advance We had passed but a little way beyond our left when the road forked We looked to see if we could which road Sheridan had taken with his cavalry during the day It seemed to be the right hand one and accordingly we took it We had not gone far however when Colonel C B Comstock of my staff with the instinct of the engineer suspecting that we were on a road that would lead us into the lines of the enemy if he too should be moving dashed by at a rapid gallop and all alone In a few minutes he returned and reported that Lee was moving and that the road we were on would bring us into his lines in a short distance We returned to the forks of the road left a man to indicate the right road to the head of Warren s column when it should come up and continued our journey to Todd s Tavern where we arrived after midnight My object in moving to Spottsylvania was two fold first I did not want Lee to get back to Richmond in time to attempt to crush Butler before I could get there second I wanted to get between his army and Richmond if possible and if not to draw him into the open field But Lee by accident beat us to Spottsylvania Our wagon trains had been ordered easterly of the roads the troops were to march upon before the movement commenced Lee interpreted this as a semi retreat of the Army of the Potomac to Fredericksburg and so informed his government Accordingly he ordered Longstreet s corps now commanded by Anderson to move in the morning the eighth to Spottsylvania But the woods being still on fire Anderson could not go into bivouac and marched directly on to his destination that night By this accident Lee got possession of Spottsylvania It is impossible to say now what would have been the result if Lee s orders had been obeyed as given but it is certain that we would have been in Spottsylvania and between him and his capital My belief is that there would have been a race between the two armies to see which could reach Richmond first and the Army of the Potomac would have had the shorter line Thus twice since crossing the Rapidan we came near closing the campaign so far as battles were concerned from the Rapidan to the James River or Richmond The first failure was caused by our not following up the success gained over Hill s corps on the morning of the sixth as before described the second when fires caused by that battle drove Anderson to make a march during the night of the seventh eighth which he was ordered to commence on the morning of the eighth But accident often decides the fate of battle Sheridan s cavalry had had considerable fighting during the afternoon of the seventh lasting at Todd s Tavern until after night with the field his at the close He issued the necessary orders for seizing Spottsylvania and holding the bridge over the Po River which Lee s troops would have to cross to get to Spottsylvania But Meade changed Sheridan s orders to Merritt who was holding the bridge on his arrival at Todd s Tavern and thereby left the road free for Anderson when he came up Wilson who was ordered to seize the town did so with his division of cavalry but he could not hold it against the Confederate corps which had not been detained at the crossing of the Po as it would have been but for the unfortunate change in Merritt s orders Had he been permitted to execute the orders Sheridan gave him he would have been guarding with two brigades of cavalry the bridge over the Po River which Anderson had to cross and must have detained him long enough to enable Warren to reinforce Wilson and hold the town Anderson soon intrenched himself if indeed the intrenchments were not already made immediately across Warren s front Warren was not aware of his presence but probably supposed it was the cavalry which Merritt had engaged earlier in the day He assaulted at once but was repulsed He soon organized his men as they were not pursued by the enemy and made a second attack this time with his whole corps This time he succeeded in gaining a position immediately in the enemy s front where he intrenched His right and left divisions the former Crawford s the latter Wadsworth s now commanded by Cutler drove the enemy back some distance At this time my headquarters had been advanced to Piney Branch Church I was anxious to crush Anderson before Lee could get a force to his support To this end Sedgwick who was at Piney Branch Church was ordered to Warren s support Hancock who was at Todd s Tavern was notified of Warren s engagement and was directed to be in readiness to come up Burnside who was with the wagon trains at Aldrich s on our extreme left received the same instructions Sedgwick was slow in getting up for some reason probably unavoidable because he was never at fault when serious work was to be done so that it was near night before the combined forces were ready to attack Even then all of Sedgwick s command did not get into the engagement Warren led the last assault one division at a time and of course it failed Warren s difficulty was twofold when he received an order to do anything it would at once occur to his mind how all the balance of the army should be engaged so as properly to company operate with him His ideas were generally good but he would forget that the person giving him orders had thought of others at the time he had of him In like manner when he did get ready to execute an order after giving most intelligent instructions to division commanders he would go in with one division holding the others in reserve until he could superintend their movements in person also forgetting that division commanders could execute an order without his presence His difficulty was constitutional and beyond his control He was an officer of superior ability quick perceptions and personal courage to accomplish anything that could be done with a small command Lee had ordered Hill s corps now commanded by Early to move by the very road we had marched upon This shows that even early in the morning of the eighth Lee had not yet become acquainted with my move but still thought that the Army of the Potomac had gone to Fredericksburg Indeed he informed the authorities at Richmond he had possession of Spottsylvania and was on my flank Anderson was in possession of Spottsylvania through no foresight of Lee however Early only found that he had been following us when he ran against Hancock at Todd s Tavern His coming detained Hancock from the battle field of Spottsylvania for that day but he in like manner kept Early back and forced him to move by another route Had I ordered the movement for the night of the seventh by my left flank it would have put Hancock in the lead It would also have given us an hour or earlier start It took all that time for Warren to get the head of his column to the left of Hancock after he had got his troops out of their line confronting the enemy This hour and Hancock s capacity to use his whole force when necessary would no doubt have enabled him to crush Anderson before he could be reinforced But the movement made was tactical It kept the troops in mass against a possible assault by the enemy Our left occupied its intrenchments while the two corps to the right passed If an attack had been made by the enemy he would have found the twod corps in position fortified and practically the fifth and sixth corps in position as reserves until his entire front was passed By a left flank movement the army would have been scattered while still passing the front of the enemy and before the extreme right had got by it would have been very much exposed Then too I had not yet learned the special qualifications of the different corps commanders At that time my judgment was that Warren was the man I would suggest to succeed Meade should anything happen to that gallant soldier to take him from the field As I have before said Warren was a gallant soldier an able man and he was beside thoroughly imbued with the solemnity and importance of the duty he had to perform CHAPTER LII BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA HANCOCK S POSITION ASSAULT OF WARREN S AND WRIGHT S CORPS UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD GOOD NEWS FROM BUTLER AND SHERIDAN The Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat the Ta the Po and the Ny rivers the last being the northernmost of the four It takes its rise about a mile south and a little east of the Wilderness Tavern The Po rises south west of the place but farther away Spottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these two streams and where they are but a few miles apart The Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania without crossing either of these streams Lee s army coming up by the Catharpin Road had to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge Warren and Hancock came by the Brock Road Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace Burnside coming by Aldrich s to Gates s house had to cross the Ny near the enemy He found pickets at the bridge but they were soon driven off by a brigade of Willcox s division and the stream was crossed This brigade was furiously attacked but the remainder of the division coming up they were enabled to hold their position and soon fortified it About the time I received the news of this attack word came from Hancock that Early had left his front He had been forced over to the Catharpin Road crossing the Po at Corbin s and again at Wooden Bridge These are the bridges Sheridan had given orders to his cavalry to occupy on the eighth while one division should occupy Spottsylvania These movements of the enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make the attempt to get to or towards Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies I made arrangements to attack his right and get between him and Richmond if he should try to execute this design If he had any such intention it was abandoned as soon as Burnside was established south of the Ny The Po and the Ny are narrow little streams but deep with abrupt banks and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy bottoms at the time we were there and difficult to cross except where bridged The country about was generally heavily timbered but with occasional clearings It was a much better country to conduct a defensive campaign in than an offensive one By noon of the ninth the position of the two armies was as follows Lee occupied a semicircle facing north north west and north east inclosing the town Anderson was on his left extending to the Po Ewell came next then Early Warren occupied our right covering the Brock and other roads converging at Spottsylvania Sedgwick was to his left and Burnside on our extreme left Hancock was yet back at Todd s Tavern but as soon as it was known that Early had left Hancock s front the latter was ordered up to Warren s right He formed a line with three divisions on the hill overlooking the Po early in the afternoon and was ordered to cross the Po and get on the enemy s flank The fourth division of Hancock s corps Mott commanding was left at Todd s when the corps first came up but in the afternoon it was brought up and placed to the left of Sedgwick s now Wright s sixth corps In the morning General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of his intrenchments by rebel sharpshooters His loss was a severe one to the Army of the Potomac and to the Nation General H G Wright succeeded him in the command of his corps Hancock was now nine P M of the ninth of May across the left flank of Lee s army but separated from it and also from the remainder of Meade s army by the Po River But for the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night he would have attempted to cross the river again at Wooden Bridge thus bringing himself on the same side with both friend and foe The Po at the points where Hancock s corps crossed runs nearly due east Just below his lower crossing the troops crossed at three points it turns due south and after passing under Wooden Bridge soon resumes a more easterly direction During the night this corps built three bridges over the Po but these were in rear The position assumed by Hancock s corps forced Lee to reinforce his left during the night Accordingly on the morning of the tenth when Hancock renewed his effort to get over the Po to his front he found himself confronted by some of Early s command which had been brought from the extreme right of the enemy during the night He succeeded in effecting a crossing with one brigade however but finding the enemy intrenched in his front no more were crossed Hancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the tenth with the view of forcing a crossing if it was found that an advantage could be gained The enemy was found strongly intrenched on the high ground overlooking the river and commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery Anderson s left rested on the Po where it turns south therefore for Hancock to cross over although it would bring him to the same side of the stream with the rest of the army would still farther isolate him from it The stream would have to be crossed twice in the face of the enemy to unite with the main body The idea of crossing was therefore abandoned Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this movement of Hancock s and I determined to take advantage of it Accordingly in the morning orders were issued for an attack in the afternoon on the centre by Warren s and Wright s corps Hancock to command all the attacking force Two of his divisions were brought to the north side of the Po Gibbon was placed to the right of Warren and Birney in his rear as a reserve Barlow s division was left south of the stream and Mott of the same corps was still to the left of Wright s corps Burnside was ordered to reconnoitre his front in force and if an opportunity presented to attack with vigor The enemy seeing Barlow s division isolated from the rest of the army came out and attacked with fury Barlow repulsed the assault with great slaughter and with considerable loss to himself But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault Birney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river crossings built by our troops and covered the crossings The second assault was repulsed again with severe loss to the enemy and Barlow was withdrawn without further molestation General T G Stevenson was killed in this move Between the lines where Warren s assault was to take place there was a ravine grown up with large trees and underbrush making it almost impenetrable by man The slopes on both sides were also covered with a heavy growth of timber Warren before noon reconnoitred his front twice the first time with one and the second with two divisions He was repulsed on both occasions but gained such information of the ground as to induce him to report recommending the assault Wright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably advanced position from the one he started from He then organized a storming party consisting of twelve regiments and assigned Colonel Emory Upton of the one hundred and twenty first New York Volunteers to the command of it About four o clock in the afternoon the assault was ordered Warren s and Wright s corps with Mott s division of Hancock s corps to move simultaneously The movement was prompt and in a few minutes the fiercest of struggles began The battle field was so densely covered with forest that but little could be seen by any one person as to the progress made Meade and I occupied the best position we could get in rear of Warren Warren was repulsed with heavy loss General J C Rice being among the killed He was not followed however by the enemy and was thereby enabled to reorganize his command as soon as covered from the guns of the enemy To the left our success was decided but the advantage was lost by the feeble action of Mott Upton with his assaulting party pushed forward and crossed the enemy s intrenchments Turning to the right and left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners Mott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly So much time was lost in trying to get up the troops which were in the right position to reinforce that I ordered Upton to withdraw but the officers and men of his command were so averse to giving up the advantage they had gained that I withdrew the order To relieve them I ordered a renewal of the assault By this time Hancock who had gone with Birney s division to relieve Barlow had returned bringing the division with him His corps was now joined with Warren s and Wright s in this last assault It was gallantly made many men getting up to and over the works of the enemy but they were not able to hold them At night they were withdrawn Upton brought his prisoners with him but the guns he had captured he was obliged to abandon Upton had gained an important advantage but a lack in others of the spirit and dash possessed by him lost it to us Before leaving Washington I had been authorized to promote officers on the field for special acts of gallantry By this authority I conferred the rank of brigadier general upon Upton on the spot and this act was confirmed by the President Upton had been badly wounded in this fight Burnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards of Spottsylvania Court House completely turning Lee s right He was not aware of the importance of the advantage he had gained and I being with the troops where the heavy fighting was did not know of it at the time He had gained his position with but little fighting and almost without loss Burnside s position now separated him widely from Wright s corps the corps nearest to him At night he was ordered to join on to this This brought him back about a mile and lost to us an important advantage I attach no blame to Burnside for this but I do to myself for not having had a staff officer with him to report to me his position The enemy had not dared to come out of his line at any point to follow up his advantage except in the single instance of his attack on Barlow Then he was twice repulsed with heavy loss though he had an entire corps against two brigades Barlow took up his bridges in the presence of this force On the eleventh there was no battle and but little firing none except by Mott who made a reconnoissance to ascertain if there was a weak point in the enemy s line I wrote the following letter to General Halleck NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C H May eleven eighteen sixty four eight point thirty A M MAJOR GENERAL HALLECK Chief of Staff of the Army Washington D C We have now ended the sixth day of very hard fighting The result up to this time is much in our favor But our losses have been heavy as well as those of the enemy We have lost to this time eleven general officers killed wounded and missing and probably twenty thousand men I think the loss of the enemy must be greater we having taken over four thousand prisoners in battle whilst he has taken from us but few except a few stragglers I am now sending back to Belle Plain all my wagons for a fresh supply of provisions and ammunition and purpose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer The arrival of reinforcements here will be very encouraging to the men and I hope they will be sent as fast as possible and in as great numbers My object in having them sent to Belle Plain was to use them as an escort to our supply trains If it is more convenient to send them out by train to march from the railroad to Belle Plain or Fredericksburg send them so I am satisfied the enemy are very shaky and are only kept up to the mark by the greatest exertions on the part of their officers and by keeping them intrenched in every position they take Up to this time there is no indication of any portion of Lee s army being detached for the defence of Richmond U S GRANT Lieut General And also I received information through the War Department from General Butler that his cavalry under Kautz had cut the railroad south of Petersburg separating Beauregard from Richmond and had whipped Hill killing wounding and capturing many Also that he was intrenched and could maintain himself On this same day came news from Sheridan to the effect that he had destroyed ten miles of the railroad and telegraph between Lee and Richmond one and a half million rations and most of the medical stores for his army On the eighth I had directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac and pass around the left of Lee s army and attack his cavalry and communications which was successfully executed in the manner I have already described CHAPTER LIII HANCOCK S ASSAULT LOSSES OF THE CONFEDERATES PROMOTIONS RECOMMENDED DISCOMFITURE OF THE ENEMY EWELL S ATTACK REDUCING THE ARTILLERY In the reconnoissance made by Mott on the eleventh a salient was discovered at the right centre I determined that an assault should be made at that point twenty eight Accordingly in the afternoon Hancock was ordered to move his command by the rear of Warren and Wright under cover of night to Wright s left and there form it for an assault at four o clock the next morning The night was dark it rained heavily and the road was difficult so that it was midnight when he reached the point where he was to halt It took most of the night to get the men in position for their advance in the morning The men got but little rest Burnside was ordered to attack twenty nine on the left of the salient at the same hour I sent two of my staff officers to impress upon him the importance of pushing forward vigorously Hancock was notified of this Warren and Wright were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to join in the assault if circumstances made it advisable I occupied a central position most convenient for receiving information from all points Hancock put Barlow on his left in double column and Birney to his right Mott followed Birney and Gibbon was held in reserve The morning of the twelfth opened foggy delaying the start more than half an hour The ground over which Hancock had to pass to reach the enemy was ascending and heavily wooded to within two or three hundred yards of the enemy s intrenchments In front of Birney there was also a marsh to cross But notwithstanding all these difficulties the troops pushed on in quick time without firing a gun and when within four or five hundred yards of the enemy s line broke out in loud cheers and with a rush went up to and over the breastworks Barlow and Birney entered almost simultaneously Here a desperate hand to hand conflict took place The men of the two sides were too close together to fire but used their guns as clubs The hand conflict was soon over Hancock s corps captured some four thousand prisoners among them a division and a brigade commander twenty or more guns with their horses caissons and ammunition several thousand stand of arms and many colors Hancock as soon as the hand to hand conflict was over turned the guns of the enemy against him and advanced inside the rebel lines About six o clock I ordered Warren s corps to the support of Hancock s Burnside on the left had advanced up east of the salient to the very parapet of the enemy Potter commanding one of his divisions got over but was not able to remain there However he inflicted a heavy loss upon the enemy but not without loss in return This victory was important and one that Lee could not afford to leave us in full possession of He made the most strenuous efforts to regain the position he had lost Troops were brought up from his left and attacked Hancock furiously Hancock was forced to fall back but he did so slowly with his face to the enemy inflicting on him heavy loss until behind the breastworks he had captured These he turned facing them the other way and continued to hold Wright was ordered up to reinforce Hancock and arrived by six o clock He was wounded soon after coming up but did not relinquish the command of his corps although the fighting lasted until one o clock the next morning At eight o clock Warren was ordered up again but was so slow in making his dispositions that his orders were frequently repeated and with emphasis At eleven o clock I gave Meade written orders to relieve Warren from his command if he failed to move promptly Hancock placed batteries on high ground in his rear which he used against the enemy firing over the heads of his own troops Burnside accomplished but little on our left of a positive nature but negatively a great deal He kept Lee from reinforcing his centre from that quarter If the fifth corps or rather if Warren had been as prompt as Wright was with the sixth corps better results might have been obtained Lee massed heavily from his left flank on the broken point of his line Five times during the day he assaulted furiously but without dislodging our troops from their new position His losses must have been fearful Sometimes the belligerents would be separated by but a few feet In one place a tree eighteen inches in diameter was cut entirely down by musket balls All the trees between the lines were very much cut to pieces by artillery and musketry It was three o clock next morning before the fighting ceased Some of our troops had then been twenty hours under fire In this engagement we did not lose a single organization not even a company The enemy lost one division with its commander one brigade and one regiment with heavy losses elsewhere thirty Our losses were heavy but as stated no whole company was captured At night Lee took a position in rear of his former one and by the following morning he was strongly intrenched in it Warren s corps was now temporarily broken up Cutler s division sent to Wright and Griffin s to Hancock Meade ordered his chief of staff General Humphreys to remain with Warren and the remaining division and authorized him to give it orders in his name During the day I was passing along the line from wing to wing continuously About the centre stood a house which proved to be occupied by an old lady and her daughter She showed such unmistakable signs of being strongly Union that I stopped She said she had not seen a Union flag for so long a time that it did her heart good to look upon it again She said her husband and son being Union men had had to leave early in the war and were now somewhere in the Union army if alive She was without food or nearly so so I ordered rations issued to her and promised to find out if I could where the husband and son were There was no fighting on the thirteenth further than a little skirmishing between Mott s division and the enemy I was afraid that Lee might be moving out and I did not want him to go without my knowing it The indications were that he was moving but it was found that he was only taking his new position back from the salient that had been captured Our dead were buried this day Mott s division was reduced to a brigade and assigned to Birney s division During this day I wrote to Washington recommending Sherman and Meade thirty one for promotion to the grade of Major General in the regular army Hancock for Brigadier General Wright Gibbon and Humphreys to be Major Generals of Volunteers and Upton and Carroll to be Brigadiers Upton had already been named as such but the appointment had to be confirmed by the Senate on the nomination of the President The night of the thirteenth Warren and Wright were moved by the rear to the left of Burnside The night was very dark and it rained heavily the roads were so bad that the troops had to cut trees and corduroy the road a part of the way to get through It was midnight before they got to the point where they were to halt and daylight before the troops could be organized to advance to their position in line They gained their position in line however without any fighting except a little in Wright s front Here Upton had to contend for an elevation which we wanted and which the enemy was not disposed to yield Upton first drove the enemy and was then repulsed in turn Ayres coming to his support with his brigade of Griffin s division Warren s corps the position was secured and fortified There was no more battle during the fourteenth This brought our line east of the Court House and running north and south and facing west During the night of the fourteenth fifteenth Lee moved to cover this new front This left Hancock without an enemy confronting him He was brought to the rear of our new centre ready to be moved in any direction he might be wanted On the fifteenth news came from Butler and Averill The former reported the capture of the outer works at Drury s Bluff on the James River and that his cavalry had cut the railroad and telegraph south of Richmond on the Danville road and the latter the destruction of a depot of supplies at Dublin West Virginia and the breaking of New River Bridge on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad The next day news came from Sherman and Sheridan Sherman had forced Johnston out of Dalton Georgia and was following him south The report from Sheridan embraced his operations up to his passing the outer defences of Richmond The prospect must now have been dismal in Richmond The road and telegraph were cut between the capital and Lee The roads and wires were cut in every direction from the rebel capital Temporarily that city was cut off from all communication with the outside except by courier This condition of affairs however was of but short duration I wrote Halleck NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C H May sixteen eighteen sixty four eight A M MAJOR GENERAL HALLECK Washington D C We have had five days almost constant rain without any prospect yet of it clearing up The roads have now become so impassable that ambulances with wounded men can no longer run between here and Fredericksburg All offensive operations necessarily cease until we can have twenty four hours of dry weather The army is in the best of spirits and feel the greatest confidence of ultimate success You can assure the President and Secretary of War that the elements alone have suspended hostilities and that it is in no manner due to weakness or exhaustion on our part U S GRANT Lieut General The condition of the roads was such that nothing was done on the seventeenth But that night Hancock and Wright were to make a night march back to their old positions and to make an assault at four o clock in the morning Lee got troops back in time to protect his old line so the assault was unsuccessful On this day eighteenth the news was almost as discouraging to us as it had been two days before in the rebel capital As stated above Hancock s and Wright s corps had made an unsuccessful assault News came that Sigel had been defeated at New Market badly and was retreating down the valley Not two hours before I had sent the inquiry to Halleck whether Sigel could not get to Staunton to stop supplies coming from there to Lee I asked at once that Sigel might be relieved and some one else put in his place Hunter s name was suggested and I heartily approved Further news from Butler reported him driven from Drury s Bluff but still in possession of the Petersburg road Banks had been defeated in Louisiana relieved and Canby put in his place This change of commander was not on my suggestion All this news was very discouraging All of it must have been known by the enemy before it was by me In fact the good news for the enemy must have been known to him at the moment I thought he was in despair and his anguish had been already relieved when we were enjoying his supposed discomfiture But this was no time for repining I immediately gave orders for a movement by the left flank on towards Richmond to commence on the night of the nineteenth I also asked Halleck to secure the cooperation of the navy in changing our base of supplies from Fredericksburg to Port Royal on the Rappahannock Up to this time I had received no reinforcements except six thousand raw troops under Brigadier General Robert O Tyler just arrived They had not yet joined their command Hancock s corps but were on our right This corps had been brought to the rear of the centre ready to move in any direction Lee probably suspecting some move on my part and seeing our right entirely abandoned moved Ewell s corps about five o clock in the afternoon with Early s as a reserve to attack us in that quarter Tyler had come up from Fredericksburg and had been halted on the road to the right of our line near Kitching s brigade of Warren s corps Tyler received the attack with his raw troops and they maintained their position until reinforced in a manner worthy of veterans Hancock was in a position to reinforce speedily and was the soldier to do it without waiting to make dispositions Birney was thrown to Tyler s right and Crawford to his left with Gibbon as a reserve and Ewell was whirled back speedily and with heavy loss Warren had been ordered to get on Ewell s flank and in his rear to cut him off from his intrenchments But his efforts were so feeble that under the cover of night Ewell got back with only the loss of a few hundred prisoners besides his killed and wounded The army being engaged until after dark I rescinded the order for the march by our left flank that night As soon as it was discovered that the enemy were coming out to attack I naturally supposed they would detach a force to destroy our trains The withdrawal of Hancock from the right uncovered one road from Spottsylvania to Fredericksburg over which trains drew our supplies This was guarded by a division of colored troops commanded by General Ferrero belonging to Burnside s corps Ferrero was therefore promptly notified and ordered to throw his cavalry pickets out to the south and be prepared to meet the enemy if he should come if he had to retreat to do so towards Fredericksburg The enemy did detach as expected and captured twenty five or thirty wagons which however were soon retaken In consequence of the disasters that had befallen us in the past few days Lee could be reinforced largely and I had no doubt he would be Beauregard had come up from the south with troops to guard the Confederate capital when it was in danger Butler being driven back most of the troops could be sent to Lee Hoke was no longer needed in North Carolina and Sigel s troops having gone back to Cedar Creek whipped many troops could be spared from the valley The Wilderness and Spottsylvania battles convinced me that we had more artillery than could ever be brought into action at any one time It occupied much of the road in marching and taxed the trains in bringing up forage Artillery is very useful when it can be brought into action but it is a very burdensome luxury where it cannot be used Before leaving Spottsylvania therefore I sent back to the defences of Washington over one hundred pieces of artillery with the horses and caissons This relieved the roads over which we were to march of more than two hundred six horse teams and still left us more artillery than could be advantageously used In fact before reaching the James River I again reduced the artillery with the army largely I believed that if one corps of the army was exposed on the road to Richmond and at a distance from the main army Lee would endeavor to attack the exposed corps before reinforcements could come up in which case the main army could follow Lee up and attack him before he had time to intrench So I issued the following orders NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C H VA May eighteen eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding Army of the Potomac Before daylight to morrow morning I propose to draw Hancock and Burnside from the position they now hold and put Burnside to the left of Wright Wright and Burnside should then force their way up as close to the enemy as they can get without a general engagement or with a general engagement if the enemy will come out of their works to fight and intrench Hancock should march and take up a position as if in support of the two left corps To morrow night at twelve or one o clock he will be moved south east with all his force and as much cavalry as can be given to him to get as far towards Richmond on the line of the Fredericksburg Railroad as he can make fighting the enemy in whatever force he can find him If the enemy make a general move to meet this they will be followed by the other three corps of the army and attacked if possible before time is given to intrench Suitable directions will at once be given for all trains and surplus artillery to conform to this movement U S GRANT On the twentieth Lee showing no signs of coming out of his lines orders were renewed for a left flank movement to commence after night CHAPTER LIV MOVEMENT BY THE LEFT FLANK BATTLE OF NORTH ANNA AN INCIDENT OF THE MARCH MOVING ON RICHMOND SOUTH OF THE PAMUNKEY POSITION OF THE NATIONAL ARMY We were now to operate in a different country from any we had before seen in Virginia The roads were wide and good and the country well cultivated No men were seen except those bearing arms even the black man having been sent away The country however was new to us and we had neither guides nor maps to tell us where the roads were or where they led to Engineer and staff officers were put to the dangerous duty of supplying the place of both maps and guides By reconnoitring they were enabled to locate the roads in the vicinity of each army corps Our course was south and we took all roads leading in that direction which would not separate the army too widely Hancock who had the lead had marched easterly to Guiney s Station on the Fredericksburg Railroad thence southerly to Bowling Green and Milford He was at Milford by the night of the twenty first Here he met a detachment of Pickett s division coming from Richmond to reinforce Lee They were speedily driven away and several hundred captured Warren followed on the morning of the twenty first and reached Guiney s Station that night without molestation Burnside and Wright were retained at Spottsylvania to keep up the appearance of an intended assault and to hold Lee if possible while Hancock and Warren should get start enough to interpose between him and Richmond Lee had now a superb opportunity to take the initiative either by attacking Wright and Burnside alone or by following by the Telegraph Road and striking Hancock s and Warren s corps or even Hancock s alone before reinforcements could come up But he did not avail himself of either opportunity He seemed really to be misled as to my designs but moved by his interior line the Telegraph Road to make sure of keeping between his capital and the Army of the Potomac He never again had such an opportunity of dealing a heavy blow The evening of the twenty first Burnside ninth corps moved out followed by Wright sixth corps Burnside was to take the Telegraph Road but finding Stanard s Ford over the Po fortified and guarded he turned east to the road taken by Hancock and Warren without an attempt to dislodge the enemy The night of the twenty first I had my headquarters near the sixth corps at Guiney s Station and the enemy s cavalry was between us and Hancock There was a slight attack on Burnside s and Wright s corps as they moved out of their lines but it was easily repulsed The object probably was only to make sure that we were not leaving a force to follow upon the rear of the Confederates By the morning of the twenty twod Burnside and Wright were at Guiney s Station Hancock s corps had now been marching and fighting continuously for several days not having had rest even at night much of the time They were therefore permitted to rest during the twenty twod But Warren was pushed to Harris s Store directly west of Milford and connected with it by a good road and Burnside was sent to New Bethel Church Wright s corps was still back at Guiney s Station I issued the following order for the movement of the troops the next day NEW BETHEL VA May twenty two eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding Army of the Potomac Direct corps commanders to hold their troops in readiness to march at five A M to morrow At that hour each command will send out cavalry and infantry on all roads to their front leading south and ascertain if possible where the enemy is If beyond the South Anna the fifth and sixth corps will march to the forks of the road where one branch leads to Beaver Dam Station the other to Jericho Bridge then south by roads reaching the Anna as near to and east of Hawkins Creek as they can be found The twod corps will move to Chesterfield Ford The ninth corps will be directed to move at the same time to Jericho Bridge The map only shows two roads for the four corps to march upon but no doubt by the use of plantation roads and pressing in guides others can be found to give one for each corps The troops will follow their respective reconnoitring parties The trains will be moved at the same time to Milford Station Headquarters will follow the ninth corps U S GRANT Lieut General Warren s corps was moved from Harris s Store to Jericho Ford Wright s following Warren arrived at the ford early in the afternoon and by five o clock effected a crossing under the protection of sharpshooters The men had to wade in water up to their waists As soon as enough troops were over to guard the ford pontoons were laid and the artillery and the rest of the troops crossed The line formed was almost perpendicular to the course of the river Crawford on the left next to the river Griffin in the centre and Cutler on the right Lee was found intrenched along the front of their line The whole of Hill s corps was sent against Warren s right before it had got in position A brigade of Cutler s division was driven back the enemy following but assistance coming up the enemy was in turn driven back into his trenches with heavy loss in killed and wounded with about five hundred prisoners left in our hands By night Wright s corps was up ready to reinforce Warren On the twenty threed Hancock s corps was moved to the wooden bridge which spans the North Anna River just west of where the Fredericksburg Railroad crosses It was near night when the troops arrived They found the bridge guarded with troops intrenched on the north side Hancock sent two brigades Egan s and Pierce s to the right and left and when properly disposed they charged simultaneously The bridge was carried quickly the enemy retreating over it so hastily that many were shoved into the river and some of them were drowned Several hundred prisoners were captured The hour was so late that Hancock did not cross until next morning Burnside s corps was moved by a middle road running between those described above and which strikes the North Anna at Ox Ford midway between Telegraph Road and Jericho Ford The hour of its arrival was too late to cross that night On the twenty fourth Hancock s corps crossed to the south side of the river without opposition and formed line facing nearly west The railroad in rear was taken possession of and destroyed as far as possible Wright s corps crossed at Jericho early the same day and took position to the right of Warren s corps extending south of the Virginia Central Railroad This road was torn up for a considerable distance to the rear west the ties burned and the rails bent and twisted by heating them over the burning ties It was found however that Burnside s corps could not cross at Ox Ford Lee had taken a position with his centre on the river at this point with the two wings thrown back his line making an acute angle where it overlooked the river Before the exact position of the whole of Lee s line was accurately known I directed Hancock and Warren each to send a brigade to Ox Ford by the south side of the river They found the enemy too strong to justify a serious attack A third ford was found between Ox Ford and Jericho Burnside was directed to cross a division over this ford and to send one division to Hancock Crittenden was crossed by this newly discovered ford and formed up the river to connect with Crawford s left Potter joined Hancock by way of the wooden bridge Crittenden had a severe engagement with some of Hill s corps on his crossing the river and lost heavily When joined to Warren s corps he was no further molested Burnside still guarded Ox Ford from the north side Lee now had his entire army south of the North Anna Our lines covered his front with the six miles separating the two wings guarded by but a single division To get from one wing to the other the river would have to be crossed twice Lee could reinforce any part of his line from all points of it in a very short march or could concentrate the whole of it wherever he might choose to assault We were for the time practically two armies besieging Lee had been reinforced and was being reinforced largely About this time the very troops whose coming I had predicted had arrived or were coming in Pickett with a full division from Richmond was up Hoke from North Carolina had come with a brigade and Breckinridge was there in all probably not less than fifteen thousand men But he did not attempt to drive us from the field On the twenty twod or twenty threed I received dispatches from Washington saying that Sherman had taken Kingston crossed the Etowah River and was advancing into Georgia I was seated at the time on the porch of a fine plantation house waiting for Burnside s corps to pass Meade and his staff besides my own staff were with me The lady of the house a missus Tyler and an elderly lady were present Burnside seeing us came up on the porch his big spurs and saber rattling as he walked He touched his hat politely to the ladies and remarked that he supposed they had never seen so many live Yankees before in their lives The elderly lady spoke up promptly saying Oh yes I have many more Where said Burnside In Richmond Prisoners of course was understood I read my dispatch aloud when it was received This threw the younger lady into tears I found the information she had received and I suppose it was the information generally in circulation through the South was that Lee was driving us from the State in the most demoralized condition and that in the South west our troops were but little better than prisoners of war Seeing our troops moving south was ocular proof that a part of her information was incorrect and she asked me if my news from Sherman was true I assured her that there was no doubt about it I left a guard to protect the house from intrusion until the troops should have all passed and assured her that if her husband was in hiding she could bring him in and he should be protected also But I presume he was in the Confederate army On the twenty fifth I gave orders through Halleck to Hunter who had relieved Sigel to move up the Valley of Virginia cross over the Blue Ridge to Charlottesville and go as far as Lynchburg if possible living upon the country and cutting the railroads and canal as he went After doing this he could find his way back to his base or join me On the same day news was received that Lee was falling back on Richmond This proved not to be true But we could do nothing where we were unless Lee would assume the offensive I determined therefore to draw out of our present position and make one more effort to get between him and Richmond I had no expectation now however of succeeding in this but I did expect to hold him far enough west to enable me to reach the James River high up Sheridan was now again with the Army of the Potomac On the twenty sixth I informed the government at Washington of the position of the two armies of the reinforcements the enemy had received of the move I proposed to make thirty two and directed that our base of supplies should be shifted to White House on the Pamunkey The wagon train and guards moved directly from Port Royal to White House Supplies moved around by water guarded by the navy Orders had previously been sent through Halleck for Butler to send Smith s corps to White House This order was repeated on the twenty fifth with directions that they should be landed on the north side of the Pamunkey and marched until they joined the Army of the Potomac It was a delicate move to get the right wing of the Army of the Potomac from its position south of the North Anna in the presence of the enemy To accomplish it I issued the following order QUARLES MILLS VA May twenty five eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding A P Direct Generals Warren and Wright to withdraw all their teams and artillery not in position to the north side of the river to morrow Send that belonging to General Wright s corps as far on the road to Hanover Town as it can go without attracting attention to the fact Send with it Wright s best division or division under his ablest commander Have their places filled up in the line so if possible the enemy will not notice their withdrawal Send the cavalry to morrow afternoon or as much of it as you may deem necessary to watch and seize if they can Littlepage s Bridge and Taylor s Ford and to remain on one or other side of the river at these points until the infantry and artillery all pass As soon as it is dark to morrow night start the division which you withdraw first from Wright s corps to make a forced march to Hanover Town taking with them no teams to impede their march At the same time this division starts commence withdrawing all of the fifth and sixth corps from the south side of the river and march them for the same place The two divisions of the ninth corps not now with Hancock may be moved down the north bank of the river where they will be handy to support Hancock if necessary or will be that much on their road to follow the fifth and sixth corps Hancock should hold his command in readiness to follow as soon as the way is clear for him To morrow it will leave nothing for him to do but as soon as he can he should get all his teams and spare artillery on the road or roads which he will have to take As soon as the troops reach Hanover Town they should get possession of all the crossings they can in that neighborhood I think it would be well to make a heavy cavalry demonstration on the enemy s left to morrow afternoon also U S GRANT Lieut General Wilson s division of cavalry was brought up from the left and moved by our right south to Little River Here he manoeuvred to give the impression that we were going to attack the left flank of Lee s army Under cover of night our right wing was withdrawn to the north side of the river Lee being completely deceived by Wilson s feint On the afternoon of the twenty sixth Sheridan moved sending Gregg s and Torbert s cavalry to Taylor s and Littlepage s fords towards Hanover As soon as it was dark both divisions moved quietly to Hanover Ferry leaving small guards behind to keep up the impression that crossings were to be attempted in the morning Sheridan was followed by a division of infantry under General Russell On the morning of the twenty seventh the crossing was effected with but little loss the enemy losing thirty or forty taken prisoners Thus a position was secured south of the Pamunkey Russell stopped at the crossing while the cavalry pushed on to Hanover Town Here Barringer s formerly Gordon s brigade of rebel cavalry was encountered but it was speedily driven away Warren s and Wright s corps were moved by the rear of Burnside s and Hancock s corps When out of the way these latter corps followed leaving pickets confronting the enemy Wilson s cavalry followed last watching all the fords until everything had recrossed then taking up the pontoons and destroying other bridges became the rear guard Two roads were traversed by the troops in this move The one nearest to and north of the North Anna and Pamunkey was taken by Wright followed by Hancock Warren followed by Burnside moved by a road farther north and longer The trains moved by a road still farther north and had to travel a still greater distance All the troops that had crossed the Pamunkey on the morning of the twenty seventh remained quiet during the rest of the day while the troops north of that stream marched to reach the crossing that had been secured for them Lee had evidently been deceived by our movement from North Anna for on the morning of the twenty seventh he telegraphed to Richmond Enemy crossed to north side and cavalry and infantry crossed at Hanover Town The troops that had then crossed left his front the night of the twenty fifth The country we were now in was a difficult one to move troops over The streams were numerous deep and sluggish sometimes spreading out into swamps grown up with impenetrable growths of trees and underbrush The banks were generally low and marshy making the streams difficult to approach except where there were roads and bridges Hanover Town is about twenty miles from Richmond There are two roads leading there the most direct and shortest one crossing the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge near the Virginia Central Railroad the second going by New and Old Cold Harbor A few miles out from Hanover Town there is a third road by way of Mechanicsville to Richmond New Cold Harbor was important to us because while there we both covered the roads back to White House where our supplies came from and the roads south east over which we would have to pass to get to the James River below the Richmond defences On the morning of the twenty eighth the army made an early start and by noon all had crossed except Burnside s corps This was left on the north side temporarily to guard the large wagon train A line was at once formed extending south from the river Wright s corps on the right Hancock s in the centre and Warren s on the left ready to meet the enemy if he should come At the same time Sheridan was directed to reconnoitre towards Mechanicsville to find Lee s position At Hawes Shop just where the middle road leaves the direct road to Richmond he encountered the Confederate cavalry dismounted and partially intrenched Gregg attacked with his division but was unable to move the enemy In the evening Custer came up with a brigade The attack was now renewed the cavalry dismounting and charging as infantry This time the assault was successful both sides losing a considerable number of men But our troops had to bury the dead and found that more Confederate than Union soldiers had been killed The position was easily held because our infantry was near On the twenty ninth a reconnoissance was made in force to find the position of Lee Wright s corps pushed to Hanover Court House Hancock s corps pushed toward Totopotomoy Creek Warren s corps to the left on the Shady Grove Church Road while Burnside was held in reserve Our advance was pushed forward three miles on the left with but little fighting There was now an appearance of a movement past our left flank and Sheridan was sent to meet it On the thirtieth Hancock moved to the Totopotomoy where he found the enemy strongly fortified Wright was moved to the right of Hancock s corps and Burnside was brought forward and crossed taking position to the left of Hancock Warren moved up near Huntley Corners on the Shady Grove Church Road There was some skirmishing along the centre and in the evening Early attacked Warren with some vigor driving him back at first and threatening to turn our left flank As the best means of reinforcing the left Hancock was ordered to attack in his front He carried and held the rifle pits While this was going on Warren got his men up repulsed Early and drove him more than a mile On this day I wrote to Halleck ordering all the pontoons in Washington to be sent to City Point In the evening news was received of the arrival of Smith with his corps at White House I notified Meade in writing as follows NEAR HAWES SHOP VA six point forty P M May thirty eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding A P General Smith will debark his force at the White House tonight and start up the south bank of the Pamunkey at an early hour probably at three A M in the morning It is not improbable that the enemy being aware of Smith s movement will be feeling to get on our left flank for the purpose of cutting him off or by a dash to crush him and get back before we are aware of it Sheridan ought to be notified to watch the enemy s movements well out towards Cold Harbor and also on the Mechanicsville road Wright should be got well massed on Hancock s right so that if it becomes necessary he can take the place of the latter readily whilst troops are being thrown east of the Totopotomoy if necessary I want Sheridan to send a cavalry force of at least half a brigade if not a whole brigade at five A M in the morning to communicate with Smith and to return with him I will send orders for Smith by the messenger you send to Sheridan with his orders U S GRANT I also notified Smith of his danger and the precautions that would be taken to protect him The night of the thirtieth Lee s position was substantially from Atlee s Station on the Virginia Central Railroad south and east to the vicinity of Cold Harbor Ours was The left of Warren s corps was on the Shady Grove Road extending to the Mechanicsville Road and about three miles south of the Totopotomoy Burnside to his right then Hancock and Wright on the extreme right extending towards Hanover Court House six miles south east of it Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry was watching our left front towards Cold Harbor Wilson with his division on our right was sent to get on the Virginia Central Railroad and destroy it as far back as possible He got possession of Hanover Court House the next day after a skirmish with Young s cavalry brigade The enemy attacked Sheridan s pickets but reinforcements were sent up and the attack was speedily repulsed and the enemy followed some distance towards Cold Harbor CHAPTER LV ADVANCE ON COLD HARBOR AN ANECDOTE OF THE WAR BATTLE OF COLD HARBOR CORRESPONDENCE WITH LEE RETROSPECTIVE On the thirty first Sheridan advanced to near Old Cold Harbor He found it intrenched and occupied by cavalry and infantry A hard fight ensued but the place was carried The enemy well knew the importance of Cold Harbor to us and seemed determined that we should not hold it He returned with such a large force that Sheridan was about withdrawing without making any effort to hold it against such odds but about the time he commenced the evacuation he received orders to hold the place at all hazards until reinforcements could be sent to him He speedily turned the rebel works to face against them and placed his men in position for defence Night came on before the enemy was ready for assault Wright s corps was ordered early in the evening to march directly to Cold Harbor passing by the rear of the army It was expected to arrive by daylight or before but the night was dark and the distance great so that it was nine o clock the first of June before it reached its destination Before the arrival of Wright the enemy had made two assaults on Sheridan both of which were repulsed with heavy loss to the enemy Wright s corps coming up there was no further assault on Cold Harbor Smith who was coming up from White House was also directed to march directly to Cold Harbor and was expected early on the morning of the first of June but by some blunder the order which reached Smith directed him to Newcastle instead of Cold Harbor Through this blunder Smith did not reach his destination until three o clock in the afternoon and then with tired and worn out men from their long and dusty march He landed twelve thousand five hundred men from Butler s command but a division was left at White House temporarily and many men had fallen out of ranks in their long march Before the removal of Wright s corps from our right after dark on the thirty first the two lines Federal and Confederate were so close together at that point that either side could detect directly any movement made by the other Finding at daylight that Wright had left his front Lee evidently divined that he had gone to our left At all events soon after light on the first of June Anderson who commanded the corps on Lee s left was seen moving along Warren s front Warren was ordered to attack him vigorously in flank while Wright was directed to move out and get on his front Warren fired his artillery at the enemy but lost so much time in making ready that the enemy got by and at three o clock he reported the enemy was strongly intrenched in his front and besides his lines were so long that he had no mass of troops to move with He seemed to have forgotten that lines in rear of an army hold themselves while their defenders are fighting in their front Wright reconnoitred some distance to his front but the enemy finding Old Cold Harbor already taken had halted and fortified some distance west By six o clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith were ready to make an assault In front of both the ground was clear for several hundred yards and then became wooded Both charged across this open space and into the wood capturing and holding the first line of rifle pits of the enemy and also capturing seven or eight hundred prisoners While this was going on the enemy charged Warren three separate times with vigor but were repulsed each time with loss There was no officer more capable nor one more prompt in acting than Warren when the enemy forced him to it There was also an attack upon Hancock s and Burnside s corps at the same time but it was feeble and probably only intended to relieve Anderson who was being pressed by Wright and Smith During the night the enemy made frequent attacks with the view of dispossessing us of the important position we had gained but without effecting their object Hancock was moved from his place in line during the night and ordered to the left of Wright I expected to take the offensive on the morning of the twod but the night was so dark the heat and dust so excessive and the roads so intricate and hard to keep that the head of column only reached Old Cold Harbor at six o clock but was in position at seven point thirty A M Preparations were made for an attack in the afternoon but did not take place until the next morning Warren s corps was moved to the left to connect with Smith Hancock s corps was got into position to the left of Wright s and Burnside was moved to Bethesda Church in reserve While Warren and Burnside were making these changes the enemy came out several times and attacked them capturing several hundred prisoners The attacks were repulsed but not followed up as they should have been I was so annoyed at this that I directed Meade to instruct his corps commanders that they should seize all such opportunities when they occurred and not wait for orders all of our manoeuvres being made for the very purpose of getting the enemy out of his cover On this day Wilson returned from his raid upon the Virginia Central Railroad having damaged it considerably But like ourselves the rebels had become experts in repairing such damage Sherman in his memoirs relates an anecdote of his campaign to Atlanta that well illustrates this point The rebel cavalry lurking in his rear to burn bridges and obstruct his communications had become so disgusted at hearing trains go whistling by within a few hours after a bridge had been burned that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels One of them said No use boys Old Sherman carries duplicate tunnels with him and will replace them as fast as you can blow them up better save your powder Sheridan was engaged reconnoitring the banks of the Chickahominy to find crossings and the condition of the roads He reported favorably During the night Lee moved his left up to make his line correspond to ours His lines extended now from the Totopotomoy to New Cold Harbor Mine from Bethesda Church by Old Cold Harbor to the Chickahominy with a division of cavalry guarding our right An assault was ordered for the threed to be made mainly by the corps of Hancock Wright and Smith but Warren and Burnside were to support it by threatening Lee s left and to attack with great earnestness if he should either reinforce more threatened points by drawing from that quarter or if a favorable opportunity should present itself The corps commanders were to select the points in their respective fronts where they would make their assaults The move was to commence at half past four in the morning Hancock sent Barlow and Gibbon forward at the appointed hour with Birney as a reserve Barlow pushed forward with great vigor under a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry through thickets and swamps Notwithstanding all the resistance of the enemy and the natural obstructions to overcome he carried a position occupied by the enemy outside their main line where the road makes a deep cut through a bank affording as good a shelter for troops as if it had been made for that purpose Three pieces of artillery had been captured here and several hundred prisoners The guns were immediately turned against the men who had just been using them No thirty three assistance coming to him he Barlow intrenched under fire and continued to hold his place Gibbon was not so fortunate in his front He found the ground over which he had to pass cut up with deep ravines and a morass difficult to cross But his men struggled on until some of them got up to the very parapet covering the enemy Gibbon gained ground much nearer the enemy than that which he left and here he intrenched and held fast Wright s corps moving in two lines captured the outer rifle pits in their front but accomplished nothing more Smith s corps also gained the outer rifle pits in its front The ground over which this corps eighteenth had to move was the most exposed of any over which charges were made An open plain intervened between the contending forces at this point which was exposed both to a direct and a cross fire Smith however finding a ravine running towards his front sufficiently deep to protect men in it from cross fire and somewhat from a direct fire put Martindale s division in it and with Brooks supporting him on the left and Devens on the right succeeded in gaining the outer probably picket rifle pits Warren and Burnside also advanced and gained ground which brought the whole army on one line This assault cost us heavily and probably without benefit to compensate but the enemy was not cheered by the occurrence sufficiently to induce him to take the offensive In fact nowhere after the battle of the Wilderness did Lee show any disposition to leave his defences far behind him Fighting was substantially over by half past seven in the morning At eleven o clock I started to visit all the corps commanders to see for myself the different positions gained and to get their opinion of the practicability of doing anything more in their respective fronts Hancock gave the opinion that in his front the enemy was too strong to make any further assault promise success Wright thought he could gain the lines of the enemy but it would require the cooperation of Hancock s and Smith s corps Smith thought a lodgment possible but was not sanguine Burnside thought something could be done in his front but Warren differed I concluded therefore to make no more assaults and a little after twelve directed in the following letter that all offensive action should cease COLD HARBOR June three eighteen sixty four twelve point thirty P M MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding A P The opinion of corps commanders not being sanguine of success in case an assault is ordered you may direct a suspension of farther advance for the present Hold our most advanced positions and strengthen them Whilst on the defensive our line may be contracted from the right if practicable Reconnoissances should be made in front of every corps and advances made to advantageous positions by regular approaches To aid the expedition under General Hunter it is necessary that we should detain all the army now with Lee until the former gets well on his way to Lynchburg To do this effectually it will be better to keep the enemy out of the intrenchments of Richmond than to have them go back there Wright and Hancock should be ready to assault in case the enemy should break through General Smith s lines and all should be ready to resist an assault U S GRANT Lieutenant General The remainder of the day was spent in strengthening the line we now held By night we were as strong against Lee as he was against us During the night the enemy quitted our right front abandoning some of their wounded and without burying their dead These we were able to care for But there were many dead and wounded men between the lines of the contending forces which were now close together who could not be cared for without a cessation of hostilities So I wrote the following COLD HARBOR VA June five eighteen sixty four GENERAL R E LEE Commanding Confederate Army It is reported to me that there are wounded men probably of both armies now lying exposed and suffering between the lines occupied respectively by the two armies Humanity would dictate that some provision should be made to provide against such hardships I would propose therefore that hereafter when no battle is raging either party be authorized to send to any point between the pickets or skirmish lines unarmed men bearing litters to pick up their dead or wounded without being fired upon by the other party Any other method equally fair to both parties you may propose for meeting the end desired will be accepted by me U S GRANT Lieut General Lee replied that he feared such an arrangement would lead to misunderstanding and proposed that in future when either party wished to remove their dead and wounded a flag of truce be sent I answered this immediately by saying COLD HARBOR VA June six eighteen sixty four GENERAL R E LEE Commanding Army of N Va Your communication of yesterday s date is received I will send immediately as you propose to collect the dead and wounded between the lines of the two armies and will also instruct that you be allowed to do the same I propose that the time for doing this be between the hours of twelve M and three P M to day I will direct all parties going out to bear a white flag and not to attempt to go beyond where we have dead or wounded and not beyond or on ground occupied by your troops U S GRANT Lieut General Lee s response was that he could not consent to the burial of the dead and removal of the wounded in the way I proposed but when either party desired such permission it should be asked for by flag of truce and he had directed that any parties I may have sent out as mentioned in my letter to be turned back I answered COLD HARBOR VA June six eighteen sixty four GENERAL R E LEE Commanding Army N Va The knowledge that wounded men are now suffering from want of attention between the two armies compels me to ask a suspension of hostilities for sufficient time to collect them in say two hours Permit me to say that the hours you may fix upon for this will be agreeable to me and the same privilege will be extended to such parties as you may wish to send out on the same duty without further application U S GRANT Lieut General Lee acceded to this but delays in transmitting the correspondence brought it to the seventh of June forty eight hours after it commenced before parties were got out to collect the men left upon the field In the meantime all but two of the wounded had died And I wrote to Lee COLD HARBOR VA June seven eighteen sixty four ten point thirty A M general R E LEE Commanding Army of N Va I regret that your note of seven P M yesterday should have been received at the nearest corps headquarters to where it was delivered after the hour which had been given for the removal of the dead and wounded had expired ten point forty five P M was the hour at which it was received at corps headquarters and between eleven and twelve it reached my headquarters As a consequence it was not understood by the troops of this army that there was a cessation of hostilities for the purpose of collecting the dead and wounded and none were collected Two officers and six men of the eighth and twenty fifth North Carolina Regts who were out in search of the bodies of officers of their respective regiments were captured and brought into our lines owing to this want of understanding I regret this but will state that as soon as I learned the fact I directed that they should not be held as prisoners but must be returned to their commands These officers and men having been carelessly brought through our lines to the rear have not determined whether they will be sent back the way they came or whether they will be sent by some other route Regretting that all my efforts for alleviating the sufferings of wounded men left upon the battle field have been rendered nugatory I remain c U S GRANT Lieutenant General I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made I might say the same thing of the assault of the twenty twod of May eighteen sixty three at Vicksburg At Cold Harbor no advantage whatever was gained to compensate for the heavy loss we sustained Indeed the advantages other than those of relative losses were on the Confederate side Before that the Army of Northern Virginia seemed to have acquired a wholesome regard for the courage endurance and soldierly qualities generally of the Army of the Potomac They no longer wanted to fight them one Confederate to five Yanks Indeed they seemed to have given up any idea of gaining any advantage of their antagonist in the open field They had come to much prefer breastworks in their front to the Army of the Potomac This charge seemed to revive their hopes temporarily but it was of short duration The effect upon the Army of the Potomac was the reverse When we reached the James River however all effects of the battle of Cold Harbor seemed to have disappeared There was more justification for the assault at Vicksburg We were in a Southern climate at the beginning of the hot season The Army of the Tennessee had won five successive victories over the garrison of Vicksburg in the three preceding weeks They had driven a portion of that army from Port Gibson with considerable loss after having flanked them out of their stronghold at Grand Gulf They had attacked another portion of the same army at Raymond more than fifty miles farther in the interior of the State and driven them back into Jackson with great loss in killed wounded captured and missing besides loss of large and small arms they had captured the capital of the State of Mississippi with a large amount of materials of war and manufactures Only a few days before they had beaten the enemy then penned up in the town first at Champion s Hill next at Big Black River Bridge inflicting upon him a loss of fifteen thousand or more men including those cut off from returning besides large losses in arms and ammunition The Army of the Tennessee had come to believe that they could beat their antagonist under any circumstances There was no telling how long a regular siege might last As I have stated it was the beginning of the hot season in a Southern climate There was no telling what the casualties might be among Northern troops working and living in trenches drinking surface water filtered through rich vegetation under a tropical sun If Vicksburg could have been carried in May it would not only have saved the army the risk it ran of a greater danger than from the bullets of the enemy but it would have given us a splendid army well equipped and officered to operate elsewhere with These are reasons justifying the assault The only benefit we gained and it was a slight one for so great a sacrifice was that the men worked cheerfully in the trenches after that being satisfied with digging the enemy out Had the assault not been made I have no doubt that the majority of those engaged in the siege of Vicksburg would have believed that had we assaulted it would have proven successful and would have saved life health and comfort CHAPTER LVI LEFT FLANK MOVEMENT ACROSS THE CHICKAHOMINY AND JAMES GENERAL LEE VISIT TO BUTLER THE MOVEMENT ON PETERSBURG THE INVESTMENT OF PETERSBURG Lee s position was now so near Richmond and the intervening swamps of the Chickahominy so great an obstacle to the movement of troops in the face of an enemy that I determined to make my next left flank move carry the Army of the Potomac south of the James River thirty four Preparations for this were promptly commenced The move was a hazardous one to make the Chickahominy River with its marshy and heavily timbered approaches had to be crossed all the bridges over it east of Lee were destroyed the enemy had a shorter line and better roads to travel on to confront me in crossing more than fifty miles intervened between me and Butler by the roads I should have to travel with both the James and the Chickahominy unbridged to cross and last the Army of the Potomac had to be got out of a position but a few hundred yards from the enemy at the widest place Lee if he did not choose to follow me might with his shorter distance to travel and his bridges over the Chickahominy and the James move rapidly on Butler and crush him before the army with me could come to his relief Then too he might spare troops enough to send against Hunter who was approaching Lynchburg living upon the country he passed through and without ammunition further than what he carried with him But the move had to be made and I relied upon Lee s not seeing my danger as I saw it Besides we had armies on both sides of the James River and not far from the Confederate capital I knew that its safety would be a matter of the first consideration with the executive legislative and judicial branches of the so called Confederate government if it was not with the military commanders But I took all the precaution I knew of to guard against all dangers Sheridan was sent with two divisions to communicate with Hunter and to break up the Virginia Central Railroad and the James River Canal on the seventh of June taking instructions to Hunter to come back with him thirty five Hunter was also informed by way of Washington and the Valley that Sheridan was on the way to meet him The canal and Central Road and the regions penetrated by them were of vast importance to the enemy furnishing and carrying a large per cent of all the supplies for the Army of Northern Virginia and the people of Richmond Before Sheridan got off on the seventh news was received from Hunter reporting his advance to Staunton and successful engagement with the enemy near that place on the fifth in which the Confederate commander W S Jones was killed On the fourth of June the enemy having withdrawn his left corps Burnside on our right was moved up between Warren and Smith On the fifth Birney returned to Hancock which extended his left now to the Chickahominy and Warren was withdrawn to Cold Harbor Wright was directed to send two divisions to the left to extend down the banks of that stream to Bottom s Bridge The cavalry extended still farther east to Jones s Bridge On the seventh Abercrombie who was in command at White House and who had been in command at our base of supplies in all the changes made from the start was ordered to take up the iron from the York River Railroad and put it on boats and to be in readiness to move by water to City Point On the eighth Meade was directed to fortify a line down the bank overlooking the Chickahominy under cover of which the army could move On the ninth Abercrombie was directed to send all organized troops arriving at White House without debarking from their transports to report to Butler Halleck was at this time instructed to send all reinforcements to City Point On the eleventh I wrote COLD HARBOR VA June eleven eighteen sixty four MAJOR general B F BUTLER Commanding Department of Va and N C The movement to transfer this army to the south side of the James River will commence after dark to morrow night colonel Comstock of my staff was sent specially to ascertain what was necessary to make your position secure in the interval during which the enemy might use most of his force against you and also to ascertain what point on the river we should reach to effect a crossing if it should not be practicable to reach this side of the river at Bermuda Hundred Colonel Comstock has not yet returned so that I cannot make instructions as definite as I would wish but the time between this and Sunday night being so short in which to get word to you I must do the best I can Colonel Dent goes to the Chickahominy to take to you the eighteenth corps The corps will leave its position in the trenches as early in the evening tomorrow as possible and make a forced march to Cole s Landing or Ferry where it should reach by ten A M the following morning This corps numbers now fifteen thousand three hundred men They take with them neither wagons nor artillery these latter marching with the balance of the army to the James River The remainder of the army will cross the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and at Jones s and strike the river at the most practicable crossing below City Point I directed several days ago that all reinforcements for the army should be sent to you I am not advised of the number that may have gone but suppose you have received from six to ten thousand General Smith will also reach you as soon as the enemy could going by the way of Richmond The balance of the force will not be more than one day behind unless detained by the whole of Lee s army in which case you will be strong enough I wish you would direct the proper staff officers your chief engineer and your chief quartermaster to commence at once the collection of all the means in their reach for crossing the army on its arrival If there is a point below City Point where a pontoon bridge can be thrown have it laid Expecting the arrival of the eighteenth corps by Monday night if you deem it practicable from the force you have to seize and hold Petersburg you may prepare to start on the arrival of troops to hold your present lines I do not want Petersburg visited however unless it is held nor an attempt to take it unless you feel a reasonable degree of confidence of success If you should go there I think troops should take nothing with them except what they can carry depending upon supplies being sent after the place is secured If Colonel Dent should not succeed in securing the requisite amount of transportation for the eighteenth corps before reaching you please have the balance supplied U S GRANT Lieut General P S On reflection I will send the eighteenth corps by way of White House The distance which they will have to march will be enough shorter to enable them to reach you about the same time and the uncertainty of navigation on the Chickahominy will be avoided U S GRANT COLD HARBOR VA June one hundred eleven thousand eight hundred sixty four MAJOR GENERAL G G MEADE Commanding Army of the Potomac Colonel Comstock who visited the James River for the purpose of ascertaining the best point below Bermuda Hundred to which to march the army has not yet returned It is now getting so late however that all preparations may be made for the move to morrow night without waiting longer The movement will be made as heretofore agreed upon that is the eighteenth corps make a rapid march with the infantry alone their wagons and artillery accompanying the balance of the army to Cole s Landing or Ferry and there embark for City Point losing no time for rest until they reach the latter point The fifth corps will seize Long Bridge and move out on the Long Bridge Road to its junction with Quaker Road or until stopped by the enemy The other three corps will follow in such order as you may direct one of them crossing at Long Bridge and two at Jones s Bridge After the crossing is effected the most practicable roads will be taken to reach about Fort Powhattan Of course this is supposing the enemy makes no opposition to our advance The fifth corps after securing the passage of the balance of the army will join or follow in rear of the corps which crosses the same bridge with themselves The wagon trains should be kept well east of the troops and if a crossing can be found or made lower down than Jones s they should take it U S GRANT Lieut General P S In view of the long march to reach Cole s Landing and the uncertainty of being able to embark a large number of men there the direction of the eighteenth corps may be changed to White House They should be directed to load up transports and start them as fast as loaded without waiting for the whole corps or even whole divisions to go together U S GRANT About this time word was received through the Richmond papers of the eleventh that Crook and Averell had united and were moving east This with the news of Hunter s successful engagement near Staunton was no doubt known to Lee before it was to me Then Sheridan leaving with two divisions of cavalry looked indeed threatening both to Lee s communications and supplies Much of his cavalry was sent after Sheridan and Early with Ewell s entire corps was sent to the Valley Supplies were growing scarce in Richmond and the sources from which to draw them were in our hands People from outside began to pour into Richmond to help eat up the little on hand Consternation reigned there On the twelfth Smith was ordered to move at night to White House not to stop until he reached there and to take boats at once for City Point leaving his trains and artillery to move by land Soon after dark some of the cavalry at Long Bridge effected a crossing by wading and floundering through the water and mud leaving their horses behind and drove away the cavalry pickets A pontoon bridge was speedily thrown across over which the remainder of the army soon passed and pushed out for a mile or two to watch and detain any advance that might be made from the other side Warren followed the cavalry and by the morning of the thirteenth had his whole corps over Hancock followed Warren Burnside took the road to Jones s Bridge followed by Wright Ferrero s division with the wagon train moved farther east by Window Shades and Cole s Ferry our rear being covered by cavalry It was known that the enemy had some gunboats at Richmond These might run down at night and inflict great damage upon us before they could be sunk or captured by our navy General Butler had in advance loaded some vessels with stone ready to be sunk so as to obstruct the channel in an emergency On the thirteenth I sent orders to have these sunk as high up the river as we could guard them and prevent their removal by the enemy As soon as Warren s corps was over the Chickahominy it marched out and joined the cavalry in holding the roads from Richmond while the army passed No attempt was made by the enemy to impede our march however but Warren and Wilson reported the enemy strongly fortified in their front By the evening of the thirteenth Hancock s corps was at Charles City Court House on the James River Burnside s and Wright s corps were on the Chickahominy and crossed during the night Warren s corps and the cavalry still covering the army The material for a pontoon bridge was already at hand and the work of laying it was commenced immediately under the superintendence of Brigadier General Benham commanding the engineer brigade On the evening of the fourteenth the crossing commenced Hancock in advance using both the bridge and boats When the Wilderness campaign commenced the Army of the Potomac including Burnside s which was a separate command until the twenty fourth of May when it was incorporated with the main army numbered about one hundred sixteen thousand men During the progress of the campaign about forty thousand reinforcements were received At the crossing of the James River June fourteenth fifteenth the army numbered about one hundred fifteen thousand Besides the ordinary losses incident to a campaign of six weeks nearly constant fighting or skirmishing about one half of the artillery was sent back to Washington and many men were discharged by reason of the expiration of their term of service In estimating our strength every enlisted man and every commissioned officer present is included no matter how employed in bands sick in field hospitals hospital attendants company cooks and all Operating in an enemy s country and being supplied always from a distant base large detachments had at all times to be sent from the front not only to guard the base of supplies and the roads to it but all the roads leading to our flanks and rear We were also operating in a country unknown to us and without competent guides or maps showing the roads accurately The manner of estimating numbers in the two armies differs materially In the Confederate army often only bayonets are taken into account never I believe do they estimate more than are handling the guns of the artillery and armed with muskets thirty six or carbines Generally the latter are far enough away to be excluded from the count in any one field Officers and details of enlisted men are not included In the Northern armies the estimate is most liberal taking in all connected with the army and drawing pay Estimated in the same manner as ours Lee had not less than eighty thousand men at the start His reinforcements were about equal to ours during the campaign deducting the discharged men and those sent back He was on the defensive and in a country in which every stream every road every obstacle to the movement of troops and every natural defence was familiar to him and his army The citizens were all friendly to him and his cause and could and did furnish him with accurate reports of our every move Rear guards were not necessary for him and having always a railroad at his back large wagon trains were not required All circumstances considered we did not have any advantage in numbers General Lee who had led the Army of Northern Virginia in all these contests was a very highly estimated man in the Confederate army and States and filled also a very high place in the estimation of the people and press of the Northern States His praise was sounded throughout the entire North after every action he was engaged in the number of his forces was always lowered and that of the National forces exaggerated He was a large austere man and I judge difficult of approach to his subordinates To be extolled by the entire press of the South after every engagement and by a portion of the press North with equal vehemence was calculated to give him the entire confidence of his troops and to make him feared by his antagonists It was not an uncommon thing for my staff officers to hear from Eastern officers Well Grant has never met Bobby Lee yet There were good and true officers who believe now that the Army of Northern Virginia was superior to the Army of the Potomac man to man I do not believe so except as the advantages spoken of above made them so Before the end I believe the difference was the other way The Army of Northern Virginia became despondent and saw the end It did not please them The National army saw the same thing and were encouraged by it The advance of the Army of the Potomac reached the James on the fourteenth of June Preparations were at once commenced for laying the pontoon bridges and crossing the river As already stated I had previously ordered General Butler to have two vessels loaded with stone and carried up the river to a point above that occupied by our gunboats where the channel was narrow and sunk there so as to obstruct the passage and prevent Confederate gunboats from coming down the river Butler had had these boats filled and put in position but had not had them sunk before my arrival I ordered this done and also directed that he should turn over all material and boats not then in use in the river to be used in ferrying the troops across I then on the fourteenth took a steamer and ran up to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler for the purpose of directing a movement against Petersburg while our troops of the Army of the Potomac were crossing I had sent General W F Smith back from Cold Harbor by the way of White House thence on steamers to City Point for the purpose of giving General Butler more troops with which to accomplish this result General Butler was ordered to send Smith with his troops reinforced as far as that could be conveniently done from other parts of the Army of the James He gave Smith about six thousand reinforcements including some twenty five hundred cavalry under Kautz and about thirty five hundred colored infantry under Hinks The distance which Smith had to move to reach the enemy s lines was about six miles and the Confederate advance line of works was but two miles outside of Petersburg Smith was to move under cover of night up close to the enemy s works and assault as soon as he could after daylight I believed then and still believe that Petersburg could have been easily captured at that time It only had about twenty five hundred men in the defences besides some irregular troops consisting of citizens and employees in the city who took up arms in case of emergency Smith started as proposed but his advance encountered a rebel force intrenched between City Point and their lines outside of Petersburg This position he carried with some loss to the enemy but there was so much delay that it was daylight before his troops really got off from there While there I informed General Butler that Hancock s corps would cross the river and move to Petersburg to support Smith in case the latter was successful and that I could reinforce there more rapidly than Lee could reinforce from his position I returned down the river to where the troops of the Army of the Potomac now were communicated to General Meade in writing the directions I had given to General Butler and directed him Meade to cross Hancock s corps over under cover of night and push them forward in the morning to Petersburg halting them however at a designated point until they could hear from Smith I also informed General Meade that I had ordered rations from Bermuda Hundred for Hancock s corps and desired him to issue them speedily and to lose no more time than was absolutely necessary The rations did not reach him however and Hancock while he got all his corps over during the night remained until half past ten in the hope of receiving them He then moved without them and on the road received a note from General W F Smith asking him to come on This seems to be the first information that General Hancock had received of the fact that he was to go to Petersburg or that anything particular was expected of him Otherwise he would have been there by four o clock in the afternoon Smith arrived in front of the enemy s lines early in the forenoon of the fifteenth and spent the day until after seven o clock in the evening in reconnoitering what appeared to be empty works The enemy s line consisted of redans occupying commanding positions with rifle pits connecting them To the east side of Petersburg from the Appomattox back there were thirteen of these redans extending a distance of several miles probably three If they had been properly manned they could have held out against any force that could have attacked them at least until reinforcements could have got up from the north of Richmond Smith assaulted with the colored troops and with success By nine o clock at night he was in possession of five of these redans and of course of the connecting lines of rifle pits All of them contained artillery which fell into our hands Hancock came up and proposed to take any part assigned to him and Smith asked him to relieve his men who were in the trenches Next morning the sixteenth Hancock himself was in command and captured another redan Meade came up in the afternoon and succeeded Hancock who had to be relieved temporarily from the command of his corps on account of the breaking out afresh of the wound he had received at Gettysburg During the day Meade assaulted and carried one more redan to his right and two to his left In all this we lost very heavily The works were not strongly manned but they all had guns in them which fell into our hands together with the men who were handling them in the effort to repel these assaults Up to this time Beauregard who had commanded south of Richmond had received no reinforcements except Hoke s division from Drury s Bluff thirty seven which had arrived on the morning of the sixteenth though he had urged the authorities very strongly to send them believing as he did that Petersburg would be a valuable prize which we might seek During the seventeenth the fighting was very severe and the losses heavy and at night our troops occupied about the same position they had occupied in the morning except that they held a redan which had been captured by Potter during the day During the night however Beauregard fell back to the line which had been already selected and commenced fortifying it Our troops advanced on the eighteenth to the line which he had abandoned and found that the Confederate loss had been very severe many of the enemy s dead still remaining in the ditches and in front of them Colonel J L Chamberlain of the twentieth Maine was wounded on the eighteenth He was gallantly leading his brigade at the time as he had been in the habit of doing in all the engagements in which he had previously been engaged He had several times been recommended for a brigadier generalcy for gallant and meritorious conduct On this occasion however I promoted him on the spot and forwarded a copy of my order to the War Department asking that my act might be confirmed and Chamberlain s name sent to the Senate for confirmation without any delay This was done and at last a gallant and meritorious officer received partial justice at the hands of his government which he had served so faithfully and so well If General Hancock s orders of the fifteenth had been communicated to him that officer with his usual promptness would undoubtedly have been upon the ground around Petersburg as early as four o clock in the afternoon of the fifteenth The days were long and it would have given him considerable time before night I do not think there is any doubt that Petersburg itself could have been carried without much loss or at least if protected by inner detached works that a line could have been established very much in rear of the one then occupied by the enemy This would have given us control of both the Weldon and South Side railroads This would also have saved an immense amount of hard fighting which had to be done from the fifteenth to the eighteenth and would have given us greatly the advantage in the long siege which ensued I now ordered the troops to be put under cover and allowed some of the rest which they had so long needed They remained quiet except that there was more or less firing every day until the twenty twod when General Meade ordered an advance towards the Weldon Railroad We were very anxious to get to that road and even round to the South Side Railroad if possible Meade moved Hancock s corps now commanded by Birney to the left with a view to at least force the enemy to stay within the limits of his own line General Wright with the sixth corps was ordered by a road farther south to march directly for the Weldon road The enemy passed in between these two corps and attacked vigorously and with very serious results to the National troops who were then withdrawn from their advanced position The Army of the Potomac was given the investment of Petersburg while the Army of the James held Bermuda Hundred and all the ground we possessed north of the James River The ninth corps Burnside s was placed upon the right at Petersburg the fifth Warren s next the twod Birney s next then the sixth Wright s broken off to the left and south Thus began the siege of Petersburg CHAPTER LVII RAID ON THE VIRGINIA CENTRAL RAILROAD RAID ON THE WELDON RAILROAD EARLY S MOVEMENT UPON WASHINGTON MINING THE WORKS BEFORE PETERSBURG EXPLOSION OF THE MINE BEFORE PETERSBURG CAMPAIGN IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY CAPTURE OF THE WELDON RAILROAD On the seventh of June while at Cold Harbor I had as already indicated sent Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry to destroy as much as he could of the Virginia Central Railroad General Hunter had been operating up the Shenandoah Valley with some success having fought a battle near Staunton where he captured a great many prisoners besides killing and wounding a good many men After the battle he formed a junction at Staunton with Averell and Crook who had come up from the Kanawha or Gauley River It was supposed therefore that General Hunter would be about Charlottesville Virginia by the time Sheridan could get there doing on the way the damage that he was sent to do I gave Sheridan instructions to have Hunter in case he should meet him about Charlottesville join and return with him to the Army of the Potomac Lee hearing of Hunter s success in the valley started Breckinridge out for its defence at once Learning later of Sheridan s going with two divisions he also sent Hampton with two divisions of cavalry his own and Fitz Hugh Lee s Sheridan moved to the north side of the North Anna to get out west and learned of the movement of these troops to the south side of the same stream almost as soon as they had started He pushed on to get to Trevilian Station to commence his destruction at that point On the night of the tenth he bivouacked some six or seven miles east of Trevilian while Fitz Hugh Lee was the same night at Trevilian Station and Hampton but a few miles away During the night Hampton ordered an advance on Sheridan hoping no doubt to surprise and very badly cripple him Sheridan however by a counter move sent Custer on a rapid march to get between the two divisions of the enemy and into their rear This he did successfully so that at daylight when the assault was made the enemy found himself at the same time resisted in front and attacked in rear and broke in some confusion The losses were probably very light on both sides in killed and wounded but Sheridan got away with some five hundred prisoners and sent them to City Point During that day the eleventh Sheridan moved into Trevilian Station and the following day proceeded to tear up the road east and west There was considerable fighting during the whole of the day but the work of destruction went on In the meantime at night the enemy had taken possession of the crossing which Sheridan had proposed to take to go north when he left Trevilian Sheridan learned however from some of the prisoners he had captured here that General Hunter was about Lynchburg and therefore that there was no use of his going on to Charlottesville with a view to meet him Sheridan started back during the night of the twelfth and made his way north and farther east coming around by the north side of White House and arriving there on the twenty first Here he found an abundance of forage for his animals food for his men and security while resting He had been obliged to leave about ninety of his own men in the field hospital which he had established near Trevilian and these necessarily fell into the hands of the enemy White House up to this time had been a depot but now that our troops were all on the James River it was no longer wanted as a store of supplies Sheridan was therefore directed to break it up which he did on the twenty twod of June bringing the garrison and an immense wagon train with him All these were over the James River by the twenty sixth of the month and Sheridan ready to follow In the meantime Meade had sent Wilson s division on a raid to destroy the Weldon and South Side roads Now that Sheridan was safe and Hampton free to return to Richmond with his cavalry Wilson s position became precarious Meade therefore on the twenty seventh ordered Sheridan over the river to make a demonstration in favor of Wilson Wilson got back though not without severe loss having struck both roads but the damage done was soon repaired After these events comparative quiet reigned about Petersburg until late in July The time however was spent in strengthening the intrenchments and making our position generally more secure against a sudden attack In the meantime I had to look after other portions of my command where things had not been going on so favorably always as I could have wished General Hunter who had been appointed to succeed Sigel in the Shenandoah Valley immediately took up the offensive He met the enemy on the fifth of June at Piedmont and defeated him On the eighth he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton from which place he moved direct on Lynchburg via Lexington which he reached and invested on the sixteenth Up to this time he was very successful and but for the difficulty of taking with him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march through a hostile country he would no doubt have captured Lynchburg The destruction of the enemy s supplies and manufactories had been very great To meet this movement under General Hunter General Lee sent Early with his corps a part of which reached Lynchburg before Hunter After some skirmishing on the seventeenth and eighteenth General Hunter owing to a want of ammunition to give battle retired from before the place Unfortunately this want of ammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers thence up the Ohio River returning to Harper s Ferry by way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad A long time was consumed in making this movement Meantime the valley was left open to Early s troops and others in that quarter and Washington also was uncovered Early took advantage of this condition of affairs and moved on Washington In the absence of Hunter General Lew Wallace with headquarters at Baltimore commanded the department in which the Shenandoah lay His surplus of troops with which to move against the enemy was small in number Most of these were raw and consequently very much inferior to our veterans and to the veterans which Early had with him but the situation of Washington was precarious and Wallace moved with commendable promptitude to meet the enemy at the Monocacy He could hardly have expected to defeat him badly but he hoped to cripple and delay him until Washington could be put into a state of preparation for his reception I had previously ordered General Meade to send a division to Baltimore for the purpose of adding to the defences of Washington and he had sent Ricketts s division of the sixth corps Wright s which arrived in Baltimore on the eighth of July Finding that Wallace had gone to the front with his command Ricketts immediately took the cars and followed him to the Monocacy with his entire division They met the enemy and as might have been expected were defeated but they succeeded in stopping him for the day on which the battle took place The next morning Early started on his march to the capital of the Nation arriving before it on the eleventh Learning of the gravity of the situation I had directed General Meade to also order Wright with the rest of his corps directly to Washington for the relief of that place and the latter reached there the very day that Early arrived before it The nineteenth corps which had been stationed in Louisiana having been ordered up to reinforce the armies about Richmond had about this time arrived at Fortress Monroe on their way to join us I diverted them from that point to Washington which place they reached almost simultaneously with Wright on the eleventh The nineteenth corps was commanded by Major General Emory Early made his reconnoissance with a view of attacking on the following morning the twelfth but the next morning he found our intrenchments which were very strong fully manned He at once commenced to retreat Wright following There is no telling how much this result was contributed to by General Lew Wallace s leading what might well be considered almost a forlorn hope If Early had been but one day earlier he might have entered the capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent Whether the delay caused by the battle amounted to a day or not General Wallace contributed on this occasion by the defeat of the troops under him a greater benefit to the cause than often falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by means of a victory Farther west also the troubles were threatening Some time before Forrest had met Sturgis in command of some of our cavalry in Mississippi and handled him very roughly gaining a very great victory over him This left Forrest free to go almost where he pleased and to cut the roads in rear of Sherman who was then advancing Sherman was abundantly able to look after the army that he was immediately with and all of his military division so long as he could communicate with it but it was my place to see that he had the means with which to hold his rear Two divisions under A J Smith had been sent to Banks in Louisiana some months before Sherman ordered these back with directions to attack Forrest Smith met and defeated him very badly I then directed that Smith should hang to Forrest and not let him go and to prevent by all means his getting upon the Memphis and Nashville Railroad Sherman had anticipated me in this matter and given the same orders in substance but receiving my directions for this order to Smith he repeated it On the twenty fifth of June General Burnside had commenced running a mine from about the centre of his front under the Confederate works confronting him He was induced to do this by Colonel Pleasants of the Pennsylvania Volunteers whose regiment was mostly composed of miners and who was himself a practical miner Burnside had submitted the scheme to Meade and myself and we both approved of it as a means of keeping the men occupied His position was very favorable for carrying on this work but not so favorable for the operations to follow its completion The position of the two lines at that point were only about a hundred yards apart with a comparatively deep ravine intervening In the bottom of this ravine the work commenced The position was unfavorable in this particular that the enemy s line at that point was re entering so that its front was commanded by their own lines both to the right and left Then too the ground was sloping upward back of the Confederate line for a considerable distance and it was presumable that the enemy had at least a detached work on this highest point The work progressed and on the twenty threed of July the mine was finished ready for charging but I had this work of charging deferred until we were ready for it On the seventeenth of July several deserters came in and said that there was great consternation in Richmond and that Lee was coming out to make an attack upon us the object being to put us on the defensive so that he might detach troops to go to Georgia where the army Sherman was operating against was said to be in great trouble I put the army commanders Meade and Butler on the lookout but the attack was not made I concluded then a few days later to do something in the way of offensive movement myself having in view something of the same object that Lee had had Wright s and Emory s corps were in Washington and with this reduction of my force Lee might very readily have spared some troops from the defences to send West I had other objects in view however besides keeping Lee where he was The mine was constructed and ready to be exploded and I wanted to take that occasion to carry Petersburg if I could It was the object therefore to get as many of Lee s troops away from the south side of the James River as possible Accordingly on the twenty sixth we commenced a movement with Hancock s corps and Sheridan s cavalry to the north side by the way of Deep Bottom where Butler had a pontoon bridge laid The plan in the main was to let the cavalry cut loose and joining with Kautz s cavalry of the Army of the James get by Lee s lines and destroy as much as they could of the Virginia Central Railroad while in the mean time the infantry was to move out so as to protect their rear and cover their retreat back when they should have got through with their work We were successful in drawing the enemy s troops to the north side of the James as I expected The mine was ordered to be charged and the morning of the thirtieth of July was the time fixed for its explosion I gave Meade minute orders thirty eight on the twenty fourth directing how I wanted the assault conducted which orders he amplified into general instructions for the guidance of the troops that were to be engaged Meade s instructions which I of course approved most heartily were all that I can see now was necessary The only further precaution which he could have taken and which he could not foresee would have been to have different men to execute them The gallery to the mine was over five hundred feet long from where it entered the ground to the point where it was under the enemy s works and with a cross gallery of something over eighty feet running under their lines Eight chambers had been left requiring a ton of powder each to charge them All was ready by the time I had prescribed and on the twenty ninth Hancock and Sheridan were brought back near the James River with their troops Under cover of night they started to recross the bridge at Deep Bottom and to march directly for that part of our lines in front of the mine Warren was to hold his line of intrenchments with a sufficient number of men and concentrate the balance on the right next to Burnside s corps while Ord now commanding the eighteenth corps temporarily under Meade was to form in the rear of Burnside to support him when he went in All were to clear off the parapets and the abatis in their front so as to leave the space as open as possible and be able to charge the moment the mine had been sprung and Burnside had taken possession Burnside s corps was not to stop in the crater at all but push on to the top of the hill supported on the right and left by Ord s and Warren s corps Warren and Ord fulfilled their instructions perfectly so far as making ready was concerned Burnside seemed to have paid no attention whatever to the instructions and left all the obstruction in his own front for his troops to get over in the best way they could The four divisions of his corps were commanded by Generals Potter Willcox Ledlie and Ferrero The last was a colored division and Burnside selected it to make the assault Meade interfered with this Burnside then took Ledlie s division a worse selection than the first could have been In fact Potter and Willcox were the only division commanders Burnside had who were equal to the occasion Ledlie besides being otherwise inefficient proved also to possess disqualification less common among soldiers There was some delay about the explosion of the mine so that it did not go off until about five o clock in the morning When it did explode it was very successful making a crater twenty feet deep and something like a hundred feet in length Instantly one hundred and ten cannon and fifty mortars which had been placed in the most commanding positions covering the ground to the right and left of where the troops were to enter the enemy s lines commenced playing Ledlie s division marched into the crater immediately on the explosion but most of the men stopped there in the absence of any one to give directions their commander having found some safe retreat to get into before they started There was some delay on the left and right in advancing but some of the troops did get in and turn to the right and left carrying the rifle pits as I expected they would do There had been great consternation in Petersburg as we were well aware about a rumored mine that we were going to explode They knew we were mining and they had failed to cut our mine off by countermining though Beauregard had taken the precaution to run up a line of intrenchments to the rear of that part of their line fronting where they could see that our men were at work We had learned through deserters who had come in that the people had very wild rumors about what was going on on our side They said that we had undermined the whole of Petersburg that they were resting upon a slumbering volcano and did not know at what moment they might expect an eruption I somewhat based my calculations upon this state of feeling and expected that when the mine was exploded the troops to the right and left would flee in all directions and that our troops if they moved promptly could get in and strengthen themselves before the enemy had come to a realization of the true situation It was just as I expected it would be We could see the men running without any apparent object except to get away It was half an hour before musketry firing to amount to anything was opened upon our men in the crater It was an hour before the enemy got artillery up to play upon them and it was nine o clock before Lee got up reinforcements from his right to join in expelling our troops The effort was a stupendous failure It cost us about four thousand men mostly however captured and all due to inefficiency on the part of the corps commander and the incompetency of the division commander who was sent to lead the assault After being fully assured of the failure of the mine and finding that most of that part of Lee s army which had been drawn north of the James River were still there I gave Meade directions to send a corps of infantry and the cavalry next morning before Lee could get his forces back to destroy fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad But misfortunes never come singly I learned during that same afternoon that Wright s pursuit of Early was feeble because of the constant and contrary orders he had been receiving from Washington while I was cut off from immediate communication by reason of our cable across Chesapeake Bay being broken Early however was not aware of the fact that Wright was not pursuing until he had reached Strasburg Finding that he was not pursued he turned back to Winchester where Crook was stationed with a small force and drove him out He then pushed north until he had reached the Potomac then he sent McCausland across to Chambersburg Pa to destroy that town Chambersburg was a purely defenceless town with no garrison whatever and no fortifications yet McCausland under Early s orders burned the place and left about three hundred families houseless This occurred on the thirtieth of July I rescinded my orders for the troops to go out to destroy the Weldon Railroad and directed them to embark for Washington City After burning Chambersburg McCausland retreated pursued by our cavalry towards Cumberland They were met and defeated by General Kelley and driven into Virginia The Shenandoah Valley was very important to the Confederates because it was the principal storehouse they now had for feeding their armies about Richmond It was well known that they would make a desperate struggle to maintain it It had been the source of a great deal of trouble to us heretofore to guard that outlet to the north partly because of the incompetency of some of the commanders but chiefly because of interference from Washington It seemed to be the policy of General Halleck and Secretary Stanton to keep any force sent there in pursuit of the invading army moving right and left so as to keep between the enemy and our capital and generally speaking they pursued this policy until all knowledge of the whereabouts of the enemy was lost They were left therefore free to supply themselves with horses beef cattle and such provisions as they could carry away from Western Maryland and Pennsylvania I determined to put a stop to this I started Sheridan at once for that field of operation and on the following day sent another division of his cavalry I had previously asked to have Sheridan assigned to that command but mister Stanton objected on the ground that he was too young for so important a command On the first of August when I sent reinforcements for the protection of Washington I sent the following orders CITY POINT VA August one eighteen sixty four eleven point thirty A M MAJOR GENERAL HALLECK Washington D C I am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the enemy is being expelled from the border Unless General Hunter is in the field in person I want Sheridan put in command of all the troops in the field with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and follow him to the death Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also Once started up the valley they ought to be followed until we get possession of the Virginia Central Railroad If General Hunter is in the field give Sheridan direct command of the sixth corps and cavalry division All the cavalry I presume will reach Washington in the course of to morrow U S GRANT Lieutenant General The President in some way or other got to see this dispatch of mine directing certain instructions to be given to the commanders in the field operating against Early and sent me the following very characteristic dispatch OFFICE U S MILITARY TELEGRAPH WAR DEPARTMENT WASHINGTON D C August three eighteen sixty four Cypher six P M lieutenant GENERAL GRANT City Point Va I have seen your despatch in which you say I want Sheridan put in command of all the troops in the field with instructions to put himself south of the enemy and follow him to the death Wherever the enemy goes let our troops go also This I think is exactly right as to how our forces should move But please look over the despatches you may have received from here even since you made that order and discover if you can that there is any idea in the head of any one here of putting our army south of the enemy or of following him to the death in any direction I repeat to you it will neither be done nor attempted unless you watch it every day and hour and force it A LINCOLN I replied to this that I would start in two hours for Washington and soon got off going directly to the Monocacy without stopping at Washington on my way I found General Hunter s army encamped there scattered over the fields along the banks of the Monocacy with many hundreds of cars and locomotives belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad which he had taken the precaution to bring back and collect at that point I asked the general where the enemy was He replied that he did not know He said the fact was that he was so embarrassed with orders from Washington moving him first to the right and then to the left that he had lost all trace of the enemy I then told the general that I would find out where the enemy was and at once ordered steam got up and trains made up giving directions to push for Halltown some four miles above Harper s Ferry in the Shenandoah Valley The cavalry and the wagon trains were to march but all the troops that could be transported by the cars were to go in that way I knew that the valley was of such importance to the enemy that no matter how much he was scattered at that time he would in a very short time be found in front of our troops moving south I then wrote out General Hunter s instructions thirty nine I told him that Sheridan was in Washington and still another division was on its way and suggested that he establish the headquarters of the department at any point that would suit him best Cumberland Baltimore or elsewhere and give Sheridan command of the troops in the field The general replied to this that he thought he had better be relieved entirely He said that General Halleck seemed so much to distrust his fitness for the position he was in that he thought somebody else ought to be there He did not want in any way to embarrass the cause thus showing a patriotism that was none too common in the army There were not many major generals who would voluntarily have asked to have the command of a department taken from them on the supposition that for some particular reason or for any reason the service would be better performed I told him very well then and telegraphed at once for Sheridan to come to the Monocacy and suggested that I would wait and meet him there Sheridan came at once by special train but reached there after the troops were all off I went to the station and remained there until he arrived Myself and one or two of my staff were about all the Union people except General Hunter and his staff who were left at the Monocacy when Sheridan arrived I hastily told Sheridan what had been done and what I wanted him to do giving him at the same time the written instructions which had been prepared for General Hunter and directed to that officer Sheridan now had about thirty thousand men to move with eight thousand of them being cavalry Early had about the same number but the superior ability of the National commander over the Confederate commander was so great that all the latter s advantage of being on the defensive was more than counterbalanced by this circumstance As I had predicted Early was soon found in front of Sheridan in the valley and Pennsylvania and Maryland were speedily freed from the invaders The importance of the valley was so great to the Confederates that Lee reinforced Early but not to the extent that we thought and feared he would To prevent as much as possible these reinforcements from being sent out from Richmond I had to do something to compel Lee to retain his forces about his capital I therefore gave orders for another move to the north side of the James River to threaten Richmond Hancock s corps part of the tenth corps under Birney and Gregg s division of cavalry were crossed to the north side of the James during the night of the thirteenth fourteenth of August A threatening position was maintained for a number of days with more or less skirmishing and some tolerably hard fighting although it was my object and my instructions that anything like a battle should be avoided unless opportunities should present themselves which would insure great success General Meade was left in command of the few troops around Petersburg strongly intrenched and was instructed to keep a close watch upon the enemy in that quarter and himself to take advantage of any weakening that might occur through an effort on the part of the enemy to reinforce the north side There was no particular victory gained on either side but during that time no more reinforcements were sent to the valley I informed Sheridan of what had been done to prevent reinforcements being sent from Richmond against him and also that the efforts we had made had proven that one of the divisions which we supposed had gone to the valley was still at Richmond because we had captured six or seven hundred prisoners from that division each of its four brigades having contributed to our list of captures I also informed him that but one division had gone and it was possible that I should be able to prevent the going of any more To add to my embarrassment at this time Sherman who was now near Atlanta wanted reinforcements He was perfectly willing to take the raw troops then being raised in the North west saying that he could teach them more soldiering in one day among his troops than they would learn in a week in a camp of instruction I therefore asked that all troops in camps of instruction in the North west be sent to him Sherman also wanted to be assured that no Eastern troops were moving out against him I informed him of what I had done and assured him that I would hold all the troops there that it was possible for me to hold and that up to that time none had gone I also informed him that his real danger was from Kirby Smith who commanded the trans Mississippi Department If Smith should escape Steele and get across the Mississippi River he might move against him I had therefore asked to have an expedition ready to move from New Orleans against Mobile in case Kirby Smith should get across This would have a tendency to draw him to the defence of that place instead of going against Sherman Right in the midst of all these embarrassments Halleck informed me that there was an organized scheme on foot in the North to resist the draft and suggested that it might become necessary to draw troops from the field to put it down He also advised taking in sail and not going too fast The troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River on the night of the twentieth Before they were withdrawn however and while most of Lee s force was on that side of the river Warren had been sent with most of the fifth corps to capture the Weldon Railroad He took up his line of march well back to the rear south of the enemy while the troops remaining in the trenches extended so as to cover that part of the line which he had vacated by moving out From our left near the old line it was about three miles to the Weldon Railroad A division was ordered from the right of the Petersburg line to reinforce Warren while a division was brought back from the north side of the James River to take its place This road was very important to the enemy The limits from which his supplies had been drawn were already very much contracted and I knew that he must fight desperately to protect it Warren carried the road though with heavy loss on both sides He fortified his new position and our trenches were then extended from the left of our main line to connect with his new one Lee made repeated attempts to dislodge Warren s corps but without success and with heavy loss As soon as Warren was fortified and reinforcements reached him troops were sent south to destroy the bridges on the Weldon Railroad and with such success that the enemy had to draw in wagons for a distance of about thirty miles all the supplies they got thereafter from that source It was on the twenty first that Lee seemed to have given up the Weldon Railroad as having been lost to him but along about the twenty fourth or twenty fifth he made renewed attempts to recapture it again he failed and with very heavy losses to him as compared with ours On the night of the twentieth our troops on the north side of the James were withdrawn and Hancock and Gregg were sent south to destroy the Weldon Railroad They were attacked on the twenty fifth at Reams s Station and after desperate fighting a part of our line gave way losing five pieces of artillery But the Weldon Railroad never went out of our possession from the eighteenth of August to the close of the war CHAPTER LVIII SHERIDAN S ADVANCE VISIT TO SHERIDAN SHERIDAN S VICTORY IN THE SHENANDOAH SHERIDAN S RIDE TO WINCHESTER CLOSE OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE WINTER We had our troops on the Weldon Railroad contending against a large force that regarded this road of so much importance that they could afford to expend many lives in retaking it Sherman just getting through to Atlanta with great losses of men from casualties discharges and detachments left along as guards to occupy and hold the road in rear of him Washington threatened but a short time before and now Early being strengthened in the valley so as probably to renew that attempt It kept me pretty active in looking after all these points On the tenth of August Sheridan had advanced on Early up the Shenandoah Valley Early falling back to Strasburg On the twelfth I learned that Lee had sent twenty pieces of artillery two divisions of infantry and a considerable cavalry force to strengthen Early It was important that Sheridan should be informed of this so I sent the information to Washington by telegraph and directed a courier to be sent from there to get the message to Sheridan at all hazards giving him the information The messenger an officer of the army pushed through with great energy and reached Sheridan just in time The officer went through by way of Snicker s Gap escorted by some cavalry He found Sheridan just making his preparations to attack Early in his chosen position Now however he was thrown back on the defensive On the fifteenth of September I started to visit General Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley My purpose was to have him attack Early or drive him out of the valley and destroy that source of supplies for Lee s army I knew it was impossible for me to get orders through Washington to Sheridan to make a move because they would be stopped there and such orders as Halleck s caution and that of the Secretary of War would suggest would be given instead and would no doubt be contradictory to mine I therefore without stopping at Washington went directly through to Charlestown some ten miles above Harper s Ferry and waited there to see General Sheridan having sent a courier in advance to inform him where to meet me When Sheridan arrived I asked him if he had a map showing the positions of his army and that of the enemy He at once drew one out of his side pocket showing all roads and streams and the camps of the two armies He said that if he had permission he would move so and so pointing out how against the Confederates and that he could whip them Before starting I had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan which I had brought with me but seeing that he was so clear and so positive in his views and so confident of success I said nothing about this and did not take it out of my pocket Sheridan s wagon trains were kept at Harper s Ferry where all of his stores were By keeping the teams at that place their forage did not have to be hauled to them As supplies of ammunition provisions and rations for the men were wanted trains would be made up to deliver the stores to the commissaries and quartermasters encamped at Winchester Knowing that he in making preparations to move at a given day would have to bring up wagons trains from Harper s Ferry I asked him if he could be ready to get off by the following Tuesday This was on Friday O Yes he said he could be off before daylight on Monday I told him then to make the attack at that time and according to his own plan and I immediately started to return to the army about Richmond After visiting Baltimore and Burlington New Jersey I arrived at City Point on the nineteenth On the way out to Harper s Ferry I had met mister Robert Garrett President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad He seemed very anxious to know when workmen might be put upon the road again so as to make repairs and put it in shape for running It was a large piece of property to have standing idle I told him I could not answer then positively but would try and inform him before a great while On my return mister Garrett met me again with the same and I told him I thought that by the Wednesday he might send his workmen out on his road I gave him no further information however and he had no suspicion of how I expected to have the road cleared for his workmen Sheridan moved at the time he had fixed upon He met Early at the crossing of Opequon Creek a most decisive victory one which the country Early had invited this attack himself by his bad generalship and made the victory easy He had sent G T Anderson s division east of the Blue Ridge before I went to Harper s Ferry and about the time I arrived there he started other divisions leaving but two in their camps to march to Martinsburg for the purpose destroying the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at that point Early here learned that I had been with Sheridan and supposing there was some movement on foot started back as soon as he got the information But his forces were separated and as I have said he was very badly defeated He fell back to Fisher s Hill Sheridan following The valley is narrow at that point and Early made another stand there behind works which extended across But Sheridan turned both his flanks and again sent him speeding up the valley following in hot pursuit The pursuit was continued up the valley to Mount Jackson and New Market Sheridan captured about eleven hundred prisoners and sixteen guns The houses which he passed all along the route were found to be filled with Early s wounded and the country swarmed with his deserters Finally on the twenty fifth Early turned from the valley eastward leaving Sheridan at Harrisonburg in undisputed possession Now one of the main objects of the expedition began to be accomplished Sheridan went to work with his command gathering in the crops cattle and everything in the upper part of the valley required by our troops and especially taking what might be of use to the enemy What he could not take away he destroyed so that the enemy would not be invited to come back there I congratulated Sheridan upon his recent great victory and had a salute of a hundred guns fired in honor of it the guns being aimed at the enemy around Petersburg I also notified the other commanders throughout the country who also fired salutes in honor of his victory I had reason to believe that the administration was a little afraid to have a decisive battle at that time for fear it might go against us and have a bad effect on the November elections The convention which had met and made its nomination of the Democratic candidate for the presidency had declared the war a failure Treason was talked as boldly in Chicago at that convention as ever been in Charleston It was a question whether the government would then have had the power to make arrests and punish those who talked treason But this decisive victory was the most effective campaign argument made in the canvass Sheridan in his pursuit got beyond where they could hear from him in Washington and the President became very much frightened about him He was afraid that the hot pursuit had been a little like that of General Cass was said to have been in one of our Indian wars when he was an officer of army Cass was pursuing the Indians so closely that the first thing he knew he found himself in front and the Indians pursuing him The President was afraid that Sheridan had got on the other side of Early and that Early was in behind him He was afraid that Sheridan was getting so far away that reinforcements would be sent out from Richmond to enable Early to beat him I replied to the President that I had taken steps to prevent Lee from sending reinforcements to Early by attacking the former where he was On the twenty eighth of September to retain Lee in his position I sent Ord with the eighteenth corps and Birney with the tenth corps to make an advance on Richmond to threaten it Ord moved with the left wing up to Chaffin s Bluff Birney with the tenth corps took a road farther north while Kautz with the cavalry took the Darby road still farther to the north They got across the river by the next morning and made an effort to surprise the enemy In that however they were unsuccessful The enemy s lines were very strong and very intricate Stannard s division of the eighteenth corps with General Burnham s brigade leading tried an assault against Fort Harrison and captured it with sixteen guns and a good many prisoners Burnham was killed in the assault Colonel Stevens who succeeded him was badly wounded and his successor also fell in the same way Some works to the right and left were also carried with the guns in them six in number and a few more prisoners Birney s troops to the right captured the enemy s intrenched picket lines but were unsuccessful in their efforts upon the main line Our troops fortified their new position bringing Fort Harrison into the new line and extending it to the river This brought us pretty close to the enemy on the north side of the James and the two opposing lines maintained their relative positions to the close of the siege In the afternoon a further attempt was made to advance but it failed Ord fell badly wounded and had to be relieved the command devolved upon General Heckman and later General Weitzel was assigned to the command of the eighteenth corps During the night Lee reinforced his troops about Fort Gilmer which was at the right of Fort Harrison by eight additional brigades from Petersburg and attempted to retake the works which we had captured by concentrating ten brigades against them All their efforts failed their attacks being all repulsed with very heavy loss In one of these assaults upon us General Stannard a gallant officer who was defending Fort Harrison lost an arm Our casualties during these operations amounted to three hundred ninety four killed I five hundred fifty four wounded and three hundred twenty four missing Whilst this was going on General Meade was instructed to keep up an appearance of moving troops to our extreme left Parke and Warren were kept with two divisions each under arms ready to move leaving their enclosed batteries manned with a scattering line on the other intrenchments The object of this was to prevent reinforcements from going to the north side of the river Meade was instructed to watch the enemy closely and if Lee weakened his lines to make an attack On the thirtieth these troops moved out under Warren and captured an advanced intrenched camp at Peeble s farm driving the enemy back to the main line Our troops followed and made an attack in the hope of carrying the enemy s main line but in this they were unsuccessful and lost a large number of men mostly captured The number of killed and wounded was not large The next day our troops advanced again and established themselves intrenching a new line about a mile in front of the enemy This advanced Warren s position on the Weldon Railroad very considerably Sheridan having driven the enemy out of the valley and taken the productions of the valley so that instead of going there for supplies the enemy would have to bring his provisions with him if he again entered it recommended a reduction of his own force the surplus to be sent where it could be of more use I approved of his suggestion and ordered him to send Wright s corps back to the James River I further directed him to repair the railroad up the Shenandoah Valley towards the advanced position which we would hold with a small force The troops were to be sent to Washington by the way of Culpeper in order to watch the east side of the Blue Ridge and prevent the enemy from getting into the rear of Sheridan while he was still doing his work of destruction The valley was so very important however to the Confederate army that contrary to our expectations they determined to make one more strike and save it if possible before the supplies should be all destroyed Reinforcements were sent therefore to Early and this before any of our troops had been withdrawn Early prepared to strike Sheridan at Harrisonburg but the latter had not remained there On the sixth of October Sheridan commenced retiring down the valley taking or destroying all the food and forage and driving the cattle before him Early following At Fisher s Hill Sheridan turned his cavalry back on that of Early which under the lead of Rosser was pursuing closely and routed it most completely capturing eleven guns and a large number of prisoners Sheridan lost only about sixty men His cavalry pursued the enemy back some twenty five miles On the tenth of October the march down the valley was again resumed Early again following I now ordered Sheridan to halt and to improve the opportunity if afforded by the enemy s having been sufficiently weakened to move back again and cut the James River Canal and Virginia Central Railroad But this order had to go through Washington where it was intercepted and when Sheridan received what purported to be a statement of what I wanted him to do it was something entirely different Halleck informed Sheridan that it was my wish for him to hold a forward position as a base from which to act against Charlottesville and Gordonsville that he should fortify this position and provision it Sheridan objected to this most decidedly and I was impelled to telegraph him on the fourteenth as follows CITY POINT VA October fourteen eighteen sixty four twelve point thirty P M MAJOR GENERAL SHERIDAN Cedar Creek Va What I want is for you to threaten the Virginia Central Railroad and canal in the manner your judgment tells you is best holding yourself ready to advance if the enemy draw off their forces If you make the enemy hold a force equal to your own for the protection of those thoroughfares it will accomplish nearly as much as their destruction If you cannot do this then the next best thing to do is to send here all the force you can I deem a good cavalry force necessary for your offensive as well as defensive operations You need not therefore send here more than one division of cavalry U S GRANT Lieutenant General Sheridan having been summoned to Washington City started on the fifteenth leaving Wright in command His army was then at Cedar Creek some twenty miles south of Winchester The next morning while at Front Royal Sheridan received a dispatch from Wright saying that a dispatch from Longstreet to Early had been intercepted It directed the latter to be ready to move and to crush Sheridan as soon as he Longstreet arrived On the receipt of this news Sheridan ordered the cavalry up the valley to join Wright On the eighteenth of October Early was ready to move and during the night succeeded in getting his troops in the rear of our left flank which fled precipitately and in great confusion down the valley losing eighteen pieces of artillery and a thousand or more prisoners The right under General Getty maintained a firm and steady front falling back to Middletown where it took a position and made a stand The cavalry went to the rear seized the roads leading to Winchester and held them for the use of our troops in falling back General Wright having ordered a retreat back to that place Sheridan having left Washington on the eighteenth reached Winchester that night The following morning he started to join his command He had scarcely got out of town when he met his men returning in panic from the front and also heard heavy firing to the south He immediately ordered the cavalry at Winchester to be deployed across the valley to stop the stragglers Leaving members of his staff to take care of Winchester and the public property there he set out with a small escort directly for the scene of battle As he met the fugitives he ordered them to turn back reminding them that they were going the wrong way His presence soon restored confidence Finding themselves worse frightened than hurt the men did halt and turn back Many of those who had run ten miles got back in time to redeem their reputation as gallant soldiers before night When Sheridan got to the front he found Getty and Custer still holding their ground firmly between the Confederates and our retreating troops Everything in the rear was now ordered up Sheridan at once proceeded to intrench his position and he awaited an assault from the enemy This was made with vigor and was directed principally against Emory s corps which had sustained the principal loss in the first attack By one o clock the attack was repulsed Early was so badly damaged that he seemed disinclined to make another attack but went to work to intrench himself with a view to holding the position he had already gained He thought no doubt that Sheridan would be glad enough to leave him unmolested but in this he was mistaken About the middle of the afternoon Sheridan advanced He sent his cavalry by both flanks and they penetrated to the enemy s rear The contest was close for a time but at length the left of the enemy broke and disintegration along the whole line soon followed Early tried to rally his men but they were followed so closely that they had to give way very quickly every time they attempted to make a stand Our cavalry having pushed on and got in the rear of the Confederates captured twenty four pieces of artillery besides retaking what had been lost in the morning This victory pretty much closed the campaigning in the Valley of Virginia All the Confederate troops were sent back to Richmond with the exception of one division of infantry and a little cavalry Wright s corps was ordered back to the Army of the Potomac and two other divisions were withdrawn from the valley Early had lost more men in killed wounded and captured in the valley than Sheridan had commanded from first to last On more than one occasion in these engagements General R B Hayes who succeeded me as President of the United States bore a very honorable part His conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry as well as the display of qualities of a higher order than that of mere personal daring This might well have been expected of one who could write at the time he is said to have done so Any officer fit for duty who at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer for a seat in Congress ought to be scalped Having entered the army as a Major of Volunteers at the beginning of the war General Hayes attained by meritorious service the rank of Brevet Major General before its close On the north side of the James River the enemy attacked Kautz s cavalry on the seventh of October and drove it back with heavy loss in killed wounded and prisoners and the loss of all the artillery This was followed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line but was repulsed with severe slaughter On the thirteenth a reconnoissance was sent out by General Butler with a view to drive the enemy from some new works he was constructing which resulted in heavy loss to us On the twenty fourth I ordered General Meade to attempt to get possession of the South Side Railroad and for that purpose to advance on the twenty seventh The attempt proved a failure however the most advanced of our troops not getting nearer than within six miles of the point aimed for Seeing the impossibility of its accomplishment I ordered the troops to withdraw and they were all back in their former positions the next day Butler by my directions also made a demonstration on the north side of the James River in order to support this move by detaining there the Confederate troops who were on that side He succeeded in this but failed of further results by not marching past the enemy s left before turning in on the Darby road and by reason of simply coming up against their lines in place This closed active operations around Richmond for the winter Of course there was frequent skirmishing between pickets but no serious battle was fought near either Petersburg or Richmond It would prolong this work to give a detailed account of all that took place from day to day around Petersburg and at other parts of my command and it would not interest the general reader if given All these details can be found by the military student in a series of books published by the Scribners Badeau s history of my campaigns and also in the publications of the War Department including both the National and Confederate reports In the latter part of November General Hancock was relieved from the command of the twod corps by the Secretary of War and ordered to Washington to organize and command a corps of veteran troops to be designated the first corps It was expected that this would give him a large command to company operate with in the spring It was my expectation at the time that in the final operations Hancock should move either up the valley or else east of the Blue Ridge to Lynchburg the idea being to make the spring campaign the close of the war I expected with Sherman coming up from the South Meade south of Petersburg and around Richmond and Thomas s command in Tennessee with depots of supplies established in the eastern part of that State to move from the direction of Washington or the valley towards Lynchburg We would then have Lee so surrounded that his supplies would be cut off entirely making it impossible for him to support his army General Humphreys chief of staff of the Army of the Potomac was assigned to the command of the twod corps to succeed Hancock CHAPTER LIX THE CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA SHERMAN S MARCH TO THE SEA WAR ANECDOTES THE MARCH ON SAVANNAH INVESTMENT OF SAVANNAH CAPTURE OF SAVANNAH Let us now return to the operations in the military division of the Mississippi and accompany Sherman in his march to the sea The possession of Atlanta by us narrowed the territory of the enemy very materially and cut off one of his two remaining lines of roads from east to west A short time after the fall of Atlanta mister Davis visited Palmetto and Macon and made speeches at each place He spoke at Palmetto on the twentieth of September and at Macon on the twenty twod Inasmuch as he had relieved Johnston and appointed Hood and Hood had immediately taken the initiative it is natural to suppose that mister Davis was disappointed with General Johnston s policy My own judgment is that Johnston acted very wisely he husbanded his men and saved as much of his territory as he could without fighting decisive battles in which all might be lost As Sherman advanced as I have show his army became spread out until if this had been continued it would have been easy to destroy it in detail I know that both Sherman and I were rejoiced when we heard of the change Hood was unquestionably a brave gallant soldier and not destitute of ability but unfortunately his policy was to fight the enemy wherever he saw him without thinking much of the consequences of defeat In his speeches mister Davis denounced Governor Brown of Georgia and General Johnston in unmeasured terms even insinuating that their loyalty to the Southern cause was doubtful So far as General Johnston is concerned I think Davis did him a great injustice in this particular I had know the general before the war and strongly believed it would be impossible for him to accept a high commission for the purpose of betraying the cause he had espoused There as I have said I think that his policy was the best one that could have been pursued by the whole South protract the war which was all that was necessary to enable them to gain recognition in the end The North was already growing weary as the South evidently was also but with this difference In the North the people governed and could stop hostilities whenever they chose to stop supplies The South was a military camp controlled absolutely by the government with soldiers to back it and the war could have been protracted no matter to what extent the discontent reached up to the point of open mutiny of the soldiers themselves mister Davis s speeches were frank appeals to the people of Georgia and that portion of the South to come to their relief He tried to assure his frightened hearers that the Yankees were rapidly digging their own graves that measures were already being taken to cut them off from supplies from the North and that with a force in front and cut off from the rear they must soon starve in the midst of a hostile people Papers containing reports of these speeches immediately reached the Northern States and they were republished Of course that caused no alarm so long as telegraphic communication was kept up with Sherman When Hood was forced to retreat from Atlanta he moved to the south west and was followed by a portion of Sherman s army He soon appeared upon the railroad in Sherman s rear and with his whole army began destroying the road At the same time also the work was begun in Tennessee and Kentucky which mister Davis had assured his hearers at Palmetto and Macon would take place He ordered Forrest about the ablest cavalry general in the South north for this purpose and Forrest and Wheeler carried out their orders with more or less destruction occasionally picking up a garrison Forrest indeed performed the very remarkable feat of capturing with cavalry two gunboats and a number of transports something the accomplishment of which is very hard to account for Hood s army had been weakened by Governor Brown s withdrawing the Georgia State troops for the purpose of gathering in the season s crops for the use of the people and for the use of the army This not only depleted Hood s forces but it served a most excellent purpose in gathering in supplies of food and forage for the use of our army in its subsequent march Sherman was obliged to push on with his force and go himself with portions of it hither and thither until it was clearly demonstrated to him that with the army he then had it would be impossible to hold the line from Atlanta back and leave him any force whatever with which to take the offensive Had that plan been adhered to very large reinforcements would have been necessary and mister Davis s prediction of the destruction of the army would have been realized or else Sherman would have been obliged to make a successful retreat which mister Davis said in his speeches would prove more disastrous than Napoleon s retreat from Moscow These speeches of mister Davis were not long in reaching Sherman He took advantage of the information they gave and made all the preparation possible for him to make to meet what now became expected attempts to break his communications Something else had to be done and to Sherman s sensible and soldierly mind the idea was not long in dawning upon him not only that something else had to be done but what that something else should be On September tenth I telegraphed Sherman as follows CITY POINT VA Sept ten eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL SHERMAN Atlanta Georgia So soon as your men are sufficiently rested and preparations can be made it is desirable that another campaign should be commenced We want to keep the enemy constantly pressed to the end of the war If we give him no peace whilst the war lasts the end cannot be distant Now that we have all of Mobile Bay that is valuable I do not know but it will be the best move to transfer Canby s troops to act upon Savannah whilst you move on Augusta I should like to hear from you however in this matter U S GRANT Lieutenant General Sherman replied promptly If I could be sure of finding provisions and ammunition at Augusta or Columbus Georgia I can march to Milledgeville and compel Hood to give up Augusta or Macon and then turn on the other If you can manage to take the Savannah River as high up as Augusta or the Chattahoochee as far up as Columbus I can sweep the whole State of Georgia On the twelfth I sent a special messenger one of my own staff with a letter inviting Sherman s views about the next campaign CITY POINT VA Sept twelve eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN Commanding Mill Division of the Mississippi I send Lieutenant Colonel Porter of my staff with this Colonel Porter will explain to you the exact condition of affairs here better than I can do in the limits of a letter Although I feel myself strong enough for offensive operations I am holding on quietly to get advantage of recruits and convalescents who are coming forward very rapidly My lines are necessarily very long extending from Deep Bottom north of the James across the peninsula formed by the Appomattox and the James and south of the Appomattox to the Weldon Road This line is very strongly fortified and can be held with comparatively few men but from its great length takes many in the aggregate I propose when I do move to extend my left so as to control what is known as the South Side or Lynchburg and Petersburg Road then if possible to keep the Danville Road cut At the same time this move is made I want to send a force of from six to ten thousand men against Wilmington The way I propose to do this is to land the men north of Fort Fisher and hold that point At the same time a large naval fleet will be assembled there and the iron clads will run the batteries as they did at Mobile This will give us the same control of the harbor of Wilmington that we now have of the harbor of Mobile What you are to do with the forces at your command I do not see The difficulties of supplying your army except when you are constantly moving beyond where you are I plainly see If it had not been for Price s movements Canby would have sent twelve thousand more men to Mobile From your command on the Mississippi an equal number could have been taken With these forces my idea would have been to divide them sending one half to Mobile and the other half to Savannah You could then move as proposed in your telegram so as to threaten Macon and Augusta equally Whichever was abandoned by the enemy you could take and open up a new base of supplies My object now in sending a staff officer is not so much to suggest operations for you as to get your views and have plans matured by the time everything can be got ready It will probably be the fifth of October before any of the plans herein indicated will be executed If you have any promotions to recommend send the names forward and I will approve them U S GRANT Lieutenant General This reached Sherman on September twentieth On the twenty fifth of September Sherman reported to Washington that Hood s troops were in his rear He had provided against this by sending a division to Chattanooga and a division to Rome Georgia which was in the rear of Hood supposing that Hood would fall back in the direction from which he had come to reach the railroad At the same time Sherman and Hood kept up a correspondence relative to the exchange of prisoners the treatment of citizens and other matters suitable to be arranged between hostile commanders in the field On the twenty seventh of September I telegraphed Sherman as follows CITY POINT VA September twenty seven eighteen sixty four ten point thirty A M MAJOR GENERAL SHERMAN I have directed all recruits and new troops from the Western States to be sent to Nashville to receive their further orders from you U S GRANT Lieutenant General On the twenty ninth Sherman sent Thomas back to Chattanooga and afterwards to Nashville with another division Morgan s of the advanced army Sherman then suggested that when he was prepared his movements should take place against Milledgeville and then to Savannah His expectation at that time was to make this movement as soon as he could get up his supplies Hood was moving in his own country and was moving light so that he could make two miles to Sherman s one He depended upon the country to gather his supplies and so was not affected by delays As I have said until this unexpected state of affairs happened Mobile had been looked upon as the objective point of Sherman s army It had been a favorite move of mine from eighteen sixty two when I first suggested to the then commander in chief that the troops in Louisiana instead of frittering away their time in the trans Mississippi should move against Mobile I recommended this from time to time until I came into command of the army the last of March eighteen sixty four Having the power in my own hands I now ordered the concentration of supplies stores and troops in the department of the Gulf about New Orleans with a view to a move against Mobile in support of and in conjunction with the other armies operating in the field Before I came into command these troops had been scattered over the trans Mississippi department in such a way that they could not be or were not gotten back in time to take any part in the original movement hence the consideration which had caused Mobile to be selected as the objective point for Sherman s army to find his next base of supplies after having cut loose from Atlanta no longer existed General G M Dodge an exceedingly efficient officer having been badly wounded had to leave the army about the first of October He was in command of two divisions of the sixteenth corps consolidated into one Sherman then divided his army into the right and left wings the right commanded by General O O Howard and the left by General Slocum General Dodge s two divisions were assigned one to each of these wings Howard s command embraced the fifteenth and seventeenth corps and Slocum s the fourteenth and twentieth corps commanded by Generals Jeff C Davis and A S Williams Generals Logan and Blair commanded the two corps composing the right wing About this time they left to take part in the presidential election which took place that year leaving their corps to Osterhaus and Ransom I have no doubt that their leaving was at the earnest solicitation of the War Department General Blair got back in time to resume his command and to proceed with it throughout the march to the sea and back to the grand review at Washington General Logan did not return to his command until after it reached Savannah Logan felt very much aggrieved at the transfer of General Howard from that portion of the Army of the Potomac which was then with the Western Army to the command of the Army of the Tennessee with which army General Logan had served from the battle of Belmont to the fall of Atlanta having passed successively through all grades from colonel commanding a regiment to general commanding a brigade division and army corps until upon the death of McPherson the command of the entire Army of the Tennessee devolved upon him in the midst of a hotly contested battle He conceived that he had done his full duty as commander in that engagement and I can bear testimony from personal observation that he had proved himself fully equal to all the lower positions which he had occupied as a soldier I will not pretend to question the motive which actuated Sherman in taking an officer from another army to supersede General Logan I have no doubt whatever that he did this for what he considered would be to the good of the service which was more important than that the personal feelings of any individual should not be aggrieved though I doubt whether he had an officer with him who could have filled the place as Logan would have done Differences of opinion must exist between the best of friends as to policies in war and of judgment as to men s fitness The officer who has the command however should be allowed to judge of the fitness of the officers under him unless he is very manifestly wrong Sherman s army after all the depletions numbered about sixty thousand effective men All weak men had been left to hold the rear and those remaining were not only well men but strong and hardy so that he had sixty thousand as good soldiers as ever trod the earth better than any European soldiers because they not only worked like a machine but the machine thought European armies know very little what they are fighting for and care less Included in these sixty thousand troops there were two small divisions of cavalry numbering altogether about four thousand men Hood had about thirty five to forty thousand men independent of Forrest whose forces were operating in Tennessee and Kentucky as mister Davis had promised they should This part of mister Davis s military plan was admirable and promised the best results of anything he could have done according to my judgment I say this because I have criticised his military judgment in the removal of Johnston and also in the appointment of Hood I am aware however that there was high feeling existing at that time between Davis and his subordinate whom I regarded as one of his ablest lieutenants On the fifth of October the railroad back from Atlanta was again very badly broken Hood having got on the track with his army Sherman saw after night from a high point the road burning for miles The defence of the railroad by our troops was very gallant but they could not hold points between their intrenched positions against Hood s whole army in fact they made no attempt to do so but generally the intrenched positions were held as well as important bridges and store located at them Allatoona for instance was defended by a small force of men under the command of General Corse one of the very able and efficient volunteer officers produced by the war He with a small force was cut off from the remainder of the National army and was attacked with great vigor by many times his own number Sherman from his high position could see the battle raging with the Confederate troops between him and his subordinate He sent men of course to raise the temporary siege but the time that would be necessarily consumed in reaching Corse would be so great that all occupying the intrenchments might be dead Corse was a man who would never surrender From a high position some of Sherman s signal corps discovered a signal flag waving from a hole in the block house at Allatoona It was from Corse He had been shot through the face but he signalled to his chief a message which left no doubt of his determination to hold his post at all hazards It was at this point probably that Sherman first realized that with the forces at his disposal the keeping open of his line of communication with the North would be impossible if he expected to retain any force with which to operate offensively beyond Atlanta He proposed therefore to destroy the roads back to Chattanooga when all ready to move and leave the latter place garrisoned Yet before abandoning the railroad it was necessary that he should repair damages already done and hold the road until he could get forward such supplies ordnance stores and small rations as he wanted to carry with him on his proposed march and to return to the north his surplus artillery his object being to move light and to have no more artillery than could be used to advantage on the field Sherman thought Hood would follow him though he proposed to prepare for the contingency of the latter moving the other way while he was moving south by making Thomas strong enough to hold Tennessee and Kentucky I myself was thoroughly satisfied that Hood would go north as he did On the twod of November I telegraphed Sherman authorizing him definitely to move according to the plan he had proposed that is cutting loose from his base giving up Atlanta and the railroad back to Chattanooga To strengthen Thomas he sent Stanley fourth corps back and also ordered Schofield commanding the Army of the Ohio twelve thousand strong to report to him In addition to this A J Smith who with two divisions of Sherman s army was in Missouri aiding Rosecrans in driving the enemy from that State was under orders to return to Thomas and under the most unfavorable circumstances might be expected to arrive there long before Hood could reach Nashville In addition to this the new levies of troops that were being raised in the North west went to Thomas as rapidly as enrolled and equipped Thomas without any of these additions spoken of had a garrison at Chattanooga which had been strengthened by one division and garrisons at Bridgeport Stevenson Decatur Murfreesboro and Florence There were already with him in Nashville ten thousand soldiers in round numbers and many thousands of employees in the quartermaster s and other departments who could be put in the intrenchments in front of Nashville for its defence Also Wilson was there with ten thousand dismounted cavalrymen who were being equipped for the field Thomas had at this time about forty five thousand men without any of the reinforcements here above enumerated These reinforcements gave him altogether about seventy thousand men without counting what might be added by the new levies already spoken of About this time Beauregard arrived upon the field not to supersede Hood in command but to take general charge over the entire district in which Hood and Sherman were or might be operating He made the most frantic appeals to the citizens for assistance to be rendered in every way by sending reinforcements by destroying supplies on the line of march of the invaders by destroying the bridges over which they would have to cross and by in every way obstructing the roads to their front But it was hard to convince the people of the propriety of destroying supplies which were so much needed by themselves and each one hoped that his own possessions might escape Hood soon started north and went into camp near Decatur Alabama where he remained until the twenty ninth of October but without making an attack on the garrison of that place The Tennessee River was patrolled by gunboats from Muscle Shoals east and also below the second shoals out to the Ohio River These with the troops that might be concentrated from the garrisons along the river at any point where Hood might choose to attempt to cross made it impossible for him to cross the Tennessee at any place where it was navigable But Muscle Shoals is not navigable and below them again is another shoal which also obstructs navigation Hood therefore moved down to a point nearly opposite Florence Alabama crossed over and remained there for some time collecting supplies of food forage and ammunition All of these had to come from a considerable distance south because the region in which he was then situated was mountainous with small valleys which produced but little and what they had produced had long since been exhausted On the first of November I suggested to Sherman and also asked his views thereon the propriety of destroying Hood before he started on his campaign On the twod of November as stated I approved definitely his making his proposed campaign through Georgia leaving Hood behind to the tender mercy of Thomas and the troops in his command Sherman fixed the tenth of November as the day of starting Sherman started on that day to get back to Atlanta and on the fifteenth the real march to the sea commenced The right wing under Howard and the cavalry went to Jonesboro Milledgeville then the capital of Georgia being Sherman s objective or stopping place on the way to Savannah The left wing moved to Stone Mountain along roads much farther east than those taken by the right wing Slocum was in command and threatened Augusta as the point to which he was moving but he was to turn off and meet the right wing at Milledgeville Atlanta was destroyed so far as to render it worthless for military purposes before starting Sherman himself remaining over a day to superintend the work and see that it was well done Sherman s orders for this campaign were perfect Before starting he had sent back all sick disabled and weak men retaining nothing but the hardy well inured soldiers to accompany him on his long march in prospect His artillery was reduced to sixty five guns The ammunition carried with them was two hundred rounds for musket and gun Small rations were taken in a small wagon train which was loaded to its capacity for rapid movement The army was expected to live on the country and to always keep the wagons full of forage and provisions against a possible delay of a few days The troops both of the right and left wings made most of their advance along the line of railroads which they destroyed The method adopted to perform this work was to burn and destroy all the bridges and culverts and for a long distance at places to tear up the track and bend the rails Soldiers to do this rapidly would form a line along one side of the road with crowbars and poles place these under the rails and hoisting all at once turn over many rods of road at one time The ties would then be placed in piles and the rails as they were loosened would be carried and put across these log heaps When a sufficient number of rails were placed upon a pile of ties it would be set on fire This would heat the rails very much more in the middle that being over the main part of the fire than at the ends so that they would naturally bend of their own weight but the soldiers to increase the damage would take tongs and one or two men at each end of the rail carry it with force against the nearest tree and twist it around thus leaving rails forming bands to ornament the forest trees of Georgia All this work was going on at the same time there being a sufficient number of men detailed for that purpose Some piled the logs and built the fire some put the rails upon the fire while others would bend those that were sufficiently heated so that by the time the last bit of road was torn up that it was designed to destroy at a certain place the rails previously taken up were already destroyed The organization for supplying the army was very complete Each brigade furnished a company to gather supplies of forage and provisions for the command to which they belonged Strict injunctions were issued against pillaging or otherwise unnecessarily annoying the people but everything in shape of food for man and forage for beast was taken The supplies were turned over to the brigade commissary and quartermaster and were issued by them to their respective commands precisely the same as if they had been purchased The captures consisted largely of cattle sheep poultry some bacon cornmeal often molasses and occasionally coffee or other small rations The skill of these men called by themselves and the army bummers in collecting their loads and getting back to their respective commands was marvellous When they started out in the morning they were always on foot but scarcely one of them returned in the evening without being mounted on a horse or mule These would be turned in for the general use of the army and the next day these men would start out afoot and return again in the evening mounted Many of the exploits of these men would fall under the head of romance indeed I am afraid that in telling some of their experiences the romance got the better of the truth upon which the story was founded and that in the way many of these anecdotes are told very little of the foundation is left I suspect that most of them consist chiefly of the fiction added to make the stories better In one instance it was reported that a few men of Sherman s army passed a house where they discovered some chickens under the dwelling They immediately proceeded to capture them to add to the army s supplies The lady of the house who happened to be at home made piteous appeals to have these spared saying they were a few she had put away to save by permission of other parties who had preceded and who had taken all the others that she had The soldiers seemed moved at her appeal but looking at the chickens again they were tempted and one of them replied The rebellion must be suppressed if it takes the last chicken in the Confederacy and proceeded to appropriate the last one Another anecdote characteristic of these times has been told The South prior to the rebellion kept bloodhounds to pursue runaway slaves who took refuge in the neighboring swamps and also to hunt convicts Orders were issued to kill all these animals as they were met with On one occasion a soldier picked up a poodle the favorite pet of its mistress and was carrying it off to execution when the lady made a strong appeal to him to spare it The soldier replied Madam our orders are to kill every bloodhound But this is not a bloodhound said the lady Well madam we cannot tell what it will grow into if we leave it behind said the soldier as he went off with it Notwithstanding these anecdotes and the necessary hardship they would seem to imply I do not believe there was much unwarrantable pillaging considering that we were in the enemy s territory and without any supplies except such as the country afforded On the twenty threed Sherman with the left wing reached Milledgeville The right wing was not far off but proceeded on its way towards Savannah destroying the road as it went The troops at Milledgeville remained over a day to destroy factories buildings used for military purposes et cetera before resuming its march The governor who had been almost defying mister Davis before this now fled precipitately as did the legislature of the State and all the State officers The governor Sherman says was careful to carry away even his garden vegetables while he left the archives of the State to fall into our hands The only military force that was opposed to Sherman s forward march was the Georgia militia a division under the command of General G W Smith and a battalion under Harry Wayne Neither the quality of the forces nor their numbers was sufficient to even retard the progress of Sherman s army The people at the South became so frantic at this time at the successful invasion of Georgia that they took the cadets from the military college and added them to the ranks of the militia They even liberated the State convicts under promise from them that they would serve in the army I have but little doubt that the worst acts that were attributed to Sherman s army were committed by these convicts and by other Southern people who ought to have been under sentence such people as could be found in every community North and South who took advantage of their country being invaded to commit crime They were in but little danger of detection or of arrest even if detected The Southern papers in commenting upon Sherman s movements pictured him as in the most deplorable condition stating that his men were starving that they were demoralized and wandering about almost without object aiming only to reach the sea coast and get under the protection of our navy These papers got to the North and had more or less effect upon the minds of the people causing much distress to all loyal persons particularly to those who had husbands sons or brothers with Sherman mister Lincoln seeing these accounts had a letter written asking me if I could give him anything that he could say to the loyal people that would comfort them I told him there was not the slightest occasion for alarm that with sixty thousand such men as Sherman had with him such a commanding officer as he was could not be cut off in the open country He might possibly be prevented from reaching the point he had started out to reach but he would get through somewhere and would finally get to his chosen destination and even if worst came to worst he could return North I heard afterwards of mister Lincoln s saying to those who would inquire of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman s army that Sherman was all right Grant says they are safe with such a general and that if they cannot get out where they want to they can crawl back by the hole they went in at While at Milledgeville the soldiers met at the State House organized a legislature and proceeded to business precisely as if they were the legislative body belonging to the State of Georgia The debates were exciting and were upon the subject of the situation the South was in at that time particularly the State of Georgia They went so far as to repeal after a spirited and acrimonious debate the ordinance of secession The next day twenty fourth Sherman continued his march going by the way of Waynesboro and Louisville Millen being the next objective and where the two columns the right and left wings were to meet The left wing moved to the left of the direct road and the cavalry still farther off so as to make it look as though Augusta was the point they were aiming for They moved on all the roads they could find leading in that direction The cavalry was sent to make a rapid march in hope of surprising Millen before the Union prisoners could be carried away but they failed in this The distance from Milledgeville to Millen was about one hundred miles At this point Wheeler who had been ordered from Tennessee arrived and swelled the numbers and efficiency of the troops confronting Sherman Hardee a native of Georgia also came but brought no troops with him It was intended that he should raise as large an army as possible with which to intercept Sherman s march He did succeed in raising some troops and with these and those under the command of Wheeler and Wayne had an army sufficient to cause some annoyance but no great detention Our cavalry and Wheeler s had a pretty severe engagement in which Wheeler was driven towards Augusta thus giving the idea that Sherman was probably making for that point Millen was reached on the threed of December and the march was resumed the following day for Savannah the final objective Bragg had now been sent to Augusta with some troops Wade Hampton was there also trying to raise cavalry sufficient to destroy Sherman s army If he ever raised a force it was too late to do the work expected of it Hardee s whole force probably numbered less than ten thousand men From Millen to Savannah the country is sandy and poor and affords but very little forage other than rice straw which was then growing This answered a very good purpose as forage and the rice grain was an addition to the soldier s rations No further resistance worthy of note was met with until within a few miles of Savannah This place was found to be intrenched and garrisoned Sherman proceeded at once on his arrival to invest the place and found that the enemy had placed torpedoes in the ground which were to explode when stepped on by man or beast One of these exploded under an officer s horse blowing the animal to pieces and tearing one of the legs of the officer so badly that it had to be amputated Sherman at once ordered his prisoners to the front moving them in a compact body in advance to either explode the torpedoes or dig them up No further explosion took place On the tenth of December the siege of Savannah commenced Sherman then before proceeding any further with operations for the capture of the place started with some troops to open communication with our fleet which he expected to find in the lower harbor or as near by as the forts of the enemy would permit In marching to the coast he encountered Fort Mc Allister which it was necessary to reduce before the supplies he might find on shipboard could be made available Fort Mc Allister was soon captured by an assault made by General Hazen s division Communication was then established with the fleet The capture of Savannah then only occupied a few days and involved no great loss of life The garrison however as we shall see was enabled to escape by crossing the river and moving eastward When Sherman had opened communication with the fleet he found there a steamer which I had forwarded to him carrying the accumulated mails for his army also supplies which I supposed he would be in need of General J G Foster who commanded all the troops south of North Carolina on the Atlantic sea board visited General Sherman before he had opened communication with the fleet with the view of ascertaining what assistance he could be to him Foster returned immediately to his own headquarters at Hilton Head for the purpose of sending Sherman siege guns and also if he should find he had them to spare supplies of clothing hard bread et cetera thinking that these articles might not be found outside The mail on the steamer which I sent down had been collected by Colonel A H Markland of the Post Office Department who went in charge of it On this same vessel I sent an officer of my staff Lieutenant Dunn with the following letter to General Sherman CITY POINT VA Dec three eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN Commanding Armies near Savannah Ga The little information gleaned from the Southern press indicating no great obstacle to your progress I have directed your mails which had been previously collected at Baltimore by Colonel Markland Special Agent of the Post Office Department to be sent as far as the blockading squadron off Savannah to be forwarded to you as soon as heard from on the coast Not liking to rejoice before the victory is assured I abstain from congratulating you and those under your command until bottom has been struck I have never had a fear however for the result Since you left Atlanta no very great progress has been made here The enemy has been closely watched though and prevented from detaching against you I think not one man has gone from here except some twelve or fifteen hundred dismounted cavalry Bragg has gone from Wilmington I am trying to take advantage of his absence to get possession of that place Owing to some preparations Admiral Porter and General Butler are making to blow up Fort Fisher which while hoping for the best I do not believe a particle in there is a delay in getting this expedition off I hope they will be ready to start by the seventh and that Bragg will not have started back by that time In this letter I do not intend to give you anything like directions for future action but will state a general idea I have and will get your views after you have established yourself on the sea coast With your veteran army I hope to get control of the only two through routes from east to west possessed by the enemy before the fall of Atlanta The condition will be filled by holding Savannah and Augusta or by holding any other port to the east of Savannah and Branchville If Wilmington falls a force from there can company operate with you Thomas has got back into the defences of Nashville with Hood close upon him Decatur has been abandoned and so have all the roads except the main one leading to Chattanooga Part of this falling back was undoubtedly necessary and all of it may have been It did not look so however to me In my opinion Thomas far outnumbers Hood in infantry In cavalry Hood has the advantage in morale and numbers I hope yet that Hood will be badly crippled if not destroyed The general news you will learn from the papers better than I could give it After all becomes quiet and roads become so bad up here that there is likely to be a week or two when nothing can be done I will run down the coast to see you If you desire it I will ask missus Sherman to go with me Yours truly U S GRANT Lieutenant General I quote this letter because it gives the reader a full knowledge of the events of that period Sherman now the fifteenth returned to Savannah to complete its investment and insure the surrender of the garrison The country about Savannah is low and marshy and the city was well intrenched from the river above to the river below and assaults could not be made except along a comparatively narrow causeway For this reason assaults must have resulted in serious destruction of life to the Union troops with the chance of failing altogether Sherman therefore decided upon a complete investment of the place When he believed this investment completed he summoned the garrison to surrender General Hardee who was in command replied in substance that the condition of affairs was not such as Sherman had described He said he was in full communication with his department and was receiving supplies constantly Hardee however was cut off entirely from all communication with the west side of the river and by the river itself to the north and south On the South Carolina side the country was all rice fields through which it would have been impossible to bring supplies so that Hardee had no possible communication with the outside world except by a dilapidated plank road starting from the west bank of the river Sherman receiving this reply proceeded in person to a point on the coast where General Foster had troops stationed under General Hatch for the purpose of making arrangements with the latter officer to go through by one of the numerous channels running inland along that part of the coast of South Carolina to the plank road which General Hardee still possessed and thus to cut him off from the last means he had of getting supplies if not of communication While arranging for this movement and before the attempt to execute the plan had been commenced Sherman received information through one of his staff officers that the enemy had evacuated Savannah the night before This was the night of the twenty first of December Before evacuating the place Hardee had blown up the navy yard Some iron clads had been destroyed as well as other property that might have been valuable to us but he left an immense amount of stores untouched consisting of cotton railroad cars workshops numerous pieces of artillery and several thousand stands of small arms A little incident occurred soon after the fall of Savannah which Sherman relates in his Memoirs and which is worthy of repetition Savannah was one of the points where blockade runners entered Shortly after the city fell into our possession a blockade runner came sailing up serenely not doubting but the Confederates were still in possession It was not molested and the captain did not find out his mistake until he had tied up and gone to the Custom House where he found a new occupant of the building and made a less profitable disposition of his vessel and cargo than he had expected As there was some discussion as to the authorship of Sherman s march to the sea by critics of his book when it appeared before the public I want to state here that no question upon that subject was ever raised between General Sherman and myself Circumstances made the plan on which Sherman expected to act impracticable as as commander of the forces he necessarily had to devise a new on which would give more promise of success consequently he recommended the destruction of the railroad back to Chattanooga and that he should be authorized then to move as he did from Atlanta forward His suggestions were finally approved although they did not immediately find favor in Washington Even when it came to the time of starting the greatest apprehension as to the propriety of the campaign he was about commence filled the mind of the President induced no doubt by his advisers This went so far as to move the President to ask me to suspend Sherman s march for a day or two until I could think the matter over My recollection is though I find no record to show it that out of deference to the President s wish I did send a dispatch to Sherman asking him to wait a day or two or else the connections between us were already cut so that I could not do so However this may be the question of who devised the plan of march from Atlanta to Savannah is easily answered it was clearly Sherman and to him also belongs the credit of its brilliant execution It was hardly possible that any one else than those on the spot could have devised a new plan of campaign to supersede one that did not promise success forty I was in favor of Sherman s plan from the time it was first submitted to me My chief of staff however was very bitterly opposed to it and as I learned subsequently finding that he could not move me he appealed to the authorities at Washington to stop it CHAPTER LX THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN THE BATTLE OF NASHVILLE As we have seen Hood succeeded in crossing the Tennessee River between Muscle Shoals and the lower shoals at the end of October eighteen sixty four Thomas sent Schofield with the fourth and twenty threed corps together with three brigades of Wilson s cavalry to Pulaski to watch him On the seventeenth of November Hood started and moved in such a manner 
4196-23955-0000	train-other-500	as to avoid Schofield thereby turning his position Hood had with him three infantry corps commanded respectively by Stephen D Lee Stewart and Cheatham
4196-23955-0001	train-other-500	These with his cavalry numbered about forty five thousand men Schofield had of
none	none	 all arms about thirty thousand Thomas s orders were therefore 
4196-23955-0002	train-other-500	for Schofield to watch the movements of the enemy but not to fight a battle if he could avoid it but to fall back in case of an advance on Nashville and to fight the enemy as he fell back
4196-23955-0003	train-other-500	so as to retard the enemy s movements until he could be reinforced by Thomas himself As soon as Schofield saw this movement of Hood s he sent his trains to the rear
4196-23955-0004	train-other-500	but did not fall back himself until the twenty first and then only to Columbia At Columbia there was a slight skirmish but no battle From this place Schofield then retreated to Franklin
4196-23955-0005	train-other-500	He had sent his wagons in advance and Stanley had gone with them with two divisions to protect them Cheatham s corps of Hood s army pursued the wagon train and went into camp at Spring Hill
4196-23955-0006	train-other-500	for the night of the twenty ninth Schofield retreating from Columbia on the twenty ninth passed Spring Hill where Cheatham was bivouacked during the night without molestation though within half a mile of where the Confederates were encamped
4196-23955-0007	train-other-500	On the morning of the thirtieth he had arrived at Franklin Hood followed closely and reached Franklin in time to make an attack the same day The fight was very desperate and sanguinary
4196-23955-0008	train-other-500	The Confederate generals led their men in the repeated charges and the loss among them was of unusual proportions This fighting continued with great severity until long after the night closed in
4196-23955-0009	train-other-500	when the Confederates drew off General Stanley who commanded two divisions of the Union troops and whose troops bore the brunt of the battle was wounded in the fight but maintained his position
none	none	 The enemy s loss at Franklin according to Thomas s report was seventeen fifty buried upon the field by our troops three thousand eight hundred in the hospital and seven hundred two prisoners besides Schofield s loss as officially reported was one hundred eighty nine killed ten thirty three wounded and eleven oh four captured and missing Thomas made no effort to reinforce Schofield at Franklin as it seemed to me at the time he should have done 
4196-23955-0012	train-other-500	and fight out the battle there He simply ordered Schofield to continue his retreat to Nashville which the latter did during that night and the next day Thomas in the meantime
4196-23955-0013	train-other-500	was making his preparations to receive Hood The road to Chattanooga was still well guarded with strong garrisons at Murfreesboro Stevenson Bridgeport and Chattanooga
4196-23955-0014	train-other-500	Thomas had previously given up Decatur and had been reinforced by A J Smith s two divisions just returned from Missouri He also had Steedman s division and R S Granger s
4196-23955-0015	train-other-500	which he had drawn from the front His quartermaster s men about ten thousand in number had been organized and armed under the command of the chief quartermaster General J L Donaldson
4196-23955-0016	train-other-500	and placed in the fortifications under the general supervision of General Z B Tower of the United States Engineers
4196-23955-0017	train-other-500	Hood was allowed to move upon Nashville and to invest that place almost without interference Thomas was strongly fortified in his position
4196-23955-0018	train-other-500	so that he would have been safe against the attack of Hood He had troops enough even to annihilate him in the open field To me his delay was unaccountable
4196-23955-0019	train-other-500	sitting there and permitting himself to be invested so that in the end to raise the siege he would have to fight the enemy strongly posted behind fortifications It is true the weather was very bad
4196-23955-0020	train-other-500	The rain was falling and freezing as it fell so that the ground was covered with a sheet of ice that made it very difficult to move But I was afraid that the enemy would find means of moving
4196-23955-0021	train-other-500	elude Thomas and manage to get north of the Cumberland River If he did this I apprehended most serious results from the campaign in the North
4196-23955-0022	train-other-500	and was afraid we might even have to send troops from the East to head him off if he got there General Thomas s movements being always so deliberate and so slow though
none	none	 effective in 
4196-23955-0023	train-other-500	defence I consequently
none	none	 urged Thomas in frequent dispatches sent from City Point forty one to make the attack at once 
4196-23955-0024	train-other-500	The country was alarmed the administration was alarmed and I was alarmed lest the very thing would take place which I have just described that is Hood would get north
4196-23955-0025	train-other-500	It was all without avail further than to elicit dispatches from Thomas saying that he was getting ready to move as soon as he could that he was making preparations et cetera
4196-23955-0026	train-other-500	At last I had to say to General Thomas that I should be obliged to remove him unless he acted promptly He replied that he was very sorry but he would move as soon as he could General Logan
4196-23955-0027	train-other-500	happening to visit City Point about that time and knowing him as a prompt gallant and efficient officer I gave him an order to proceed to Nashville to relieve Thomas I directed him however
4196-23955-0028	train-other-500	not to deliver the order or publish it until he reached there and if Thomas had moved then not to deliver it at all but communicate with me by telegraph After Logan started
4196-23955-0029	train-other-500	in thinking over the situation I became restless and concluded to go myself I went as far as Washington City when a dispatch was received from General Thomas announcing his readiness at last to move
4196-23955-0030	train-other-500	and designating the time of his movement I concluded to wait until that time He did move and was successful from the start This was on the fifteenth of December
4196-23955-0031	train-other-500	General Logan was at Louisville at the time this movement was made and telegraphed the fact to Washington and proceeded no farther himself The battle during the fifteenth was severe
4196-23955-0032	train-other-500	but favorable to the Union troops and continued until night closed in upon the combat The next day the battle was renewed After a successful assault upon Hood s men in their intrenchments
4196-23955-0033	train-other-500	the enemy fled in disorder routed and broken leaving their dead their artillery and small arms in great numbers on the field besides the wounded that were captured Our cavalry had fought on foot as infantry
none	none	 and had not their horses with them so that they were not ready to join in the pursuit the moment the enemy retreated They sent back however for their horses and endeavored to get to Franklin ahead of Hood s broken army 
4196-23955-0034	train-other-500	by the Granny White Road but too much time was consumed in getting started They had got but a few miles beyond the scene of the battle when they found the enemy s cavalry dismounted and behind intrenchments
4196-23955-0035	train-other-500	covering the road on which they were advancing Here another battle ensued our men dismounting and fighting on foot in which the Confederates were again routed and driven in great disorder
4196-23955-0036	train-other-500	Our cavalry then went into bivouac and renewed the pursuit on the following morning They were too late The enemy already had possession of Franklin and was beyond them
4196-23955-0037	train-other-500	It now became a chase in which the Confederates had the lead Our troops continued the pursuit to within a few miles of Columbia where they found the rebels had destroyed the railroad bridge
none	none	 as well as all other bridges over Duck River 
4196-23955-0038	train-other-500	The heavy rains of a few days before had swelled the stream into a mad torrent impassable except on bridges Unfortunately either through a mistake in the wording of the order or otherwise
4196-23955-0039	train-other-500	the pontoon bridge which was to have been sent by rail out to Franklin to be taken thence with the pursuing column had gone toward Chattanooga
none	none	 There was consequently a delay of some four days in building bridges out of the remains of the old railroad bridge Of course Hood got such a start in this time that farther pursuit was useless although it was continued for some distance but without coming upon him again CHAPTER LXI EXPEDITION AGAINST FORT FISHER ATTACK ON THE FORT FAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION SECOND EXPEDITION AGAINST THE FORT CAPTURE OF FORT FISHER Up to January eighteen sixty five the enemy occupied Fort Fisher at the mouth of Cape Fear River and below the City of Wilmington This port was of immense importance to the Confederates because it formed their principal inlet for blockade runners by means of which they brought in from abroad such supplies and munitions of war as they could not produce at home It was equally important to us to get possession of it not only because it was desirable to cut off their supplies so as to insure a speedy termination of the war but also because foreign governments particularly the British Government were constantly threatening that unless ours could maintain the blockade of that coast they should cease to recognize any blockade For these reasons I determined with the concurrence of the Navy Department in December to send an expedition against Fort Fisher for the purpose of capturing it To show the difficulty experienced in maintaining the blockade I will mention a circumstance that took place at Fort Fisher after its fall Two English blockade runners came in at night Their commanders not supposing the fort had fallen worked their way through all our fleet and got into the river unobserved They then signalled the fort announcing their arrival There was a colored man in the fort who had been there before and who understood these signals He informed General Terry what reply he should make to have them come in and Terry did as he advised The vessels came in their officers entirely unconscious that they were falling into the hands of the Union forces Even after they were brought in to the fort they were entertained in conversation for some little time before suspecting that the Union troops were occupying the fort They were finally informed that their vessels and cargoes were prizes I selected General Weitzel of the Army of the James to go with the expedition but gave instructions through General Butler He commanded the department within whose geographical limits Fort Fisher was situated as well as Beaufort and other points on that coast held by our troops he was therefore entitled to the right of fitting out the expedition against Fort Fisher General Butler conceived the idea that if a steamer loaded heavily with powder could be run up to near the shore under the fort and exploded it would create great havoc and make the capture an easy matter Admiral Porter who was to command the naval squadron seemed to fall in with the idea and it was not disapproved of in Washington the navy was therefore given the task of preparing the steamer for this purpose I had no confidence in the success of the scheme and so expressed myself but as no serious harm could come of the experiment and the authorities at Washington seemed desirous to have it tried I permitted it The steamer was sent to Beaufort North Carolina and was there loaded with powder and prepared for the part she was to play in the reduction of Fort Fisher General Butler chose to go in command of the expedition himself and was all ready to sail by the ninth of December eighteen sixty four Very heavy storms prevailed however at that time along that part of the sea coast and prevented him from getting off until the thirteenth or fourteenth His advance arrived off Fort Fisher on the fifteenth The naval force had been already assembled or was assembling but they were obliged to run into Beaufort for munitions coal et cetera then too the powder boat was not yet fully prepared The fleet was ready to proceed on the eighteenth but Butler who had remained outside from the fifteenth up to that time now found himself out of coal fresh water et cetera and had to put into Beaufort to replenish Another storm overtook him and several days more were lost before the army and navy were both ready at the same time to company operate On the night of the twenty threed the powder boat was towed in by a gunboat as near to the fort as it was safe to run She was then propelled by her own machinery to within about five hundred yards of the shore There the clockwork which was to explode her within a certain length of time was set and she was abandoned Everybody left and even the vessels put out to sea to prevent the effect of the explosion upon them At two o clock in the morning the explosion took place and produced no more effect on the fort or anything else on land than the bursting of a boiler anywhere on the Atlantic Ocean would have done Indeed when the troops in Fort Fisher heard the explosion they supposed it was the bursting of a boiler in one of the Yankee gunboats Fort Fisher was situated upon a low flat peninsula north of Cape Fear River The soil is sandy Back a little the peninsula is very heavily wooded and covered with fresh water swamps The fort ran across this peninsula about five hundred yards in width and extended along the sea coast about thirteen hundred yards The fort had an armament of twenty one guns and three mortars on the land side and twenty four guns on the sea front At that time it was only garrisoned by four companies of infantry one light battery and the gunners at the heavy guns less than seven hundred men with a reserve of less than a thousand men five miles up the peninsula General Whiting of the Confederate army was in command and General Bragg was in command of the force at Wilmington Both commenced calling for reinforcements the moment they saw our troops landing The Governor of North Carolina called for everybody who could stand behind a parapet and shoot a gun to join them In this way they got two or three hundred additional men into Fort Fisher and Hoke s division five or six thousand strong was sent down from Richmond A few of these troops arrived the very day that Butler was ready to advance On the twenty fourth the fleet formed for an attack in arcs of concentric circles their heavy iron clads going in very close range being nearest the shore and leaving intervals or spaces so that the outer vessels could fire between them Porter was thus enabled to throw one hundred and fifteen shells per minute The damage done to the fort by these shells was very slight only two or three cannon being disabled in the fort But the firing silenced all the guns by making it too hot for the men to maintain their positions about them and compelling them to seek shelter in the bomb proofs On the next day part of Butler s troops under General Adelbert Ames effected a landing out of range of the fort without difficulty This was accomplished under the protection of gunboats sent for the purpose and under cover of a renewed attack upon the fort by the fleet They formed a line across the peninsula and advanced part going north and part toward the fort covering themselves as they did so Curtis pushed forward and came near to Fort Fisher capturing the small garrison at what was called the Flag Pond Battery Weitzel accompanied him to within a half a mile of the works Here he saw that the fort had not been injured and so reported to Butler advising against an assault Ames who had gone north in his advance captured two hundred twenty eight of the reserves These prisoners reported to Butler that sixteen hundred of Hoke s division of six thousand from Richmond had already arrived and the rest would soon be in his rear Upon these reports Butler determined to withdraw his troops from the peninsula and return to the fleet At that time there had not been a man on our side injured except by one of the shells from the fleet Curtis had got within a few yards of the works Some of his men had snatched a flag from the parapet of the fort and others had taken a horse from the inside of the stockade At night Butler informed Porter of his withdrawal giving the reasons above stated and announced his purpose as soon as his men could embark to start for Hampton Roads Porter represented to him that he had sent to Beaufort for more ammunition He could fire much faster than he had been doing and would keep the enemy from showing himself until our men were within twenty yards of the fort and he begged that Butler would leave some brave fellows like those who had snatched the flag from the parapet and taken the horse from the fort Butler was unchangeable He got all his troops aboard except Curtis s brigade and started back In doing this Butler made a fearful mistake My instructions to him or to the officer who went in command of the expedition were explicit in the statement that to effect a landing would be of itself a great victory and if one should be effected the foothold must not be relinquished on the contrary a regular siege of the fort must be commenced and to guard against interference by reason of storms supplies of provisions must be laid in as soon as they could be got on shore But General Butler seems to have lost sight of this part of his instructions and was back at Fort Monroe on the twenty eighth I telegraphed to the President as follows CITY POINT VA Dec twenty eight eighteen sixty four eight point thirty P M The Wilmington expedition has proven a gross and culpable failure Many of the troops are back here Delays and free talk of the object of the expedition enabled the enemy to move troops to Wilmington to defeat it After the expedition sailed from Fort Monroe three days of fine weather were squandered during which the enemy was without a force to protect himself Who is to blame will I hope be known U S GRANT Lieutenant General Porter sent dispatches to the Navy Department in which he complained bitterly of having been abandoned by the army just when the fort was nearly in our possession and begged that our troops might be sent back again to cooperate but with a different commander As soon as I heard this I sent a messenger to Porter with a letter asking him to hold on I assured him that I fully sympathized with him in his disappointment and that I would send the same troops back with a different commander with some reinforcements to offset those which the enemy had received I told him it would take some little time to get transportation for the additional troops but as soon as it could be had the men should be on their way to him and there would be no delay on my part I selected A H Terry to command It was the sixth of January before the transports could be got ready and the troops aboard They sailed from Fortress Monroe on that day The object and destination of the second expedition were at the time kept a secret to all except a few in the Navy Department and in the army to whom it was necessary to impart the information General Terry had not the slightest idea of where he was going or what he was to do He simply knew that he was going to sea and that he had his orders with him which were to be opened when out at sea He was instructed to communicate freely with Porter and have entire harmony between army and navy because the work before them would require the best efforts of both arms of service They arrived off Beaufort on the eighth A heavy storm however prevented a landing at Forth Fisher until the thirteenth The navy prepared itself for attack about as before and the same time assisted the army in landing this time five miles away Only iron clads fired at first the object being to draw the fire of the enemy s guns so as to ascertain their positions This object being accomplished they then let in their shots thick and fast Very soon the guns were all silenced and the fort showed evident signs of being much injured Terry deployed his men across the peninsula as had been done before and at two o clock on the following morning was up within two miles of the fort with a respectable abatis in front of his line His artillery was all landed on that day the fourteenth Again Curtis s brigade of Ame s division had the lead By noon they had carried an unfinished work less than a half mile from the fort and turned it so as to face the other way Terry now saw Porter and arranged for an assault on the following day The two commanders arranged their signals so that they could communicate with each other from time to time as they might have occasion At day light the fleet commenced its firing The time agreed upon for the assault was the middle of the afternoon and Ames who commanded the assaulting column moved at three point thirty Porter landed a force of sailors and marines to move against the sea front in company operation with Ames s assault They were under Commander Breese of the navy These sailors and marines had worked their way up to within a couple of hundred yards of the fort before the assault The signal was given and the assault was made but the poor sailors and marines were repulsed and very badly handled by the enemy losing two hundred eighty killed and wounded out of their number Curtis s brigade charged successfully though met by a heavy fire some of the men having to wade through the swamp up to their waists to reach the fort Many were wounded of course and some killed but they soon reached the palisades These they cut away and pushed on through The other troops then came up Pennypacker s following Curtis and Bell who commanded the threed brigade of Ames s division following Pennypacker But the fort was not yet captured though the parapet was gained The works were very extensive The large parapet around the work would have been but very little protection to those inside except when they were close up under it Traverses had therefore been run until really the work was a succession of small forts enclosed by a large one The rebels made a desperate effort to hold the fort and had to be driven from these traverses one by one The fight continued till long after night Our troops gained first one traverse and then another and by ten o clock at night the place was carried During this engagement the sailors who had been repulsed in their assault on the bastion rendered the best service they could by reinforcing Terry s northern line thus enabling him to send a detachment to the assistance of Ames The fleet kept up a continuous fire upon that part of the fort which was still occupied by the enemy By means of signals they could be informed where to direct their shots During the succeeding nights the enemy blew up Fort Caswell on the opposite side of Cape Fear River and abandoned two extensive works on Smith s Island in the river Our captures in all amounted to one hundred sixty nine guns besides small arms with full supplies of ammunition and twenty eighty three prisoners In addition to these there were about seven hundred dead and wounded left there We had lost one hundred ten killed and five hundred thirty six wounded In this assault on Fort Fisher Bell one of the brigade commanders was killed and two Curtis and Pennypacker were badly wounded Secretary Stanton who was on his way back from Savannah arrived off Fort Fisher soon after it fell When he heard the good news he promoted all the officers of any considerable rank for their conspicuous gallantry Terry had been nominated for major general but had not been confirmed This confirmed him and soon after I recommended him for a brigadier generalcy in the regular army and it was given to him for this victory CHAPTER LXII SHERMAN S MARCH NORTH SHERIDAN ORDERED TO LYNCHBURG CANBY ORDERED TO MOVE AGAINST MOBILE MOVEMENTS OF SCHOFIELD AND THOMAS CAPTURE OF COLUMBIA SOUTH CAROLINA SHERMAN IN THE CAROLINAS When news of Sherman being in possession of Savannah reached the North distinguished statesmen and visitors began to pour in to see him Among others who went was the Secretary of War who seemed much pleased at the result of his campaign mister Draper the collector of customs of New York who was with mister Stanton s party was put in charge of the public property that had been abandoned and captured Savannah was then turned over to General Foster s command to hold so that Sherman might have his own entire army free to operate as might be decided upon in the future I sent the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac General Barnard with letters to General Sherman He remained some time with the general and when he returned brought back letters one of which contained suggestions from Sherman as to what ought to be done in company operation with him when he should have started upon his march northward I must not neglect to state here the fact that I had no idea originally of having Sherman march from Savannah to Richmond or even to North Carolina The season was bad the roads impassable for anything except such an army as he had and I should not have thought of ordering such a move I had therefore made preparations to collect transports to carry Sherman and his army around to the James River by water and so informed him On receiving this letter he went to work immediately to prepare for the move but seeing that it would require a long time to collect the transports he suggested the idea then of marching up north through the Carolinas I was only too happy to approve this for if successful it promised every advantage His march through Georgia had thoroughly destroyed all lines of transportation in that State and had completely cut the enemy off from all sources of supply to the west of it If North and South Carolina were rendered helpless so far as capacity for feeding Lee s army was concerned the Confederate garrison at Richmond would be reduced in territory from which to draw supplies to very narrow limits in the State of Virginia and although that section of the country was fertile it was already well exhausted of both forage and food I approved Sherman s suggestion therefore at once The work of preparation was tedious because supplies to load the wagons for the march had to be brought from a long distance Sherman would now have to march through a country furnishing fewer provisions than that he had previously been operating in during his march to the sea Besides he was confronting or marching toward a force of the enemy vastly superior to any his troops had encountered on their previous march and the territory through which he had to pass had now become of such vast importance to the very existence of the Confederate army that the most desperate efforts were to be expected in order to save it Sherman therefore while collecting the necessary supplies to start with made arrangements with Admiral Dahlgren who commanded that part of the navy on the South Carolina and Georgia coast and General Foster commanding the troops to take positions and hold a few points on the sea coast which he Sherman designated in the neighborhood of Charleston This provision was made to enable him to fall back upon the sea coast in case he should encounter a force sufficient to stop his onward progress He also wrote me a letter making suggestions as to what he would like to have done in support of his movement farther north This letter was brought to City Point by General Barnard at a time when I happened to be going to Washington City where I arrived on the twenty first of January I cannot tell the provision I had already made to company operate with Sherman in anticipation of his expected movement better than by giving my reply to this letter HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES WASHINGTON D C Jan twenty one eighteen sixty five MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN Commanding Mill Div of the Mississippi GENERAL Your letters brought by General Barnard were received at City Point and read with interest Not having them with me however I cannot say that in this I will be able to satisfy you on all points of recommendation As I arrived here at one P M and must leave at six P M having in the meantime spent over three hours with the Secretary and General Halleck I must be brief Before your last request to have Thomas make a campaign into the heart of Alabama I had ordered Schofield to Annapolis Md with his corps The advance six thousand will reach the seaboard by the twenty threed the remainder following as rapidly as railroad transportation can be procured from Cincinnati The corps numbers over twenty one thousand men I was induced to do this because I did not believe Thomas could possibly be got off before spring His pursuit of Hood indicated a sluggishness that satisfied me that he would never do to conduct one of your campaigns The command of the advance of the pursuit was left to subordinates whilst Thomas followed far behind When Hood had crossed the Tennessee and those in pursuit had reached it Thomas had not much more than half crossed the State from whence he returned to Nashville to take steamer for Eastport He is possessed of excellent judgment great coolness and honesty but he is not good on a pursuit He also reported his troops fagged and that it was necessary to equip up This report and a determination to give the enemy no rest determined me to use his surplus troops elsewhere Thomas is still left with a sufficient force surplus to go to Selma under an energetic leader He has been telegraphed to to know whether he could go and if so which of the several routes he would select No reply is yet received Canby has been ordered to act offensively from the sea coast to the interior towards Montgomery and Selma Thomas s forces will move from the north at an early day or some of his troops will be sent to Canby Without further reinforcements Canby will have a moving column of twenty thousand men Fort Fisher you are aware has been captured We have a force there of eight thousand effective At New Bern about half the number It is rumored through deserters that Wilmington also has fallen I am inclined to believe the rumor because on the seventeenth we knew the enemy were blowing up their works about Fort Caswell and that on the eighteenth Terry moved on Wilmington If Wilmington is captured Schofield will go there If not he will be sent to New Bern In either event all the surplus forces at the two points will move to the interior toward Goldsboro in company operation with your movements From either point railroad communications can be run out there being here abundance of rolling stock suited to the gauge of those roads There have been about sixteen thousand men sent from Lee s army south Of these you will have fourteen thousand against you if Wilmington is not held by the enemy casualties at Fort Fisher having overtaken about two thousand All these troops are subject to your orders as you come in communication with them They will be so instructed From about Richmond I will watch Lee closely and if he detaches much more or attempts to evacuate will pitch in In the meantime should you be brought to a halt anywhere I can send two corps of thirty thousand effective men to your support from the troops about Richmond To resume Canby is ordered to operate to the interior from the Gulf A J Smith may go from the north but I think it doubtful A force of twenty eight or thirty thousand will company operate with you from New Bern or Wilmington or both You can call for reinforcements This will be handed you by Captain Hudson of my staff who will return with any message you may have for me If there is anything I can do for you in the way of having supplies on ship board at any point on the sea coast ready for you let me know it Yours truly U S GRANT Lieut General I had written on the eighteenth of January to General Sherman giving him the news of the battle of Nashville He was much pleased at the result although like myself he had been very much disappointed at Thomas for permitting Hood to cross the Tennessee River and nearly the whole State of Tennessee and come to Nashville to be attacked there He however as I had done sent Thomas a warm congratulatory letter On the tenth of January eighteen sixty five the resolutions of thanks to Sherman and his army passed by Congress were approved Sherman after the capture at once had the debris cleared up commencing the work by removing the piling and torpedoes from the river and taking up all obstructions He had then intrenched the city so that it could be held by a small garrison By the middle of January all his work was done except the accumulation of supplies to commence his movement with He proposed to move in two columns one from Savannah going along by the river of the same name and the other by roads farther east threatening Charleston He commenced the advance by moving his right wing to Beaufort South Carolina then to Pocotaligo by water This column in moving north threatened Charleston and indeed it was not determined at first that they would have a force visit Charleston South Carolina had done so much to prepare the public mind of the South for secession and had been so active in precipitating the decision of the question before the South was fully prepared to meet it that there was at that time a feeling throughout the North and also largely entertained by people of the South that the State of South Carolina and Charleston the hot bed of secession in particular ought to have a heavy hand laid upon them In fact nothing but the decisive results that followed deterred the radical portion of the people from condemning the movement because Charleston had been left out To pass into the interior would however be to insure the evacuation of the city and its possession by the navy and Foster s troops It is so situated between two formidable rivers that a small garrison could have held it against all odds as long as their supplies would hold out Sherman therefore passed it by By the first of February all preparations were completed for the final march Columbia South Carolina being the first objective Fayetteville North Carolina the second and Goldsboro or neighborhood the final one unless something further should be determined upon The right wing went from Pocotaligo and the left from about Hardeeville on the Savannah River both columns taking a pretty direct route for Columbia The cavalry however were to threaten Charleston on the right and Augusta on the left On the fifteenth of January Fort Fisher had fallen news of which Sherman had received before starting out on his march We already had New Bern and had soon Wilmington whose fall followed that of Fort Fisher as did other points on the sea coast where the National troops were now in readiness to company operate with Sherman s advance when he had passed Fayetteville On the eighteenth of January I ordered Canby in command at New Orleans to move against Mobile Montgomery and Selma Alabama for the purpose of destroying roads machine shops et cetera On the eighth of February I ordered Sheridan who was in the Valley of Virginia to push forward as soon as the weather would permit and strike the canal west of Richmond at or about Lynchburg and on the twentieth I made the order to go to Lynchburg as soon as the roads would permit saying As soon as it is possible to travel I think you will have no difficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone From there you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction so as to be of no further use to the rebellion This additional raid with one starting from East Tennessee under Stoneman numbering about four or five thousand cavalry one from Eastport Mississippi ten thousand cavalry Canby from Mobile Bay with about eighteen thousand mixed troops these three latter pushing for Tuscaloosa Selma and Montgomery and Sherman with a large army eating out the vitals of South Carolina is all that will be wanted to leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon I would advise you to overcome great obstacles to accomplish this Charleston was evacuated on Tuesday last On the twenty seventh of February more than a month after Canby had received his orders I again wrote to him saying that I was extremely anxious to hear of his being in Alabama I notified him also that I had sent Grierson to take command of his cavalry he being a very efficient officer I further suggested that Forrest was probably in Mississippi and if he was there he would find him an officer of great courage and capacity whom it would be difficult to get by I still further informed him that Thomas had been ordered to start a cavalry force into Mississippi on the twentieth of February or as soon as possible thereafter This force did not get off however All these movements were designed to be in support of Sherman s march the object being to keep the Confederate troops in the West from leaving there But neither Canby nor Thomas could be got off in time I had some time before depleted Thomas s army to reinforce Canby for the reason that Thomas had failed to start an expedition which he had been ordered to send out and to have the troops where they might do something Canby seemed to be equally deliberate in all of his movements I ordered him to go in person but he prepared to send a detachment under another officer General Granger had got down to New Orleans in some way or other and I wrote Canby that he must not put him in command of troops In spite of this he asked the War Department to assign Granger to the command of a corps Almost in despair of having adequate service rendered to the cause in that quarter I said to Canby I am in receipt of a dispatch informing me that you have made requisitions for a construction corps and material to build seventy miles of railroad I have directed that none be sent Thomas s army has been depleted to send a force to you that they might be where they could act in winter and at least detain the force the enemy had in the West If there had been any idea of repairing railroads it could have been done much better from the North where we already had the troops I expected your movements to be company operative with Sherman s last This has now entirely failed I wrote to you long ago urging you to push promptly and to live upon the country and destroy railroads machine shops et cetera not to build them Take Mobile and hold it and push your forces to the interior to Montgomery and to Selma Destroy railroads rolling stock and everything useful for carrying on war and when you have done this take such positions as can be supplied by water By this means alone you can occupy positions from which the enemy s roads in the interior can be kept broken Most of these expeditions got off finally but too late to render any service in the direction for which they were designed The enemy ready to intercept his advance consisted of Hardee s troops and Wheeler s cavalry perhaps less than fifteen thousand men in all but frantic efforts were being made in Richmond as I was sure would be the case to retard Sherman s movements Everything possible was being done to raise troops in the South Lee dispatched against Sherman the troops which had been sent to relieve Fort Fisher which including those of the other defences of the harbor and its neighborhood amounted after deducting the two thousand killed wounded and captured to fourteen thousand men After Thomas s victory at Nashville what remained of Hood s army were gathered together and forwarded as rapidly as possible to the east to company operate with these forces and finally General Joseph E Johnston one of the ablest commanders of the South though not in favor with the administration or at least with mister Davis was put in command of all the troops in North and South Carolina Schofield arrived at Annapolis in the latter part of January but before sending his troops to North Carolina I went with him down the coast to see the situation of affairs as I could give fuller directions after being on the ground than I could very well have given without We soon returned and the troops were sent by sea to Cape Fear River Both New Bern and Wilmington are connected with Raleigh by railroads which unite at Goldsboro Schofield was to land troops at Smithville near the mouth of the Cape Fear River on the west side and move up to secure the Wilmington and Charlotteville Railroad This column took their pontoon bridges with them to enable them to cross over to the island south of the city of Wilmington A large body was sent by the north side to company operate with them They succeeded in taking the city on the twenty twod of February I took the precaution to provide for Sherman s army in case he should be forced to turn in toward the sea coast before reaching North Carolina by forwarding supplies to every place where he was liable to have to make such a deflection from his projected march I also sent railroad rolling stock of which we had a great abundance now that we were not operating the roads in Virginia The gauge of the North Carolina railroads being the same as the Virginia railroads had been altered too these cars and locomotives were ready for use there without any change On the thirty first of January I countermanded the orders given to Thomas to move south to Alabama and Georgia I had previously reduced his force by sending a portion of it to Terry I directed in lieu of this movement that he should send Stoneman through East Tennessee and push him well down toward Columbia South Carolina in support of Sherman Thomas did not get Stoneman off in time but on the contrary when I had supposed he was on his march in support of Sherman I heard of his being in Louisville Kentucky I immediately changed the order and directed Thomas to send him toward Lynchburg Finally however on the twelfth of March he did push down through the north western end of South Carolina creating some consternation I also ordered Thomas to send the fourth corps Stanley s to Bull Gap and to destroy no more roads east of that I also directed him to concentrate supplies at Knoxville with a view to a probable movement of his army through that way toward Lynchburg Goldsboro is four hundred and twenty five miles from Savannah Sherman s march was without much incident until he entered Columbia on the seventeenth of February He was detained in his progress by having to repair and corduroy the roads and rebuild the bridges There was constant skirmishing and fighting between the cavalry of the two armies but this did not retard the advance of the infantry Four days also were lost in making complete the destruction of the most important railroads south of Columbia there was also some delay caused by the high water and the destruction of the bridges on the line of the road A formidable river had to be crossed near Columbia and that in the face of a small garrison under General Wade Hampton There was but little delay however further than that caused by high water in the stream Hampton left as Sherman approached and the city was found to be on fire There has since been a great deal of acrimony displayed in discussions of the question as to who set Columbia on fire Sherman denies it on the part of his troops and Hampton denies it on the part of the Confederates One thing is certain as soon as our troops took possession they at once proceeded to extinguish the flames to the best of their ability with the limited means at hand In any case the example set by the Confederates in burning the village of Chambersburg Pa a town which was not garrisoned would seem to make a defence of the act of firing the seat of government of the State most responsible for the conflict then raging not imperative The Confederate troops having vacated the city the mayor took possession and sallied forth to meet the commander of the National forces for the purpose of surrendering the town making terms for the protection of property et cetera Sherman paid no attention at all to the overture but pushed forward and took the town without making any conditions whatever with its citizens He then however company operated with the mayor in extinguishing the flames and providing for the people who were rendered destitute by this destruction of their homes When he left there he even gave the mayor five hundred head of cattle to be distributed among the citizens to tide them over until some arrangement could be made for their future supplies He remained in Columbia until the roads public buildings workshops and everything that could be useful to the enemy were destroyed While at Columbia Sherman learned for the first time that what remained of Hood s army was confronting him under the command of General Beauregard Charleston was evacuated on the eighteenth of February and Foster garrisoned the place Wilmington was captured on the twenty twod Columbia and Cheraw farther north were regarded as so secure from invasion that the wealthy people of Charleston and Augusta had sent much of their valuable property to these two points to be stored Among the goods sent there were valuable carpets tons of old Madeira silverware and furniture I am afraid much of these goods fell into the hands of our troops There was found at Columbia a large amount of powder some artillery small arms and fixed ammunition These of course were among the articles destroyed While here Sherman also learned of Johnston s restoration to command The latter was given as already stated all troops in North and South Carolina After the completion of the destruction of public property about Columbia Sherman proceeded on his march and reached Cheraw without any special opposition and without incident to relate The railroads of course were thoroughly destroyed on the way Sherman remained a day or two at Cheraw and finally on the sixth of March crossed his troops over the Pedee and advanced straight for Fayetteville Hardee and Hampton were there and barely escaped Sherman reached Fayetteville on the eleventh of March He had dispatched scouts from Cheraw with letters to General Terry at Wilmington asking him to send a steamer with some supplies of bread clothing and other articles which he enumerated The scouts got through successfully and a boat was sent with the mail and such articles for which Sherman had asked as were in store at Wilmington unfortunately however those stores did not contain clothing Four days later on the fifteenth Sherman left Fayetteville for Goldsboro The march now had to be made with great caution for he was approaching Lee s army and nearing the country that still remained open to the enemy Besides he was confronting all that he had had to confront in his previous march up to that point reinforced by the garrisons along the road and by what remained of Hood s army Frantic appeals were made to the people to come in voluntarily and swell the ranks of our foe I presume however that Johnston did not have in all over thirty five thousand or forty thousand men The people had grown tired of the war and desertions from the Confederate army were much more numerous than the voluntary accessions There was some fighting at Averysboro on the sixteenth between Johnston s troops and Sherman s with some loss and at Bentonville on the nineteenth and twenty first of March but Johnston withdrew from the contest before the morning of the twenty twod Sherman s loss in these last engagements in killed wounded and missing was about sixteen hundred Sherman s troops at last reached Goldsboro on the twenty threed of the month and went into bivouac and there his men were destined to have a long rest Schofield was there to meet him with the troops which had been sent to Wilmington Sherman was no longer in danger He had Johnston confronting him but with an army much inferior to his own both in numbers and morale He had Lee to the north of him with a force largely superior but I was holding Lee with a still greater force and had he made his escape and gotten down to reinforce Johnston Sherman with the reinforcements he now had from Schofield and Terry would have been able to hold the Confederates at bay for an indefinite period He was near the sea shore with his back to it and our navy occupied the harbors He had a railroad to both Wilmington and New Bern and his flanks were thoroughly protected by streams which intersect that part of the country and deepen as they approach the sea Then too Sherman knew that if Lee should escape me I would be on his heels and he and Johnson together would be crushed in one blow if they attempted to make a stand With the loss of their capital it is doubtful whether Lee s army would have amounted to much as an army when it reached North Carolina Johnston s army was demoralized by constant defeat and would hardly have made an offensive movement even if they could have been induced to remain on duty The men of both Lee s and Johnston s armies were like their brethren of the North as brave as men can be but no man is so brave that he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him and dampen his ardor for any cause no matter how just he deems it CHAPTER LXIII ARRIVAL OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS LINCOLN AND THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS AN ANECDOTE OF LINCOLN THE WINTER BEFORE PETERSBURG SHERIDAN DESTROYS THE RAILROAD GORDON CARRIES THE PICKET LINE PARKE RECAPTURES THE LINE THE LINE OF BATTLE OF WHITE OAK ROAD On the last of January eighteen sixty five peace commissioners from the so called Confederate States presented themselves on our lines around Petersburg and were immediately conducted to my headquarters at City Point They proved to be Alexander H Stephens Vice President of the Confederacy Judge Campbell Assistant Secretary of War and R M T Hunt formerly United States Senator and then a member of the Confederate Senate It was about dark when they reached my headquarters and I at once conducted them to the steam Mary Martin a Hudson River boat which was very comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers I at once communicated by telegraph with Washington and informed the Secretary of War and the President of the arrival of these commissioners and that their object was to negotiate terms of peace between the United States and as they termed it the Confederate Government I was instructed to retain them at City Point until the President or some one whom he would designate should come to meet them They remained several days as guests on board the boat I saw them quite frequently though I have no recollection of having had any conversation whatever with them on the subject of their mission It was something I had nothing to do with and I therefore did not wish to express any views on the subject For my own part I never had admitted and never was ready to admit that they were the representatives of a GOVERNMENT There had been too great a waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind As long as they remained there however our relations were pleasant and I found them all very agreeable gentlemen I directed the captain to furnish them with the best the boat afforded and to administer to their comfort in every way possible No guard was placed over them and no restriction was put upon their movements nor was there any pledge asked that they would not abuse the privileges extended to them They were permitted to leave the boat when they felt like it and did so coming up on the bank and visiting me at my headquarters I had never met either of these gentlemen before the war but knew them well by reputation and through their public services and I had been a particular admirer of mister Stephens I had always supposed that he was a very small man but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was very much surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be When he got down on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollen overcoat a manufacture that had been introduced into the South during the rebellion The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I had ever seen even in Canada The overcoat extended nearly to his feet and was so large that it gave him the appearance of being an average sized man He took this off when he reached the cabin of the boat and I was struck with the apparent change in size in the coat and out of it After a few days about the twod of February I received a dispatch from Washington directing me to send the commissioners to Hampton Roads to meet the President and a member of the cabinet mister Lincoln met them there and had an interview of short duration It was not a great while after they met that the President visited me at City Point He spoke of his having met the commissioners and said he had told them that there would be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they would recognize first that the Union as a whole must be forever preserved and second that slavery must be abolished If they were willing to concede these two points then he was ready to enter into negotiations and was almost willing to hand them a blank sheet of paper with his signature attached for them to fill in the terms upon which they were willing to live with us in the Union and be one people He always showed a generous and kindly spirit toward the Southern people and I never heard him abuse an enemy Some of the cruel things said about President Lincoln particularly in the North used to pierce him to the heart but never in my presence did he evince a revengeful disposition and I saw a great deal of him at City Point for he seemed glad to get away from the cares and anxieties of the capital Right here I might relate an anecdote of mister Lincoln It was on the occasion of his visit to me just after he had talked with the peace commissioners at Hampton Roads After a little conversation he asked me if I had seen that overcoat of Stephens s I replied that I had Well said he did you see him take it off I said yes Well said he didn t you think it was the biggest shuck and the littlest ear that ever you did see Long afterwards I told this story to the Confederate General J B Gordon at the time a member of the Senate He repeated it to Stephens and as I heard afterwards Stephens laughed immoderately at the simile of mister Lincoln The rest of the winter after the departure of the peace commissioners passed off quietly and uneventfully except for two or three little incidents On one occasion during this period while I was visiting Washington City for the purpose of conferring with the administration the enemy s cavalry under General Wade Hampton passing our extreme left and then going to the south got in east of us Before their presence was known they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that were grazing in that section It was a fair capture and they were sufficiently needed by the Confederates It was only retaliating for what we had done sometimes for many weeks at a time when out of supplies taking what the Confederate army otherwise would have gotten As appears in this book on one single occasion we captured five thousand head of cattle which were crossing the Mississippi River near Port Hudson on their way from Texas to supply the Confederate army in the East One of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellion was the last few weeks before Petersburg I felt that the situation of the Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape at the earliest practicable moment and I was afraid every morning that I would awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone and that nothing was left but a picket line He had his railroad by the way of Danville south and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all stores and ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him for his immediate defence I knew he could move much more lightly and more rapidly than I and that if he got the start he would leave me behind so that we would have the same army to fight again farther south and the war might be prolonged another year I was led to this fear by the fact that I could not see how it was possible for the Confederates to hold out much longer where they were There is no doubt that Richmond would have been evacuated much sooner than it was if it had not been that it was the capital of the so called Confederacy and the fact of evacuating the capital would of course have had a very demoralizing effect upon the Confederate army When it was evacuated as we shall see further on the Confederacy at once began to crumble and fade away Then too desertions were taking place not only among those who were with General Lee in the neighborhood of their capital but throughout the whole Confederacy I remember that in a conversation with me on one occasion long prior to this General Butler remarked that the Confederates would find great difficulty in getting more men for their army possibly adding though I am not certain as to this unless they should arm the slave The South as we all knew were conscripting every able bodied man between the ages of eighteen and forty five and now they had passed a law for the further conscription of boys from fourteen to eighteen calling them the junior reserves and men from forty five to sixty to be called the senior reserves The latter were to hold the necessary points not in immediate danger and especially those in the rear General Butler in alluding to this conscription remarked that they were thus robbing both the cradle and the grave an expression which I afterwards used in writing a letter to mister Washburn It was my belief that while the enemy could get no more recruits they were losing at least a regiment a day taking it throughout the entire army by desertions alone Then by casualties of war sickness and other natural causes their losses were much heavier It was a mere question of arithmetic to calculate how long they could hold out while that rate of depletion was going on Of course long before their army would be thus reduced to nothing the army which we had in the field would have been able to capture theirs Then too I knew from the great number of desertions that the men who had fought so bravely so gallantly and so long for the cause which they believed in and as earnestly I take it as our men believed in the cause for which they were fighting had lost hope and become despondent Many of them were making application to be sent North where they might get employment until the war was over when they could return to their Southern homes For these and other reasons I was naturally very impatient for the time to come when I could commence the spring campaign which I thoroughly believed would close the war There were two considerations I had to observe however and which detained me One was the fact that the winter had been one of heavy rains and the roads were impassable for artillery and teams It was necessary to wait until they had dried sufficiently to enable us to move the wagon trains and artillery necessary to the efficiency of an army operating in the enemy s country The other consideration was that General Sheridan with the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac was operating on the north side of the James River having come down from the Shenandoah It was necessary that I should have his cavalry with me and I was therefore obliged to wait until he could join me south of the James River Let us now take account of what he was doing On the fifth of March I had heard from Sheridan He had met Early between Staunton and Charlottesville and defeated him capturing nearly his entire command Early and some of his officers escaped by finding refuge in the neighboring houses or in the woods On the twelfth I heard from him again He had turned east to come to White House He could not go to Lynchburg as ordered because the rains had been so very heavy and the streams were so very much swollen He had a pontoon train with him but it would not reach half way across some of the streams at their then stage of water which he would have to get over in going south as first ordered I had supplies sent around to White House for him and kept the depot there open until he arrived We had intended to abandon it because the James River had now become our base of supplies Sheridan had about ten thousand cavalry with him divided into two divisions commanded respectively by Custer and Devin General Merritt was acting as chief of cavalry Sheridan moved very light carrying only four days provisions with him with a larger supply of coffee salt and other small rations and a very little else besides ammunition They stopped at Charlottesville and commenced tearing up the railroad back toward Lynchburg He also sent a division along the James River Canal to destroy locks culverts et cetera All mills and factories along the lines of march of his troops were destroyed also Sheridan had in this way consumed so much time that his making a march to White House was now somewhat hazardous He determined therefore to fight his way along the railroad and canal till he was as near to Richmond as it was possible to get or until attacked He did this destroying the canal as far as Goochland and the railroad to a point as near Richmond as he could get On the tenth he was at Columbia Negroes had joined his column to the number of two thousand or more and they assisted considerably in the work of destroying the railroads and the canal His cavalry was in as fine a condition as when he started because he had been able to find plenty of forage He had captured most of Early s horses and picked up a good many others on the road When he reached Ashland he was assailed by the enemy in force He resisted their assault with part of his command moved quickly across the South and North Anna going north and reached White House safely on the nineteenth The time for Sherman to move had to be fixed with reference to the time he could get away from Goldsboro where he then was Supplies had to be got up to him which would last him through a long march as there would probably not be much to be obtained in the country through which he would pass I had to arrange therefore that he should start from where he was in the neighborhood of Goldsboro on the eighteenth of April the earliest day at which he supposed he could be ready Sherman was anxious that I should wait where I was until he could come up and make a sure thing of it but I had determined to move as soon as the roads and weather would admit of my doing so I had been tied down somewhat in the matter of fixing any time at my pleasure for starting until Sheridan who was on his way from the Shenandoah Valley to join me should arrive as both his presence and that of his cavalry were necessary to the execution of the plans which I had in mind However having arrived at White House on the nineteenth of March I was enabled to make my plans Prompted by my anxiety lest Lee should get away some night before I was aware of it and having the lead of me push into North Carolina to join with Johnston in attempting to crush out Sherman I had as early as the first of the month of March given instructions to the troops around Petersburg to keep a sharp lookout to see that such a movement should not escape their notice and to be ready strike at once if it was undertaken It is now known that early in the month of March mister Davis and General Lee had a consultation about the situation of affairs in and about and Petersburg and they both agreed places were no longer tenable for them and that they must get away as soon as possible They too were waiting for dry roads or a condition of the roads which would make it possible to move General Lee in aid of his plan of escape and to secure a wider opening to enable them to reach the Danville Road with greater security than he would have in the way the two armies were situated determined upon an assault upon the right of our lines around Petersburg The night of the twenty fourth of March was fixed upon for this assault and General Gordon was assigned to the execution of the plan The point between Fort Stedman and Battery No ten where our lines were closest together was selected as the point of his attack The attack was to be made at night and the troops were to get possession of the higher ground in the rear where they supposed we had intrenchments then sweep to the right and left create a panic in the lines of our army and force me to contract my lines Lee hoped this would detain me a few days longer and give him an opportunity of escape The plan was well conceived and the execution of it very well done indeed up to the point of carrying a portion of our line Gordon assembled his troops under the cover of night at the point at which they were to make their charge and got possession of our picket line entirely without the knowledge of the troops inside of our main line of intrenchments this reduced the distance he would have to charge over to not much more than fifty yards For some time before the deserters had been coming in with great frequency often bringing their arms with them and this the Confederate general knew Taking advantage of this knowledge he sent his pickets with their arms creeping through to ours as if to desert When they got to our lines they at once took possession and sent our pickets to the rear as prisoners In the main line our men were sleeping serenely as if in great security This plan was to have been executed and much damage done before daylight but the troops that were to reinforce Gordon had to be brought from the north side of the James River and by some accident on the railroad on their way over they were detained for a considerable time so that it got to be nearly daylight before they were ready to make the charge The charge however was successful and almost without loss the enemy passing through our lines between Fort Stedman and Battery No ten Then turning to the right and left they captured the fort and the battery with all the arms and troops in them Continuing the charge they also carried batteries Eleven and Twelve to our left which they turned toward City Point Meade happened to be at City Point that night and this break in his line cut him off from all communication with his headquarters Parke however commanding the ninth corps when this breach took place telegraphed the facts to Meade s headquarters and learning that the general was away assumed command himself and with commendable promptitude made all preparations to drive the enemy back General Tidball gathered a large number of pieces of artillery and planted them in rear of the captured works so as to sweep the narrow space of ground between the lines very thoroughly Hartranft was soon out with his division as also was Willcox Hartranft to the right of the breach headed the rebels off in that direction and rapidly drove them back into Fort Stedman On the other side they were driven back into the intrenchments which they had captured and batteries eleven and twelve were retaken by Willcox early in the morning Parke then threw a line around outside of the captured fort and batteries and communication was once more established The artillery fire was kept up so continuously that it was impossible for the Confederates to retreat and equally impossible for reinforcements to join them They all therefore fell captives into our hands This effort of Lee s cost him about four thousand men and resulted in their killing wounding and capturing about two thousand of ours After the recapture of the batteries taken by the Confederates our troops made a charge and carried the enemy s intrenched picket line which they strengthened and held This in turn gave us but a short distance to charge over when our attack came to be made a few days later The day that Gordon was making dispositions for this attack twenty fourth of March I issued my orders for the movement to commence on the twenty ninth Ord with three divisions of infantry and Mackenzie s cavalry was to move in advance on the night of the twenty seventh from the north side of the James River and take his place on our extreme left thirty miles away He left Weitzel with the rest of the Army of the James to hold Bermuda Hundred and the north of the James River The engineer brigade was to be left at City Point and Parke s corps in the lines about Petersburg forty two Ord was at his place promptly Humphreys and Warren were then on our extreme left with the twod and fifth corps They were directed on the arrival of Ord and on his getting into position in their places to cross Hatcher s Run and extend out west toward Five Forks the object being to get into a position from which we could strike the South Side Railroad and ultimately the Danville Railroad There was considerable fighting in taking up these new positions for the twod and fifth corps in which the Army of the James had also to participate somewhat and the losses were quite severe This was what was known as the Battle of White Oak Road CHAPTER LXIV INTERVIEW WITH SHERIDAN GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC SHERIDAN S ADVANCE ON FIVE FORKS BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS PARKE AND WRIGHT STORM THE ENEMY S LINE BATTLES BEFORE PETERSBURG Sheridan reached City Point on the twenty sixth day of March His horses of course were jaded and many of them had lost their shoes A few days of rest were necessary to recuperate the animals and also to have them shod and put in condition for moving Immediately on General Sheridan s arrival at City Point I prepared his instructions for the move which I had decided upon The movement was to commence on the twenty ninth of the month After reading the instructions I had given him Sheridan walked out of my tent and I followed to have some conversation with him by himself not in the presence of anybody else even of a member of my staff In preparing his instructions I contemplated just what took place that is to say capturing Five Forks driving the enemy from Petersburg and Richmond and terminating the contest before separating from the enemy But the Nation had already become restless and discouraged at the prolongation of the war and many believed that it would never terminate except by compromise Knowing that unless my plan proved an entire success it would be interpreted as a disastrous defeat I provided in these instructions that in a certain event he was to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac and his base of supplies and living upon the country proceed south by the way of the Danville Railroad or near it across the Roanoke get in the rear of Johnston who was guarding that road and cooperate with Sherman in destroying Johnston then with these combined forces to help carry out the instructions which Sherman already had received to act in cooperation with the armies around Petersburg and Richmond I saw that after Sheridan had read his instructions he seemed somewhat disappointed at the idea possibly of having to cut loose again from the Army of the Potomac and place himself between the two main armies of the enemy I said to him General this portion of your instructions I have put in merely as a blind and gave him the reason for doing so heretofore described I told him that as a matter of fact I intended to close the war right here with this movement and that he should go no farther His face at once brightened up and slapping his hand on his leg he said I am glad to hear it and we can do it Sheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks until he got further instructions from me One day after the movement I am about to describe had commenced and when his cavalry was on our extreme left and far to the rear south Sheridan rode up to where my headquarters were then established at Dabney s Mills He met some of my staff officers outside and was highly jubilant over the prospects of success giving reasons why he believed this would prove the final and successful effort Although my chief of staff had urged very strongly that we return to our position about City Point and in the lines around Petersburg he asked Sheridan to come in to see me and say to me what he had been saying to them Sheridan felt a little modest about giving his advice where it had not been asked so one of my staff came in and told me that Sheridan had what they considered important news and suggested that I send for him I did so and was glad to see the spirit of confidence with which he was imbued Knowing as I did from experience of what great value that feeling of confidence by a commander was I determined to make a movement at once although on account of the rains which had fallen after I had started out the roads were still very heavy Orders were given accordingly Finally the twenty ninth of March came and fortunately there having been a few days free from rain the surface of the ground was dry giving indications that the time had come when we could move On that date I moved out with all the army available after leaving sufficient force to hold the line about Petersburg It soon set in raining again however and in a very short time the roads became practically impassable for teams and almost so for cavalry Sometimes a horse or mule would be standing apparently on firm ground when all at once one foot would sink and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all his feet would sink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of the quicksands so common in that part of Virginia and other southern States It became necessary therefore to build corduroy roads every foot of the way as we advanced to move our artillery upon The army had become so accustomed to this kind of work and were so well prepared for it that it was done very rapidly The next day March thirtieth we had made sufficient progress to the south west to warrant me in starting Sheridan with his cavalry over by Dinwiddie with instructions to then come up by the road leading north west to Five Forks thus menacing the right of Lee s line This movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to the west as far as practicable towards the enemy s extreme right or Five Forks The column moving detached from the army still in the trenches was excluding the cavalry very small The forces in the trenches were themselves extending to the left flank Warren was on the extreme left when the extension began but Humphreys was marched around later and thrown into line between him and Five Forks My hope was that Sheridan would be able to carry Five Forks get on the enemy s right flank and rear and force them to weaken their centre to protect their right so that an assault in the centre might be successfully made General Wright s corps had been designated to make this assault which I intended to order as soon as information reached me of Sheridan s success He was to move under cover as close to the enemy as he could get It is natural to suppose that Lee would understand my design to be to get up to the South Side and ultimately to the Danville Railroad as soon as he had heard of the movement commenced on the twenty ninth These roads were so important to his very existence while he remained in Richmond and Petersburg and of such vital importance to him even in case of retreat that naturally he would make most strenuous efforts to defend them He did on the thirtieth send Pickett with five brigades to reinforce Five Forks He also sent around to the right of his army some two or three other divisions besides directing that other troops be held in readiness on the north side of the James River to come over on call He came over himself to superintend in person the defence of his right flank Sheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court House on the night of the thirtieth and then took a road leading north west to Five Forks He had only his cavalry with him Soon encountering the rebel cavalry he met with a very stout resistance He gradually drove them back however until in the neighborhood of Five Forks Here he had to encounter other troops besides those he had been contending with and was forced to give way In this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken place and stated that he was falling back toward Dinwiddie gradually and slowly and asked me to send Wright s corps to his assistance I replied to him that it was impossible to send Wright s corps because that corps was already in line close up to the enemy where we should want to assault when the proper time came and was besides a long distance from him but the twod Humphreys s and fifth Warren s corps were on our extreme left and a little to the rear of it in a position to threaten the left flank of the enemy at Five Forks and that I would send Warren Accordingly orders were sent to Warren to move at once that night the thirty first to Dinwiddie Court House and put himself in communication with Sheridan as soon as possible and report to him He was very slow in moving some of his troops not starting until after five o clock next morning When he did move it was done very deliberately and on arriving at Gravelly Run he found the stream swollen from the recent rains so that he regarded it as not fordable Sheridan of course knew of his coming and being impatient to get the troops up as soon as possible sent orders to him to hasten He was also hastened or at least ordered to move up rapidly by General Meade He now felt that he could not cross that creek without bridges and his orders were changed to move so as to strike the pursuing enemy in flank or get in their rear but he was so late in getting up that Sheridan determined to move forward without him However Ayres s division of Warren s corps reached him in time to be in the fight all day most of the time separated from the remainder of the fifth corps and fighting directly under Sheridan Warren reported to Sheridan about eleven o clock on the first but the whole of his troops were not up so as to be much engaged until late in the afternoon Griffin s division in backing to get out of the way of a severe cross fire of the enemy was found marching away from the fighting This did not continue long however the division was brought back and with Ayres s division did most excellent service during the day Crawford s division of the same corps had backed still farther off and although orders were sent repeatedly to bring it up it was late before it finally got to where it could be of material assistance Once there it did very excellent service Sheridan succeeded by the middle of the afternoon or a little later in advancing up to the point from which to make his designed assault upon Five Forks itself He was very impatient to make the assault and have it all over before night because the ground he occupied would be untenable for him in bivouac during the night Unless the assault was made and was successful he would be obliged to return to Dinwiddie Court House or even further than that for the night It was at this junction of affairs that Sheridan wanted to get Crawford s division in hand and he also wanted Warren He sent staff officer after staff officer in search of Warren directing that general to report to him but they were unable to find him At all events Sheridan was unable to get that officer to him Finally he went himself He issued an order relieving Warren and assigning Griffin to the command of the fifth corps The troops were then brought up and the assault successfully made I was so much dissatisfied with Warren s dilatory movements in the battle of White Oak Road and in his failure to reach Sheridan in time that I was very much afraid that at the last moment he would fail Sheridan He was a man of fine intelligence great earnestness quick perception and could make his dispositions as quickly as any officer under difficulties where he was forced to act But I had before discovered a defect which was beyond his control that was very prejudicial to his usefulness in emergencies like the one just before us He could see every danger at a glance before he had encountered it He would not only make preparations to meet the danger which might occur but he would inform his commanding officer what others should do while he was executing his move I had sent a staff officer to General Sheridan to call his attention to these defects and to say that as much as I liked General Warren now was not a time when we could let our personal feelings for any one stand in the way of success and if his removal was necessary to success not to hesitate It was upon that authorization that Sheridan removed Warren I was very sorry that it had been done and regretted still more that I had not long before taken occasion to assign him to another field of duty It was dusk when our troops under Sheridan went over the parapets of the enemy The two armies were mingled together there for a time in such manner that it was almost a question which one was going to demand the surrender of the other Soon however the enemy broke and ran in every direction some six thousand prisoners besides artillery and small arms in large quantities falling into our hands The flying troops were pursued in different directions the cavalry and fifth corps under Sheridan pursuing the larger body which moved north west This pursuit continued until about nine o clock at night when Sheridan halted his troops and knowing the importance to him of the part of the enemy s line which had been captured returned sending the fifth corps across Hatcher s Run to just south west of Petersburg and facing them toward it Merritt with the cavalry stopped and bivouacked west of Five Forks This was the condition which affairs were in on the night of the first of April I then issued orders for an assault by Wright and Parke at four o clock on the morning of the twod I also ordered the twod corps General Humphreys and General Ord with the Army of the James on the left to hold themselves in readiness to take any advantage that could be taken from weakening in their front I notified mister Lincoln at City Point of the success of the day in fact I had reported to him during the day and evening as I got news because he was so much interested in the movements taking place that I wanted to relieve his mind as much as I could I notified Weitzel on the north side of the James River directing him also to keep close up to the enemy and take advantage of the withdrawal of troops from there to promptly enter the city of Richmond I was afraid that Lee would regard the possession of Five Forks as of so much importance that he would make a last desperate effort to retake it risking everything upon the cast of a single die It was for this reason that I had ordered the assault to take place at once as soon as I had received the news of the capture of Five Forks The corps commanders however reported that it was so dark that the men could not see to move and it would be impossible to make the assault then But we kept up a continuous artillery fire upon the enemy around the whole line including that north of the James River until it was light enough to move which was about a quarter to five in the morning At that hour Parke s and Wright s corps moved out as directed brushed the abatis from their front as they advanced under a heavy fire of musketry and artillery and went without flinching directly on till they mounted the parapets and threw themselves inside of the enemy s line Parke who was on the right swept down to the right and captured a very considerable length of line in that direction but at that point the outer was so near the inner line which closely enveloped the city of Petersburg that he could make no advance forward and in fact had a very serious task to turn the lines which he had captured to the defence of his own troops and to hold them but he succeeded in this Wright swung around to his left and moved to Hatcher s Run sweeping everything before him The enemy had traverses in rear of his captured line under cover of which he made something of a stand from one to another as Wright moved on but the latter met no serious obstacle As you proceed to the left the outer line becomes gradually much farther from the inner one and along about Hatcher s Run they must be nearly two miles apart Both Parke and Wright captured a considerable amount of artillery and some prisoners Wright about three thousand of them In the meantime Ord and Humphreys in obedience to the instructions they had received had succeeded by daylight or very early in the morning in capturing the intrenched picket lines in their front and before Wright got up to that point Ord had also succeeded in getting inside of the enemy s intrenchments The second corps soon followed and the outer works of Petersburg were in the hands of the National troops never to be wrenched from them again When Wright reached Hatcher s Run he sent a regiment to destroy the South Side Railroad just outside of the city My headquarters were still at Dabney s saw mills As soon as I received the news of Wright s success I sent dispatches announcing the fact to all points around the line including the troops at Bermuda Hundred and those on the north side of the James and to the President at City Point Further dispatches kept coming in and as they did I sent the additional news to these points Finding at length that they were all in I mounted my horse to join the troops who were inside the works When I arrived there I rode my horse over the parapet just as Wright s three thousand prisoners were coming out I was soon joined inside by General Meade and his staff Lee made frantic efforts to recover at least part of the lost ground Parke on our right was repeatedly assaulted but repulsed every effort Before noon Longstreet was ordered up from the north side of the James River thus bringing the bulk of Lee s army around to the support of his extreme right As soon as I learned this I notified Weitzel and directed him to keep up close to the enemy and to have Hartsuff commanding the Bermuda Hundred front to do the same thing and if they found any break to go in Hartsuff especially should do so for this would separate Richmond and Petersburg Sheridan after he had returned to Five Forks swept down to Petersburg coming in on our left This gave us a continuous line from the Appomattox River below the city to the same river above At eleven o clock not having heard from Sheridan I reinforced Parke with two brigades from City Point With this additional force he completed his captured works for better defence and built back from his right so as to protect his flank He also carried in and made an abatis between himself and the enemy Lee brought additional troops and artillery against Parke even after this was done and made several assaults with very heavy losses The enemy had in addition to their intrenched line close up to Petersburg two enclosed works outside of it Fort Gregg and Fort Whitworth We thought it had now become necessary to carry them by assault About one o clock in the day Fort Gregg was assaulted by Foster s division of the twenty fourth corps Gibbon s supported by two brigades from Ord s command The battle was desperate and the National troops were repulsed several times but it was finally carried and immediately the troops in Fort Whitworth evacuated the place The guns of Fort Gregg were turned upon the retreating enemy and the commanding officer with some sixty of the men of Fort Whitworth surrendered I had ordered Miles in the morning to report to Sheridan In moving to execute this order he came upon the enemy at the intersection of the White Oak Road and the Claiborne Road The enemy fell back to Sutherland Station on the South Side Road and were followed by Miles This position naturally a strong and defensible one was also strongly intrenched Sheridan now came up and Miles asked permission from him to make the assault which Sheridan gave By this time Humphreys had got through the outer works in his front and came up also and assumed command over Miles who commanded a division in his corps I had sent an order to Humphreys to turn to his right and move towards Petersburg This order he now got and started off thus leaving Miles alone The latter made two assaults both of which failed and he had to fall back a few hundred yards Hearing that Miles had been left in this position I directed Humphreys to send a division back to his relief He went himself Sheridan before starting to sweep down to Petersburg had sent Merritt with his cavalry to the west to attack some Confederate cavalry that had assembled there Merritt drove them north to the Appomattox River Sheridan then took the enemy at Sutherland Station on the reverse side from where Miles was and the two together captured the place with a large number of prisoners and some pieces of artillery and put the remainder portions of three Confederate corps to flight Sheridan followed and drove them until night when further pursuit was stopped Miles bivouacked for the night on the ground which he with Sheridan had carried so handsomely by assault I cannot explain the situation here better than by giving my dispatch to City Point that evening BOYDTON ROAD NEAR PETERSBURG April two eighteen sixty five four point forty P M COLONEL T S BOWERS City Point We are now up and have a continuous line of troops and in a few hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river above Heth s and Wilcox s divisions such part of them as were not captured were cut off from town either designedly on their part or because they could not help it Sheridan with the cavalry and fifth corps is above them Miles s division twod corps was sent from the White Oak Road to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad where he met them and at last accounts was engaged with them Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time General Humphreys was sent with another division from here The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men and probably fifty pieces of artillery I do not know the number of men and guns accurately however I think the President might come out and pay us a visit tomorrow U S GRANT Lieutenant General During the night of April twod our line was intrenched from the river above to the river below I ordered a bombardment to be commenced the next morning at five A M to be followed by an assault at six o clock but the enemy evacuated Petersburg early in the morning CHAPTER LXV THE CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG MEETING PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN PETERSBURG THE CAPTURE OF RICHMOND PURSUING THE ENEMY VISIT TO SHERIDAN AND MEADE General Meade and I entered Petersburg on the morning of the threed and took a position under cover of a house which protected us from the enemy s musketry which was flying thick and fast there As we would occasionally look around the corner we could see the streets and the Appomattox bottom presumably near the bridge packed with the Confederate army I did not have artillery brought up because I was sure Lee was trying to make his escape and I wanted to push immediately in pursuit At all events I had not the heart to turn the artillery upon such a mass of defeated and fleeing men and I hoped to capture them soon Soon after the enemy had entirely evacuated Petersburg a man came in who represented himself to be an engineer of the Army of Northern Virginia He said that Lee had for some time been at work preparing a strong enclosed intrenchment into which he would throw himself when forced out of Petersburg and fight his final battle there that he was actually at that time drawing his troops from Richmond and falling back into this prepared work This statement was made to General Meade and myself when we were together I had already given orders for the movement up the south side of the Appomattox for the purpose of heading off Lee but Meade was so much impressed by this man s story that he thought we ought to cross the Appomattox there at once and move against Lee in his new position I knew that Lee was no fool as he would have been to have put himself and his army between two formidable streams like the James and Appomattox rivers and between two such armies as those of the Potomac and the James Then these streams coming together as they did to the east of him it would be only necessary to close up in the west to have him thoroughly cut off from all supplies or possibility of reinforcement It would only have been a question of days and not many of them if he had taken the position assigned to him by the so called engineer when he would have been obliged to surrender his army Such is one of the ruses resorted to in war to deceive your antagonist My judgment was that Lee would necessarily have to evacuate Richmond and that the only course for him to pursue would be to follow the Danville Road Accordingly my object was to secure a point on that road south of Lee and I told Meade this He suggested that if Lee was going that way we would follow him My reply was that we did not want to follow him we wanted to get ahead of him and cut him off and if he would only stay in the position he Meade believed him to be in at that time I wanted nothing better that when we got in possession of the Danville Railroad at its crossing of the Appomattox River if we still found him between the two rivers all we had to do was to move eastward and close him up That we would then have all the advantage we could possibly have by moving directly against him from Petersburg even if he remained in the position assigned him by the engineer officer I had held most of the command aloof from the intrenchments so as to start them out on the Danville Road early in the morning supposing that Lee would be gone during the night During the night I strengthened Sheridan by sending him Humphreys s corps Lee as we now know had advised the authorities at Richmond during the day of the condition of affairs and told them it would be impossible for him to hold out longer than night if he could hold out that long Davis was at church when he received Lee s dispatch The congregation was dismissed with the notice that there would be no evening service The rebel government left Richmond about two o clock in the afternoon of the twod At night Lee ordered his troops to assemble at Amelia Court House his object being to get away join Johnston if possible and to try to crush Sherman before I could get there As soon as I was sure of this I notified Sheridan and directed him to move out on the Danville Railroad to the south side of the Appomattox River as speedily as possible He replied that he already had some of his command nine miles out I then ordered the rest of the Army of the Potomac under Meade to follow the same road in the morning Parke s corps followed by the same road and the Army of the James was directed to follow the road which ran alongside of the South Side Railroad to Burke s Station and to repair the railroad and telegraph as they proceeded That road was a five feet gauge while our rolling stock was all of the four feet eight one two inches gauge consequently the rail on one side of the track had to be taken up throughout the whole length and relaid so as to conform to the gauge of our cars and locomotives mister Lincoln was at City Point at the time and had been for some days I would have let him know what I contemplated doing only while I felt a strong conviction that the move was going to be successful yet it might not prove so and then I would have only added another to the many disappointments he had been suffering for the past three years But when we started out he saw that we were moving for a purpose and bidding us Godspeed remained there to hear the result The next morning after the capture of Petersburg I telegraphed mister Lincoln asking him to ride out there and see me while I would await his arrival I had started all the troops out early in the morning so that after the National army left Petersburg there was not a soul to be seen not even an animal in the streets There was absolutely no one there except my staff officers and possibly a small escort of cavalry We had selected the piazza of a deserted house and occupied it until the President arrived About the first thing that mister Lincoln said to me after warm congratulations for the victory and thanks both to myself and to the army which had accomplished it was Do you know general that I have had a sort of a sneaking idea for some days that you intended to do something like this Our movements having been successful up to this point I no longer had any object in concealing from the President all my movements and the objects I had in view He remained for some days near City Point and I communicated with him frequently and fully by telegraph mister Lincoln knew that it had been arranged for Sherman to join me at a fixed time to company operate in the destruction of Lee s army I told him that I had been very anxious to have the Eastern armies vanquish their old enemy who had so long resisted all their repeated and gallant attempts to subdue them or drive them from their capital The Western armies had been in the main successful until they had conquered all the territory from the Mississippi River to the State of North Carolina and were now almost ready to knock at the back door of Richmond asking admittance I said to him that if the Western armies should be even upon the field operating against Richmond and Lee the credit would be given to them for the capture by politicians and non combatants from the section of country which those troops hailed from It might lead to disagreeable bickerings between members of Congress of the East and those of the West in some of their debates Western members might be throwing it up to the members of the East that in the suppression of the rebellion they were not able to capture an army or to accomplish much in the way of contributing toward that end but had to wait until the Western armies had conquered all the territory south and west of them and then come on to help them capture the only army they had been engaged with mister Lincoln said he saw that now but had never thought of it before because his anxiety was so great that he did not care where the aid came from so the work was done The Army of the Potomac has every reason to be proud of its four years record in the suppression of the rebellion The army it had to fight was the protection to the capital of a people which was attempting to found a nation upon the territory of the United States Its loss would be the loss of the cause Every energy therefore was put forth by the Confederacy to protect and maintain their capital Everything else would go if it went Lee s army had to be strengthened to enable it to maintain its position no matter what territory was wrested from the South in another quarter I never expected any such bickering as I have indicated between the soldiers of the two sections and fortunately there has been none between the politicians Possibly I am the only one who thought of the liability of such a state of things in advance When our conversation was at an end mister Lincoln mounted his horse and started on his return to City Point while I and my staff started to join the army now a good many miles in advance Up to this time I had not received the report of the capture of Richmond Soon after I left President Lincoln I received a dispatch from General Weitzel which notified me that he had taken possession of Richmond at about eight point fifteen o clock in the morning of that day the threed and that he had found the city on fire in two places The city was in the most utter confusion The authorities had taken the precaution to empty all the liquor into the gutter and to throw out the provisions which the Confederate government had left for the people to gather up The city had been deserted by the authorities civil and military without any notice whatever that they were about to leave In fact up to the very hour of the evacuation the people had been led to believe that Lee had gained an important victory somewhere around Petersburg Weitzel s command found evidence of great demoralization in Lee s army there being still a great many men and even officers in the town The city was on fire Our troops were directed to extinguish the flames which they finally succeeded in doing The fire had been started by some one connected with the retreating army All authorities deny that it was authorized and I presume it was the work of excited men who were leaving what they regarded as their capital and may have felt that it was better to destroy it than have it fall into the hands of their enemy Be that as it may the National troops found the city in flames and used every effort to extinguish them The troops that had formed Lee s right a great many of them were cut off from getting back into Petersburg and were pursued by our cavalry so hotly and closely that they threw away caissons ammunition clothing and almost everything to lighten their loads and pushed along up the Appomattox River until finally they took water and crossed over I left mister Lincoln and started as I have already said to join the command which halted at Sutherland Station about nine miles out We had still time to march as much farther and time was an object but the roads were bad and the trains belonging to the advance corps had blocked up the road so that it was impossible to get on Then again our cavalry had struck some of the enemy and were pursuing them and the orders were that the roads should be given up to the cavalry whenever they appeared This caused further delay General Wright who was in command of one of the corps which were left back thought to gain time by letting his men go into bivouac and trying to get up some rations for them and clearing out the road so that when they did start they would be uninterrupted Humphreys who was far ahead was also out of rations They did not succeed in getting them up through the night but the Army of the Potomac officers and men were so elated by the reflection that at last they were following up a victory to its end that they preferred marching without rations to running a possible risk of letting the enemy elude them So the march was resumed at three o clock in the morning Merritt s cavalry had struck the enemy at Deep Creek and driven them north to the Appomattox where I presume most of them were forced to cross On the morning of the fourth I learned that Lee had ordered rations up from Danville for his famishing army and that they were to meet him at Farmville This showed that Lee had already abandoned the idea of following the railroad down to Danville but had determined to go farther west by the way of Farmville I notified Sheridan of this and directed him to get possession of the road before the supplies could reach Lee He responded that he had already sent Crook s division to get upon the road between Burkesville and Jetersville then to face north and march along the road upon the latter place and he thought Crook must be there now The bulk of the army moved directly for Jetersville by two roads After I had received the dispatch from Sheridan saying that Crook was on the Danville Road I immediately ordered Meade to make a forced march with the Army of the Potomac and to send Parke s corps across from the road they were on to the South Side Railroad to fall in the rear of the Army of the James and to protect the railroad which that army was repairing as it went along Our troops took possession of Jetersville and in the telegraph office they found a dispatch from Lee ordering two hundred thousand rations from Danville The dispatch had not been sent but Sheridan sent a special messenger with it to Burkesville and had it forwarded from there In the meantime however dispatches from other sources had reached Danville and they knew there that our army was on the line of the road so that they sent no further supplies from that quarter At this time Merritt and Mackenzie with the cavalry were off between the road which the Army of the Potomac was marching on and the Appomattox River and were attacking the enemy in flank They picked up a great many prisoners and forced the abandonment of some property Lee intrenched himself at Amelia Court House and also his advance north of Jetersville and sent his troops out to collect forage The country was very poor and afforded but very little His foragers scattered a great deal many of them were picked up by our men and many others never returned to the Army of Northern Virginia Griffin s corps was intrenched across the railroad south of Jetersville and Sheridan notified me of the situation I again ordered Meade up with all dispatch Sheridan having but the one corps of infantry with a little cavalry confronting Lee s entire army Meade always prompt in obeying orders now pushed forward with great energy although he was himself sick and hardly able to be out of bed Humphreys moved at two and Wright at three o clock in the morning without rations as I have said the wagons being far in the rear I stayed that night at Wilson s Station on the South Side Railroad On the morning of the fifth I sent word to Sheridan of the progress Meade was making and suggested that he might now attack Lee We had now no other objective than the Confederate armies and I was anxious to close the thing up at once On the fifth I marched again with Ord s command until within about ten miles of Burkesville where I stopped to let his army pass I then received from Sheridan the following dispatch The whole of Lee s army is at or near Amelia Court House and on this side of it General Davies whom I sent out to Painesville on their right flank has just captured six pieces of artillery and some wagons We can capture the Army of Northern Virginia if force enough can be thrown to this point and then advance upon it My cavalry was at Burkesville yesterday and six miles beyond on the Danville Road last night General Lee is at Amelia Court House in person They are out of rations or nearly so They were advancing up the railroad towards Burkesville yesterday when we intercepted them at this point It now became a life and death struggle with Lee to get south to his provisions Sheridan thinking the enemy might turn off immediately towards Farmville moved Davies s brigade of cavalry out to watch him Davies found the movement had already commenced He attacked and drove away their cavalry which was escorting wagons to the west capturing and burning one hundred eighty wagons He also captured five pieces of artillery The Confederate infantry then moved against him and probably would have handled him very roughly but Sheridan had sent two more brigades of cavalry to follow Davies and they came to his relief in time A sharp engagement took place between these three brigades of cavalry and the enemy s infantry but the latter was repulsed Meade himself reached Jetersville about two o clock in the afternoon but in advance of all his troops The head of Humphreys s corps followed in about an hour afterwards Sheridan stationed the troops as they came up at Meade s request the latter still being very sick He extended two divisions of this corps off to the west of the road to the left of Griffin s corps and one division to the right The cavalry by this time had also come up and they were put still farther off to the left Sheridan feeling certain that there lay the route by which the enemy intended to escape He wanted to attack feeling that if time was given the enemy would get away but Meade prevented this preferring to wait till his troops were all up At this juncture Sheridan sent me a letter which had been handed to him by a colored man with a note from himself saying that he wished I was there myself The letter was dated Amelia Court House April fifth and signed by Colonel Taylor It was to his mother and showed the demoralization of the Confederate army Sheridan s note also gave me the information as here related of the movements of that day I received a second message from Sheridan on the fifth in which he urged more emphatically the importance of my presence This was brought to me by a scout in gray uniform It was written on tissue paper and wrapped up in tin foil such as chewing tobacco is folded in This was a precaution taken so that if the scout should be captured he could take this tin foil out of his pocket and putting it into his mouth chew it It would cause no surprise at all to see a Confederate soldier chewing tobacco It was nearly night when this letter was received I gave Ord directions to continue his march to Burkesville and there intrench himself for the night and in the morning to move west to cut off all the roads between there and Farmville I then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort of cavalry going directly through the woods to join Meade s army The distance was about sixteen miles but the night being dark our progress was slow through the woods in the absence of direct roads However we got to the outposts about ten o clock in the evening and after some little parley convinced the sentinels of our identity and were conducted in to where Sheridan was bivouacked We talked over the situation for some little time Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee was trying to do and that Meade s orders if carried out moving to the right flank would give him the coveted opportunity of escaping us and putting us in rear of him We then together visited Meade reaching his headquarters about midnight I explained to Meade that we did not want to follow the enemy we wanted to get ahead of him and that his orders would allow the enemy to escape and besides that I had no doubt that Lee was moving right then Meade changed his orders at once They were now given for an advance on Amelia Court House at an early hour in the morning as the army then lay that is the infantry being across the railroad most of it to the west of the road with the cavalry swung out still farther to the left CHAPTER LXVI BATTLE OF SAILOR S CREEK ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE CORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL LEE SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY The Appomattox going westward takes a long sweep to the south west from the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville Railroad bridge and then trends north westerly Sailor s Creek an insignificant stream running northward empties into the Appomattox between the High Bridge and Jetersville Near the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg to Lynchburg crosses the Appomattox River also on a bridge The railroad runs on the north side of the river to Farmville a few miles west and from there recrossing continues on the south side of it The roads coming up from the south east to Farmville cross the Appomattox River there on a bridge and run on the north side leaving the Lynchburg and Petersburg Railroad well to the left Lee in pushing out from Amelia Court House availed himself of all the roads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to move upon and never permitted the head of his columns to stop because of any fighting that might be going on in his rear In this way he came very near succeeding in getting to his provision trains and eluding us with at least part of his army As expected Lee s troops had moved during the night before and our army in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered them There was a good deal of fighting before Sailor s Creek was reached Our cavalry charged in upon a body of theirs which was escorting a wagon train in order to get it past our left A severe engagement ensued in which we captured many prisoners and many men also were killed and wounded There was as much gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates in these little engagements as was displayed at any time during the war notwithstanding the sad defeats of the past week The armies finally met on Sailor s Creek when a heavy engagement took place in which infantry artillery and cavalry were all brought into action Our men on the right as they were brought in against the enemy came in on higher ground and upon his flank giving us every advantage to be derived from the lay of the country Our firing was also very much more rapid because the enemy commenced his retreat westward and in firing as he retreated had to turn around every time he fired The enemy s loss was very heavy as well in killed and wounded as in captures Some six general officers fell into our hands in this engagement and seven thousand men were made prisoners This engagement was commenced in the middle of the afternoon of the sixth and the retreat and pursuit were continued until nightfall when the armies bivouacked upon the ground where the night had overtaken them When the move towards Amelia Court House had commenced that morning I ordered Wright s corps which was on the extreme right to be moved to the left past the whole army to take the place of Griffin s and ordered the latter at the same time to move by and place itself on the right The object of this movement was to get the sixth corps Wright s next to the cavalry with which they had formerly served so harmoniously and so efficiently in the valley of Virginia The sixth corps now remained with the cavalry and under Sheridan s direct command until after the surrender Ord had been directed to take possession of all the roads southward between Burkesville and the High Bridge On the morning of the sixth he sent Colonel Washburn with two infantry regiments with instructions to destroy High Bridge and to return rapidly to Burkesville Station and he prepared himself to resist the enemy there Soon after Washburn had started Ord became a little alarmed as to his safety and sent Colonel Read of his staff with about eighty cavalrymen to overtake him and bring him back Very shortly after this he heard that the head of Lee s column had got up to the road between him and where Washburn now was and attempted to send reinforcements but the reinforcements could not get through Read however had got through ahead of the enemy He rode on to Farmville and was on his way back again when he found his return cut off and Washburn confronting apparently the advance of Lee s army Read drew his men up into line of battle his force now consisting of less than six hundred men infantry and cavalry and rode along their front making a speech to his men to inspire them with the same enthusiasm that he himself felt He then gave the order to charge This little band made several charges of course unsuccessful ones but inflicted a loss upon the enemy more than equal to their own entire number Colonel Read fell mortally wounded and then Washburn and at the close of the conflict nearly every officer of the command and most of the rank and file had been either killed or wounded The remainder then surrendered The Confederates took this to be only the advance of a larger column which had headed them off and so stopped to intrench so that this gallant band of six hundred had checked the progress of a strong detachment of the Confederate army This stoppage of Lee s column no doubt saved to us the trains following Lee himself pushed on and crossed the wagon road bridge near the High Bridge and attempted to destroy it He did set fire to it but the flames had made but little headway when Humphreys came up with his corps and drove away the rear guard which had been left to protect it while it was being burned up Humphreys forced his way across with some loss and followed Lee to the intersection of the road crossing at Farmville with the one from Petersburg Here Lee held a position which was very strong naturally besides being intrenched Humphreys was alone confronting him all through the day and in a very hazardous position He put on a bold face however and assaulted with some loss but was not assaulted in return Our cavalry had gone farther south by the way of Prince Edward s Court House along with the fifth corps Griffin s Ord falling in between Griffin and the Appomattox Crook s division of cavalry and Wright s corps pushed on west of Farmville When the cavalry reached Farmville they found that some of the Confederates were in ahead of them and had already got their trains of provisions back to that point but our troops were in time to prevent them from securing anything to eat although they succeeded in again running the trains off so that we did not get them for some time These troops retreated to the north side of the Appomattox to join Lee and succeeded in destroying the bridge after them Considerable fighting ensued there between Wright s corps and a portion of our cavalry and the Confederates but finally the cavalry forded the stream and drove them away Wright built a foot bridge for his men to march over on and then marched out to the junction of the roads to relieve Humphreys arriving there that night I had stopped the night before at Burkesville Junction Our troops were then pretty much all out of the place but we had a field hospital there and Ord s command was extended from that point towards Farmville Here I met doctor Smith a Virginian and an officer of the regular army who told me that in a conversation with General Ewell one of the prisoners and a relative of his Ewell had said that when we had got across the James River he knew their cause was lost and it was the duty of their authorities to make the best terms they could while they still had a right to claim concessions The authorities thought differently however Now the cause was lost and they had no right to claim anything He said further that for every man that was killed after this in the war somebody is responsible and it would be but very little better than murder He was not sure that Lee would consent to surrender his army without being able to consult with the President but he hoped he would I rode in to Farmville on the seventh arriving there early in the day Sheridan and Ord were pushing through away to the south Meade was back towards the High Bridge and Humphreys confronting Lee as before stated After having gone into bivouac at Prince Edward s Court House Sheridan learned that seven trains of provisions and forage were at Appomattox and determined to start at once and capture them and a forced march was necessary in order to get there before Lee s army could secure them He wrote me a note telling me this This fact together with the incident related the night before by doctor Smith gave me the idea of opening correspondence with General Lee on the subject of the surrender of his army I therefore wrote to him on this day as follows HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U S five P M April seven eighteen sixty five GENERAL R E LEE Commanding C S A The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle I feel that it is so and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of Northern Virginia U S GRANT Lieut General Lee replied on the evening of the same day as follows April seven eighteen sixty five GENERAL I have received your note of this day Though not entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood and therefore before considering your proposition ask the terms you will offer on condition of its surrender R E LEE General LIEUT GENERAL U S GRANT Commanding Armies of the U S This was not satisfactory but I regarded it as deserving another letter and wrote him as follows April eight eighteen sixty five GENERAL R E LEE Commanding C S A Your note of last evening in reply to mine of same date asking the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia is just received In reply I would say that peace being my great desire there is but one condition I would insist upon namely that the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for taking up arms again against the Government of the United States until properly exchanged I will meet you or will designate officers to meet any officers you may name for the same purpose at any point agreeable to you for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be received U S GRANT Lieut General Lee s army was rapidly crumbling Many of his soldiers had enlisted from that part of the State where they now were and were continually dropping out of the ranks and going to their homes I know that I occupied a hotel almost destitute of furniture at Farmville which had probably been used as a Confederate hospital The next morning when I came out I found a Confederate colonel there who reported to me and said that he was the proprietor of that house and that he was a colonel of a regiment that had been raised in that neighborhood He said that when he came along past home he found that he was the only man of the regiment remaining with Lee s army so he just dropped out and now wanted to surrender himself I told him to stay there and he would not be molested That was one regiment which had been eliminated from Lee s force by this crumbling process Although Sheridan had been marching all day his troops moved with alacrity and without any straggling They began to see the end of what they had been fighting four years for Nothing seemed to fatigue them They were ready to move without rations and travel without rest until the end Straggling had entirely ceased and every man was now a rival for the front The infantry marched about as rapidly as the cavalry could Sheridan sent Custer with his division to move south of Appomattox Station which is about five miles south west of the Court House to get west of the trains and destroy the roads to the rear They got there the night of the eighth and succeeded partially but some of the train men had just discovered the movement of our troops and succeeded in running off three of the trains The other four were held by Custer The head of Lee s column came marching up there on the morning of the ninth not dreaming I suppose that there were any Union soldiers near The Confederates were surprised to find our cavalry had possession of the trains However they were desperate and at once assaulted hoping to recover them In the melee that ensued they succeeded in burning one of the trains but not in getting anything from it Custer then ordered the other trains run back on the road towards Farmville and the fight continued So far only our cavalry and the advance of Lee s army were engaged Soon however Lee s men were brought up from the rear no doubt expecting they had nothing to meet but our cavalry But our infantry had pushed forward so rapidly that by the time the enemy got up they found Griffin s corps and the Army of the James confronting them A sharp engagement ensued but Lee quickly set up a white flag CHAPTER LXVII NEGOTIATIONS AT APPOMATTOX INTERVIEW WITH LEE AT MCLEAN S HOUSE THE TERMS OF SURRENDER LEE S SURRENDER INTERVIEW WITH LEE AFTER THE SURRENDER On the eighth I had followed the Army of the Potomac in rear of Lee I was suffering very severely with a sick headache and stopped at a farmhouse on the road some distance in rear of the main body of the army I spent the night in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard and putting mustard plasters on my wrists and the back part of my neck hoping to be cured by morning During the night I received Lee s answer to my letter of the eighth inviting an interview between the lines on the following morning forty three But it was for a different purpose from that of surrendering his army and I answered him as follows HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U S April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL R E LEE Commanding C S A Your note of yesterday is received As I have no authority to treat on the subject of peace the meeting proposed for ten A M to day could lead to no good I will state however General that I am equally anxious for peace with yourself and the whole North entertains the same feeling The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood By the South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirable event save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed Sincerely hoping that all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life I subscribe myself et cetera U S GRANT Lieutenant General I proceeded at an early hour in the morning still suffering with the headache to get to the head of the column I was not more than two or three miles from Appomattox Court House at the time but to go direct I would have to pass through Lee s army or a portion of it I had therefore to move south in order to get upon a road coming up from another direction When the white flag was put out by Lee as already described I was in this way moving towards Appomattox Court House and consequently could not be communicated with immediately and be informed of what Lee had done Lee therefore sent a flag to the rear to advise Meade and one to the front to Sheridan saying that he had sent a message to me for the purpose of having a meeting to consult about the surrender of his army and asked for a suspension of hostilities until I could be communicated with As they had heard nothing of this until the fighting had got to be severe and all going against Lee both of these commanders hesitated very considerably about suspending hostilities at all They were afraid it was not in good faith and we had the Army of Northern Virginia where it could not escape except by some deception They however finally consented to a suspension of hostilities for two hours to give an opportunity of communicating with me in that time if possible It was found that from the route I had taken they would probably not be able to communicate with me and get an answer back within the time fixed unless the messenger should pass through the rebel lines Lee therefore sent an escort with the officer bearing this message through his lines to me April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL I received your note of this morning on the picket line whither I had come to meet you and ascertain definitely what terms were embraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrender of this army I now request an interview in accordance with the offer contained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose R E LEE General LIEUTENANT GENERAL U S GRANT Commanding U S Armies When the officer reached me I was still suffering with the sick headache but the instant I saw the contents of the note I was cured I wrote the following note in reply and hastened on April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL R E LEE Commanding C S Armies Your note of this date is but this moment eleven point fifty A M received in consequence of my having passed from the Richmond and Lynchburg road to the Farmville and Lynchburg road I am at this writing about four miles west of Walker s Church and will push forward to the front for the purpose of meeting you Notice sent to me on this road where you wish the interview to take place will meet me U S GRANT Lieutenant General I was conducted at once to where Sheridan was located with his troops drawn up in line of battle facing the Confederate army near by They were very much excited and expressed their view that this was all a ruse employed to enable the Confederates to get away They said they believed that Johnston was marching up from North Carolina now and Lee was moving to join him and they would whip the rebels where they now were in five minutes if I would only let them go in But I had no doubt about the good faith of Lee and pretty soon was conducted to where he was I found him at the house of a mister McLean at Appomattox Court House with Colonel Marshall one of his staff officers awaiting my arrival The head of his column was occupying a hill on a portion of which was an apple orchard beyond a little valley which separated it from that on the crest of which Sheridan s forces were drawn up in line of battle to the south Before stating what took place between General Lee and myself I will give all there is of the story of the famous apple tree Wars produce many stories of fiction some of which are told until they are believed to be true The war of the rebellion was no exception to this rule and the story of the apple tree is one of those fictions based on a slight foundation of fact As I have said there was an apple orchard on the side of the hill occupied by the Confederate forces Running diagonally up the hill was a wagon road which at one point ran very near one of the trees so that the wheels of vehicles had on that side cut off the roots of this tree leaving a little embankment General Babcock of my staff reported to me that when he first met General Lee he was sitting upon this embankment with his feet in the road below and his back resting against the tree The story had no other foundation than that Like many other stories it would be very good if it was only true I had known General Lee in the old army and had served with him in the Mexican War but did not suppose owing to the difference in our age and rank that he would remember me while I would more naturally remember him distinctly because he was the chief of staff of General Scott in the Mexican War When I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the result that was then taking place and consequently was in rough garb I was without a sword as I usually was when on horseback on the field and wore a soldier s blouse for a coat with the shoulder straps of my rank to indicate to the army who I was When I went into the house I found General Lee We greeted each other and after shaking hands took our seats I had my staff with me a good portion of whom were in the room during the whole of the interview What General Lee s feelings were I do not know As he was a man of much dignity with an impassible face it was impossible to say whether he felt inwardly glad that the end had finally come or felt sad over the result and was too manly to show it Whatever his feelings they were entirely concealed from my observation but my own feelings which had been quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter were sad and depressed I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly and had suffered so much for a cause though that cause was I believe one of the worst for which a people ever fought and one for which there was the least excuse I do not question however the sincerity of the great mass of those who were opposed to us General Lee was dressed in a full uniform which was entirely new and was wearing a sword of considerable value very likely the sword which had been presented by the State of Virginia at all events it was an entirely different sword from the one that would ordinarily be worn in the field In my rough traveling suit the uniform of a private with the straps of a lieutenant general I must have contrasted very strangely with a man so handsomely dressed six feet high and of faultless form But this was not a matter that I thought of until afterwards We soon fell into a conversation about old army times He remarked that he remembered me very well in the old army and I told him that as a matter of course I remembered him perfectly but from the difference in our rank and years there being about sixteen years difference in our ages I had thought it very likely that I had not attracted his attention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a long interval Our conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot the object of our meeting After the conversation had run on in this style for some time General Lee called my attention to the object of our meeting and said that he had asked for this interview for the purpose of getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army I said that I meant merely that his army should lay down their arms not to take them up again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properly exchanged He said that he had so understood my letter Then we gradually fell off again into conversation about matters foreign to the subject which had brought us together This continued for some little time when General Lee again interrupted the course of the conversation by suggesting that the terms I proposed to give his army ought to be written out I called to General Parker secretary on my staff for writing materials and commenced writing out the following terms APPOMATTOX C H VA Ap nineteenth eighteen sixty five general R E LEE Comd g C S A general In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the eighth inst I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of N Va on the following terms to wit Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate One copy to be given to an officer designated by me the other to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the United States until properly exchanged and each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the men of their commands The arms artillery and public property to be parked and stacked and turned over to the officer appointed by me to receive them This will not embrace the side arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage This done each officer and man will be allowed to return to their homes not to be disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside Very respectfully U S GRANT lieutenant general When I put my pen to the paper I did not know the first word that I should make use of in writing the terms I only knew what was in my mind and I wished to express it clearly so that there could be no mistaking it As I wrote on the thought occurred to me that the officers had their own private horses and effects which were important to them but of no value to us also that it would be an unnecessary humiliation to call upon them to deliver their side arms No conversation not one word passed between General Lee and myself either about private property side arms or kindred subjects He appeared to have no objections to the terms first proposed or if he had a point to make against them he wished to wait until they were in writing to make it When he read over that part of the terms about side arms horses and private property of the officers he remarked with some feeling I thought that this would have a happy effect upon his army Then after a little further conversation General Lee remarked to me again that their army was organized a little differently from the army of the United States still maintaining by implication that we were two countries that in their army the cavalrymen and artillerists owned their own horses and he asked if he was to understand that the men who so owned their horses were to be permitted to retain them I told him that as the terms were written they would not that only the officers were permitted to take their private property He then after reading over the terms a second time remarked that that was clear I then said to him that I thought this would be about the last battle of the war I sincerely hoped so and I said further I took it that most of the men in the ranks were small farmers The whole country had been so raided by the two armies that it was doubtful whether they would be able to put in a crop to carry themselves and their families through the next winter without the aid of the horses they were then riding The United States did not want them and I would therefore instruct the officers I left behind to receive the paroles of his troops to let every man of the Confederate army who claimed to own a horse or mule take the animal to his home Lee remarked again that this would have a happy effect He then sat down and wrote out the following letter HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL I received your letter of this date containing the terms of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the eighth inst they are accepted I will proceed to designate the proper officers to carry the stipulations into effect R E LEE General LIEUT GENERAL U S GRANT While duplicates of the two letters were being made the Union generals present were severally presented to General Lee The much talked of surrendering of Lee s sword and my handing it back this and much more that has been said about it is the purest romance The word sword or side arms was not mentioned by either of us until I wrote it in the terms There was no premeditation and it did not occur to me until the moment I wrote it down If I had happened to omit it and General Lee had called my attention to it I should have put it in the terms precisely as I acceded to the provision about the soldiers retaining their horses General Lee after all was completed and before taking his leave remarked that his army was in a very bad condition for want of food and that they were without forage that his men had been living for some days on parched corn exclusively and that he would have to ask me for rations and forage I told him certainly and asked for how many men he wanted rations His answer was about twenty five thousand and I authorized him to send his own commissary and quartermaster to Appomattox Station two or three miles away where he could have out of the trains we had stopped all the provisions wanted As for forage we had ourselves depended almost entirely upon the country for that Generals Gibbon Griffin and Merritt were designated by me to carry into effect the paroling of Lee s troops before they should start for their homes General Lee leaving Generals Longstreet Gordon and Pendleton for them to confer with in order to facilitate this work Lee and I then separated as cordially as we had met he returning to his own lines and all went into bivouac for the night at Appomattox Soon after Lee s departure I telegraphed to Washington as follows HEADQUARTERS APPOMATTOX C H VA April ninth eighteen sixty five four point thirty P M honorable E M STANTON Secretary of War Washington General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon on terms proposed by myself The accompanying additional correspondence will show the conditions fully U S GRANT Lieut General When news of the surrender first reached our lines our men commenced firing a salute of a hundred guns in honor of the victory I at once sent word however to have it stopped The Confederates were now our prisoners and we did not want to exult over their downfall I determined to return to Washington at once with a view to putting a stop to the purchase of supplies and what I now deemed other useless outlay of money Before leaving however I thought I forty four would like to see General Lee again so next morning I rode out beyond our lines towards his headquarters preceded by a bugler and a staff officer carrying a white flag Lee soon mounted his horse seeing who it was and met me We had there between the lines sitting on horseback a very pleasant conversation of over half an hour in the course of which Lee said to me that the South was a big country and that we might have to march over it three or four times before the war entirely ended but that we would now be able to do it as they could no longer resist us He expressed it as his earnest hope however that we would not be called upon to cause more loss and sacrifice of life but he could not foretell the result I then suggested to General Lee that there was not a man in the Confederacy whose influence with the soldiery and the whole people was as great as his and that if he would now advise the surrender of all the armies I had no doubt his advice would be followed with alacrity But Lee said that he could not do that without consulting the President first I knew there was no use to urge him to do anything against his ideas of what was right I was accompanied by my staff and other officers some of whom seemed to have a great desire to go inside the Confederate lines They finally asked permission of Lee to do so for the purpose of seeing some of their old army friends and the permission was granted They went over had a very pleasant time with their old friends and brought some of them back with them when they returned When Lee and I separated he went back to his lines and I returned to the house of mister McLean Here the officers of both armies came in great numbers and seemed to enjoy the meeting as much as though they had been friends separated for a long time while fighting battles under the same flag For the time being it looked very much as if all thought of the war had escaped their minds After an hour pleasantly passed in this way I set out on horseback accompanied by my staff and a small escort for Burkesville Junction up to which point the railroad had by this time been repaired CHAPTER LXVIII MORALE OF THE TWO ARMIES RELATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH PRESIDENT LINCOLN VISITS RICHMOND ARRIVAL AT WASHINGTON PRESIDENT LINCOLN S ASSASSINATION PRESIDENT JOHNSON S POLICY After the fall of Petersburg and when the armies of the Potomac and the James were in motion to head off Lee s army the morale of the National troops had greatly improved There was no more straggling no more rear guards The men who in former times had been falling back were now as I have already stated striving to get to the front For the first time in four weary years they felt that they were now nearing the time when they could return to their homes with their country saved On the other hand the Confederates were more than correspondingly depressed Their despondency increased with each returning day and especially after the battle of Sailor s Creek They threw away their arms in constantly increasing numbers dropping out of the ranks and betaking themselves to the woods in the hope of reaching their homes I have already instanced the case of the entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I met at Farmville As a result of these and other influences when Lee finally surrendered at Appomattox there were only twenty eight thousand three hundred fifty six officers and men left to be paroled and many of these were without arms It was probably this latter fact which gave rise to the statement sometimes made North and South that Lee surrendered a smaller number of men than what the official figures show As a matter of official record and in addition to the number paroled as given above we captured between March twenty ninth and the date of surrender nineteen thousand one hundred thirty two Confederates to say nothing of Lee s other losses killed wounded and missing during the series of desperate conflicts which marked his headlong and determined flight The same record shows the number of cannon including those at Appomattox to have been six hundred eighty nine between the dates named There has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the number of troops engaged in every battle or all important battles fought between the sections the South magnifying the number of Union troops engaged and belittling their own Northern writers have fallen in many instances into the same error I have often heard gentlemen who were thoroughly loyal to the Union speak of what a splendid fight the South had made and successfully continued for four years before yielding with their twelve million of people against our twenty and of the twelve four being colored slaves non combatants I will add to their argument We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who volunteered under great difficulty from the twelve million belonging to the South But the South had rebelled against the National government It was not bound by any constitutional restrictions The whole South was a military camp The occupation of the colored people was to furnish supplies for the army Conscription was resorted to early and embraced every male from the age of eighteen to forty five excluding only those physically unfit to serve in the field and the necessary number of civil officers of State and intended National government The old and physically disabled furnished a good portion of these The slaves the non combatants one third of the whole were required to work in the field without regard to sex and almost without regard to age Children from the age of eight years could and did handle the hoe they were not much older when they began to hold the plough The four million of colored non combatants were equal to more than three times their number in the North age for age and sex for sex in supplying food from the soil to support armies Women did not work in the fields in the North and children attended school The arts of peace were carried on in the North Towns and cities grew during the war Inventions were made in all kinds of machinery to increase the products of a day s labor in the shop and in the field In the South no opposition was allowed to the government which had been set up and which would have become real and respected if the rebellion had been successful No rear had to be protected All the troops in service could be brought to the front to contest every inch of ground threatened with invasion The press of the South like the people who remained at home were loyal to the Southern cause In the North the country the towns and the cities presented about the same appearance they do in time of peace The furnace was in blast the shops were filled with workmen the fields were cultivated not only to supply the population of the North and the troops invading the South but to ship abroad to pay a part of the expense of the war In the North the press was free up to the point of open treason The citizen could entertain his views and express them Troops were necessary in the Northern States to prevent prisoners from the Southern army being released by outside force armed and set at large to destroy by fire our Northern cities Plans were formed by Northern and Southern citizens to burn our cities to poison the water supplying them to spread infection by importing clothing from infected regions to blow up our river and lake steamers regardless of the destruction of innocent lives The copperhead disreputable portion of the press magnified rebel successes and belittled those of the Union army It was with a large following an auxiliary to the Confederate army The North would have been much stronger with a hundred thousand of these men in the Confederate ranks and the rest of their kind thoroughly subdued as the Union sentiment was in the South than we were as the battle was fought As I have said the whole South was a military camp The colored people four million in number were submissive and worked in the field and took care of the families while the able bodied white men were at the front fighting for a cause destined to defeat The cause was popular and was enthusiastically supported by the young men The conscription took all of them Before the war was over further conscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of age as junior reserves and those between forty five and sixty as senior reserves It would have been an offence directly after the war and perhaps it would be now to ask any able bodied man in the South who was between the ages of fourteen and sixty at any time during the war whether he had been in the Confederate army He would assert that he had or account for his absence from the ranks Under such circumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such a superiority of force in every battle fought I know they did not During eighteen sixty two and three John H Morgan a partisan officer of no military education but possessed of courage and endurance operated in the rear of the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and Tennessee He had no base of supplies to protect but was at home wherever he went The army operating against the South on the contrary had to protect its lines of communication with the North from which all supplies had to come to the front Every foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed at convenient distances apart These guards could not render assistance beyond the points where stationed Morgan Was foot loose and could operate where his information always correct led him to believe he could do the greatest damage During the time he was operating in this way he killed wounded and captured several times the number he ever had under his command at any one time He destroyed many millions of property in addition Places he did not attack had to be guarded as if threatened by him Forrest an abler soldier operated farther west and held from the National front quite as many men as could be spared for offensive operations It is safe to say that more than half the National army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies or were on leave sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their bearing arms Then again large forces were employed where no Confederate army confronted them I deem it safe to say that there were no large engagements where the National numbers compensated for the advantage of position and intrenchment occupied by the enemy While I was in pursuit of General Lee the President went to Richmond in company with Admiral Porter and on board his flagship He found the people of that city in great consternation The leading citizens among the people who had remained at home surrounded him anxious that something should be done to relieve them from suspense General Weitzel was not then in the city having taken offices in one of the neighboring villages after his troops had succeeded in subduing the conflagration which they had found in progress on entering the Confederate capital The President sent for him and on his arrival a short interview was had on board the vessel Admiral Porter and a leading citizen of Virginia being also present After this interview the President wrote an order in about these words which I quote from memory General Weitzel is authorized to permit the body calling itself the Legislature of Virginia to meet for the purpose of recalling the Virginia troops from the Confederate armies Immediately some of the gentlemen composing that body wrote out a call for a meeting and had it published in their papers This call however went very much further than mister Lincoln had contemplated as he did not say the Legislature of Virginia but the body which called itself the Legislature of Virginia mister Stanton saw the call as published in the Northern papers the very next issue and took the liberty of countermanding the order authorizing any meeting of the Legislature or any other body and this notwithstanding the fact that the President was nearer the spot than he was This was characteristic of mister Stanton He was a man who never questioned his own authority and who always did in war time what he wanted to do He was an able constitutional lawyer and jurist but the Constitution was not an impediment to him while the war lasted In this latter particular I entirely agree with the view he evidently held The Constitution was not framed with a view to any such rebellion as that of eighteen sixty one five While it did not authorize rebellion it made no provision against it Yet the right to resist or suppress rebellion is as inherent as the right of self defence and as natural as the right of an individual to preserve his life when in jeopardy The Constitution was therefore in abeyance for the time being so far as it in any way affected the progress and termination of the war Those in rebellion against the government of the United States were not restricted by constitutional provisions or any other except the acts of their Congress which was loyal and devoted to the cause for which the South was then fighting It would be a hard case when one third of a nation united in rebellion against the national authority is entirely untrammeled that the other two thirds in their efforts to maintain the Union intact should be restrained by a Constitution prepared by our ancestors for the express purpose of insuring the permanency of the confederation of the States After I left General Lee at Appomattox Station I went with my staff and a few others directly to Burkesville Station on my way to Washington The road from Burkesville back having been newly repaired and the ground being soft the train got off the track frequently and as a result it was after midnight of the second day when I reached City Point As soon as possible I took a dispatch boat thence to Washington City While in Washington I was very busy for a time in preparing the necessary orders for the new state of affairs communicating with my different commanders of separate departments bodies of troops et cetera But by the fourteenth I was pretty well through with this work so as to be able to visit my children who were then in Burlington New Jersey attending school missus Grant was with me in Washington at the time and we were invited by President and missus Lincoln to accompany them to the theatre on the evening of that day I replied to the President s verbal invitation to the effect that if we were in the city we would take great pleasure in accompanying them but that I was very anxious to get away and visit my children and if I could get through my work during the day I should do so I did get through and started by the evening train on the fourteenth sending mister Lincoln word of course that I would not be at the theatre At that time the railroad to New York entered Philadelphia on Broad Street passengers were conveyed in ambulances to the Delaware River and then ferried to Camden at which point they took the cars again When I reached the ferry on the east side of the City of Philadelphia I found people awaiting my arrival there and also dispatches informing me of the assassination of the President and mister Seward and of the probable assassination of the Vice President mister Johnson and requesting my immediate return It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame me at the news of these assassinations more especially the assassination of the President I knew his goodness of heart his generosity his yielding disposition his desire to have everybody happy and above all his desire to see all the people of the United States enter again upon the full privileges of citizenship with equality among all I knew also the feeling that mister Johnson had expressed in speeches and conversation against the Southern people and I feared that his course towards them would be such as to repel and make them unwilling citizens and if they became such they would remain so for a long while I felt that reconstruction had been set back no telling how far I immediately arranged for getting a train to take me back to Washington City but missus Grant was with me it was after midnight and Burlington was but an hour away Finding that I could accompany her to our house and return about as soon as they would be ready to take me from the Philadelphia station I went up with her and returned immediately by the same special train The joy that I had witnessed among the people in the street and in public places in Washington when I left there had been turned to grief the city was in reality a city of mourning I have stated what I believed then the effect of this would be and my judgment now is that I was right I believe the South would have been saved from very much of the hardness of feeling that was engendered by mister Johnson s course towards them during the first few months of his administration Be this as it may mister Lincoln s assassination was particularly unfortunate for the entire nation mister Johnson s course towards the South did engender bitterness of feeling His denunciations of treason and his ever ready remark Treason is a crime and must be made odious was repeated to all those men of the South who came to him to get some assurances of safety so that they might go to work at something with the feeling that what they obtained would be secure to them He uttered his denunciations with great vehemence and as they were accompanied with no assurances of safety many Southerners were driven to a point almost beyond endurance The President of the United States is in a large degree or ought to be a representative of the feeling wishes and judgment of those over whom he presides and the Southerners who read the denunciations of themselves and their people must have come to the conclusion that he uttered the sentiments of the Northern people whereas as a matter of fact but for the assassination of mister Lincoln I believe the great majority of the Northern people and the soldiers unanimously would have been in favor of a speedy reconstruction on terms that would be the least humiliating to the people who had rebelled against their government They believed I have no doubt as I did that besides being the mildest it was also the wisest policy The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back into the Union and be incorporated as an integral part of the nation Naturally the nearer they were placed to an equality with the people who had not rebelled the more reconciled they would feel with their old antagonists and the better citizens they would be from the beginning They surely would not make good citizens if they felt that they had a yoke around their necks I do not believe that the majority of the Northern people at that time were in favor of negro suffrage They supposed that it would naturally follow the freedom of the negro but that there would be a time of probation in which the ex slaves could prepare themselves for the privileges of citizenship before the full right would be conferred but mister Johnson after a complete revolution of sentiment seemed to regard the South not only as an oppressed people but as the people best entitled to consideration of any of our citizens This was more than the people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union were prepared for and they became more radical in their views The Southerners had the most power in the executive branch mister Johnson having gone to their side and with a compact South and such sympathy and support as they could get from the North they felt that they would be able to control the nation at once and already many of them acted as if they thought they were entitled to do so Thus mister Johnson fighting Congress on the one hand and receiving the support of the South on the other drove Congress which was overwhelmingly republican to the passing of first one measure and then another to restrict his power There being a solid South on one side that was in accord with the political party in the North which had sympathized with the rebellion it finally in the judgment of Congress and of the majority of the legislatures of the States became necessary to enfranchise the negro in all his ignorance In this work I shall not discuss the question of how far the policy of Congress in this particular proved a wise one It became an absolute necessity however because of the foolhardiness of the President and the blindness of the Southern people to their own interest As to myself while strongly favoring the course that would be the least humiliating to the people who had been in rebellion I gradually worked up to the point where with the majority of the people I favored immediate enfranchisement CHAPTER LXIX SHERMAN AND JOHNSTON JOHNSTON S SURRENDER TO SHERMAN CAPTURE OF MOBILE WILSON S EXPEDITION CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS GENERAL THOMAS S QUALITIES ESTIMATE OF GENERAL CANBY When I left Appomattox I ordered General Meade to proceed leisurely back to Burkesville Station with the Army of the Potomac and the Army of the James and to go into camp there until further orders from me General Johnston as has been stated before was in North Carolina confronting General Sherman It could not be known positively of course whether Johnston would surrender on the news of Lee s surrender though I supposed he would and if he did not Burkesville Station was the natural point from which to move to attack him The army which I could have sent against him was superior to his and that with which Sherman confronted him was also superior and between the two he would necessarily have been crushed or driven away With the loss of their capital and the Army of Northern Virginia it was doubtful whether Johnston s men would have the spirit to stand My belief was that he would make no such attempt but I adopted this course as a precaution against what might happen however improbable Simultaneously with my starting from City Point I sent a messenger to North Carolina by boat with dispatches to General Sherman informing him of the surrender of Lee and his army also of the terms which I had given him and I authorized Sherman to give the same terms to Johnston if the latter chose to accept them The country is familiar with the terms that Sherman agreed to CONDITIONALLY because they embraced a political question as well as a military one and he would therefore have to confer with the government before agreeing to them definitely General Sherman had met mister Lincoln at City Point while visiting there to confer with me about our final movement and knew what mister Lincoln had said to the peace commissioners when he met them at Hampton Roads viz that before he could enter into negotiations with them they would have to agree to two points one being that the Union should be preserved and the other that slavery should be abolished and if they were ready to concede these two points he was almost ready to sign his name to a blank piece of paper and permit them to fill out the balance of the terms upon which we would live together He had also seen notices in the newspapers of mister Lincoln s visit to Richmond and had read in the same papers that while there he had authorized the convening of the Legislature of Virginia Sherman thought no doubt in adding to the terms that I had made with general Lee that he was but carrying out the wishes of the President of the United States But seeing that he was going beyond his authority he made it a point that the terms were only conditional They signed them with this understanding and agreed to a truce until the terms could be sent to Washington for approval if approved by the proper authorities there they would then be final if not approved then he would give due notice before resuming hostilities As the world knows Sherman from being one of the most popular generals of the land Congress having even gone so far as to propose a bill providing for a second lieutenant general for the purpose of advancing him to that grade was denounced by the President and Secretary of War in very bitter terms Some people went so far as to denounce him as a traitor a most preposterous term to apply to a man who had rendered so much service as he had even supposing he had made a mistake in granting such terms as he did to Johnston and his army If Sherman had taken authority to send Johnston with his army home with their arms to be put in the arsenals of their own States without submitting the question to the authorities at Washington the suspicions against him might have some foundation But the feeling against Sherman died out very rapidly and it was not many weeks before he was restored to the fullest confidence of the American people When some days after my return to Washington President Johnson and the Secretary of war received the terms which General Sherman had forwarded for approval a cabinet meeting was immediately called and I was sent for There seemed to be the greatest consternation lest Sherman would commit the government to terms which they were not willing to accede to and which he had no right to grant A message went out directing the troops in the South not to obey General Sherman I was ordered to proceed at once to North Carolina and take charge of matter there myself Of course I started without delay and reached there as soon as possible I repaired to Raleigh where Sherman was as quietly as possible hoping to see him without even his army learning of my presence When I arrived I went to Sherman s headquarters and we were at once closeted together I showed him the instruction and orders under which I visited him I told him that I wanted him to notify General Johnston that the terms which they had conditionally agreed upon had not been approved in Washington and that he was authorized to offer the same terms I had given General Lee I sent Sherman to do this himself I did not wish the knowledge of my presence to be known to the army generally so I left it to Sherman to negotiate the terms of the surrender solely by himself and without the enemy knowing that I was anywhere near the field As soon as possible I started to get away to leave Sherman quite free and untrammelled At Goldsboro on my way back I met a mail containing the last newspapers and I found in them indications of great excitement in the North over the terms Sherman had given Johnston and harsh orders that had been promulgated by the President and Secretary of War I knew that Sherman must see these papers and I fully realized what great indignation they would cause him though I do not think his feelings could have been more excited than were my own But like the true and loyal soldier that he was he carried out the instructions I had given him obtained the surrender of Johnston s army and settled down in his camp about Raleigh to await final orders There were still a few expeditions out in the South that could not be communicated with and had to be left to act according to the judgment of their respective commanders With these it was impossible to tell how the news of the surrender of Lee and Johnston of which they must have heard might affect their judgment as to what was best to do The three expeditions which I had tried so hard to get off from the commands of Thomas and Canby did finally get off one under Canby himself against Mobile late in March that under Stoneman from East Tennessee on the twentieth and the one under Wilson starting from Eastport Mississippi on the twenty twod of March They were all eminently successful but without any good result Indeed much valuable property was destroyed and many lives lost at a time when we would have liked to spare them The war was practically over before their victories were gained They were so late in commencing operations that they did not hold any troops away that otherwise would have been operating against the armies which were gradually forcing the Confederate armies to a surrender The only possible good that we may have experienced from these raids was by Stoneman s getting near Lynchburg about the time the armies of the Potomac and the James were closing in on Lee at Appomattox Stoneman entered North Carolina and then pushed north to strike the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad He got upon that road destroyed its bridges at different places and rendered the road useless to the enemy up to within a few miles of Lynchburg His approach caused the evacuation of that city about the time we were at Appomattox and was the cause of a commotion we heard of there He then pushed south and was operating in the rear of Johnston s army about the time the negotiations were going on between Sherman and Johnston for the latter s surrender In this raid Stoneman captured and destroyed a large amount of stores while fourteen guns and nearly two thousand prisoners were the trophies of his success Canby appeared before Mobile on the twenty seventh of March The city of Mobile was protected by two forts besides other intrenchments Spanish Fort on the east side of the bay and Fort Blakely north of the city These forts were invested On the night of the eighth of April the National troops having carried the enemy s works at one point Spanish Fort was evacuated and on the ninth the very day of Lee s surrender Blakely was carried by assault with a considerable loss to us On the eleventh the city was evacuated I had tried for more than two years to have an expedition sent against Mobile when its possession by us would have been of great advantage It finally cost lives to take it when its possession was of no importance and when if left alone it would within a few days have fallen into our hands without any bloodshed whatever Wilson moved out with full twelve thousand men well equipped and well armed He was an energetic officer and accomplished his work rapidly Forrest was in his front but with neither his old time army nor his old time prestige He now had principally conscripts His conscripts were generally old men and boys He had a few thousand regular cavalry left but not enough to even retard materially the progress of Wilson s cavalry Selma fell on the twod of April with a large number of prisoners and a large quantity of war material machine shops et cetera to be disposed of by the victors Tuscaloosa Montgomery and West Point fell in quick succession These were all important points to the enemy by reason of their railroad connections as depots of supplies and because of their manufactories of war material They were fortified or intrenched and there was considerable fighting before they were captured Macon surrendered on the twenty first of April Here news was received of the negotiations for the surrender of Johnston s army Wilson belonged to the military division commanded by Sherman and of course was bound by his terms This stopped all fighting General Richard Taylor had now become the senior Confederate officer still at liberty east of the Mississippi River and on the fourth of May he surrendered everything within the limits of this extensive command General E Kirby Smith surrendered the trans Mississippi department on the twenty sixth of May leaving no other Confederate army at liberty to continue the war Wilson s raid resulted in the capture of the fugitive president of the defunct confederacy before he got out of the country This occurred at Irwinsville Georgia on the eleventh of May For myself and I believe mister Lincoln shared the feeling I would have been very glad to have seen mister Davis succeed in escaping but for one reason I feared that if not captured he might get into the trans Mississippi region and there set up a more contracted confederacy The young men now out of homes and out of employment might have rallied under his standard and protracted the war yet another year The Northern people were tired of the war they were tired of piling up a debt which would be a further mortgage upon their homes mister Lincoln I believe wanted mister Davis to escape because he did not wish to deal with the matter of his punishment He knew there would be people clamoring for the punishment of the ex Confederate president for high treason He thought blood enough had already been spilled to atone for our wickedness as a nation At all events he did not wish to be the judge to decide whether more should be shed or not But his own life was sacrificed at the hands of an assassin before the ex president of the Confederacy was a prisoner in the hands of the government which he had lent all his talent and all his energies to destroy All things are said to be wisely directed and for the best interest of all concerned This reflection does not however abate in the slightest our sense of bereavement in the untimely loss of so good and great a man as Abraham Lincoln He would have proven the best friend the South could have had and saved much of the wrangling and bitterness of feeling brought out by reconstruction under a President who at first wished to revenge himself upon Southern men of better social standing than himself but who still sought their recognition and in a short time conceived the idea and advanced the proposition to become their Moses to lead them triumphantly out of all their difficulties The story of the legislation enacted during the reconstruction period to stay the hands of the President is too fresh in the minds of the people to be told now Much of it no doubt was unconstitutional but it was hoped that the laws enacted would serve their purpose before the question of constitutionality could be submitted to the judiciary and a decision obtained These laws did serve their purpose and now remain a dead letter upon the statute books of the United States no one taking interest enough in them to give them a passing thought Much was said at the time about the garb mister Davis was wearing when he was captured I cannot settle this question from personal knowledge of the facts but I have been under the belief from information given to me by General Wilson shortly after the event that when mister Davis learned that he was surrounded by our cavalry he was in his tent dressed in a gentleman s dressing gown Naturally enough mister Davis wanted to escape and would not reflect much how this should be accomplished provided it might be done successfully If captured he would be no ordinary prisoner He represented all there was of that hostility to the government which had caused four years of the bloodiest war and the most costly in other respects of which history makes any record Every one supposed he would be tried for treason if captured and that he would be executed Had he succeeded in making his escape in any disguise it would have been adjudged a good thing afterwards by his admirers As my official letters on file in the War Department as well as my remarks in this book reflect upon General Thomas by dwelling somewhat upon his tardiness it is due to myself as well as to him that I give my estimate of him as a soldier The same remark will apply also in the case of General Canby I had been at West Point with Thomas one year and had known him later in the old army He was a man of commanding appearance slow and deliberate in speech and action sensible honest and brave He possessed valuable soldierly qualities in an eminent degree He gained the confidence of all who served under him and almost their love This implies a very valuable quality It is a quality which calls out the most efficient services of the troops serving under the commander possessing it Thomas s dispositions were deliberately made and always good He could not be driven from a point he was given to hold He was not as good however in pursuit as he was in action I do not believe that he could ever have conducted Sherman s army from Chattanooga to Atlanta against the defences and the commander guarding that line in eighteen sixty four On the other hand if it had been given him to hold the line which Johnston tried to hold neither that general nor Sherman nor any other officer could have done it better Thomas was a valuable officer who richly deserved as he has received the plaudits of his countrymen for the part he played in the great tragedy of eighteen sixty one five General Canby was an officer of great merit He was naturally studious and inclined to the law There have been in the army but very few if any officers who took as much interest in reading and digesting every act of Congress and every regulation for the government of the army as he His knowledge gained in this way made him a most valuable staff officer a capacity in which almost all his army services were rendered up to the time of his being assigned to the Military Division of the Gulf He was an exceedingly modest officer though of great talent and learning I presume his feelings when first called upon to command a large army against a fortified city were somewhat like my own when marching a regiment against General Thomas Harris in Missouri in eighteen sixty one Neither of us would have felt the slightest trepidation in going into battle with some one else commanding Had Canby been in other engagements afterwards he would I have no doubt have advanced without any fear arising from a sense of the responsibility He was afterwards killed in the lava beds of Southern Oregon while in pursuit of the hostile Modoc Indians His character was as pure as his talent and learning were great His services were valuable during the war but principally as a bureau officer I have no idea that it was from choice that his services were rendered in an office but because of his superior efficiency there CHAPTER LXX THE END OF THE WAR THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON ONE OF LINCOLN S ANECDOTES GRAND REVIEW AT WASHINGTON CHARACTERISTICS OF LINCOLN AND STANTON ESTIMATE OF THE DIFFERENT CORPS COMMANDERS Things began to quiet down and as the certainty that there would be no more armed resistance became clearer the troops in North Carolina and Virginia were ordered to march immediately to the capital and go into camp there until mustered out Suitable garrisons were left at the prominent places throughout the South to insure obedience to the laws that might be enacted for the government of the several States and to insure security to the lives and property of all classes I do not know how far this was necessary but I deemed it necessary at that time that such a course should be pursued I think now that these garrisons were continued after they ceased to be absolutely required but it is not to be expected that such a rebellion as was fought between the sections from eighteen sixty one to eighteen sixty five could terminate without leaving many serious apprehensions in the mind of the people as to what should be done Sherman marched his troops from Goldsboro up to Manchester on the south side of the James River opposite Richmond and there put them in camp while he went back to Savannah to see what the situation was there It was during this trip that the last outrage was committed upon him Halleck had been sent to Richmond to command Virginia and had issued orders prohibiting even Sherman s own troops from obeying his Sherman s orders Sherman met the papers on his return containing this order of Halleck and very justly felt indignant at the outrage On his arrival at Fortress Monroe returning from Savannah Sherman received an invitation from Halleck to come to Richmond and be his guest This he indignantly refused and informed Halleck furthermore that he had seen his order He also stated that he was coming up to take command of his troops and as he marched through it would probably be as well for Halleck not to show himself because he Sherman would not be responsible for what some rash person might do through indignation for the treatment he had received Very soon after that Sherman received orders from me to proceed to Washington City and to go into camp on the south side of the city pending the mustering out of the troops There was no incident worth noting in the march northward from Goldsboro to Richmond or in that from Richmond to Washington City The army however commanded by Sherman which had been engaged in all the battles of the West and had marched from the Mississippi through the Southern States to the sea from there to Goldsboro and thence to Washington City had passed over many of the battle fields of the Army of the Potomac thus having seen to a greater extent than any other body of troops the entire theatre of the four years war for the preservation of the Union The march of Sherman s army from Atlanta to the sea and north to Goldsboro while it was not accompanied with the danger that was anticipated yet was magnificent in its results and equally magnificent in the way it was conducted It had an important bearing in various ways upon the great object we had in view that of closing the war All the States east of the Mississippi River up to the State of Georgia had felt the hardships of the war Georgia and South Carolina and almost all of North Carolina up to this time had been exempt from invasion by the Northern armies except upon their immediate sea coasts Their newspapers had given such an account of Confederate success that the people who remained at home had been convinced that the Yankees had been whipped from first to last and driven from pillar to post and that now they could hardly be holding out for any other purpose than to find a way out of the war with honor to themselves Even during this march of Sherman s the newspapers in his front were proclaiming daily that his army was nothing better than a mob of men who were frightened out of their wits and hastening panic stricken to try to get under the cover of our navy for protection against the Southern people As the army was seen marching on triumphantly however the minds of the people became disabused and they saw the true state of affairs In turn they became disheartened and would have been glad to submit without compromise Another great advantage resulting from this march and which was calculated to hasten the end was the fact that the great storehouse of Georgia was entirely cut off from the Confederate armies As the troops advanced north from Savannah the destruction of the railroads in South Carolina and the southern part of North Carolina further cut off their resources and left the armies still in Virginia and North Carolina dependent for supplies upon a very small area of country already very much exhausted of food and forage In due time the two armies one from Burkesville Junction and the other from the neighborhood of Raleigh North Carolina arrived and went into camp near the Capital as directed The troops were hardy being inured to fatigue and they appeared in their respective camps as ready and fit for duty as they had ever been in their lives I doubt whether an equal body of men of any nation take them man for man officer for officer was ever gotten together that would have proved their equal in a great battle The armies of Europe are machines the men are brave and the officers capable but the majority of the soldiers in most of the nations of Europe are taken from a class of people who are not very intelligent and who have very little interest in the contest in which they are called upon to take part Our armies were composed of men who were able to read men who knew what they were fighting for and could not be induced to serve as soldiers except in an emergency when the safety of the nation was involved and so necessarily must have been more than equal to men who fought merely because they were brave and because they were thoroughly drilled and inured to hardships There was nothing of particular importance occurred during the time these troops were in camp before starting North I remember one little incident which I will relate as an anecdote characteristic of mister Lincoln It occurred a day after I reached Washington and about the time General Meade reached Burkesville with the army Governor Smith of Virginia had left Richmond with the Confederate States government and had gone to Danville Supposing I was necessarily with the army at Burkesville he addressed a letter to me there informing me that as governor of the Commonwealth of the State of Virginia he had temporarily removed the State capital from Richmond to Danville and asking if he would be permitted to perform the functions of his office there without molestation by the Federal authorities I give this letter only in substance He also inquired of me whether in case he was not allowed to perform the duties of his office he with a few others might not be permitted to leave the country and go abroad without interference General Meade being informed that a flag of truce was outside his pickets with a letter to me at once sent out and had the letter brought in without informing the officer who brought it that I was not present He read the letter and telegraphed me its contents Meeting mister Lincoln shortly after receiving this dispatch I repeated its contents to him mister Lincoln supposing I was asking for instructions said in reply to that part of Governor Smith s letter which inquired whether he with a few friends would be permitted to leave the country unmolested that his position was like that of a certain Irishman giving the name he knew in Springfield who was very popular with the people a man of considerable promise and very much liked Unfortunately he had acquired the habit of drinking and his friends could see that the habit was growing on him These friends determined to make an effort to save him and to do this they drew up a pledge to abstain from all alcoholic drinks They asked Pat to join them in signing the pledge and he consented He had been so long out of the habit of using plain water as a beverage that he resorted to soda water as a substitute After a few days this began to grow distasteful to him So holding the glass behind him he said Doctor couldn t you drop a bit of brandy in that unbeknownst to myself I do not remember what the instructions were the President gave me but I know that Governor Smith was not permitted to perform the duties of his office I also know that if mister Lincoln had been spared there would have been no efforts made to prevent any one from leaving the country who desired to do so He would have been equally willing to permit the return of the same expatriated citizens after they had time to repent of their choice On the eighteenth of May orders were issued by the adjutant general for a grand review by the President and his cabinet of Sherman s and Meade s armies The review commenced on the twenty threed and lasted two days Meade s army occupied over six hours of the first day in passing the grand stand which had been erected in front of the President s house Sherman witnessed this review from the grand stand which was occupied by the President and his cabinet Here he showed his resentment for the cruel and harsh treatment that had unnecessarily been inflicted upon him by the Secretary of War by refusing to take his extended hand Sherman s troops had been in camp on the south side of the Potomac During the night of the twenty threed he crossed over and bivouacked not far from the Capitol Promptly at ten o clock on the morning of the twenty fourth his troops commenced to pass in review Sherman s army made a different appearance from that of the Army of the Potomac The latter had been operating where they received directly from the North full supplies of food and clothing regularly the review of this army therefore was the review of a body of sixty five thousand well drilled well disciplined and orderly soldiers inured to hardship and fit for any duty but without the experience of gathering their own food and supplies in an enemy s country and of being ever on the watch Sherman s army was not so well dressed as the Army of the Potomac but their marching could not be excelled they gave the appearance of men who had been thoroughly drilled to endure hardships either by long and continuous marches or through exposure to any climate without the ordinary shelter of a camp They exhibited also some of the order of march through Georgia where the sweet potatoes sprung up from the ground as Sherman s army went marching through In the rear of a company there would be a captured horse or mule loaded with small cooking utensils captured chickens and other food picked up for the use of the men Negro families who had followed the army would sometimes come along in the rear of a company with three or four children packed upon a single mule and the mother leading it The sight was varied and grand nearly all day for two successive days from the Capitol to the Treasury Building could be seen a mass of orderly soldiers marching in columns of companies The National flag was flying from almost every house and store the windows were filled with spectators the door steps and side walks were crowded with colored people and poor whites who did not succeed in securing better quarters from which to get a view of the grand armies The city was about as full of strangers who had come to see the sights as it usually is on inauguration day when a new President takes his seat It may not be out of place to again allude to President Lincoln and the Secretary of War mister Stanton who were the great conspicuous figures in the executive branch of the government There is no great difference of opinion now in the public mind as to the characteristics of the President With mister Stanton the case is different They were the very opposite of each other in almost every particular except that each possessed great ability mister Lincoln gained influence over men by making them feel that it was a pleasure to serve him He preferred yielding his own wish to gratify others rather than to insist upon having his own way It distressed him to disappoint others In matters of public duty however he had what he wished but in the least offensive way mister Stanton never questioned his own authority to command unless resisted He cared nothing for the feeling of others In fact it seemed to be pleasanter to him to disappoint than to gratify He felt no hesitation in assuming the functions of the executive or in acting without advising with him If his act was not sustained he would change it if he saw the matter would be followed up until he did so It was generally supposed that these two officials formed the complement of each other The Secretary was required to prevent the President s being imposed upon The President was required in the more responsible place of seeing that injustice was not done to others I do not know that this view of these two men is still entertained by the majority of the people It is not a correct view however in my estimation mister Lincoln did not require a guardian to aid him in the fulfilment of a public trust mister Lincoln was not timid and he was willing to trust his generals in making and executing their plans The Secretary was very timid and it was impossible for him to avoid interfering with the armies covering the capital when it was sought to defend it by an offensive movement against the army guarding the Confederate capital He could see our weakness but he could not see that the enemy was in danger The enemy would not have been in danger if mister Stanton had been in the field These characteristics of the two officials were clearly shown shortly after Early came so near getting into the capital Among the army and corps commanders who served with me during the war between the States and who attracted much public attention but of whose ability as soldiers I have not yet given any estimate are Meade Hancock Sedgwick Burnside Terry and Hooker There were others of great merit such as Griffin Humphreys Wright and Mackenzie Of those first named Burnside at one time had command of the Army of the Potomac and later of the Army of the Ohio Hooker also commanded the Army of the Potomac for a short time General Meade was an officer of great merit with drawbacks to his usefulness that were beyond his control He had been an officer of the engineer corps before the war and consequently had never served with troops until he was over forty six years of age He never had I believe a command of less than a brigade He saw clearly and distinctly the position of the enemy and the topography of the country in front of his own position His first idea was to take advantage of the lay of the ground sometimes without reference to the direction we wanted to move afterwards He was subordinate to his superiors in rank to the extent that he could execute an order which changed his own plans with the same zeal he would have displayed if the plan had been his own He was brave and conscientious and commanded the respect of all who knew him He was unfortunately of a temper that would get beyond his control at times and make him speak to officers of high rank in the most offensive manner No one saw this fault more plainly than he himself and no one regretted it more This made it unpleasant at times even in battle for those around him to approach him even with information In spite of this defect he was a most valuable officer and deserves a high place in the annals of his country General Burnside was an officer who was generally liked and respected He was not however fitted to command an army No one knew this better than himself He always admitted his blunders and extenuated those of officers under him beyond what they were entitled to It was hardly his fault that he was ever assigned to a separate command Of Hooker I saw but little during the war I had known him very well before however Where I did see him at Chattanooga his achievement in bringing his command around the point of Lookout Mountain and into Chattanooga Valley was brilliant I nevertheless regarded him as a dangerous man He was not subordinate to his superiors He was ambitious to the extent of caring nothing for the rights of others His disposition was when engaged in battle to get detached from the main body of the army and exercise a separate command gathering to his standard all he could of his juniors Hancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general officers who did not exercise a separate command He commanded a corps longer than any other one and his name was never mentioned as having committed in battle a blunder for which he was responsible He was a man of very conspicuous personal appearance Tall well formed and at the time of which I now write young and fresh looking he presented an appearance that would attract the attention of an army as he passed His genial disposition made him friends and his personal courage and his presence with his command in the thickest of the fight won for him the confidence of troops serving under him No matter how hard the fight the twod corps always felt that their commander was looking after them Sedgwick was killed at Spottsylvania before I had an opportunity of forming an estimate of his qualifications as a soldier from personal observation I had known him in Mexico when both of us were lieutenants and when our service gave no indication that either of us would ever be equal to the command of a brigade He stood very high in the army however as an officer and a man He was brave and conscientious His ambition was not great and he seemed to dread responsibility He was willing to do any amount of battling but always wanted some one else to direct He declined the command of the Army of the Potomac once if not oftener General Alfred H Terry came into the army as a volunteer without a military education His way was won without political influence up to an important separate command the expedition against Fort Fisher in January eighteen sixty five His success there was most brilliant and won for him the rank of brigadier general in the regular army and of major general of volunteers He is a man who makes friends of those under him by his consideration of their wants and their dues As a commander he won their confidence by his coolness in action and by his clearness of perception in taking in the situation under which he was placed at any given time Griffin Humphreys and Mackenzie were good corps commanders but came into that position so near to the close of the war as not to attract public attention All three served as such in the last campaign of the armies of the Potomac and the James which culminated at Appomattox Court House on the ninth of April eighteen sixty five The sudden collapse of the rebellion monopolized attention to the exclusion of almost everything else I regarded Mackenzie as the most promising young officer in the army Graduating at West Point as he did during the second year of the war he had won his way up to the command of a corps before its close This he did upon his own merit and without influence CONCLUSION The cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United Status will have to be attributed to slavery For some years before the war began it was a trite saying among some politicians that A state half slave and half free cannot exist All must become slave or all free or the state will go down I took no part myself in any such view of the case at the time but since the war is over reviewing the whole question I have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true Slavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for its security wherever it existed and in a country like ours where the larger portion of it was free territory inhabited by an intelligent and well to do population the people would naturally have but little sympathy with demands upon them for its protection Hence the people of the South were dependent upon keeping control of the general government to secure the perpetuation of their favorite institution They were enabled to maintain this control long after the States where slavery existed had ceased to have the controlling power through the assistance they received from odd men here and there throughout the Northern States They saw their power waning and this led them to encroach upon the prerogatives and independence of the Northern States by enacting such laws as the Fugitive Slave Law By this law every Northern man was obliged when properly summoned to turn out and help apprehend the runaway slave of a Southern man Northern marshals became slave catchers and Northern courts had to contribute to the support and protection of the institution This was a degradation which the North would not permit any longer than until they could get the power to expunge such laws from the statute books Prior to the time of these encroachments the great majority of the people of the North had no particular quarrel with slavery so long as they were not forced to have it themselves But they were not willing to play the role of police for the South in the protection of this particular institution In the early days of the country before we had railroads telegraphs and steamboats in a word rapid transit of any sort the States were each almost a separate nationality At that time the subject of slavery caused but little or no disturbance to the public mind But the country grew rapid transit was established and trade and commerce between the States got to be so much greater than before that the power of the National government became more felt and recognized and therefore had to be enlisted in the cause of this institution It is probably well that we had the war when we did We are better off now than we would have been without it and have made more rapid progress than we otherwise should have made The civilized nations of Europe have been stimulated into unusual activity so that commerce trade travel and thorough acquaintance among people of different nationalities has become common whereas before it was but the few who had ever had the privilege of going beyond the limits of their own country or who knew anything about other people Then too our republican institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breaking out of the rebellion and monarchical Europe generally believed that our republic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the slightest strain was brought upon it Now it has shown itself capable of dealing with one of the greatest wars that was ever made and our people have proven themselves to be the most formidable in war of any nationality But this war was a fearful lesson and should teach us the necessity of avoiding wars in the future The conduct of some of the European states during our troubles shows the lack of conscience of communities where the responsibility does not come upon a single individual Seeing a nation that extended from ocean to ocean embracing the better part of a continent growing as we were growing in population wealth and intelligence the European nations thought it would be well to give us a check We might possibly after a while threaten their peace or at least the perpetuity of their institutions Hence England was constantly finding fault with the administration at Washington because we were not able to keep up an effective blockade She also joined at first with France and Spain in setting up an Austrian prince upon the throne in Mexico totally disregarding any rights or claims that Mexico had of being treated as an independent power It is true they trumped up grievances as a pretext but they were only pretexts which can always be found when wanted Mexico in her various revolutions had been unable to give that protection to the subjects of foreign nations which she would have liked to give and some of her revolutionary leaders had forced loans from them Under pretence of protecting their citizens these nations seized upon Mexico as a foothold for establishing a European monarchy upon our continent thus threatening our peace at home I myself regarded this as a direct act of war against the United States by the powers engaged and supposed as a matter of course that the United States would treat it as such when their hands were free to strike I often spoke of the matter to mister Lincoln and the Secretary of War but never heard any special views from them to enable me to judge what they thought or felt about it I inferred that they felt a good deal as I did but were unwilling to commit themselves while we had our own troubles upon our hands All of the powers except France very soon withdrew from the armed intervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince upon the throne of Mexico but the governing people of these countries continued to the close of the war to throw obstacles in our way After the surrender of Lee therefore entertaining the opinion here expressed I sent Sheridan with a corps to the Rio Grande to have him where he might aid Juarez in expelling the French from Mexico These troops got off before they could be stopped and went to the Rio Grande where Sheridan distributed them up and down the river much to the consternation of the troops in the quarter of Mexico bordering on that stream This soon led to a request from France that we should withdraw our troops from the Rio Grande and to negotiations for the withdrawal of theirs Finally Bazaine was withdrawn from Mexico by order of the French Government From that day the empire began to totter Mexico was then able to maintain her independence without aid from us France is the traditional ally and friend of the United States I did not blame France for her part in the scheme to erect a monarchy upon the ruins of the Mexican Republic That was the scheme of one man an imitator without genius or merit He had succeeded in stealing the government of his country and made a change in its form against the wishes and instincts of his people He tried to play the part of the first Napoleon without the ability to sustain that role He sought by new conquests to add to his empire and his glory but the signal failure of his scheme of conquest was the precursor of his own overthrow Like our own war between the States the Franco Prussian war was an expensive one but it was worth to France all it cost her people It was the completion of the downfall of Napoleon III The beginning was when he landed troops on this continent Failing here the prestige of his name all the prestige he ever had was gone He must achieve a success or fall He tried to strike down his neighbor Prussia and fell I never admired the character of the first Napoleon but I recognize his great genius His work too has left its impress for good on the face of Europe The third Napoleon could have no claim to having done a good or just act To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared for war There can scarcely be a possible chance of a conflict such as the last one occurring among our own people again but growing as we are in population wealth and military power we may become the envy of nations which led us in all these particulars only a few years ago and unless we are prepared for it we may be in danger of a combined movement being some day made to crush us out Now scarcely twenty years after the war we seem to have forgotten the lessons it taught and are going on as if in the greatest security without the power to resist an invasion by the fleets of fourth rate European powers for a time until we could prepare for them We should have a good navy and our sea coast defences should be put in the finest possible condition Neither of these cost much when it is considered where the money goes and what we get in return Money expended in a fine navy not only adds to our security and tends to prevent war in the future but is very material aid to our commerce with foreign nations in the meantime Money spent upon sea coast defences is spent among our own people and all goes back again among the people The work accomplished too like that of the navy gives us a feeling of security England s course towards the United States during the rebellion exasperated the people of this country very much against the mother country I regretted it England and the United States are natural allies and should be the best of friends They speak one language and are related by blood and other ties We together or even either separately are better qualified than any other people to establish commerce between all the nationalities of the world England governs her own colonies and particularly those embracing the people of different races from her own better than any other nation She is just to the conquered but rigid She makes them self supporting but gives the benefit of labor to the laborer She does not seem to look upon the colonies as outside possessions which she is at liberty to work for the support and aggrandizement of the home government The hostility of England to the United States during our rebellion was not so much real as it was apparent It was the hostility of the leaders of one political party I am told that there was no time during the civil war when they were able to get up in England a demonstration in favor of secession while these were constantly being gotten up in favor of the Union or as they called it in favor of the North Even in Manchester which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut off from her mills they had a monster demonstration in favor of the North at the very time when their workmen were almost famishing It is possible that the question of a conflict between races may come up in the future as did that between freedom and slavery before The condition of the colored man within our borders may become a source of anxiety to say the least But he was brought to our shores by compulsion and he now should be considered as having as good a right to remain here as any other class of our citizens It was looking to a settlement of this question that led me to urge the annexation of Santo Domingo during the time I was President of the United States Santo Domingo was freely offered to us not only by the administration but by all the people almost without price The island is upon our shores is very fertile and is capable of supporting fifteen millions of people The products of the soil are so valuable that labor in her fields would be so compensated as to enable those who wished to go there to quickly repay the cost of their passage I took it that the colored people would go there in great numbers so as to have independent states governed by their own race They would still be States of the Union and under the protection of the General Government but the citizens would be almost wholly colored By the war with Mexico we had acquired as we have seen territory almost equal in extent to that we already possessed It was seen that the volunteers of the Mexican war largely composed the pioneers to settle up the Pacific coast country Their numbers however were scarcely sufficient to be a nucleus for the population of the important points of the territory acquired by that war After our rebellion when so many young men were at liberty to return to their homes they found they were not satisfied with the farm the store or the work shop of the villages but wanted larger fields The mines of the mountains first attracted them but afterwards they found that rich valleys and productive grazing and farming lands were there This territory the geography of which was not known to us at the close of the rebellion is now as well mapped as any portion of our country Railroads traverse it in every direction north south east and west The mines are worked The high lands are used for grazing purposes and rich agricultural lands are found in many of the valleys This is the work of the volunteer It is probable that the Indians would have had control of these lands for a century yet but for the war We must conclude therefore that wars are not always evils unmixed with some good Prior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were satisfied to remain near the scenes of their birth In fact an immense majority of the whole people did not feel secure against coming to want should they move among entire strangers So much was the country divided into small communities that localized idioms had grown up so that you could almost tell what section a person was from by hearing him speak Before new territories were settled by a class people who shunned contact with others people who when the country began to settle up around them would push out farther from civilization Their guns furnished meat and the cultivation of a very limited amount of the soil their bread and vegetables All the streams abounded with fish Trapping would furnish pelts to be brought into the States once a year to pay for necessary articles which they could not raise powder lead whiskey tobacco and some store goods Occasionally some little articles of luxury would enter into these purchases a quarter of a pound of tea two or three pounds of coffee more of sugar some playing cards and if anything was left over of the proceeds of the sale more whiskey Little was known of the topography of the country beyond the settlements of these frontiersmen This is all changed now The war begot a spirit of independence and enterprise The feeling now is that a youth must cut loose from his old surroundings to enable him to get up in the world There is now such a commingling of the people that particular idioms and pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent the country has filled up from the centre all around to the sea railroads connect the two oceans and all parts of the interior maps nearly perfect of every part of the country are now furnished the student of geography The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence We have but little to do to preserve peace happiness and prosperity at home and the respect of other nations Our experience ought to teach us the necessity of the first our power secures the latter I feel that we are on the eve of a new era when there is to be great harmony between the Federal and Confederate I cannot stay to be a living witness to the correctness of this prophecy but I feel it within me that it is to be so The universally kind feeling expressed for me at a time when it was supposed that each day would prove my last seemed to me the beginning of the answer to Let us have peace The expression of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a section of the country nor to a division of the people They came from individual citizens of all nationalities from all denominations the Protestant the Catholic and the Jew and from the various societies of the land scientific educational religious or otherwise Politics did not enter into the matter at all I am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should be given because I was the object of it But the war between the States was a very bloody and a very costly war One side or the other had to yield principles they deemed dearer than life before it could be brought to an end I commanded the whole of the mighty host engaged on the victorious side I was no matter whether deservedly so or not a representative of that side of the controversy It is a significant and gratifying fact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this spontaneous move I hope the good feeling inaugurated may continue to the end APPENDIX REPORT OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL U S GRANT OF THE UNITED STATES ARMIES eighteen sixty four sixty five HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES WASHINGTON D C July twenty two eighteen sixty five honorable E M STANTON Secretary of War SIR I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Armies of the United States from the date of my appointment to command the same From an early period in the rebellion I had been impressed with the idea that active and continuous operations of all the troops that could be brought into the field regardless of season and weather were necessary to a speedy termination of the war The resources of the enemy and his numerical strength were far inferior to ours but as an offset to this we had a vast territory with a population hostile to the government to garrison and long lines of river and railroad communications to protect to enable us to supply the operating armies The armies in the East and West acted independently and without concert like a balky team no two ever pulling together enabling the enemy to use to great advantage his interior lines of communication for transporting troops from East to West reinforcing the army most vigorously pressed and to furlough large numbers during seasons of inactivity on our part to go to their homes and do the work of producing for the support of their armies It was a question whether our numerical strength and resources were not more than balanced by these disadvantages and the enemy s superior position From the first I was firm in the conviction that no peace could be had that would be stable and conducive to the happiness of the people both North and South until the military power of the rebellion was entirely broken I therefore determined first to use the greatest number of troops practicable against the armed force of the enemy preventing him from using the same force at different seasons against first one and then another of our armies and the possibility of repose for refitting and producing necessary supplies for carrying on resistance Second to hammer continuously against the armed force of the enemy and his resources until by mere attrition if in no other way there should be nothing left to him but an equal submission with the loyal section of our common country to the constitution and laws of the land These views have been kept constantly in mind and orders given and campaigns made to carry them out Whether they might have been better in conception and execution is for the people who mourn the loss of friends fallen and who have to pay the pecuniary cost to say All I can say is that what I have done has been done conscientiously to the best of my ability and in what I conceived to be for the best interests of the whole country At the date when this report begins the situation of the contending forces was about as follows The Mississippi River was strongly garrisoned by Federal troops from saint Louis Missouri to its mouth The line of the Arkansas was also held thus giving us armed possession of all west of the Mississippi north of that stream A few points in Southern Louisiana not remote from the river were held by us together with a small garrison at and near the mouth of the Rio Grande All the balance of the vast territory of Arkansas Louisiana and Texas was in the almost undisputed possession of the enemy with an army of probably not less than eighty thousand effective men that could have been brought into the field had there been sufficient opposition to have brought them out The let alone policy had demoralized this force so that probably but little more than one half of it was ever present in garrison at any one time But the one half or forty thousand men with the bands of guerillas scattered through Missouri Arkansas and along the Mississippi River and the disloyal character of much of the population compelled the use of a large number of troops to keep navigation open on the river and to protect the loyal people to the west of it To the east of the Mississippi we held substantially with the line of the Tennessee and Holston rivers running eastward to include nearly all of the State of Tennessee South of Chattanooga a small foothold had been obtained in Georgia sufficient to protect East Tennessee from incursions from the enemy s force at Dalton Georgia West Virginia was substantially within our lines Virginia with the exception of the northern border the Potomac River a small area about the mouth of James River covered by the troops at Norfolk and Fort Monroe and the territory covered by the Army of the Potomac lying along the Rapidan was in the possession of the enemy Along the sea coast footholds had been obtained at Plymouth Washington and New Bern in North Carolina Beaufort Folly and Morris Islands Hilton Head Fort Pulaski and Port Royal in South Carolina Fernandina and saint Augustine in Florida Key West and Pensacola were also in our possession while all the important ports were blockaded by the navy The accompanying map a copy of which was sent to General Sherman and other commanders in March eighteen sixty four shows by red lines the territory occupied by us at the beginning of the rebellion and at the opening of the campaign of eighteen sixty four while those in blue are the lines which it was proposed to occupy Behind the Union lines there were many bands of guerillas and a large population disloyal to the government making it necessary to guard every foot of road or river used in supplying our armies In the South a reign of military despotism prevailed which made every man and boy capable of bearing arms a soldier and those who could not bear arms in the field acted as provosts for collecting deserters and returning them This enabled the enemy to bring almost his entire strength into the field The enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of the Mississippi into two armies commanded by Generals R E Lee and J E Johnston his ablest and best generals The army commanded by Lee occupied the south bank of the Rapidan extending from Mine Run westward strongly intrenched covering and defending Richmond the rebel capital against the Army of the Potomac The army under Johnston occupied a strongly intrenched position at Dalton Georgia covering and defending Atlanta Georgia a place of great importance as a railroad centre against the armies under Major General W T Sherman In addition to these armies he had a large cavalry force under Forrest in North east Mississippi a considerable force of all arms in the Shenandoah Valley and in the western part of Virginia and extreme eastern part of Tennessee and also confronting our sea coast garrisons and holding blockaded ports where we had no foothold upon land These two armies and the cities covered and defended by them were the main objective points of the campaign Major General W T Sherman who was appointed to the command of the Military Division of the Mississippi embracing all the armies and territory east of the Mississippi River to the Alleghanies and the Department of Arkansas west of the Mississippi had the immediate command of the armies operating against Johnston Major General George G Meade had the immediate command of the Army of the Potomac from where I exercised general supervision of the movements of all our armies General Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston s army to break it up and to go into the interior of the enemy s country as far as he could inflicting all the damage he could upon their war resources If the enemy in his front showed signs of joining Lee to follow him up to the full extent of his ability while I would prevent the concentration of Lee upon him if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to do so More specific written instructions were not given for the reason that I had talked over with him the plans of the campaign and was satisfied that he understood them and would execute them to the fullest extent possible Major General N P Banks then on an expedition up Red River against Shreveport Louisiana which had been organized previous to my appointment to command was notified by me on the fifteenth of March of the importance it was that Shreveport should be taken at the earliest possible day and that if he found that the taking of it would occupy from ten to fifteen days more time than General Sherman had given his troops to be absent from their command he would send them back at the time specified by General Sherman even if it led to the abandonment of the main object of the Red River expedition for this force was necessary to movements east of the Mississippi that should his expedition prove successful he would hold Shreveport and the Red River with such force as he might deem necessary and return the balance of his troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans commencing no move for the further acquisition of territory unless it was to make that then held by him more easily held that it might be a part of the spring campaign to move against Mobile that it certainly would be if troops enough could be obtained to make it without embarrassing other movements that New Orleans would be the point of departure for such an expedition also that I had directed General Steele to make a real move from Arkansas as suggested by him General Banks instead of a demonstration as Steele thought advisable On the thirty first of March in addition to the foregoing notification and directions he was instructed as follows first If successful in your expedition against Shreveport that you turn over the defence of the Red River to General Steele and the navy twod That you abandon Texas entirely with the exception of your hold upon the Rio Grande This can be held with four thousand men if they will turn their attention immediately to fortifying their positions At least one half of the force required for this service might be taken from the colored troops threed By properly fortifying on the Mississippi River the force to guard it from Port Hudson to New Orleans can be reduced to ten thousand men if not to a less number Six thousand more would then hold all the rest of the territory necessary to hold until active operations can again be resumed west of the river According to your last return this would give you a force of over thirty thousand effective men with which to move against Mobile To this I expect to add five thousand men from Missouri If however you think the force here stated too small to hold the territory regarded as necessary to hold possession of I would say concentrate at least twenty five thousand men of your present command for operations against Mobile With these and such additions as I can give you from elsewhere lose no time in making a demonstration to be followed by an attack upon Mobile Two or more iron clads will be ordered to report to Admiral Farragut This gives him a strong naval fleet with which to company operate You can make your own arrangements with the admiral for his company operation and select your own line of approach My own idea of the matter is that Pascagoula should be your base but from your long service in the Gulf Department you will know best about the matter It is intended that your movements shall be company operative with movements elsewhere and you cannot now start too soon All I would now add is that you commence the concentration of your forces at once Preserve a profound secrecy of what you intend doing and start at the earliest possible moment U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL N P BANKS Major General Meade was instructed that Lee s army would be his objective point that wherever Lee went he would go also For his movement two plans presented themselves One to cross the Rapidan below Lee moving by his right flank the other above moving by his left Each presented advantages over the other with corresponding objections By crossing above Lee would be cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond or going north on a raid But if we took this route all we did would have to be done whilst the rations we started with held out besides it separated us from Butler so that he could not be directed how to cooperate If we took the other route Brandy Station could be used as a base of supplies until another was secured on the York or James rivers Of these however it was decided to take the lower route The following letter of instruction was addressed to Major General B F Butler FORT MONROE VIRGINIA April two eighteen sixty four GENERAL In the spring campaign which it is desirable shall commence at as early a day as practicable it is proposed to have cooperative action of all the armies in the field as far as this object can be accomplished It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three large ones to act as so many units owing to the absolute necessity of holding on to the territory already taken from the enemy But generally speaking concentration can be practically effected by armies moving to the interior of the enemy s country from the territory they have to guard By such movement they interpose themselves between the enemy and the country to be guarded thereby reducing the number necessary to guard important points or at least occupy the attention of a part of the enemy s force if no greater object is gained Lee s army and Richmond being the greater objects towards which our attention must be directed in the next campaign it is desirable to unite all the force we can against them The necessity of covering Washington with the Army of the Potomac and of covering your department with your army makes it impossible to unite these forces at the beginning of any move I propose therefore what comes nearest this of anything that seems practicable The Army of the Potomac will act from its present base Lee s army being the objective point You will collect all the forces from your command that can be spared from garrison duty I should say not less than twenty thousand effective men to operate on the south side of James River Richmond being your objective point To the force you already have will be added about ten thousand men from South Carolina under Major General Gillmore who will command them in person Major General W F Smith is ordered to report to you to command the troops sent into the field from your own department General Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fortress Monroe with all the troops on transports by the eighteenth instant or as soon thereafter as practicable Should you not receive notice by that time to move you will make such disposition of them and your other forces as you may deem best calculated to deceive the enemy as to the real move to be made When you are notified to move take City Point with as much force as possible Fortify or rather intrench at once and concentrate all your troops for the field there as rapidly as you can From City Point directions cannot be given at this time for your further movements The fact that has already been stated that is that Richmond is to be your objective point and that there is to be company operation between your force and the Army of the Potomac must be your guide This indicates the necessity of your holding close to the south bank of the James River as you advance Then should the enemy be forced into his intrenchments in Richmond the Army of the Potomac would follow and by means of transports the two armies would become a unit All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to your direction If however you think it practicable to use your cavalry south of you so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford about the time of the general advance it would be of immense advantage You will please forward for my information at the earliest practicable day all orders details and instructions you may give for the execution of this order U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL B F BUTLER On the sixteenth these instructions were substantially reiterated On the nineteenth in order to secure full company operation between his army and that of General Meade he was informed that I expected him to move from Fort Monroe the same day that General Meade moved from Culpeper The exact time I was to telegraph him as soon as it was fixed and that it would not be earlier than the twenty seventh of April that it was my intention to fight Lee between Culpeper and Richmond if he would stand Should he however fall back into Richmond I would follow up and make a junction with his General Butler s army on the James River that could I be certain he would be able to invest Richmond on the south side so as to have his left resting on the James above the city I would form the junction there that circumstances might make this course advisable anyhow that he should use every exertion to secure footing as far up the south side of the river as he could and as soon as possible after the receipt of orders to move that if he could not carry the city he should at least detain as large a force there as possible In company operation with the main movements against Lee and Johnston I was desirous of using all other troops necessarily kept in departments remote from the fields of immediate operations and also those kept in the background for the protection of our extended lines between the loyal States and the armies operating against them A very considerable force under command of Major General Sigel was so held for the protection of West Virginia and the frontiers of Maryland and Pennsylvania Whilst these troops could not be withdrawn to distant fields without exposing the North to invasion by comparatively small bodies of the enemy they could act directly to their front and give better protection than if lying idle in garrison By such a movement they would either compel the enemy to detach largely for the protection of his supplies and lines of communication or he would lose them General Sigel was therefore directed to organize all his available force into two expeditions to move from Beverly and Charleston under command of Generals Ord and Crook against the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad Subsequently General Ord having been relieved at his own request General Sigel was instructed at his own suggestion to give up the expedition by Beverly and to form two columns one under General Crook on the Kanawha numbering about ten thousand men and one on the Shenandoah numbering about seven thousand men The one on the Shenandoah to assemble between Cumberland and the Shenandoah and the infantry and artillery advanced to Cedar Creek with such cavalry as could be made available at the moment to threaten the enemy in the Shenandoah Valley and advance as far as possible while General Crook would take possession of Lewisburg with part of his force and move down the Tennessee Railroad doing as much damage as he could destroying the New River Bridge and the salt works at Saltville Va Owing to the weather and bad condition of the roads operations were delayed until the first of May when everything being in readiness and the roads favorable orders were given for a general movement of all the armies not later than the fourth of May My first object being to break the military power of the rebellion and capture the enemy s important strongholds made me desirous that General Butler should succeed in his movement against Richmond as that would tend more than anything else unless it were the capture of Lee s army to accomplish this desired result in the East If he failed it was my determination by hard fighting either to compel Lee to retreat or to so cripple him that he could not detach a large force to go north and still retain enough for the defence of Richmond It was well understood by both Generals Butler and Meade before starting on the campaign that it was my intention to put both their armies south of the James River in case of failure to destroy Lee without it Before giving General Butler his instructions I visited him at Fort Monroe and in conversation pointed out the apparent importance of getting possession of Petersburg and destroying railroad communication as far south as possible Believing however in the practicability of capturing Richmond unless it was reinforced I made that the objective point of his operations As the Army of the Potomac was to move simultaneously with him Lee could not detach from his army with safety and the enemy did not have troops elsewhere to bring to the defence of the city in time to meet a rapid movement from the north of James River I may here state that commanding all the armies as I did I tried as far as possible to leave General Meade in independent command of the Army of the Potomac My instructions for that army were all through him and were general in their nature leaving all the details and the execution to him The campaigns that followed proved him to be the right man in the right place His commanding always in the presence of an officer superior to him in rank has drawn from him much of that public attention that his zeal and ability entitle him to and which he would otherwise have received The movement of the Army of the Potomac commenced early on the morning of the fourth of May under the immediate direction and orders of Major General Meade pursuant to instructions Before night the whole army was across the Rapidan the fifth and sixth corps crossing at Germania Ford and the second corps at Ely s Ford the cavalry under Major General Sheridan moving in advance with the greater part of its trains numbering about four thousand wagons meeting with but slight opposition The average distance travelled by the troops that day was about twelve miles This I regarded as a great success and it removed from my mind the most serious apprehensions I had entertained that of crossing the river in the face of an active large well appointed and ably commanded army and how so large a train was to be carried through a hostile country and protected Early on the fifth the advance corps the fifth Major General G K Warren commanding met and engaged the enemy outside his intrenchments near Mine Run The battle raged furiously all day the whole army being brought into the fight as fast as the corps could be got upon the field which considering the density of the forest and narrowness of the roads was done with commendable promptness General Burnside with the ninth corps was at the time the Army of the Potomac moved left with the bulk of his corps at the crossing of the Rappahannock River and Alexandria Railroad holding the road back to Bull Run with instructions not to move until he received notice that a crossing of the Rapidan was secured but to move promptly as soon as such notice was received This crossing he was apprised of on the afternoon of the fourth By six o clock of the morning of the sixth he was leading his corps into action near the Wilderness Tavern some of his troops having marched a distance of over thirty miles crossing both the Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers Considering that a large proportion probably two thirds of his command was composed of new troops unaccustomed to marches and carrying the accoutrements of a soldier this was a remarkable march The battle of the Wilderness was renewed by us at five o clock on the morning of the sixth and continued with unabated fury until darkness set in each army holding substantially the same position that they had on the evening of the fifth After dark the enemy made a feeble attempt to turn our right flank capturing several hundred prisoners and creating considerable confusion But the promptness of General Sedgwick who was personally present and commanded that part of our line soon reformed it and restored order On the morning of the seventh reconnoissances showed that the enemy had fallen behind his intrenched lines with pickets to the front covering a part of the battle field From this it was evident to my mind that the two days fighting had satisfied him of his inability to further maintain the contest in the open field notwithstanding his advantage of position and that he would wait an attack behind his works I therefore determined to push on and put my whole force between him and Richmond and orders were at once issued for a movement by his right flank On the night of the seventh the march was commenced towards Spottsylvania Court House the fifth corps moving on the most direct road But the enemy having become apprised of our movement and having the shorter line was enabled to reach there first On the eighth General Warren met a force of the enemy which had been sent out to oppose and delay his advance to gain time to fortify the line taken up at Spottsylvania This force was steadily driven back on the main force within the recently constructed works after considerable fighting resulting in severe loss to both sides On the morning of the ninth General Sheridan started on a raid against the enemy s lines of communication with Richmond The ninth tenth and eleventh were spent in manoeuvring and fighting without decisive results Among the killed on the ninth was that able and distinguished soldier Major General John Sedgwick commanding the sixth army corps Major General H G Wright succeeded him in command Early on the morning of the twelfth a general attack was made on the enemy in position The second corps Major General Hancock commanding carried a salient of his line capturing most of Johnson s division of Ewell s corps and twenty pieces of artillery But the resistance was so obstinate that the advantage gained did not prove decisive The thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth were consumed in manoeuvring and awaiting the arrival of reinforcements from Washington Deeming it impracticable to make any further attack upon the enemy at Spottsylvania Court House orders were issued on the fifteenth with a view to a movement to the North Anna to commence at twelve o clock on the night of the nineteenth Late in the afternoon of the nineteenth Ewell s corps came out of its works on our extreme right flank but the attack was promptly repulsed with heavy loss This delayed the movement to the North Anna until the night of the twenty first when it was commenced But the enemy again having the shorter line and being in possession of the main roads was enabled to reach the North Anna in advance of us and took position behind it The fifth corps reached the North Anna on the afternoon of the twenty threed closely followed by the sixth corps The second and ninth corps got up about the same time the second holding the railroad bridge and the ninth lying between that and Jericho Ford General Warren effected a crossing the same afternoon and got a position without much opposition Soon after getting into position he was violently attacked but repulsed the enemy with great slaughter On the twenty fifth General Sheridan rejoined the Army of the Potomac from the raid on which he started from Spottsylvania having destroyed the depots at Beaver Dam and Ashland stations four trains of cars large supplies of rations and many miles of railroad track recaptured about four hundred of our men on their way to Richmond as prisoners of war met and defeated the enemy s cavalry at Yellow Tavern carried the first line of works around Richmond but finding the second line too strong to be carried by assault recrossed to the north bank of the Chickahominy at Meadow Bridge under heavy fire and moved by a detour to Haxall s Landing on the James River where he communicated with General Butler This raid had the effect of drawing off the whole of the enemy s cavalry force making it comparatively easy to guard our trains General Butler moved his main force up the James River in pursuance of instructions on the fourth of May General Gillmore having joined him with the tenth corps At the same time he sent a force of one thousand eight hundred cavalry by way of West Point to form a junction with him wherever he might get a foothold and a force of three thousand cavalry under General Kautz from Suffolk to operate against the road south of Petersburg and Richmond On the fifth he occupied without opposition both City Point and Bermuda Hundred his movement being a complete surprise On the sixth he was in position with his main army and commenced intrenching On the seventh he made a reconnoissance against the Petersburg and Richmond Railroad destroying a portion of it after some fighting On the ninth he telegraphed as follows HEADQUARTERS NEAR BERMUDA LANDING May nine eighteen sixty four honorable E M STANTON Secretary of War Our operations may be summed up in a few words With one thousand seven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the Peninsula forced the Chickahominy and have safely brought them to their present position These were colored cavalry and are now holding our advance pickets towards Richmond General Kautz with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk on the same day with our movement up James River forced the Black Water burned the railroad bridge at Stony Creek below Petersburg cutting into Beauregard s force at that point We have landed here intrenched ourselves destroyed many miles of railroad and got a position which with proper supplies we can hold out against the whole of Lee s army I have ordered up the supplies Beauregard with a large portion of his force was left south by the cutting of the railroads by Kautz That portion which reached Petersburg under Hill I have whipped to day killing and wounding many and taking many prisoners after a severe and well contested fight General Grant will not be troubled with any further reinforcements to Lee from Beauregard s force BENJ F BUTLER Major General On the evening of the thirteenth and morning of the fourteenth he carried a portion of the enemy s first line of defences at Drury s Bluff or Fort Darling with small loss The time thus consumed from the sixth lost to us the benefit of the surprise and capture of Richmond and Petersburg enabling as it did Beauregard to collect his loose forces in North and South Carolina and bring them to the defence of those places On the sixteenth the enemy attacked General Butler in his position in front of Drury s Bluff He was forced back or drew back into his intrenchments between the forks of the James and Appomattox rivers the enemy intrenching strongly in his front thus covering his railroads the city and all that was valuable to him His army therefore though in a position of great security was as completely shut off from further operations directly against Richmond as if it had been in a bottle strongly corked It required but a comparatively small force of the enemy to hold it there On the twelfth General Kautz with his cavalry was started on a raid against the Danville Railroad which he struck at Coalfield Powhatan and Chula Stations destroying them the railroad track two freight trains and one locomotive together with large quantities of commissary and other stores thence crossing to the South Side Road struck it at Wilson s Wellsville and Black s and White s Stations destroying the road and station houses thence he proceeded to City Point which he reached on the eighteenth On the nineteenth of April and prior to the movement of General Butler the enemy with a land force under General Hoke and an iron clad ram attacked Plymouth N C commanded by General H W Wessells and our gunboats there and after severe fighting the place was carried by assault and the entire garrison and armament captured The gunboat Smithfield was sunk and the Miami disabled The army sent to operate against Richmond having hermetically sealed itself up at Bermuda Hundred the enemy was enabled to bring the most if not all the reinforcements brought from the south by Beauregard against the Army of the Potomac In addition to this reinforcement a very considerable one probably not less than fifteen thousand men was obtained by calling in the scattered troops under Breckinridge from the western part of Virginia The position of Bermuda Hundred was as easy to defend as it was difficult to operate from against the enemy I determined therefore to bring from it all available forces leaving enough only to secure what had been gained and accordingly on the twenty twod I directed that they be sent forward under command of Major General W F Smith to join the Army of the Potomac On the twenty fourth of May the ninth army corps commanded by Major General A E Burnside was assigned to the Army of the Potomac and from this time forward constituted a portion of Major General Meade s command Finding the enemy s position on the North Anna stronger than either of his previous ones I withdrew on the night of the twenty sixth to the north bank of the North Anna and moved via Hanover Town to turn the enemy s position by his right Generals Torbert s and Merritt s divisions of cavalry under Sheridan and the sixth corps led the advance crossed the Pamunkey River at Hanover Town after considerable fighting and on the twenty eighth the two divisions of cavalry had a severe but successful engagement with the enemy at Hawes s Shop On the twenty ninth and thirtieth we advanced with heavy skirmishing to the Hanover Court House and Cold Harbor Road and developed the enemy s position north of the Chickahominy Late on the evening of the last day the enemy came out and attacked our left but was repulsed with very considerable loss An attack was immediately ordered by General Meade along his whole line which resulted in driving the enemy from a part of his intrenched skirmish line On the thirty first General Wilson s division of cavalry destroyed the railroad bridges over the South Anna River after defeating the enemy s cavalry General Sheridan on the same day reached Cold Harbor and held it until relieved by the sixth corps and General Smith s command which had just arrived via White House from General Butler s army On the first day of June an attack was made at five P M by the sixth corps and the troops under General Smith the other corps being held in readiness to advance on the receipt of orders This resulted in our carrying and holding the enemy s first line of works in front of the right of the sixth corps and in front of General Smith During the attack the enemy made repeated assaults on each of the corps not engaged in the main attack but was repulsed with heavy loss in every instance That night he made several assaults to regain what he had lost in the day but failed The twod was spent in getting troops into position for an attack on the threed On the threed of June we again assaulted the enemy s works in the hope of driving him from his position In this attempt our loss was heavy while that of the enemy I have reason to believe was comparatively light It was the only general attack made from the Rapidan to the James which did not inflict upon the enemy losses to compensate for our own losses I would not be understood as saying that all previous attacks resulted in victories to our arms or accomplished as much as I had hoped from them but they inflicted upon the enemy severe losses which tended in the end to the complete overthrow of the rebellion From the proximity of the enemy to his defences around Richmond it was impossible by any flank movement to interpose between him and the city I was still in a condition to either move by his left flank and invest Richmond from the north side or continue my move by his right flank to the south side of the James While the former might have been better as a covering for Washington yet a full survey of all the ground satisfied me that it would be impracticable to hold a line north and east of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad a long vulnerable line which would exhaust much of our strength to guard and that would have to be protected to supply the army and would leave open to the enemy all his lines of communication on the south side of the James My idea from the start had been to beat Lee s army north of Richmond if possible Then after destroying his lines of communication north of the James River to transfer the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond or follow him south if he should retreat After the battle of the Wilderness it was evident that the enemy deemed it of the first importance to run no risks with the army he then had He acted purely on the defensive behind breastworks or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them and where in case of repulse he could easily retire behind them Without a greater sacrifice of life than I was willing to make all could not be accomplished that I had designed north of Richmond I therefore determined to continue to hold substantially the ground we then occupied taking advantage of any favorable circumstances that might present themselves until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesville and Gordonsville to effectually break up the railroad connection between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg and when the cavalry got well off to move the army to the south side of the James River by the enemy s right flank where I felt I could cut off all his sources of supply except by the canal On the seventh two divisions of cavalry under General Sheridan got off on the expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad with instructions to Hunter whom I hoped he would meet near Charlottesville to join his forces to Sheridan s and after the work laid out for them was thoroughly done to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid down in Sheridan s instructions On the tenth of June General Butler sent a force of infantry under General Gillmore and of cavalry under General Kautz to capture Petersburg if possible and destroy the railroad and common bridges across the Appomattox The cavalry carried the works on the south side and penetrated well in towards the town but were forced to retire General Gillmore finding the works which he approached very strong and deeming an assault impracticable returned to Bermuda Hundred without attempting one Attaching great importance to the possession of Petersburg I sent back to Bermuda Hundred and City Point General Smith s command by water via the White House to reach there in advance of the Army of the Potomac This was for the express purpose of securing Petersburg before the enemy becoming aware of our intention could reinforce the place The movement from Cold Harbor commenced after dark on the evening of the twelfth One division of cavalry under General Wilson and the fifth corps crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge and moved out to White Oak Swamp to cover the crossings of the other corps The advance corps reached James River at Wilcox s Landing and Charles City Court House on the night of the thirteenth During three long years the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia had been confronting each other In that time they had fought more desperate battles than it probably ever before fell to the lot of two armies to fight without materially changing the vantage ground of either The Southern press and people with more shrewdness than was displayed in the North finding that they had failed to capture Washington and march on to New York as they had boasted they would do assumed that they only defended their Capital and Southern territory Hence Antietam Gettysburg and all the other battles that had been fought were by them set down as failures on our part and victories for them Their army believed this It produced a morale which could only be overcome by desperate and continuous hard fighting The battles of the Wilderness Spottsylvania North Anna and Cold Harbor bloody and terrible as they were on our side were even more damaging to the enemy and so crippled him as to make him wary ever after of taking the offensive His losses in men were probably not so great owing to the fact that we were save in the Wilderness almost invariably the attacking party and when he did attack it was in the open field The details of these battles which for endurance and bravery on the part of the soldiery have rarely been surpassed are given in the report of Major General Meade and the subordinate reports accompanying it During the campaign of forty three days from the Rapidan to the James River the army had to be supplied from an ever shifting base by wagons over narrow roads through a densely wooded country with a lack of wharves at each new base from which to conveniently discharge vessels Too much credit cannot therefore be awarded to the quartermaster and commissary departments for the zeal and efficiency displayed by them Under the general supervision of the chief quartermaster Brigadier General R Ingalls the trains were made to occupy all the available roads between the army and our water base and but little difficulty was experienced in protecting them The movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys under General Sigel commenced on the first of May General Crook who had the immediate command of the Kanawha expedition divided his forces into two columns giving one composed of cavalry to General Averell They crossed the mountains by separate routes Averell struck the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad near Wytheville on the tenth and proceeding to New River and Christiansburg destroyed the road several important bridges and depots including New River Bridge forming a junction with Crook at Union on the fifteenth General Sigel moved up the Shenandoah Valley met the enemy at New Market on the fifteenth and after a severe engagement was defeated with heavy loss and retired behind Cedar Creek Not regarding the operations of General Sigel as satisfactory I asked his removal from command and Major General Hunter appointed to supersede him His instructions were embraced in the following dispatches to Major General H W Halleck chief of staff of the army NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE VA May twenty eighteen sixty four The enemy are evidently relying for supplies greatly on such as are brought over the branch road running through Staunton On the whole therefore I think it would be better for General Hunter to move in that direction reach Staunton and Gordonsville or Charlottesville if he does not meet too much opposition If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own he will be doing good service U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL H W HALLECK JERICHO FORD VA May twenty five eighteen sixty four If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg he should do so living on the country The railroads and canal should be destroyed beyond possibility of repairs for weeks Completing this he could find his way back to his original base or from about Gordonsville join this army U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL H W HALLECK General Hunter immediately took up the offensive and moving up the Shenandoah Valley met the enemy on the fifth of June at Piedmont and after a battle of ten hours routed and defeated him capturing on the field of battle one thousand five hundred men three pieces of artillery and three hundred stand of small arms On the eighth of the same month he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton from which place he moved direct on Lynchburg via Lexington which place he reached and invested on the sixteenth day of June Up to this time he was very successful and but for the difficulty of taking with him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march through a hostile country he would no doubt have captured that to the enemy important point The destruction of the enemy s supplies and manufactories was very great To meet this movement under General Hunter General Lee sent a force perhaps equal to a corps a part of which reached Lynchburg a short time before Hunter After some skirmishing on the seventeenth and eighteenth General Hunter owing to a want of ammunition to give battle retired from before the place Unfortunately this want of ammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by way of Kanawha This lost to us the use of his troops for several weeks from the defence of the North Had General Hunter moved by way of Charlottesville instead of Lexington as his instructions contemplated he would have been in a position to have covered the Shenandoah Valley against the enemy should the force he met have seemed to endanger it If it did not he would have been within easy distance of the James River Canal on the main line of communication between Lynchburg and the force sent for its defence I have never taken exception to the operations of General Hunter and am not now disposed to find fault with him for I have no doubt he acted within what he conceived to be the spirit of his instructions and the interests of the service The promptitude of his movements and his gallantry should entitle him to the commendation of his country To return to the Army of the Potomac The twod corps commenced crossing the James River on the morning of the fourteenth by ferry boats at Wilcox s Landing The laying of the pontoon bridge was completed about midnight of the fourteenth and the crossing of the balance of the army was rapidly pushed forward by both bridge and ferry After the crossing had commenced I proceeded by steamer to Bermuda Hundred to give the necessary orders for the immediate capture of Petersburg The instructions to General Butler were verbal and were for him to send General Smith immediately that night with all the troops he could give him without sacrificing the position he then held I told him that I would return at once to the Army of the Potomac hasten its crossing and throw it forward to Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it could be done that we could reinforce our armies more rapidly there than the enemy could bring troops against us General Smith got off as directed and confronted the enemy s pickets near Petersburg before daylight next morning but for some reason that I have never been able to satisfactorily understand did not get ready to assault his main lines until near sundown Then with a part of his command only he made the assault and carried the lines north east of Petersburg from the Appomattox River for a distance of over two and a half miles capturing fifteen pieces of artillery and three hundred prisoners This was about seven P M Between the line thus captured and Petersburg there were no other works and there was no evidence that the enemy had reinforced Petersburg with a single brigade from any source The night was clear the moon shining brightly and favorable to further operations General Hancock with two divisions of the twod corps reached General Smith just after dark and offered the service of these troops as he Smith might wish waiving rank to the named commander who he naturally supposed knew best the position of affairs and what to do with the troops But instead of taking these troops and pushing at once into Petersburg he requested General Hancock to relieve a part of his line in the captured works which was done before midnight By the time I arrived the next morning the enemy was in force An attack was ordered to be made at six o clock that evening by the troops under Smith and the twod and ninth corps It required until that time for the ninth corps to get up and into position The attack was made as ordered and the fighting continued with but little intermission until six o clock the next morning and resulted in our carrying the advance and some of the main works of the enemy to the right our left of those previously captured by General Smith several pieces of artillery and over four hundred prisoners The fifth corps having got up the attacks were renewed and persisted in with great vigor on the seventeenth and eighteenth but only resulted in forcing the enemy into an interior line from which he could not be dislodged The advantages of position gained by us were very great The army then proceeded to envelop Petersburg towards the South Side Railroad as far as possible without attacking fortifications On the sixteenth the enemy to reinforce Petersburg withdrew from a part of his intrenchment in front of Bermuda Hundred expecting no doubt to get troops from north of the James to take the place of those withdrawn before we could discover it General Butler taking advantage of this at once moved a force on the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond As soon as I was apprised of the advantage thus gained to retain it I ordered two divisions of the sixth corps General Wright commanding that were embarking at Wilcox s Landing under orders for City Point to report to General Butler at Bermuda Hundred of which General Butler was notified and the importance of holding a position in advance of his present line urged upon him About two o clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced back to the line the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning General Wright with his two divisions joined General Butler on the forenoon of the seventeenth the latter still holding with a strong picket line the enemy s works But instead of putting these divisions into the enemy s works to hold them he permitted them to halt and rest some distance in the rear of his own line Between four and five o clock in the afternoon the enemy attacked and drove in his pickets and re occupied his old line On the night of the twentieth and morning of the twenty first a lodgment was effected by General Butler with one brigade of infantry on the north bank of the James at Deep Bottom and connected by pontoon bridge with Bermuda Hundred On the nineteenth General Sheridan on his return from his expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad arrived at the White House just as the enemy s cavalry was about to attack it and compelled it to retire The result of this expedition was that General Sheridan met the enemy s cavalry near Trevilian Station on the morning of the eleventh of June whom he attacked and after an obstinate contest drove from the field in complete rout He left his dead and nearly all his wounded in our hands and about four hundred prisoners and several hundred horses On the twelfth he destroyed the railroad from Trevilian Station to Louisa Court House This occupied until three o clock P M when he advanced in the direction of Gordonsville He found the enemy reinforced by infantry behind well constructed rifle pits about five miles from the latter place and too strong to successfully assault On the extreme right however his reserve brigade carried the enemy s works twice and was twice driven therefrom by infantry Night closed the contest Not having sufficient ammunition to continue the engagement and his animals being without forage the country furnishing but inferior grazing and hearing nothing from General Hunter he withdrew his command to the north side of the North Anna and commenced his return march reaching White House at the time before stated After breaking up the depot at that place he moved to the James River which he reached safely after heavy fighting He commenced crossing on the twenty fifth near Fort Powhatan without further molestation and rejoined the Army of the Potomac On the twenty twod General Wilson with his own division of cavalry of the Army of the Potomac and General Kautz s division of cavalry of the Army of the James moved against the enemy s railroads south of Richmond Striking the Weldon Railroad at Reams s Station destroying the depot and several miles of the road and the South Side road about fifteen miles from Petersburg to near Nottoway Station where he met and defeated a force of the enemy s cavalry He reached Burkesville Station on the afternoon of the twenty threed and from there destroyed the Danville Railroad to Roanoke Bridge a distance of twenty five miles where he found the enemy in force and in a position from which he could not dislodge him He then commenced his return march and on the twenty eighth met the enemy s cavalry in force at the Weldon Railroad crossing of Stony Creek where he had a severe but not decisive engagement Thence he made a detour from his left with a view of reaching Reams s Station supposing it to be in our possession At this place he was met by the enemy s cavalry supported by infantry and forced to retire with the loss of his artillery and trains In this last encounter General Kautz with a part of his command became separated and made his way into our lines General Wilson with the remainder of his force succeeded in crossing the Nottoway River and coming in safely on our left and rear The damage to the enemy in this expedition more than compensated for the losses we sustained It severed all connection by railroad with Richmond for several weeks With a view of cutting the enemy s railroad from near Richmond to the Anna rivers and making him wary of the situation of his army in the Shenandoah and in the event of failure in this to take advantage of his necessary withdrawal of troops from Petersburg to explode a mine that had been prepared in front of the ninth corps and assault the enemy s lines at that place on the night of the twenty sixth of July the twod corps and two divisions of the cavalry corps and Kautz s cavalry were crossed to the north bank of the James River and joined the force General Butler had there On the twenty seventh the enemy was driven from his intrenched position with the loss of four pieces of artillery On the twenty eighth our lines were extended from Deep Bottom to New Market Road but in getting this position were attacked by the enemy in heavy force The fighting lasted for several hours resulting in considerable loss to both sides The first object of this move having failed by reason of the very large force thrown there by the enemy I determined to take advantage of the diversion made by assaulting Petersburg before he could get his force back there One division of the twod corps was withdrawn on the night of the twenty eighth and moved during the night to the rear of the eighteenth corps to relieve that corps in the line that it might be foot loose in the assault to be made The other two divisions of the twod corps and Sheridan s cavalry were crossed over on the night of the twenty ninth and moved in front of Petersburg On the morning of the thirtieth between four and five o clock the mine was sprung blowing up a battery and most of a regiment and the advance of the assaulting column formed of the ninth corps immediately took possession of the crater made by the explosion and the line for some distance to the right and left of it and a detached line in front of it but for some cause failed to advance promptly to the ridge beyond Had they done this I have every reason to believe that Petersburg would have fallen Other troops were immediately pushed forward but the time consumed in getting them up enabled the enemy to rally from his surprise which had been complete and get forces to this point for its defence The captured line thus held being untenable and of no advantage to us the troops were withdrawn but not without heavy loss Thus terminated in disaster what promised to be the most successful assault of the campaign Immediately upon the enemy s ascertaining that General Hunter was retreating from Lynchburg by way of the Kanawha River thus laying the Shenandoah Valley open for raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania he returned northward and moved down that valley As soon as this movement of the enemy was ascertained General Hunter who had reached the Kanawha River was directed to move his troops without delay by river and railroad to Harper s Ferry but owing to the difficulty of navigation by reason of low water and breaks in the railroad great delay was experienced in getting there It became necessary therefore to find other troops to check this movement of the enemy For this purpose the sixth corps was taken from the armies operating against Richmond to which was added the nineteenth corps then fortunately beginning to arrive in Hampton Roads from the Gulf Department under orders issued immediately after the ascertainment of the result of the Red River expedition The garrisons of Baltimore and Washington were at this time made up of heavy artillery regiments hundred days men and detachments from the invalid corps One division under command of General Ricketts of the sixth corps was sent to Baltimore and the remaining two divisions of the sixth corps under General Wright were subsequently sent to Washington On the threed of July the enemy approached Martinsburg General Sigel who was in command of our forces there retreated across the Potomac at Shepherdtown and General Weber commanding at Harper s Ferry crossed the occupied Hagerstown moving a strong column towards Frederick City General Wallace with Rickett s division and his own command the latter mostly new and undisciplined troops pushed out from Baltimore with great promptness and met the enemy in force on the Monocacy near the crossing of the railroad bridge His force was not sufficient to insure success but he fought the enemy nevertheless and although it resulted in a defeat to our arms yet it detained the enemy and thereby served to enable General Wright to reach Washington with two division of the sixth corps and the advance of the nineteenth corps before him From Monocacy the enemy moved on Washington his cavalry advance reaching Rockville on the evening of the tenth On the twelfth a reconnoissance was thrown out in front of Fort Stevens to ascertain the enemy s position and force A severe skirmish ensued in which we lost about two hundred and eighty in killed and wounded The enemy s loss was probably greater He commenced retreating during the night Learning the exact condition of affairs at Washington I requested by telegraph at forty five minutes past eleven P M on the twelfth the assignment of Major General H G Wright to the command of all the troops that could be made available to operate in the field against the enemy and directed that he should get outside of the trenches with all the force he could and push Early to the last moment General Wright commenced the pursuit on the thirteenth on the eighteenth the enemy was overtaken at Snicker s Ferry on the Shenandoah when a sharp skirmish occurred and on the twentieth General Averell encountered and defeated a portion of the rebel army at Winchester capturing four pieces of artillery and several hundred prisoners Learning that Early was retreating south towards Lynchburg or Richmond I directed that the sixth and nineteenth corps be got back to the armies operating against Richmond so that they might be used in a movement against Lee before the return of the troops sent by him into the valley and that Hunter should remain in the Shenandoah Valley keeping between any force of the enemy and Washington acting on the defensive as much as possible I felt that if the enemy had any notion of returning the fact would be developed before the sixth and nineteenth corps could leave Washington Subsequently the nineteenth corps was excepted form the order to return to the James About the twenty fifth it became evident that the enemy was again advancing upon Maryland and Pennsylvania and the sixth corps then at Washington was ordered back to the vicinity of Harper s Ferry The rebel force moved down the valley and sent a raiding party into Pennsylvania which on the thirtieth burned Chambersburg and then retreated pursued by our cavalry towards Cumberland They were met and defeated by General Kelley and with diminished numbers escaped into the mountains of West Virginia From the time of the first raid the telegraph wires were frequently down between Washington and City Point making it necessary to transmit messages a part of the way by boat It took from twenty four to thirty six hours to get dispatches through and return answers would be received showing a different state of facts from those on which they were based causing confusion and apparent contradiction of orders that must have considerably embarrassed those who had to execute them and rendered operations against the enemy less effective than they otherwise would have been To remedy this evil it was evident to my mind that some person should have the supreme command of all the forces in the Department of West Virginia Washington Susquehanna and the Middle Department and I so recommended On the twod of August I ordered General Sheridan to report in person to Major General Halleck chief of staff at Washington with a view to his assignment to the command of all the forces against Early At this time the enemy was concentrated in the neighborhood of Winchester while our forces under General Hunter were concentrated on the Monocacy at the crossing of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad leaving open to the enemy Western Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania From where I was I hesitated to give positive orders for the movement of our forces at Monocacy lest by so doing I should expose Washington Therefore on the fourth I left City Point to visit Hunter s command and determine for myself what was best to be done On arrival there and after consultation with General Hunter I issued to him the following instructions MONOCACY BRIDGE MARYLAND August five eighteen sixty four eight P M GENERAL Concentrate all your available force without delay in the vicinity of Harper s Ferry leaving only such railroad guards and garrisons for public property as may be necessary Use in this concentrating the railroad if by so doing time can be saved From Harper s Ferry if it is found that the enemy has moved north of the Potomac in large force push north following him and attacking him wherever found follow him if driven south of the Potomac as long as it is safe to do so If it is ascertained that the enemy has but a small force north of the Potomac then push south with the main force detaching under a competent commander a sufficient force to look after the raiders and drive them to their homes In detaching such a force the brigade of the cavalry now en route from Washington via Rockville may be taken into account There are now on their way to join you three other brigades of the best cavalry numbering at least five thousand men and horses These will be instructed in the absence of further orders to join you by the south side of the Potomac One brigade will probably start to morrow In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley where it is expected you will have to go first or last it is desirable that nothing should be left to invite the enemy to return Take all provisions forage and stock wanted for the use of your command such as cannot be consumed destroy It is not desirable that the buildings should be destroyed they should rather be protected but the people should be informed that so long as an army can subsist among them recurrence of theses raids must be expected and we are determined to stop them at all hazards Bear in mind the object is to drive the enemy south and to do this you want to keep him always in sight Be guided in your course by the course he takes Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds giving regular vouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the country through which you march U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL D HUNTER The troops were immediately put in motion and the advance reached Halltown that night General Hunter having in our conversation expressed a willingness to be relieved from command I telegraphed to have General Sheridan then at Washington sent to Harper s Ferry by the morning train with orders to take general command of all the troops in the field and to call on General Hunter at Monocacy who would turn over to him my letter of instructions I remained at Monocacy until General Sheridan arrived on the morning of the sixth and after a conference with him in relation to military affairs in that vicinity I returned to City Point by way of Washington On the seventh of August the Middle Department and the Departments of West Virginia Washington and Susquehanna were constituted into the Middle Military Division and Major General Sheridan was assigned to temporary command of the same Two divisions of cavalry commanded by Generals Torbert and Wilson were sent to Sheridan from the Army of the Potomac The first reached him at Harper s Ferry about the eleventh of August His operations during the month of August and the fore part of September were both of an offensive and defensive character resulting in many severe skirmishes principally by the cavalry in which we were generally successful but no general engagement took place The two armies lay in such a position the enemy on the west bank of the Opequon Creek covering Winchester and our forces in front of Berryville that either could bring on a battle at any time Defeat to us would lay open to the enemy the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania for long distances before another army could be interposed to check him Under these circumstances I hesitated about allowing the initiative to be taken Finally the use of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal which were both obstructed by the enemy became so indispensably necessary to us and the importance of relieving Pennsylvania and Maryland from continuously threatened invasion so great that I determined the risk should be taken But fearing to telegraph the order for an attack without knowing more than I did of General Sheridan s feelings as to what would be the probable result I left City Point on the fifteenth of September to visit him at his headquarters to decide after conference with him what should be done I met him at Charlestown and he pointed out so distinctly how each army lay what he could do the moment he was authorized and expressed such confidence of success that I saw there were but two words of instructions necessary Go in For the conveniences of forage the teams for supplying the army were kept at Harper s Ferry I asked him if he could get out his teams and supplies in time to make an attack on the ensuing Tuesday morning His reply was that he could before daylight on Monday He was off promptly to time and I may here add that the result was such that I have never since deemed it necessary to visit General Sheridan before giving him orders Early on the morning of the nineteenth General Sheridan attacked General Early at the crossing on the Opequon Creek and after a most sanguinary and bloody battle lasting until five o clock in the evening defeated him with heavy loss carrying his entire position from Opequon Creek to Winchester capturing several thousand prisoners and five pieces of artillery The enemy rallied and made a stand in a strong position at Fisher s Hill where he was attacked and again defeated with heavy loss on the twentieth twenty twod Sheridan pursued him with great energy through Harrisonburg Staunton and the gaps of the Blue Ridge After stripping the upper valley of most of the supplies and provisions for the rebel army he returned to Strasburg and took position on the north side of Cedar Creek Having received considerable reinforcements General Early again returned to the valley and on the ninth of October his cavalry encountered ours near Strasburg where the rebels were defeated with the loss of eleven pieces of artillery and three hundred and fifty prisoners On the night of the eighteenth the enemy crossed the mountains which separate the branches of the Shenandoah forded the North Fork and early on the morning of the nineteenth under cover of the darkness and the fog surprised and turned our left flank and captured the batteries which enfiladed our whole line Our troops fell back with heavy loss and in much confusion but were finally rallied between Middletown and Newtown At this juncture General Sheridan who was at Winchester when the battle commenced arrived on the field arranged his lines just in time to repulse a heavy attack of the enemy and immediately assuming the offensive he attacked in turn with great vigor The enemy was defeated with great slaughter and the loss of most of his artillery and trains and the trophies he had captured in the morning The wreck of his army escaped during the night and fled in the direction of Staunton and Lynchburg Pursuit was made to Mount Jackson Thus ended this the enemy s last attempt to invade the North via the Shenandoah Valley I was now enabled to return the sixth corps to the Army of the Potomac and to send one division from Sheridan s army to the Army of the James and another to Savannah Georgia to hold Sherman s new acquisitions on the sea coast and thus enable him to move without detaching from his force for that purpose Reports from various sources led me to believe that the enemy had detached three divisions from Petersburg to reinforce Early in the Shenandoah Valley I therefore sent the twod corps and Gregg s division of cavalry of the Army of the Potomac and a force of General Butler s army on the night of the thirteenth of August to threaten Richmond from the north side of the James to prevent him from sending troops away and if possible to draw back those sent In this move we captured six pieces of artillery and several hundred prisoners detained troops that were under marching orders and ascertained that but one division Kershaw s of the three reputed detached had gone The enemy having withdrawn heavily from Petersburg to resist this movement the fifth corps General Warren commanding was moved out on the eighteenth and took possession of the Weldon Railroad During the day he had considerable fighting To regain possession of the road the enemy made repeated and desperate assaults but was each time repulsed with great loss On the night of the twentieth the troops on the north side of the James were withdrawn and Hancock and Gregg returned to the front at Petersburg On the twenty fifth the twod corps and Gregg s division of cavalry while at Reams s Station destroying the railroad were attacked and after desperate fighting a part of our line gave way and five pieces of artillery fell into the hands of the enemy By the twelfth of September a branch railroad was completed from the City Point and Petersburg Railroad to the Weldon Railroad enabling us to supply without difficulty in all weather the army in front of Petersburg The extension of our lines across the Weldon Railroad compelled the enemy to so extend his that it seemed he could have but few troops north of the James for the defence of Richmond On the night of the twenty eighth the tenth corps Major General Birney and the eighteenth corps Major General Ord commanding of General Butler s army were crossed to the north side of the James and advanced on the morning of the twenty ninth carrying the very strong fortifications and intrenchments below Chaffin s Farm known as Fort Harrison capturing fifteen pieces of artillery and the New Market Road and intrenchments This success was followed up by a gallant assault upon Fort Gilmer immediately in front of the Chaffin Farm fortifications in which we were repulsed with heavy loss Kautz s cavalry was pushed forward on the road to the right of this supported by infantry and reached the enemy s inner line but was unable to get further The position captured from the enemy was so threatening to Richmond that I determined to hold it The enemy made several desperate attempts to dislodge us all of which were unsuccessful and for which he paid dearly On the morning of the thirtieth General Meade sent out a reconnoissance with a view to attacking the enemy s line if it was found sufficiently weakened by withdrawal of troops to the north side In this reconnoissance we captured and held the enemy s works near Poplar Spring Church In the afternoon troops moving to get to the left of the point gained were attacked by the enemy in heavy force and compelled to fall back until supported by the forces holding the captured works Our cavalry under Gregg was also attacked but repulsed the enemy with great loss On the seventh of October the enemy attacked Kautz s cavalry north of the James and drove it back with heavy loss in killed wounded and prisoners and the loss of all the artillery eight or nine pieces This he followed up by an attack on our intrenched infantry line but was repulsed with severe slaughter On the thirteenth a reconnoissance was sent out by General Butler with a view to drive the enemy from some new works he was constructing which resulted in very heavy loss to us On the twenty seventh the Army of the Potomac leaving only sufficient men to hold its fortified line moved by the enemy s right flank The twod corps followed by two divisions of the fifth corps with the cavalry in advance and covering our left flank forced a passage of Hatcher s Run and moved up the south side of it towards the South Side Railroad until the twod corps and part of the cavalry reached the Boydton Plank Road where it crosses Hatcher s Run At this point we were six miles distant from the South Side Railroad which I had hoped by this movement to reach and hold But finding that we had not reached the end of the enemy s fortifications and no place presenting itself for a successful assault by which he might be doubled up and shortened I determined to withdraw to within our fortified line Orders were given accordingly Immediately upon receiving a report that General Warren had connected with General Hancock I returned to my headquarters Soon after I left the enemy moved out across Hatcher s Run in the gap between Generals Hancock and Warren which was not closed as reported and made a desperate attack on General Hancock s right and rear General Hancock immediately faced his corps to meet it and after a bloody combat drove the enemy within his works and withdrew that night to his old position In support of this movement General Butler made a demonstration on the north side of the James and attacked the enemy on the Williamsburg Road and also on the York River Railroad In the former he was unsuccessful in the latter he succeeded in carrying a work which was afterwards abandoned and his forces withdrawn to their former positions From this time forward the operations in front of Petersburg and Richmond until the spring campaign of eighteen sixty five were confined to the defence and extension of our lines and to offensive movements for crippling the enemy s lines of communication and to prevent his detaching any considerable force to send south By the seventh of February our lines were extended to Hatcher s Run and the Weldon Railroad had been destroyed to Hicksford General Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the sixth of May with the Armies of the Cumberland Tennessee and Ohio commanded respectively by Generals Thomas McPherson and Schofield upon Johnston s army at Dalton but finding the enemy s position at Buzzard s Roost covering Dalton too strong to be assaulted General McPherson was sent through Snake Gap to turn it while Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened it in front and on the north This movement was successful Johnston finding his retreat likely to be cut off fell back to his fortified position at Resaca where he was attacked on the afternoon of May fifteenth A heavy battle ensued During the night the enemy retreated south Late on the seventeenth his rear guard was overtaken near Adairsville and heavy skirmishing followed The next morning however he had again disappeared He was vigorously pursued and was overtaken at Cassville on the nineteenth but during the ensuing night retreated across the Etowah While these operations were going on General Jefferson C Davis s division of Thomas s army was sent to Rome capturing it with its forts and artillery and its valuable mills and foundries General Sherman having give his army a few days rest at this point again put it in motion on the twenty threed for Dallas with a view of turning the difficult pass at Allatoona On the afternoon of the twenty fifth the advance under General Hooker had a severe battle with the enemy driving him back to New Hope Church near Dallas Several sharp encounters occurred at this point The most important was on the twenty eighth when the enemy assaulted General McPherson at Dallas but received a terrible and bloody repulse On the fourth of June Johnston abandoned his intrenched position at New Hope Church and retreated to the strong positions of Kenesaw Pine and Lost mountains He was forced to yield the two last named places and concentrate his army on Kenesaw where on the twenty seventh Generals Thomas and McPherson made a determined but unsuccessful assault On the night of the twod of July Sherman commenced moving his army by the right flank and on the morning of the threed found that the enemy in consequence of this movement had abandoned Kenesaw and retreated across the Chattahoochee General Sherman remained on the Chattahoochee to give his men rest and get up stores until the seventeenth of July when he resumed his operations crossed the Chattahoochee destroyed a large portion of the railroad to Augusta and drove the enemy back to Atlanta At this place General Hood succeeded General Johnston in command of the rebel army and assuming the offensive defensive policy made several severe attacks upon Sherman in the vicinity of Atlanta the most desperate and determined of which was on the twenty twod of July About one P M of this day the brave accomplished and noble hearted McPherson was killed General Logan succeeded him and commanded the Army of the Tennessee through this desperate battle and until he was superseded by Major General Howard on the twenty sixth with the same success and ability that had characterized him in the command of a corps or division In all these attacks the enemy was repulsed with great loss Finding it impossible to entirely invest the place General Sherman after securing his line of communications across the Chattahoochee moved his main force round by the enemy s left flank upon the Montgomery and Macon roads to draw the enemy from his fortifications In this he succeeded and after defeating the enemy near Rough and Ready Jonesboro and Lovejoy s forcing him to retreat to the south on the twod of September occupied Atlanta the objective point of his campaign About the time of this move the rebel cavalry under Wheeler attempted to cut his communications in the rear but was repulsed at Dalton and driven into East Tennessee whence it proceeded west to McMinnville Murfreesboro and Franklin and was finally driven south of the Tennessee The damage done by this raid was repaired in a few days During the partial investment of Atlanta General Rousseau joined General Sherman with a force of cavalry from Decatur having made a successful raid upon the Atlanta and Montgomery Railroad and its branches near Opelika Cavalry raids were also made by Generals McCook Garrard and Stoneman to cut the remaining Railroad communication with Atlanta The first two were successful the latter disastrous General Sherman s movement from Chattanooga to Atlanta was prompt skilful and brilliant The history of his flank movements and battles during that memorable campaign will ever be read with an interest unsurpassed by anything in history His own report and those of his subordinate commanders accompanying it give the details of that most successful campaign He was dependent for the supply of his armies upon a single track railroad from Nashville to the point where he was operating This passed the entire distance through a hostile country and every foot of it had to be protected by troops The cavalry force of the enemy under Forrest in Northern Mississippi was evidently waiting for Sherman to advance far enough into the mountains of Georgia to make a retreat disastrous to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the possibility of further use To guard against this danger Sherman left what he supposed to be a sufficient force to operate against Forrest in West Tennessee He directed General Washburn who commanded there to send Brigadier General S D Sturgis in command of this force to attack him On the morning of the tenth of June General Sturgis met the enemy near Guntown Mississippi was badly beaten and driven back in utter rout and confusion to Memphis a distance of about one hundred miles hotly pursued by the enemy By this however the enemy was defeated in his designs upon Sherman s line of communications The persistency with which he followed up this success exhausted him and made a season for rest and repairs necessary In the meantime Major General A J Smith with the troops of the Army of the Tennessee that had been sent by General Sherman to General Banks arrived at Memphis on their return from Red River where they had done most excellent service He was directed by General Sherman to immediately take the offensive against Forrest This he did with the promptness and effect which has characterized his whole military career On the fourteenth of July he met the enemy at Tupelo Mississippi and whipped him badly The fighting continued through three days Our loss was small compared with that of the enemy Having accomplished the object of his expedition General Smith returned to Memphis During the months of March and April this same force under Forrest annoyed us considerably On the twenty fourth of March it captured Union City Kentucky and its garrison and on the twenty fourth attacked Paducah commanded by Colonel S G Hicks fortieth Illinois Volunteers Colonel H having but a small force withdrew to the forts near the river from where he repulsed the enemy and drove him from the place On the thirteenth of April part of this force under the rebel General Buford summoned the garrison of Columbus Kentucky to surrender but received for reply from Colonel Lawrence thirty fourth New Jersey Volunteers that being placed there by his Government with adequate force to hold his post and repel all enemies from it surrender was out of the question On the morning of the same day Forrest attacked Fort Pillow Tennessee garrisoned by a detachment of Tennessee cavalry and the first Regiment Alabama colored troops commanded by Major Booth The garrison fought bravely until about three o clock in the afternoon when the enemy carried the works by assault and after our men threw down their arms proceeded to an inhuman and merciless massacre of the garrison On the fourteenth General Buford having failed at Columbus appeared before Paducah but was again driven off Guerillas and raiders seemingly emboldened by Forrest s operations were also very active in Kentucky The most noted of these was Morgan With a force of from two to three thousand cavalry he entered the State through Pound Gap in the latter part of May On the eleventh of June they attacked and captured Cynthiana with its entire garrison On the twelfth he was overtaken by General Burbridge and completely routed with heavy loss and was finally driven out of the State This notorious guerilla was afterwards surprised and killed near Greenville Tennessee and his command captured and dispersed by General Gillem In the absence of official reports of the commencement of the Red River expedition except so far as relates to the movements of the troops sent by General Sherman under General A J Smith I am unable to give the date of its starting The troops under General Smith comprising two divisions of the sixteenth and a detachment of the seventeenth army corps left Vicksburg on the tenth of March and reached the designated point on Red River one day earlier than that appointed by General Banks The rebel forces at Fort de Russy thinking to defeat him left the fort on the fourteenth to give him battle in the open field but while occupying the enemy with skirmishing and demonstrations Smith pushed forward to Fort de Russy which had been left with a weak garrison and captured it with its garrison about three hundred and fifty men eleven pieces of artillery and many small arms Our loss was but slight On the fifteenth he pushed forward to Alexandria which place he reached on the eighteenth On the twenty first he had an engagement with the enemy at Henderson s Hill in which he defeated him capturing two hundred and ten prisoners and four pieces of artillery On the twenty eighth he again attacked and defeated the enemy under the rebel General Taylor at Cane River By the twenty sixth General Banks had assembled his whole army at Alexandria and pushed forward to Grand Ecore On the morning of April sixth he moved from Grand Ecore On the afternoon of the seventh he advanced and met the enemy near Pleasant Hill and drove him from the field On the same afternoon the enemy made a stand eight miles beyond Pleasant Hill but was again compelled to retreat On the eighth at Sabine Cross Roads and Peach Hill the enemy attacked and defeated his advance capturing nineteen pieces of artillery and an immense amount of transportation and stores During the night General Banks fell back to Pleasant Hill where another battle was fought on the ninth and the enemy repulsed with great loss During the night General Banks continued his retrograde movement to Grand Ecore and thence to Alexandria which he reached on the twenty seventh of April Here a serious difficulty arose in getting Admiral Porter s fleet which accompanied the expedition over the rapids the water having fallen so much since they passed up as to prevent their return At the suggestion of Colonel now Brigadier General Bailey and under his superintendence wing dams were constructed by which the channel was contracted so that the fleet passed down the rapids in safety The army evacuated Alexandria on the fourteenth of May after considerable skirmishing with the enemy s advance and reached Morganzia and Point Coupee near the end of the month The disastrous termination of this expedition and the lateness of the season rendered impracticable the carrying out of my plans of a movement in force sufficient to insure the capture of Mobile On the twenty threed of March Major General Steele left Little Rock with the seventh army corps to cooperate with General Banks s expedition on the Red River and reached Arkadelphia on the twenty eighth On the sixteenth of April after driving the enemy before him he was joined near Elkin s Ferry in Washita County by General Thayer who had marched from Fort Smith After several severe skirmishes in which the enemy was defeated General Steele reached Camden which he occupied about the middle of April On learning the defeat and consequent retreat of General Banks on Red River and the loss of one of his own trains at Mark s Mill in Dallas County General Steele determined to fall back to the Arkansas River He left Camden on the twenty sixth of April and reached Little Rock on the twod of May On the thirtieth of April the enemy attacked him while crossing Saline River at Jenkins s Ferry but was repulsed with considerable loss Our loss was about six hundred in killed wounded and prisoners Major General Canby who had been assigned to the command of the Military Division of the West Mississippi was therefore directed to send the nineteenth army corps to join the armies operating against Richmond and to limit the remainder of his command to such operations as might be necessary to hold the positions and lines of communications he then occupied Before starting General A J Smith s troops back to Sherman General Canby sent a part of it to disperse a force of the enemy that was collecting near the Mississippi River General Smith met and defeated this force near Lake Chicot on the fifth of June Our loss was about forty killed and seventy wounded In the latter part of July General Canby sent Major General Gordon Granger with such forces as he could collect to company operate with Admiral Farragut against the defences of Mobile Bay On the eighth of August Fort Gaines surrendered to the combined naval and land forces Fort Powell was blown up and abandoned On the ninth Fort Morgan was invested and after a severe bombardment surrendered on the twenty threed The total captures amounted to one thousand four hundred and sixty four prisoners and one hundred and four pieces of artillery About the last of August it being reported that the rebel General Price with a force of about ten thousand men had reached Jacksonport on his way to invade Missouri General A J Smith s command then en route from Memphis to join Sherman was ordered to Missouri A cavalry force was also at the same time sent from Memphis under command of Colonel Winslow This made General Rosecrans s forces superior to those of Price and no doubt was entertained he would be able to check Price and drive him back while the forces under General Steele in Arkansas would cut off his retreat On the twenty sixth day of September Price attacked Pilot Knob and forced the garrison to retreat and thence moved north to the Missouri River and continued up that river towards Kansas General Curtis commanding Department of Kansas immediately collected such forces as he could to repel the invasion of Kansas while General Rosecrans s cavalry was operating in his rear The enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated with the loss of nearly all his artillery and trains and a large number of prisoners He made a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkansas The impunity with which Price was enabled to roam over the State of Missouri for a long time and the incalculable mischief done by him show to how little purpose a superior force may be used There is no reason why General Rosecrans should not have concentrated his forces and beaten and driven Price before the latter reached Pilot Knob September twentieth the enemy s cavalry under Forrest crossed the Tennessee near Waterloo Alabama and on the twenty threed attacked the garrison at Athens consisting of six hundred men which capitulated on the twenty fourth Soon after the surrender two regiments of reinforcements arrived and after a severe fight were compelled to surrender Forrest destroyed the railroad westward captured the garrison at Sulphur Branch trestle skirmished with the garrison at Pulaski on the twenty seventh and on the same day cut the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad near Tullahoma and Dechard On the morning of the thirtieth one column of Forrest s command under Buford appeared before Huntsville and summoned the surrender of the garrison Receiving an answer in the negative he remained in the vicinity of the place until next morning when he again summoned its surrender and received the same reply as on the night before He withdrew in the direction of Athens which place had been regarrisoned and attacked it on the afternoon of the first of October but without success On the morning of the twod he renewed his attack but was handsomely repulsed Another column under Forrest appeared before Columbia on the morning of the first but did not make an attack On the morning of the threed he moved towards Mount Pleasant While these operations were going on every exertion was made by General Thomas to destroy the forces under Forrest before he could recross the Tennessee but was unable to prevent his escape to Corinth Mississippi In September an expedition under General Burbridge was sent to destroy the saltworks at Saltville Virginia He met the enemy on the twod of October about three miles and a half from Saltville and drove him into his strongly intrenched position around the salt works from which he was unable to dislodge him During the night he withdrew his command and returned to Kentucky General Sherman immediately after the fall of Atlanta put his armies in camp in and about the place and made all preparations for refitting and supplying them for future service The great length of road from Atlanta to the Cumberland River however which had to be guarded allowed the troops but little rest During this time Jefferson Davis made a speech in Macon Georgia which was reported in the papers of the South and soon became known to the whole country disclosing the plans of the enemy thus enabling General Sherman to fully meet them He exhibited the weakness of supposing that an army that had been beaten and fearfully decimated in a vain attempt at the defensive could successfully undertake the offensive against the army that had so often defeated it In execution of this plan Hood with this army was soon reported to the south west of Atlanta Moving far to Sherman s right he succeeded in reaching the railroad about Big Shanty and moved north on it General Sherman leaving a force to hold Atlanta with the remainder of his army fell upon him and drove him to Gadsden Alabama Seeing the constant annoyance he would have with the roads to his rear if he attempted to hold Atlanta General Sherman proposed the abandonment and destruction of that place with all the railroads leading to it and telegraphed me as follows CENTREVILLE GEORGIA October ten noon Dispatch about Wilson just received Hood is now crossing Coosa River twelve miles below Rome bound west If he passes over the Mobile and Ohio road had I not better execute the plan of my letter sent by Colonel Porter and leave General Thomas with the troops now in Tennessee to defend the State He will have an ample force when the reinforcements ordered reach Nashville W T SHERMAN Major General LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT For a full understanding of the plan referred to in this dispatch I quote from the letter sent by Colonel Porter I will therefore give my opinion that your army and Canby s should be reinforced to the maximum that after you get Wilmington you strike for Savannah and the river that Canby be instructed to hold the Mississippi River and send a force to get Columbus Georgia either by the way of the Alabama or the Appalachicola and that I keep Hood employed and put my army in final order for a march on Augusta Columbia and Charleston to be ready as soon as Wilmington is sealed as to commerce and the city of Savannah is in our possession This was in reply to a letter of mine of date September twelfth in answer to a dispatch of his containing substantially the same proposition and in which I informed him of a proposed movement against Wilmington and of the situation in Virginia et cetera CITY POINT VIRGINIA October eleven eighteen sixty four eleven A M Your dispatch of October tenth received Does it not look as if Hood was going to attempt the invasion of Middle Tennessee using the Mobile and Ohio and Memphis and Charleston roads to supply his base on the Tennessee River about Florence or Decatur If he does this he ought to be met and prevented from getting north of the Tennessee River If you were to cut loose I do not believe you would meet Hood s army but would be bushwhacked by all the old men and little boys and such railroad guards as are still left at home Hood would probably strike for Nashville thinking that by going north he could inflict greater damage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south If there is any way of getting at Hood s army I would prefer that but I must trust to your own judgment I find I shall not be able to send a force from here to act with you on Savannah Your movements therefore will be independent of mine at least until the fall of Richmond takes place I am afraid Thomas with such lines of road as he has to protect could not prevent Hood from going north With Wilson turned loose with all your cavalry you will find the rebels put much more on the defensive than heretofore U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN KINGSTON GEORGIA October eleven eleven A M Hood moved his army from Palmetto Station across by Dallas and Cedartown and is now on the Coosa River south of Rome He threw one corps on my road at Acworth and I was forced to follow I hold Atlanta with the twentieth corps and have strong detachments along my line This reduces my active force to a comparatively small army We cannot remain here on the defensive With the twenty five thousand men and the bold cavalry he has he can constantly break my roads I would infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road and of the country from Chattanooga to Atlanta including the latter city send back all my wounded and worthless and with my effective army move through Georgia smashing things to the sea Hood may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky but I believe he will be forced to follow me Instead of my being on the defensive I would be on the offensive instead of guessing at what he means to do he would have to guess at my plans The difference in war is full twenty five per cent I can make Savannah Charleston or the mouth of the Chattahoochee Answer quick as I know we will not have the telegraph long W T SHERMAN Major General LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT CITY POINT VIRGINIA October one hundred eleven thousand eight hundred sixty four eleven point thirty P M Your dispatch of to day received If you are satisfied the trip to the sea coast can be made holding the line of the Tennessee River firmly you may make it destroying all the railroad south of Dalton or Chattanooga as you think best U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN It was the original design to hold Atlanta and by getting through to the coast with a garrison left on the southern railroads leading east and west through Georgia to effectually sever the east from the west In other words cut the would be Confederacy in two again as it had been cut once by our gaining possession of the Mississippi River General Sherman s plan virtually effected this object General Sherman commenced at once his preparations for his proposed movement keeping his army in position in the meantime to watch Hood Becoming satisfied that Hood had moved westward from Gadsden across Sand Mountain General Sherman sent the fourth corps Major General Stanley commanding and the twenty threed corps Major General Schofield commanding back to Chattanooga to report to Major General Thomas at Nashville whom he had placed in command of all the troops of his military division save the four army corps and cavalry division he designed to move with through Georgia With the troops thus left at his disposal there was little doubt that General Thomas could hold the line of the Tennessee or in the event Hood should force it would be able to concentrate and beat him in battle It was therefore readily consented to that Sherman should start for the sea coast Having concentrated his troops at Atlanta by the fourteenth of November he commenced his march threatening both Augusta and Macon His coming out point could not be definitely fixed Having to gather his subsistence as he marched through the country it was not impossible that a force inferior to his own might compel him to head for such point as he could reach instead of such as he might prefer The blindness of the enemy however in ignoring his movement and sending Hood s army the only considerable force he had west of Richmond and east of the Mississippi River northward on an offensive campaign left the whole country open and Sherman s route to his own choice How that campaign was conducted how little opposition was met with the condition of the country through which the armies passed the capture of Fort Mc Allister on the Savannah River and the occupation of Savannah on the twenty first of December are all clearly set forth in General Sherman s admirable report Soon after General Sherman commenced his march from Atlanta two expeditions one from Baton Rouge Louisiana and one from Vicksburg Mississippi were started by General Canby to cut the enemy s lines of communication with Mobile and detain troops in that field General Foster commanding Department of the South also sent an expedition via Broad River to destroy the railroad between Charleston and Savannah The expedition from Vicksburg under command of Brevet Brigadier General E D Osband colonel threed United States colored cavalry captured on the twenty seventh of November and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroad bridge and trestle work over Big Black River near Canton thirty miles of the road and two locomotives besides large amounts of stores The expedition from Baton Rouge was without favorable results The expedition from the Department of the South under the immediate command of Brigadier General John P Hatch consisting of about five thousand men of all arms including a brigade from the navy proceeded up Broad River and debarked at Boyd s Neck on the twenty ninth of November from where it moved to strike the railroad at Grahamsville At Honey Hill about three miles from Grahamsville the enemy was found and attacked in a strongly fortified position which resulted after severe fighting in our repulse with a loss of seven hundred and forty six in killed wounded and missing During the night General Hatch withdrew On the sixth of December General Foster obtained a position covering the Charleston and Savannah Railroad between the Coosawhatchie and Tulifinny rivers Hood instead of following Sherman continued his move northward which seemed to me to be leading to his certain doom At all events had I had the power to command both armies I should not have changed the orders under which he seemed to be acting On the twenty sixth of October the advance of Hood s army attacked the garrison at Decatur Alabama but failing to carry the place withdrew towards Courtland and succeeded in the face of our cavalry in effecting a lodgment on the north side of the Tennessee River near Florence On the twenty eighth Forrest reached the Tennessee at Fort Heiman and captured a gunboat and three transports On the twod of November he planted batteries above and below Johnsonville on the opposite side of the river isolating three gunboats and eight transports On the fourth the enemy opened his batteries upon the place and was replied to from the gunboats and the garrison The gunboats becoming disabled were set on fire as also were the transports to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy About a million and a half dollars worth of store and property on the levee and in storehouses was consumed by fire On the fifth the enemy disappeared and crossed to the north side of the Tennessee River above Johnsonville moving towards Clifton and subsequently joined Hood On the night of the fifth General Schofield with the advance of the twenty threed corps reached Johnsonville but finding the enemy gone was ordered to Pulaski and was put in command of all the troopers there with instruction to watch the movements of Hood and retard his advance but not to risk a general engagement until the arrival of General A J Smith s command from Missouri and until General Wilson could get his cavalry remounted On the nineteenth General Hood continued his advance General Thomas retarding him as much as possible fell back towards Nashville for the purpose of concentrating his command and gaining time for the arrival of reinforcements The enemy coming up with our main force commanded by General Schofield at Franklin on the thirtieth assaulted our works repeatedly during the afternoon until late at night but were in every instance repulsed His loss in this battle was one thousand seven hundred and fifty killed seven hundred and two prisoners and three thousand eight hundred wounded Among his losses were six general officers killed six wounded and one captured Our entire loss was two thousand three hundred This was the first serious opposition the enemy met with and I am satisfied was the fatal blow to all his expectations During the night General Schofield fell back towards Nashville This left the field to the enemy not lost by battle but voluntarily abandoned so that General Thomas s whole force might be brought together The enemy followed up and commenced the establishment of his line in front of Nashville on the twod of December As soon as it was ascertained that Hood was crossing the Tennessee River and that Price was going out of Missouri General Rosecrans was ordered to send to General Thomas the troops of General A J Smith s command and such other troops as he could spare The advance of this reinforcement reached Nashville on the thirtieth of November On the morning of the fifteenth December General Thomas attacked Hood in position and in a battle lasting two days defeated and drove him from the field in the utmost confusion leaving in our hand most of his artillery and many thousand prisoners including four general officers Before the battle of Nashville I grew very impatient over as it appeared to me the unnecessary delay This impatience was increased upon learning that the enemy had sent a force of cavalry across the Cumberland into Kentucky I feared Hood would cross his whole army and give us great trouble there After urging upon General Thomas the necessity of immediately assuming the offensive I started West to superintend matters there in person Reaching Washington City I received General Thomas s dispatch announcing his attack upon the enemy and the result as far as the battle had progressed I was delighted All fears and apprehensions were dispelled I am not yet satisfied but that General Thomas immediately upon the appearance of Hood before Nashville and before he had time to fortify should have moved out with his whole force and given him battle instead of waiting to remount his cavalry which delayed him until the inclemency of the weather made it impracticable to attack earlier than he did But his final defeat of Hood was so complete that it will be accepted as a vindication of that distinguished officer s judgment After Hood s defeat at Nashville he retreated closely pursued by cavalry and infantry to the Tennessee River being forced to abandon many pieces of artillery and most of his transportation On the twenty eighth of December our advanced forces ascertained that he had made good his escape to the south side of the river About this time the rains having set in heavily in Tennessee and North Alabama making it difficult to move army transportation and artillery General Thomas stopped the pursuit by his main force at the Tennessee River A small force of cavalry under Colonel W J Palmer fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers continued to follow Hood for some distance capturing considerable transportation and all the enemy s pontoon bridge The details of these operations will be found clearly set forth in General Thomas s report A cavalry expedition under Brevet Major General Grierson started from Memphis on the twenty first of December On the twenty fifth he surprised and captured Forrest s dismounted camp at Verona Mississippi on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad destroyed the railroad sixteen cars loaded with wagons and pontoons for Hood s army four thousand new English carbines and large amounts of public stores On the morning of the twenty eighth he attacked and captured a force of the enemy at Egypt and destroyed a train of fourteen cars thence turning to the south west he struck the Mississippi Central Railroad at Winona destroyed the factories and large amounts of stores at Bankston and the machine shops and public property at Grenada arriving at Vicksburg January fifth During the operations in Middle Tennessee the enemy with a force under General Breckinridge entered East Tennessee On the thirteenth of November he attacked General Gillem near Morristown capturing his artillery and several hundred prisoners Gillem with what was left of his command retreated to Knoxville Following up his success Breckinridge moved to near Knoxville but withdrew on the eighteenth followed by General Ammen Under the directions of General Thomas General Stoneman concentrated the commands of Generals Burbridge and Gillem near Bean s Station to operate against Breckinridge and destroy or drive him into Virginia destroy the salt works at Saltville and the railroad into Virginia as far as he could go without endangering his command On the twelfth of December he commenced his movement capturing and dispersing the enemy s forces wherever he met them On the sixteenth he struck the enemy under Vaughn at Marion completely routing and pursuing him to Wytheville capturing all his artillery trains and one hundred and ninety eight prisoners and destroyed Wytheville with its stores and supplies and the extensive lead works near there Returning to Marion he met a force under Breckinridge consisting among other troops of the garrison of Saltville that had started in pursuit He at once made arrangements to attack it the next morning but morning found Breckinridge gone He then moved directly to Saltville and destroyed the extensive salt works at that place a large amount of stores and captured eight pieces of artillery Having thus successfully executed his instructions he returned General Burbridge to Lexington and General Gillem to Knoxville Wilmington North Carolina was the most important sea coast port left to the enemy through which to get supplies from abroad and send cotton and other products out by blockade runners besides being a place of great strategic value The navy had been making strenuous exertions to seal the harbor of Wilmington but with only partial effect The nature of the outlet of Cape Fear River was such that it required watching for so great a distance that without possession of the land north of New Inlet or Fort Fisher it was impossible for the navy to entirely close the harbor against the entrance of blockade runners To secure the possession of this land required the company operation of a land force which I agreed to furnish Immediately commenced the assemblage in Hampton Roads under Admiral D D Porter of the most formidable armada ever collected for concentration upon one given point This necessarily attracted the attention of the enemy as well as that of the loyal North and through the imprudence of the public press and very likely of officers of both branches of service the exact object of the expedition became a subject of common discussion in the newspapers both North and South The enemy thus warned prepared to meet it This caused a postponement of the expedition until the later part of November when being again called upon by honorable G V Fox Assistant Secretary of the Navy I agreed to furnish the men required at once and went myself in company with Major General Butler to Hampton Roads where we had a conference with Admiral Porter as to the force required and the time of starting A force of six thousand five hundred men was regarded as sufficient The time of starting was not definitely arranged but it was thought all would be ready by the sixth of December if not before Learning on the thirtieth of November that Bragg had gone to Georgia taking with him most of the forces about Wilmington I deemed it of the utmost importance that the expedition should reach its destination before the return of Bragg and directed General Butler to make all arrangements for the departure of Major General Weitzel who had been designated to command the land forces so that the navy might not be detained one moment On the sixth of December the following instructions were given CITY POINT VIRGINIA December six eighteen sixty four GENERAL The first object of the expedition under General Weitzel is to close to the enemy the port of Wilmington If successful in this the second will be to capture Wilmington itself There are reasonable grounds to hope for success if advantage can be taken of the absence of the greater part of the enemy s forces now looking after Sherman in Georgia The directions you have given for the numbers and equipment of the expedition are all right except in the unimportant matter of where they embark and the amount of intrenching tools to be taken The object of the expedition will be gained by effecting a landing on the main land between Cape Fear River and the Atlantic north of the north entrance to the river Should such landing be effected while the enemy still holds Fort Fisher and the batteries guarding the entrance to the river then the troops should intrench themselves and by company operating with the navy effect the reduction and capture of those places These in our hands the navy could enter the harbor and the port of Wilmington would be sealed Should Fort Fisher and the point of land on which it is built fall into the hands of our troops immediately on landing then it will be worth the attempt to capture Wilmington by a forced march and surprise If time is consumed in gaining the first object of the expedition the second will become a matter of after consideration The details for execution are intrusted to you and the officer immediately in command of the troops Should the troops under General Weitzel fail to effect a landing at or near Fort Fisher they will be returned to the armies operating against Richmond without delay U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL B F BUTLER General Butler commanding the army from which the troops were taken for this enterprise and the territory within which they were to operate military courtesy required that all orders and instructions should go through him They were so sent but General Weitzel has since officially informed me that he never received the foregoing instructions nor was he aware of their existence until he read General Butler s published official report of the Fort Fisher failure with my indorsement and papers accompanying it I had no idea of General Butler s accompanying the expedition until the evening before it got off from Bermuda Hundred and then did not dream but that General Weitzel had received all the instructions and would be in command I rather formed the idea that General Butler was actuated by a desire to witness the effect of the explosion of the powder boat The expedition was detained several days at Hampton Roads awaiting the loading of the powder boat The importance of getting the Wilmington expedition off without any delay with or without the powder boat had been urged upon General Butler and he advised to so notify Admiral Porter The expedition finally got off on the thirteenth of December and arrived at the place of rendezvous off New Inlet near Fort Fisher on the evening of the fifteenth Admiral Porter arrived on the evening of the eighteenth having put in at Beaufort to get ammunition for the monitors The sea becoming rough making it difficult to land troops and the supply of water and coal being about exhausted the transport fleet put back to Beaufort to replenish this with the state of the weather delayed the return to the place of rendezvous until the twenty fourth The powder boat was exploded on the morning of the twenty fourth before the return of General Butler from Beaufort but it would seem from the notice taken of it in the Southern newspapers that the enemy were never enlightened as to the object of the explosion until they were informed by the Northern press On the twenty fifth a landing was effected without opposition and a reconnoissance under Brevet Brigadier General Curtis pushed up towards the fort But before receiving a full report of the result of this reconnoissance General Butler in direct violation of the instructions given ordered the re embarkation of the troops and the return of the expedition The re embarkation was accomplished by the morning of the twenty seventh On the return of the expedition officers and men among them Brevet Major General then Brevet Brigadier General N M Curtis First Lieutenant G W Ross one hundred and seventeenth Regiment New York Volunteers First Lieutenant William H Walling and Second Lieutenant George Simpson one hundred forty twod New York Volunteers voluntarily reported to me that when recalled they were nearly into the fort and in their opinion it could have been taken without much loss Soon after the return of the expedition I received a dispatch from the Secretary of the Navy and a letter from Admiral Porter informing me that the fleet was still off Fort Fisher and expressing the conviction that under a proper leader the place could be taken The natural supposition with me was that when the troops abandoned the expedition the navy would do so also Finding it had not however I answered on the thirtieth of December advising Admiral Porter to hold on and that I would send a force and make another attempt to take the place This time I selected Brevet Major General now Major General A H Terry to command the expedition The troops composing it consisted of the same that composed the former with the addition of a small brigade numbering about one thousand five hundred and a small siege train The latter it was never found necessary to land I communicated direct to the commander of the expedition the following instructions CITY POINT VIRGINIA January three eighteen sixty five GENERAL The expedition intrusted to your command has been fitted out to renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher N C and Wilmington ultimately if the fort falls You will then proceed with as little delay as possible to the naval fleet lying off Cape Fear River and report the arrival of yourself and command to Admiral D D Porter commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron It is exceedingly desirable that the most complete understanding should exist between yourself and the naval commander I suggest therefore that you consult with Admiral Porter freely and get from him the part to be performed by each branch of the public service so that there may be unity of action It would be well to have the whole programme laid down in writing I have served with Admiral Porter and know that you can rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he proposes I would therefore defer to him as much as is consistent with your own responsibilities The first object to be attained is to get a firm position on the spit of land on which Fort Fisher is built from which you can operate against that fort You want to look to the practicability of receiving your supplies and to defending yourself against superior forces sent against you by any of the avenues left open to the enemy If such a position can be obtained the siege of Fort Fisher will not be abandoned until its reduction is accomplished or another plan of campaign is ordered from these headquarters My own views are that if you effect a landing the navy ought to run a portion of their fleet into Cape Fear River while the balance of it operates on the outside Land forces cannot invest Fort Fisher or cut it off from supplies or reinforcements while the river is in possession of the enemy A siege train will be loaded on vessels and sent to Fort Monroe in readiness to be sent to you if required All other supplies can be drawn from Beaufort as you need them Keep the fleet of vessels with you until your position is assured When you find they can be spared order them back or such of them as you can spare to Fort Monroe to report for orders In case of failure to effect a landing bring your command back to Beaufort and report to these headquarters for further instructions You will not debark at Beaufort until so directed General Sheridan has been ordered to send a division of troops to Baltimore and place them on sea going vessels These troops will be brought to Fort Monroe and kept there on the vessels until you are heard from Should you require them they will be sent to you U S GRANT Lieutenant General BREVET MAJOR GENERAL A H TERRY Lieutenant Colonel C B Comstock aide de camp now brevet brigadier general who accompanied the former expedition was assigned in orders as chief engineer to this It will be seen that these instructions did not differ materially from those given for the first expedition and that in neither instance was there an order to assault Fort Fisher This was a matter left entirely to the discretion of the commanding officer The expedition sailed from Fort Monroe on the morning of the sixth arriving at the rendezvous off Beaufort on the eighth where owing to the difficulties of the weather it lay until the morning of the twelfth when it got under way and reached its destination that evening Under cover of the fleet the disembarkation of the troops commenced on the morning of the thirteenth and by three o clock P M was completed without loss On the fourteenth a reconnoissance was pushed to within five hundred yards of Fort Fisher and a small advance work taken possession of and turned into a defensive line against any attempt that might be made from the fort This reconnoissance disclosed the fact that the front of the work had been seriously injured by the navy fire In the afternoon of the fifteenth the fort was assaulted and after most desperate fighting was captured with its entire garrison and armament Thus was secured by the combined efforts of the navy and army one of the most important successes of the war Our loss was killed one hundred and ten wounded five hundred and thirty six On the sixteenth and the seventeenth the enemy abandoned and blew up Fort Caswell and the works on Smith s Island which were immediately occupied by us This gave us entire control of the mouth of the Cape Fear River At my request Mayor General B F Butler was relieved and Major General E O C Ord assigned to the Department of Virginia and North Carolina The defence of the line of the Tennessee no longer requiring the force which had beaten and nearly destroyed the only army now threatening it I determined to find other fields of operation for General Thomas s surplus troops fields from which they would company operate with other movements General Thomas was therefore directed to collect all troops not essential to hold his communications at Eastport in readiness for orders On the seventh of January General Thomas was directed if he was assured of the departure of Hood south from Corinth to send General Schofield with his corps east with as little delay as possible This direction was promptly complied with and the advance of the corps reached Washington on the twenty threed of the same month whence it was sent to Fort Fisher and New Bern On the twenty sixth he was directed to send General A J Smith s command and a division of cavalry to report to General Canby By the seventh of February the whole force was en route for its destination The State of North Carolina was constituted into a military department and General Schofield assigned to command and placed under the orders of Major General Sherman The following instructions were given him CITY POINT VA January thirty one eighteen sixty five GENERAL Your movements are intended as company operative with Sherman s through the States of South and North Carolina The first point to be attained is to secure Wilmington Goldsboro will then be your objective point moving either from Wilmington or New Bern or both as you deem best Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro you will advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that place with the sea coast as near to it as you can building the road behind you The enterprise under you has two objects the first is to give General Sherman material aid if needed in his march north the second to open a base of supplies for him on his line of march As soon therefore as you can determine which of the two points Wilmington or New Bern you can best use for throwing supplies from to the interior you will commence the accumulation of twenty days rations and forage for sixty thousand men and twenty thousand animals You will get of these as many as you can house and protect to such point in the interior as you may be able to occupy I believe General Palmer has received some instructions direct from General Sherman on the subject of securing supplies for his army You will learn what steps he has taken and be governed in your requisitions accordingly A supply of ordnance stores will also be necessary Make all requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective departments in the field with me at City Point Communicate with me by every opportunity and should you deem it necessary at any time send a special boat to Fortress Monroe from which point you can communicate by telegraph The supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of those required for your own command The movements of the enemy may justify or even make it your imperative duty to cut loose from your base and strike for the interior to aid Sherman In such case you will act on your own judgment without waiting for instructions You will report however what you purpose doing The details for carrying out these instructions are necessarily left to you I would urge however if I did not know that you are already fully alive to the importance of it prompt action Sherman may be looked for in the neighborhood of Goldsboro any time from the twenty twod to the twenty eighth of February this limits your time very materially If rolling stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington it can be supplied from Washington A large force of railroad men have already been sent to Beaufort and other mechanics will go to Fort Fisher in a day or two On this point I have informed you by telegraph U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL J M SCHOFIELD Previous to giving these instructions I had visited Fort Fisher accompanied by General Schofield for the purpose of seeing for myself the condition of things and personally conferring with General Terry and Admiral Porter as to what was best to be done Anticipating the arrival of General Sherman at Savannah his army entirely foot loose Hood being then before Nashville Tennessee the Southern railroads destroyed so that it would take several months to re establish a through line from west to east and regarding the capture of Lee s army as the most important operation towards closing the rebellion I sent orders to General Sherman on the sixth of December that after establishing a base on the sea coast with necessary garrison to include all his artillery and cavalry to come by water to City Point with the balance of his command On the eighteenth of December having received information of the defeat and utter rout of Hood s army by General Thomas and that owing to the great difficulty of procuring ocean transportation it would take over two months to transport Sherman s army and doubting whether he might not contribute as much towards the desired result by operating from where he was I wrote to him to that effect and asked him for his views as to what would be best to do A few days after this I received a communication from General Sherman of date sixteenth December acknowledging the receipt of my order of the sixth and informing me of his preparations to carry it into effect as soon as he could get transportation Also that he had expected upon reducing Savannah instantly to march to Columbia South Carolina thence to Raleigh and thence to report to me but that this would consume about six weeks time after the fall of Savannah whereas by sea he could probably reach me by the middle of January The confidence he manifested in this letter of being able to march up and join me pleased me and without waiting for a reply to my letter of the eighteenth I directed him on the twenty eighth of December to make preparations to start as he proposed without delay to break up the railroads in North and South Carolina and join the armies operating against Richmond as soon as he could On the twenty first of January I informed General Sherman that I had ordered the twenty threed corps Major General Schofield commanding east that it numbered about twenty one thousand men that we had at Fort Fisher about eight thousand men at New Bern about four thousand that if Wilmington was captured General Schofield would go there if not he would be sent to New Bern that in either event all the surplus force at both points would move to the interior towards Goldsboro in company operation with his movement that from either point railroad communication could be run out and that all these troops would be subject to his orders as he came into communication with them In obedience to his instructions General Schofield proceeded to reduce Wilmington North Carolina in company operation with the navy under Admiral Porter moving his forces up both sides of the Cape Fear River Fort Anderson the enemy s main defence on the west bank of the river was occupied on the morning of the nineteenth the enemy having evacuated it after our appearance before it After fighting on twentieth and twenty first our troops entered Wilmington on the morning of the twenty twod the enemy having retreated towards Goldsboro during the night Preparations were at once made for a movement on Goldsboro in two columns one from Wilmington and the other from New Bern and to repair the railroad leading there from each place as well as to supply General Sherman by Cape Fear River towards Fayetteville if it became necessary The column from New Bern was attacked on the eighth of March at Wise s Forks and driven back with the loss of several hundred prisoners On the eleventh the enemy renewed his attack upon our intrenched position but was repulsed with severe loss and fell back during the night On the fourteenth the Neuse River was crossed and Kinston occupied and on the twenty first Goldsboro was entered The column from Wilmington reached Cox s Bridge on the Neuse River ten miles above Goldsboro on the twenty twod By the first of February General Sherman s whole army was in motion from Savannah He captured Columbia South Carolina on the seventeenth thence moved on Goldsboro North Carolina via Fayetteville reaching the latter place on the twelfth of March opening up communication with General Schofield by way of Cape Fear River On the fifteenth he resumed his march on Goldsboro He met a force of the enemy at Averysboro and after a severe fight defeated and compelled it to retreat Our loss in this engagement was about six hundred The enemy s loss was much greater On the eighteenth the combined forces of the enemy under Joe Johnston attacked his advance at Bentonville capturing three guns and driving it back upon the main body General Slocum who was in the advance ascertaining that the whole of Johnston s army was in the front arranged his troops on the defensive intrenched himself and awaited reinforcements which were pushed forward On the night of the twenty first the enemy retreated to Smithfield leaving his dead and wounded in our hands From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro which place had been occupied by General Schofield on the twenty first crossing the Neuse River ten miles above there at Cox s Bridge where General Terry had got possession and thrown a pontoon bridge on the twenty twod thus forming a junction with the columns from New Bern and Wilmington Among the important fruits of this campaign was the fall of Charleston South Carolina It was evacuated by the enemy on the night of the seventeenth of February and occupied by our forces on the eighteenth On the morning of the thirty first of January General Thomas was directed to send a cavalry expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee to penetrate South Carolina well down towards Columbia to destroy the railroads and military resources of the country and return if he was able to East Tennessee by way of Salisbury North Carolina releasing our prisoners there if possible Of the feasibility of this latter however General Stoneman was to judge Sherman s movements I had no doubt would attract the attention of all the force the enemy could collect and facilitate the execution of this General Stoneman was so late in making his start on this expedition and Sherman having passed out of the State of South Carolina on the twenty seventh of February I directed General Thomas to change his course and order him to repeat his raid of last fall destroying the railroad towards Lynchburg as far as he could This would keep him between our garrisons in East Tennessee and the enemy I regarded it not impossible that in the event of the enemy being driven from Richmond he might fall back to Lynchburg and attempt a raid north through East Tennessee On the fourteenth of February the following communication was sent to General Thomas CITY POINT VA February fourteen eighteen sixty five General Canby is preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama His force will consist of about twenty thousand men besides A J Smith s command The cavalry you have sent to Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg It with the available cavalry already in that section will move from there eastward in company operation Hood s army has been terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gave it in Tennessee by desertion consequent upon their defeat and now by the withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman I take it a large portion of the infantry has been so withdrawn It is so asserted in the Richmond papers and a member of the rebel Congress said a few days since in a speech that one half of it had been brought to South Carolina to oppose Sherman This being true or even if it is not true Canby s movement will attract all the attention of the enemy and leave the advance from your standpoint easy I think it advisable therefore that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare and hold it in readiness to go south The object would be threefold first to attract as much of the enemy s force as possible to insure success to Canby second to destroy the enemy s line of communications and military resources third to destroy or capture their forces brought into the field Tuscaloosa and Selma would probably be the points to direct the expedition against This however would not be so important as the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama Discretion should be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go where according to the information he may receive he will best secure the objects named above Now that your force has been so much depleted I do not know what number of men you can put into the field If not more than five thousand men however all cavalry I think it will be sufficient It is not desirable that you should start this expedition until the one leaving Vicksburg has been three or four days out or even a week I do not know when it will start but will inform you by telegraph as soon as I learn If you should hear through other sources before hearing from me you can act on the information received To insure success your cavalry should go with as little wagon train as possible relying upon the country for supplies I would also reduce the number of guns to a battery or the number of batteries and put the extra teams to the guns taken No guns or caissons should be taken with less than eight horses Please inform me by telegraph on receipt of this what force you think you will be able to send under these directions U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL G H THOMAS On the fifteenth he was directed to start the expedition as soon after the twentieth as he could get it off I deemed it of the utmost importance before a general movement of the armies operating against Richmond that all communications with the city north of James River should be cut off The enemy having withdrawn the bulk of his force from the Shenandoah Valley and sent it south or replaced troops sent from Richmond and desiring to reinforce Sherman if practicable whose cavalry was greatly inferior in numbers to that of the enemy I determined to make a move from the Shenandoah which if successful would accomplish the first at least and possibly the latter of the objects I therefore telegraphed General Sheridan as follows CITY POINT VA February twenty eighteen sixty five one P M GENERAL As soon as it is possible to travel I think you will have no difficulty about reaching Lynchburg with a cavalry force alone From there you could destroy the railroad and canal in every direction so as to be of no further use to the rebellion Sufficient cavalry should be left behind to look after Mosby s gang From Lynchburg if information you might get there would justify it you will strike south heading the streams in Virgina to the westward of Danville and push on and join General Sherman This additional raid with one now about starting from East Tennessee under Stoneman numbering four or give thousand cavalry one from Vicksburg numbering seven or eight thousand cavalry one from Eastport Mississippi then thousand cavalry Canby from Mobile Bay with about thirty eight thousand mixed troops these three latter pushing for Tuscaloosa Selma and Montgomery and Sherman with a large army eating out the vitals of South Carolina is all that will be wanted to leave nothing for the rebellion to stand upon I would advise you to overcome great obstacles to accomplish this Charleston was evacuated on Tuesday first U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL P H SHERIDAN On the twenty fifth I received a dispatch from General Sheridan inquiring where Sherman was aiming for and if I could give him definite information as to the points he might be expected to move on this side of Charlotte North Carolina In answer the following telegram was sent him CITY POINT VA February twenty five eighteen sixty five GENERAL Sherman s movements will depend on the amount of opposition he meets with from the enemy If strongly opposed he may possibly have to fall back to Georgetown S C and fit out for a new start I think however all danger for the necessity of going to that point has passed I believe he has passed Charlotte He may take Fayetteville on his way to Goldsboro If you reach Lynchburg you will have to be guided in your after movements by the information you obtain Before you could possibly reach Sherman I think you would find him moving from Goldsboro towards Raleigh or engaging the enemy strongly posted at one or the other of these places with railroad communications opened from his army to Wilmington or New Bern U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL P H SHERIDAN General Sheridan moved from Winchester on the twenty seventh of February with two divisions of cavalry numbering about five thousand each On the first of March he secured the bridge which the enemy attempted to destroy across the middle fork of the Shenandoah at Mount Crawford and entered Staunton on the twod the enemy having retreated to Waynesboro Thence he pushed on to Waynesboro where he found the enemy in force in an intrenched position under General Early Without stopping to make a reconnoissance an immediate attack was made the position was carried and sixteen hundred prisoners eleven pieces of artillery with horses and caissons complete two hundred wagons and teams loaded with subsistence and seventeen battle flags were captured The prisoners under an escort of fifteen hundred men were sent back to Winchester Thence he marched on Charlottesville destroying effectually the railroad and bridges as he went which place he reached on the threed Here he remained two days destroying the railroad towards Richmond and Lynchburg including the large iron bridges over the north and south forks of the Rivanna River and awaited the arrival of his trains This necessary delay caused him to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg On the morning of the sixth dividing his force into two columns he sent one to Scottsville whence it marched up the James River Canal to New Market destroying every lock and in many places the bank of the canal From here a force was pushed out from this column to Duiguidsville to obtain possession of the bridge across the James River at that place but failed The enemy burned it on our approach The enemy also burned the bridge across the river at Hardwicksville The other column moved down the railroad towards Lynchburg destroying it as far as Amherst Court House sixteen miles from Lynchburg thence across the country uniting with the column at New Market The river being very high his pontoons would not reach across it and the enemy having destroyed the bridges by which he had hoped to cross the river and get on the South Side Railroad about Farmville and destroy it to Appomattox Court House the only thing left for him was to return to Winchester or strike a base at the White House Fortunately he chose the latter From New Market he took up his line of march following the canal towards Richmond destroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks wherever practicable to a point eight miles east of Goochland concentrating the whole force at Columbia on the tenth Here he rested one day and sent through by scouts information of his whereabouts and purposes and a request for supplies to meet him at White House which reached me on the night of the twelfth An infantry force was immediately sent to get possession of White House and supplies were forwarded Moving from Columbia in a direction to threaten Richmond to near Ashland Station he crossed the Annas and after having destroyed all the bridges and many miles of the railroad proceeded down the north bank of the Pamunkey to White House which place he reached on the nineteenth Previous to this the following communication was sent to General Thomas CITY POINT VIRGINIA March seven eighteen sixty five nine point thirty A M GENERAL I think it will be advisable now for you to repair the railroad in East Tennessee and throw a good force up to Bull s Gap and fortify there Supplies at Knoxville could always be got forward as required With Bull s Gap fortified you can occupy as outposts about all of East Tennessee and be prepared if it should be required of you in the spring to make a campaign towards Lynchburg or into North Carolina I do not think Stoneman should break the road until he gets into Virginia unless it should be to cut off rolling stock that may be caught west of that U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL G H THOMAS Thus it will be seen that in March eighteen sixty five General Canby was moving an adequate force against Mobile and the army defending it under General Dick Taylor Thomas was pushing out two large and well appointed cavalry expeditions one from Middle Tennessee under Brevet Major General Wilson against the enemy s vital points in Alabama the other from East Tennessee under Major General Stoneman towards Lynchburg and assembling the remainder of his available forces preparatory to commence offensive operations from East Tennessee General Sheridan s cavalry was at White House the armies of the Potomac and James were confronting the enemy under Lee in his defences of Richmond and Petersburg General Sherman with his armies reinforced by that of General Schofield was at Goldsboro General Pope was making preparations for a spring campaign against the enemy under Kirby Smith and Price west of the Mississippi and General Hancock was concentrating a force in the vicinity of Winchester Virginia to guard against invasion or to operate offensively as might prove necessary After the long march by General Sheridan s cavalry over winter roads it was necessary to rest and refit at White House At this time the greatest source of uneasiness to me was the fear that the enemy would leave his strong lines about Petersburg and Richmond for the purpose of uniting with Johnston and before he was driven from them by battle or I was prepared to make an effectual pursuit On the twenty fourth of March General Sheridan moved from White House crossed the James River at Jones s Landing and formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac in front of Petersburg on the twenty seventh During this move General Ord sent forces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy On the twenty fourth of March the following instructions for a general movement of the armies operating against Richmond were issued CITY POINT VIRGINIA March twenty four eighteen sixty five GENERAL On the twenty ninth instant the armies operating against Richmond will be moved by our left for the double purpose of turning the enemy out of his present position around Petersburg and to insure the success of the cavalry under General Sheridan which will start at the same time in its efforts to reach and destroy the South Side and Danville railroads Two corps of the Army of the Potomac will be moved at first in two columns taking the two roads crossing Hatcher s Run nearest where the present line held by us strikes that stream both moving towards Dinwiddie Court House The cavalry under General Sheridan joined by the division now under General Davies will move at the same time by the Weldon Road and the Jerusalem Plank Road turning west from the latter before crossing the Nottoway and west with the whole column before reaching Stony Creek General Sheridan will then move independently under other instructions which will be given him All dismounted cavalry belonging to the Army of the Potomac and the dismounted cavalry from the Middle Military Division not required for guarding property belonging to their arm of service will report to Brigadier General Benham to be added to the defences of City Point Major General Parke will be left in command of all the army left for holding the lines about Petersburg and City Point subject of course to orders from the commander of the Army of the Potomac The ninth army corps will be left intact to hold the present line of works so long as the whole line now occupied by us is held If however the troops to the left of the ninth corps are withdrawn then the left of the corps may be thrown back so as to occupy the position held by the army prior to the capture of the Weldon Road All troops to the left of the ninth corps will be held in readiness to move at the shortest notice by such route as may be designated when the order is given General Ord will detach three divisions two white and one colored or so much of them as he can and hold his present lines and march for the present left of the Army of the Potomac In the absence of further orders or until further orders are given the white divisions will follow the left column of the Army of the Potomac and the colored division the right column During the movement Major General Weitzel will be left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the Army of the James The movement of troops from the Army of the James will commence on the night of the twenty seventh instant General Ord will leave behind the minimum number of cavalry necessary for picket duty in the absence of the main army A cavalry expedition from General Ord s command will also be started from Suffolk to leave there on Saturday the first of April under Colonel Sumner for the purpose of cutting the railroad about Hicksford This if accomplished will have to be a surprise and therefore from three to five hundred men will be sufficient They should however be supported by all the infantry that can be spared from Norfolk and Portsmouth as far out as to where the cavalry crosses the Blackwater The crossing should probably be at Uniten Should Colonel Sumner succeed in reaching the Weldon Road he will be instructed to do all the damage possible to the triangle of roads between Hicksford Weldon and Gaston The railroad bridge at Weldon being fitted up for the passage of carriages it might be practicable to destroy any accumulation of supplies the enemy may have collected south of the Roanoke All the troops will move with four days rations in haversacks and eight days in wagons To avoid as much hauling as possible and to give the Army of the James the same number of days supplies with the Army of the Potomac General Ord will direct his commissary and quartermaster to have sufficient supplies delivered at the terminus of the road to fill up in passing Sixty rounds of ammunition per man will be taken in wagons and as much grain as the transportation on hand will carry after taking the specified amount of other supplies The densely wooded country in which the army has to operate making the use of much artillery impracticable the amount taken with the army will be reduced to six or eight guns to each division at the option of the army commanders All necessary preparations for carrying these directions into operation may be commenced at once The reserves of the ninth corps should be massed as much as possible While I would not now order an unconditional attack on the enemy s line by them they should be ready and should make the attack if the enemy weakens his line in their front without waiting for orders In case they carry the line then the whole of the ninth corps could follow up so as to join or company operate with the balance of the army To prepare for this the ninth corps will have rations issued to them same as the balance of the army General Weitzel will keep vigilant watch upon his front and if found at all practicable to break through at any point he will do so A success north of the James should be followed up with great promptness An attack will not be feasible unless it is found that the enemy has detached largely In that case it may be regarded as evident that the enemy are relying upon their local reserves principally for the defence of Richmond Preparations may be made for abandoning all the line north of the James except inclosed works only to be abandoned however after a break is made in the lines of the enemy By these instructions a large part of the armies operating against Richmond is left behind The enemy knowing this may as an only chance strip their lines to the merest skeleton in the hope of advantage not being taken of it while they hurl everything against the moving column and return It cannot be impressed too strongly upon commanders of troops left in the trenches not to allow this to occur without taking advantage of it The very fact of the enemy coming out to attack if he does so might be regarded as almost conclusive evidence of such a weakening of his lines I would have it particularly enjoined upon corps commanders that in case of an attack from the enemy those not attacked are not to wait for orders from the commanding officer of the army to which they belong but that they will move promptly and notify the commander of their action I would also enjoin the same action on the part of division commanders when other parts of their corps are engaged In like manner I would urge the importance of following up a repulse of the enemy U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERALS MEADE ORD AND SHERIDAN Early on the morning of the twenty fifth the enemy assaulted our lines in front of the ninth corps which held from the Appomattox River towards our left and carried Fort Stedman and a part of the line to the right and left of it established themselves and turned the guns of the fort against us but our troops on either flank held their ground until the reserves were brought up when the enemy was driven back with a heavy loss in killed and wounded and one thousand nine hundred prisoners Our loss was sixty eight killed three hundred and thirty seven wounded and five hundred and six missing General Meade at once ordered the other corps to advance and feel the enemy in their respective fronts Pushing forward they captured and held the enemy s strongly intrenched picket line in front of the twod and sixth corps and eight hundred and thirty four prisoners The enemy made desperate attempts to retake this line but without success Our loss in front of these was fifty two killed eight hundred and sixty four wounded and two hundred and seven missing The enemy s loss in killed and wounded was far greater General Sherman having got his troops all quietly in camp about Goldsboro and his preparations for furnishing supplies to them perfected visited me at City Point on the twenty seventh of March and stated that he would be ready to move as he had previously written me by the tenth of April fully equipped and rationed for twenty days if it should become necessary to bring his command to bear against Lee s army in company operation with our forces in front of Richmond and Petersburg General Sherman proposed in this movement to threaten Raleigh and then by turning suddenly to the right reach the Roanoke at Gaston or thereabouts whence he could move on to the Richmond and Danville Railroad striking it in the vicinity of Burkesville or join the armies operating against Richmond as might be deemed best This plan he was directed to carry into execution if he received no further directions in the meantime I explained to him the movement I had ordered to commence on the twenty ninth of March That if it should not prove as entirely successful as I hoped I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy the Danville and South Side railroads and thus deprive the enemy of further supplies and also to prevent the rapid concentration of Lee s and Johnston s armies I had spent days of anxiety lest each morning should bring the report that the enemy had retreated the night before I was firmly convinced that Sherman s crossing the Roanoke would be the signal for Lee to leave With Johnston and him combined a long tedious and expensive campaign consuming most of the summer might become necessary By moving out I would put the army in better condition for pursuit and would at least by the destruction of the Danville Road retard the concentration of the two armies of Lee and Johnston and cause the enemy to abandon much material that he might otherwise save I therefore determined not to delay the movement ordered On the night of the twenty seventh Major General Ord with two divisions of the twenty fourth corps Major General Gibbon commanding and one division of the twenty fifth corps Brigadier General Birney commanding and MacKenzie s cavalry took up his line of march in pursuance of the foregoing instructions and reached the position assigned him near Hatcher s Run on the morning of the twenty ninth On the twenty eighth the following instructions were given to General Sheridan CITY POINT VA March twenty eight eighteen sixty five GENERAL The fifth army corps will move by the Vaughn Road at three A M to morrow morning The twod moves at about nine A M having but about three miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on the right of the fifth corps after the latter reaching Dinwiddie Court House Move your cavalry at as early an hour as you can and without being confined to any particular road or roads You may go out by the nearest roads in rear of the fifth corps pass by its left and passing near to or through Dinwiddie reach the right and rear of the enemy as soon as you can It is not the intention to attack the enemy in his intrenched position but to force him out if possible Should he come out and attack us or get himself where he can be attacked move in with your entire force in your own way and with the full reliance that the army will engage or follow as circumstances will dictate I shall be on the field and will probably be able to communicate with you Should I not do so and you find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenched line you may cut loose and push for the Danville Road If you find it practicable I would like you to cross the South Side Road between Petersburg and Burkesville and destroy it to some extent I would not advise much detention however until you reach the Danville Road which I would like you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible Make your destruction on that road as complete as possible You can then pass on to the South Side Road west of Burkesville and destroy that in like manner After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads which are now the only avenues of supply to Lee s army you may return to this army selecting your road further south or you may go on into North Carolina and join General Sherman Should you select the latter course get the information to me as early as possible so that I may send orders to meet you at Goldsboro U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL P H SHERIDAN On the morning of the twenty ninth the movement commenced At night the cavalry was at Dinwiddie Court House and the left of our infantry line extended to the Quaker Road near its intersection with the Boydton Plank Road The position of the troops from left to right was as follows Sheridan Warren Humphreys Ord Wright Parke Everything looked favorable to the defeat of the enemy and the capture of Petersburg and Richmond if the proper effort was made I therefore addressed the following communication to General Sheridan having previously informed him verbally not to cut loose for the raid contemplated in his orders until he received notice from me to do so GRAVELLY CREEK March twenty nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to Dinwiddie We are all ready however to give up all from the Jerusalem Plank Road to Hatcher s Run whenever the forces can be used advantageously After getting into line south of Hatcher s we pushed forward to find the enemy s position General Griffin was attacked near where the Quaker Road intersects the Boydton Road but repulsed it easily capturing about one hundred men Humphreys reached Dabney s Mill and was pushing on when last heard from I now feel like ending the matter if it is possible to do so before going back I do not want you therefore to cut loose and go after the enemy s roads at present In the morning push around the enemy if you can and get on to his right rear The movements of the enemy s cavalry may of course modify your action We will act all together as one army here until it is seen what can be done with the enemy The signal officer at Cobb s Hill reported at half past eleven A M that a cavalry column had passed that point from Richmond towards Petersburg taking forty minutes to pass U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL P H SHERIDAN From the night of the twenty ninth to the morning of the thirty first the rain fell in such torrents as to make it impossible to move a wheeled vehicle except as corduroy roads were laid in front of them During the thirtieth Sheridan advanced from Dinwiddie Court House towards Five Forks where he found the enemy in full force General Warren advanced and extended his line across the Boydton Plank Road to near the White Oak Road with a view of getting across the latter but finding the enemy strong in his front and extending beyond his left was directed to hold on where he was and fortify General Humphreys drove the enemy from his front into his main line on the Hatcher near Burgess s Mills Generals Ord Wright and Parke made examinations in their fronts to determine the feasibility of an assault on the enemy s lines The two latter reported favorably The enemy confronting us as he did at every point from Richmond to our extreme left I conceived his lines must be weakly held and could be penetrated if my estimate of his forces was correct I determined therefore to extend our line no farther but to reinforce General Sheridan with a corps of infantry and thus enable him to cut loose and turn the enemy s right flank and with the other corps assault the enemy s lines The result of the offensive effort of the enemy the week before when he assaulted Fort Stedman particularly favored this The enemy s intrenched picket line captured by us at that time threw the lines occupied by the belligerents so close together at some points that it was but a moment s run from one to the other Preparations were at once made to relieve General Humphreys s corps to report to General Sheridan but the condition of the roads prevented immediate movement On the morning of the thirty first General Warren reported favorably to getting possession of the White Oak Road and was directed to do so To accomplish this he moved with one division instead of his whole corps which was attacked by the enemy in superior force and driven back on the twod division before it had time to form and it in turn forced back upon the threed division when the enemy was checked A division of the twod corps was immediately sent to his support the enemy driven back with heavy loss and possession of the White Oak Road gained Sheridan advanced and with a portion of his cavalry got possession of the Five Forks but the enemy after the affair with the fifth corps reinforced the rebel cavalry defending that point with infantry and forced him back towards Dinwiddie Court House Here General Sheridan displayed great generalship Instead of retreating with his whole command on the main army to tell the story of superior forces encountered he deployed his cavalry on foot leaving only mounted men enough to take charge of the horses This compelled the enemy to deploy over a vast extent of wooded and broken country and made his progress slow At this juncture he dispatched to me what had taken place and that he was dropping back slowly on Dinwiddie Court House General Mackenzie s cavalry and one division of the fifth corps were immediately ordered to his assistance Soon after receiving a report from General Meade that Humphreys could hold our position on the Boydton Road and that the other two divisions of the fifth corps could go to Sheridan they were so ordered at once Thus the operations of the day necessitated the sending of Warren because of his accessibility instead of Humphreys as was intended and precipitated intended movements On the morning of the first of April General Sheridan reinforced by General Warren drove the enemy back on Five Forks where late in the evening he assaulted and carried his strongly fortified position capturing all his artillery and between five and six thousand prisoners About the close of this battle Brevet Major General Charles Griffin relieved Major General Warren in command of the fifth corps The report of this reached me after nightfall Some apprehensions filled my mind lest the enemy might desert his lines during the night and by falling upon General Sheridan before assistance could reach him drive him from his position and open the way for retreat To guard against this General Miles s division of Humphreys s corps was sent to reinforce him and a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four o clock in the morning April two when an assault was ordered on the enemy s lines General Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps sweeping everything before him and to his left towards Hatcher s Run capturing many guns and several thousand prisoners He was closely followed by two divisions of General Ord s command until he met the other division of General Ord s that had succeeded in forcing the enemy s lines near Hatcher s Run Generals Wright and Ord immediately swung to the right and closed all of the enemy on that side of them in Petersburg while General Humphreys pushed forward with two divisions and joined General Wright on the left General Parke succeeded in carrying the enemy s main line capturing guns and prisoners but was unable to carry his inner line General Sheridan being advised of the condition of affairs returned General Miles to his proper command On reaching the enemy s lines immediately surrounding Petersburg a portion of General Gibbon s corps by a most gallant charge captured two strong inclosed works the most salient and commanding south of Petersburg thus materially shortening the line of investment necessary for taking in the city The enemy south of Hatcher s Run retreated westward to Sutherland s Station where they were overtaken by Miles s division A severe engagement ensued and lasted until both his right and left flanks were threatened by the approach of General Sheridan who was moving from Ford s Station towards Petersburg and a division sent by General Meade from the front of Petersburg when he broke in the utmost confusion leaving in our hands his guns and many prisoners This force retreated by the main road along the Appomattox River During the night of the twod the enemy evacuated Petersburg and Richmond and retreated towards Danville On the morning of the threed pursuit was commenced General Sheridan pushed for the Danville Road keeping near the Appomattox followed by General Meade with the twod and sixth corps while General Ord moved for Burkesville along the South Side Road the ninth corps stretched along that road behind him On the fourth General Sheridan struck the Danville Road near Jetersville where he learned that Lee was at Amelia Court House He immediately intrenched himself and awaited the arrival of General Meade who reached there the next day General Ord reached Burkesville on the evening of the fifth On the morning of the fifth I addressed Major General Sherman the following communication WILSON S STATION April five eighteen sixty five GENERAL All indications now are that Lee will attempt to reach Danville with the remnant of his force Sheridan who was up with him last night reports all that is left horse foot and dragoons at twenty thousand much demoralized We hope to reduce this number one half I shall push on to Burkesville and if a stand is made at Danville will in a very few days go there If you can possibly do so push on from where you are and let us see if we cannot finish the job with Lee s and Johnston s armies Whether it will be better for you to strike for Greensboro or nearer to Danville you will be better able to judge when you receive this Rebel armies now are the only strategic points to strike at U S GRANT Lieutenant General MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN On the morning of the sixth it was found that General Lee was moving west of Jetersville towards Danville General Sheridan moved with his cavalry the fifth corps having been returned to General Meade on his reaching Jetersville to strike his flank followed by the sixth corps while the twod and fifth corps pressed hard after forcing him to abandon several hundred wagons and several pieces of artillery General Ord advanced from Burkesville towards Farmville sending two regiments of infantry and a squadron of cavalry under Brevet Brigadier General Theodore Read to reach and destroy the bridges This advance met the head of Lee s column near Farmville which it heroically attacked and detained until General Read was killed and his small force overpowered This caused a delay in the enemy s movements and enabled General Ord to get well up with the remainder of his force on meeting which the enemy immediately intrenched himself In the afternoon General Sheridan struck the enemy south of Sailors Creek captured sixteen pieces of artillery and about four hundred wagons and detained him until the sixth corps got up when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was made which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand prisoners among whom were many general officers The movements of the twod corps and General Ord s command contributed greatly to the day s success On the morning of the seventh the pursuit was renewed the cavalry except one division and the fifth corps moving by Prince Edward s Court House the sixth corps General Ord s command and one division of cavalry on Farmville and the twod corps by the High Bridge Road It was soon found that the enemy had crossed to the north side of the Appomattox but so close was the pursuit that the twod corps got possession of the common bridge at High Bridge before the enemy could destroy it and immediately crossed over The sixth corps and a division of cavalry crossed at Farmville to its support Feeling now that General Lee s chance of escape was utterly hopeless I addressed him the following communication from Farmville April seven eighteen sixty five GENERAL The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in this struggle I feel that it is so and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of Northern Virginia U S GRANT Lieutenant General GENERAL R E LEE Early on the morning of the eighth before leaving I received at Farmville the following April seven eighteen sixty five GENERAL I have received your note of this date Though not entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood and therefore before considering your proposition ask the terms you will offer on condition of its surrender R E LEE General LIEUTENANT GENERAL U S GRANT To this I immediately replied April eight eighteen sixty five GENERAL Your note of last evening in reply to mine of same date asking the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia is just received In reply I would say that peace being my great desire there is but one condition I would insist upon namely That the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified for taking up arms again against the Government of the United States until properly exchanged I will meet you or will designate officers to meet any officers you may name for the same purpose at any point agreeable to you for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which the surrender of the Army of the Northern Virginia will be received U S GRANT Lieutenant General GENERAL R E LEE Early on the morning of the eighth the pursuit was resumed General Meade followed north of the Appomattox and General Sheridan with all the cavalry pushed straight ahead for Appomattox Station followed by General Ord s command and the fifth corps During the day General Meade s advance had considerable fighting with the enemy s rear guard but was unable to bring on a general engagement Late in the evening General Sheridan struck the railroad at Appomattox Station drove the enemy from there and captured twenty five pieces of artillery a hospital train and four trains of cars loaded with supplies for Lee s army During this day I accompanied General Meade s column and about midnight received the following communication from General Lee April eight eighteen sixty five GENERAL I received at a late hour your note of to day In mine of yesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia but to ask the terms of your proposition To be frank I do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrender of this army but as the restoration of peace should be the sole object of all I desired to know whether your proposals would lead to that end I cannot therefore meet you with a view to the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia but as far as your proposal may affect the Confederate States forces under my command and tend to the restoration of peace I should be pleased to meet you at ten A M to morrow on the old stage road to Richmond between the picket lines of the two armies R E LEE General LIEUTENANT GENERAL U S GRANT Early on the morning of the ninth I returned him an answer as follows and immediately started to join the column south of the Appomattox April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL Your note of yesterday is received I have no authority to treat on the subject of peace the meeting proposed for ten A M to day could lead to no good I will state however general that I am equally anxious for peace with yourself and the whole North entertains the same feeling The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood By the South laying down their arms they will hasten that most desirable event save thousands of human lives and hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed Seriously hoping that all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life I subscribe myself et cetera U S GRANT Lieutenant General GENERAL R E LEE On this morning of the ninth General Ord s command and the fifth corps reached Appomattox Station just as the enemy was making a desperate effort to break through our cavalry The infantry was at once thrown in Soon after a white flag was received requesting a suspension of hostilities pending negotiations for a surrender Before reaching General Sheridan s headquarters I received the following from General Lee April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL I received your note of this morning on the picket line whither I had come to meet you and ascertain definitely what terms were embraced in your proposal of yesterday with reference to the surrender of this army I now ask an interview in accordance with the offer contained in your letter of yesterday for that purpose R E LEE General LIEUTENANT GENERAL U S GRANT The interview was held at Appomattox Court House the result of which is set forth in the following correspondence APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE Virginia April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the eighth instant I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on the following terms to wit Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate one copy to be given to an officer to be designated by me the other to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the United States until properly exchanged and each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the men of their commands The arms artillery and public property to be parked and stacked and turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them This will not embrace the side arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage This done each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home not to be disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside U S GRANT Lieutenant General GENERAL R E LEE HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA April nine eighteen sixty five GENERAL I have received your letter of this date containing the terms of surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the eighth instant they are accepted I will proceed to designate the proper officers to carry the stipulations into effect R E LEE General LIEUTENANT GENERAL U S GRANT The command of Major General Gibbon the fifth army corps under Griffin and Mackenzie s cavalry were designated to remain at Appomattox Court House until the paroling of the surrendered army was completed and to take charge of the public property The remainder of the army immediately returned to the vicinity of Burkesville General Lee s great influence throughout the whole South caused his example to be followed and to day the result is that the armies lately under his leadership are at their homes desiring peace and quiet and their arms are in the hands of our ordnance officers On the receipt of my letter of the fifth General Sherman moved directly against Joe Johnston who retreated rapidly on and through Raleigh which place General Sherman occupied on the morning of the thirteenth The day preceding news of the surrender of General Lee reached him at Smithfield On the fourteenth a correspondence was opened between General Sherman and General Johnston which resulted on the eighteenth in an agreement for a suspension of hostilities and a memorandum or basis for peace subject to the approval of the President This agreement was disapproved by the President on the twenty first which disapproval together with your instructions was communicated to General Sherman by me in person on the morning of the twenty fourth at Raleigh North Carolina in obedience to your orders Notice was at once given by him to General Johnston for the termination of the truce that had been entered into On the twenty fifth another meeting between them was agreed upon to take place on the twenty sixth which terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston s army upon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee The expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got off on the twentieth of March moving by way of Boone North Carolina and struck the railroad at Wytheville Chambersburg and Big Lick The force striking it at Big Lick pushed on to within a few miles of Lynchburg destroying the important bridges while with the main force he effectually destroyed it between New River and Big Lick and then turned for Greensboro on the North Carolina Railroad struck that road and destroyed the bridges between Danville and Greensboro and between Greensboro and the Yadkin together with the depots of supplies along it and captured four hundred prisoners At Salisbury he attacked and defeated a force of the enemy under General Gardiner capturing fourteen pieces of artillery and one thousand three hundred and sixty four prisoners and destroyed large amounts of army stores At this place he destroyed fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges towards Charlotte Thence he moved to Slatersville General Canby who had been directed in January to make preparations for a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and the interior of Alabama commenced his movement on the twentieth of March The sixteenth corps Major General A J Smith commanding moved from Fort Gaines by water to Fish River the thirteenth corps under Major General Gordon Granger moved from Fort Morgan and joined the sixteenth corps on Fish River both moving thence on Spanish Fort and investing it on the twenty seventh while Major General Steele s command moved from Pensacola cut the railroad leading from Tensas to Montgomery effected a junction with them and partially invested Fort Blakely After a severe bombardment of Spanish Fort a part of its line was carried on the eighth of April During the night the enemy evacuated the fort Fort Blakely was carried by assault on the ninth and many prisoners captured our loss was considerable These successes practically opened to us the Alabama River and enabled us to approach Mobile from the north On the night of the eleventh the city was evacuated and was taken possession of by our forces on the morning of the twelfth The expedition under command of Brevet Major General Wilson consisting of twelve thousand five hundred mounted men was delayed by rains until March twenty twod when it moved from Chickasaw Alabama On the first of April General Wilson encountered the enemy in force under Forrest near Ebenezer Church drove him in confusion captured three hundred prisoners and three guns and destroyed the central bridge over the Cahawba River On the twod he attacked and captured the fortified city of Selma defended by Forrest with seven thousand men and thirty two guns destroyed the arsenal armory naval foundry machine shops vast quantities of stores and captured three thousand prisoners On the fourth he captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa On the tenth he crossed the Alabama River and after sending information of his operations to General Canby marched on Montgomery which place he occupied on the fourteenth the enemy having abandoned it At this place many stores and five steamboats fell into our hands Thence a force marched direct on Columbus and another on West Point both of which places were assaulted and captured on the sixteenth At the former place we got one thousand five hundred prisoners and fifty two field guns destroyed two gunboats the navy yard foundries arsenal many factories and much other public property At the latter place we got three hundred prisoners four guns and destroyed nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars On the twentieth he took possession of Macon Georgia with sixty field guns one thousand two hundred militia and five generals surrendered by General Howell Cobb General Wilson hearing that Jeff Davis was trying to make his escape sent forces in pursuit and succeeded in capturing him on the morning of May eleventh On the fourth day of May General Dick Taylor surrendered to General Canby all the remaining rebel forces east of the Mississippi A force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy under Kirby Smith west of the Mississippi was immediately put in motion for Texas and Major General Sheridan designated for its immediate command but on the twenty sixth day of May and before they reached their destination General Kirby Smith surrendered his entire command to Major General Canby This surrender did not take place however until after the capture of the rebel President and Vice President and the bad faith was exhibited of first disbanding most of his army and permitting an indiscriminate plunder of public property Owing to the report that many of those lately in arms against the government had taken refuge upon the soil of Mexico carrying with them arms rightfully belonging to the United States which had been surrendered to us by agreement among them some of the leaders who had surrendered in person and the disturbed condition of affairs on the Rio Grande the orders for troops to proceed to Texas were not changed There have been severe combats raids expeditions and movements to defeat the designs and purposes of the enemy most of them reflecting great credit on our arms and which contributed greatly to our final triumph that I have not mentioned Many of these will be found clearly set forth in the reports herewith submitted some in the telegrams and brief dispatches announcing them and others I regret to say have not as yet been officially reported For information touching our Indian difficulties I would respectfully refer to the reports of the commanders of departments in which they have occurred It has been my fortune to see the armies of both the West and the East fight battles and from what I have seen I know there is no difference in their fighting qualities All that it was possible for men to do in battle they have done The Western armies commenced their battles in the Mississippi Valley and received the final surrender of the remnant of the principal army opposed to them in North Carolina The armies of the East commenced their battles on the river from which the Army of the Potomac derived its name and received the final surrender of their old antagonists at Appomattox Court House Virginia The splendid achievements of each have nationalized our victories removed all sectional jealousies of which we have unfortunately experienced too much and the cause of crimination and recrimination that might have followed had either section failed in its duty All have a proud record and all sections can well congratulate themselves and each other for having done their full share in restoring the supremacy of law over every foot of territory belonging to the United States Let them hope for perpetual peace and harmony with that enemy whose manhood however mistaken the cause drew forth such herculean deeds of valor I have the honor to be Very respectfully your obedient servant U S GRANT Lieutenant General THE END FOOTNOTES one Afterwards General Gardner C S A two General Garland expressed a wish to get a message back to General Twiggs his division commander or General Taylor to the effect that he was nearly out of ammunition and must have more sent to him or otherwise be reinforced Deeming the return dangerous he did not like to order any one to carry it so he called for a volunteer Lieutenant Grant offered his services which were accepted PUBLISHERS three Mentioned in the reports of Major Lee Colonel Garland and General Worth PUBLISHERS four NOTE It had been a favorite idea with General Scott for a great many years before the Mexican war to have established in the United States a soldiers home patterned after something of the kind abroad particularly I believe in France He recommended this uniformly or at least frequently in his annual reports to the Secretary of War but never got any hearing Now as he had conquered the state he made assessments upon the different large towns and cities occupied by our troops in proportion to their capacity to pay and appointed officers to receive the money In addition to the sum thus realized he had derived through capture at Cerro Gordo sales of captured government tobacco et cetera sums which swelled the fund to a total of about two hundred twenty thousand dollars Portions of this fund were distributed among the rank and file given to the wounded in hospital or applied in other ways leaving a balance of some one hundred eighteen thousand dollars remaining unapplied at the close of the war After the war was over and the troops all home General Scott applied to have this money which had never been turned into the Treasury of the United States expended in establishing such homes as he had previously recommended This fund was the foundation of the Soldiers Home at Washington City and also one at Harrodsburgh Kentucky The latter went into disuse many years ago In fact it never had many soldiers in it and was I believe finally sold five The Mexican war made three presidential candidates Scott Taylor and Pierce and any number of aspirants for that high office It made also governors of States members of the cabinet foreign ministers and other officers of high rank both in state and nation The rebellion which contained more war in a single day at some critical periods than the whole Mexican war in two years has not been so fruitful of political results to those engaged on the Union side On the other side the side of the South nearly every man who holds office of any sort whatever either in the state or in the nation was a Confederate soldier but this is easily accounted for from the fact that the South was a military camp and there were very few people of a suitable age to be in the army who were not in it six C B Lagow the others not yet having joined me seven NOTE Since writing this chapter I have received from missus W H L Wallace widow of the gallant general who was killed in the first day s fight on the field of Shiloh a letter from General Lew Wallace to him dated the morning of the fifth At the date of this letter it was well known that the Confederates had troops out along the Mobile Ohio railroad west of Crump s landing and Pittsburg landing and were also collecting near Shiloh This letter shows that at that time General Lew Wallace was making preparations for the emergency that might happen for the passing of reinforcements between Shiloh and his position extending from Crump s landing westward and he sends it over the road running from Adamsville to the Pittsburg landing and Purdy road These two roads intersect nearly a mile west of the crossing of the latter over Owl Creek where our right rested In this letter General Lew Wallace advises General W H L Wallace that he will send to morrow and his letter also says April fifth which is the same day the letter was dated and which therefore must have been written on the fourth some cavalry to report to him at his headquarters and suggesting the propriety of General W H L Wallace s sending a company back with them for the purpose of having the cavalry at the two landings familiarize themselves with the road so that they could act promptly in case of emergency as guides to and from the different camps This modifies very materially what I have said and what has been said by others of the conduct of General Lew Wallace at the battle of Shiloh It shows that he naturally with no more experience than he had at the time in the profession of arms would take the particular road that he did start upon in the absence of orders to move by a different road The mistake he made and which probably caused his apparent dilatoriness was that of advancing some distance after he found that the firing which would be at first directly to his front and then off to the left had fallen back until it had got very much in rear of the position of his advance This falling back had taken place before I sent General Wallace orders to move up to Pittsburg landing and naturally my order was to follow the road nearest the river But my order was verbal and to a staff officer who was to deliver it to General Wallace so that I am not competent to say just what order the General actually received General Wallace s division was stationed the First brigade at Crump s landing the Second out two miles and the Third two and a half miles out Hearing the sounds of battle General Wallace early ordered his First and Third brigades to concentrate on the Second If the position of our front had not changed the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road U S GRANT MOUNT MACGREGOR NEW YORK June twenty one eighteen eighty five eight NOTE In an article on the battle of Shiloh which I wrote for the Century Magazine I stated that General A McD McCook who commanded a division of Buell s army expressed some unwillingness to pursue the enemy on Monday April seventh because of the condition of his troops General Badeau in his history also makes the same statement on my authority Out of justice to General McCook and his command I must say that they left a point twenty two miles east of Savannah on the morning of the sixth From the heavy rains of a few days previous and the passage of trains and artillery the roads were necessarily deep in mud which made marching slow The division had not only marched through this mud the day before but it had been in the rain all night without rest It was engaged in the battle of the second day and did as good service as its position allowed In fact an opportunity occurred for it to perform a conspicuous act of gallantry which elicited the highest commendation from division commanders in the Army of the Tennessee General Sherman both in his memoirs and report makes mention of this fact General McCook himself belongs to a family which furnished many volunteers to the army I refer to these circumstances with minuteness because I did General McCook injustice in my article in the Century though not to the extent one would suppose from the public press I am not willing to do any one an injustice and if convinced that I have done one I am always willing to make the fullest admission nine NOTE For gallantry in the various engagements from the time I was left in command down to twenty sixth of October and on my recommendation Generals McPherson and C S Hamilton were promoted to be Major Generals and Colonels C C Marsh twentieth Illinois M M Crocker thirteenth Iowa J A Mower eleventh Missouri M D Leggett seventy eighth Ohio J D Stevenson seventh Missouri and John E Smith forty fifth Illinois to be Brigadiers ten Colonel Ellet reported having attacked a Confederate battery on the Red River two days before with one of his boats the De Soto Running aground he was obliged to abandon his vessel However he reported that he set fire to her and blew her up Twenty of his men fell into the hands of the enemy With the balance he escaped on the small captured steamer the New Era and succeeded in passing the batteries at Grand Gulf and reaching the vicinity of Vicksburg eleven One of Colonel Ellet s vessels which had run the blockade on February the twod and been sunk in the Red River twelve NOTE On this occasion Governor Richard Yates of Illinois happened to be on a visit to the army and accompanied me to Carthage I furnished an ambulance for his use and that of some of the State officers who accompanied him thirteen NOTE When General Sherman first learned of the move I proposed to make he called to see me about it I recollect that I had transferred my headquarters from a boat in the river to a house a short distance back from the levee I was seated on the piazza engaged in conversation with my staff when Sherman came up After a few moments conversation he said that he would like to see me alone We passed into the house together and shut the door after us Sherman then expressed his alarm at the move I had ordered saying that I was putting myself in a position voluntarily which an enemy would be glad to manoeuvre a year or a long time to get me in I was going into the enemy s country with a large river behind me and the enemy holding points strongly fortified above and below He said that it was an axiom in war that when any great body of troops moved against an enemy they should do so from a base of supplies which they would guard as they would the apple of the eye et cetera He pointed out all the difficulties that might be encountered in the campaign proposed and stated in turn what would be the true campaign to make This was in substance to go back until high ground could be reached on the east bank of the river fortify there and establish a depot of supplies and move from there being always prepared to fall back upon it in case of disaster I said this would take us back to Memphis Sherman then said that was the very place he would go to and would move by railroad from Memphis to Grenada repairing the road as we advanced To this I replied the country is already disheartened over the lack of success on the part of our armies the last election went against the vigorous prosecution of the war voluntary enlistments had ceased throughout most of the North and conscription was already resorted to and if we went back so far as Memphis it would discourage the people so much that bases of supplies would be of no use neither men to hold them nor supplies to put in them would be furnished The problem for us was to move forward to a decisive victory or our cause was lost No progress was being made in any other field and we had to go on Sherman wrote to my adjutant general Colonel J A Rawlins embodying his views of the campaign that should be made and asking him to advise me to at least get the views of my generals upon the subject Colonel Rawlins showed me the letter but I did not see any reason for changing my plans The letter was not answered and the subject was not subsequently mentioned between Sherman and myself to the end of the war that I remember of I did not regard the letter as official and consequently did not preserve it General Sherman furnished a copy himself to General Badeau who printed it in his history of my campaigns I did not regard either the conversation between us or the letter to my adjutant general as protests but simply friendly advice which the relations between us fully justified Sherman gave the same energy to make the campaign a success that he would or could have done if it had been ordered by himself I make this statement here to correct an impression which was circulated at the close of the war to Sherman s prejudice and for which there was no fair foundation fourteen Meant Edward s Station fifteen CHATTANOOGA November eighteen eighteen sixty three MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN Enclosed herewith I send you copy of instructions to Major General Thomas You having been over the ground in person and having heard the whole matter discussed further instructions will not be necessary for you It is particularly desirable that a force should be got through to the railroad between Cleveland and Dalton and Longstreet thus cut off from communication with the South but being confronted by a large force here strongly located it is not easy to tell how this is to be effected until the result of our first effort is known I will add however what is not shown in my instructions to Thomas that a brigade of cavalry has been ordered here which if it arrives in time will be thrown across the Tennessee above Chickamauga and may be able to make the trip to Cleveland or thereabouts U S GRANT major general l CHATTANOOGA November eighteen eighteen sixty three MAJOR GENERAL GEO H THOMAS Chattanooga All preparations should be made for attacking the enemy s position on Missionary Ridge by Saturday at daylight Not being provided with a map giving names of roads spurs of the mountains and other places such definite instructions cannot be given as might be desirable However the general plan you understand is for Sherman with the force brought with him strengthened by a division from your command to effect a crossing of the Tennessee River just below the mouth of Chickamauga his crossing to be protected by artillery from the heights on the north bank of the river to be located by your chief of artillery and to secure the heights on the northern extremity to about the railroad tunnel before the enemy can concentrate against him You will company operate with Sherman The troops in Chattanooga Valley should be well concentrated on your left flank leaving only the necessary force to defend fortifications on the right and centre and a movable column of one division in readiness to move wherever ordered This division should show itself as threateningly as possible on the most practicable line for making an attack up the valley Your effort then will be to form a junction with Sherman making your advance well towards the northern end of Missionary Ridge and moving as near simultaneously with him as possible The junction once formed and the ridge carried communications will be at once established between the two armies by roads on the south bank of the river Further movements will then depend on those of the enemy Lookout Valley I think will be easily held by Geary s division and what troops you may still have there belonging to the old Army of the Cumberland Howard s corps can then be held in readiness to act either with you at Chattanooga or with Sherman It should be marched on Friday night to a position on the north side of the river not lower down than the first pontoon bridge and there held in readiness for such orders as may become necessary All these troops will be provided with two days cooked rations in haversacks and one hundred rounds of ammunition on the person of each infantry soldier Special care should be taken by all officers to see that ammunition is not wasted or unnecessarily fired away You will call on the engineer department for such preparations as you may deem necessary for carrying your infantry and artillery over the creek U S GRANT Major General

cooperation Your command will either carry the rifle pits and ridge directly in front of them or move to the left as the presence of the enemy may require If Hooker s position on the mountain cannot be maintained with a small force and it is found impracticable to carry the top from where he is it would be advisable for him to move up the valley with all the force he can spare and ascend by the

WASHINGTON D C April four eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL W T SHERMAN Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi GENERAL It is my design if the enemy keep quiet and allow me to take the initiative in the spring campaign to work all parts of the army together and somewhat towards a common centre For your information I now write you my programme as at present determined upon I have sent orders to Banks by private messenger to finish up his present expedition against Shreveport with all dispatch to turn over the defence of Red River to General Steele and the navy and to return your troops to you and his own to New Orleans to abandon all of Texas except the Rio Grande and to hold that with not to exceed four thousand men to reduce the number of troops on the Mississippi to the lowest number necessary to hold it and to collect from his command not less than twenty five thousand men To this I will add five thousand men from Missouri With this force he is to commence operations against Mobile as soon as he can It will be impossible for him to commence too early Gillmore joins Butler with ten thousand men and the two operate against Richmond from the south side of the James River This will give Butler thirty three thousand men to operate with W F Smith commanding the right wing of his forces and Gillmore the left wing I will stay with the Army of the Potomac increased by Burnside s corps of not less than twenty five thousand effective men and operate directly against Lee s army wherever it may be found Sigel collects all his available force in two columns one under Ord and Averell to start from Beverly Virginia and the other under Crook to start from Charleston on the Kanawha to move against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Crook will have all cavalry and will endeavor to get in about Saltville and move east from there to join Ord His force will be all cavalry while Ord will have from ten to twelve thousand men of all arms You I propose to move against Johnston s army to break it up and to get into the interior of the enemy s country as far as you can inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign but simply lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave you free to execute it in your own way Submit to me however as early as you can your plan of operations As stated Banks is ordered to commence operations as soon as he can Gillmore is ordered to report at Fortress Monroe by the eighteenth inst or as soon thereafter as practicable Sigel is concentrating now None will move from their places of rendezvous until I direct except Banks I want to be ready to move by the twenty fifth inst if possible But all I can now direct is that you get ready as soon as possible I know you will have difficulties to encounter in getting through the mountains to where supplies are abundant but I believe you will accomplish it From the expedition from the Department of West Virginia I do not calculate on very great results but it is the only way I can take troops from there With the long line of railroad Sigel has to protect he can spare no troops except to move directly to his front In this way he must get through to inflict great damage on the enemy or the enemy must detach from one of his armies a large force to prevent it In other words if Sigel can t skin himself he can hold a leg while some one else skins I am general very respectfully your obedient servant U S GRANT Lieutenant General twenty four See instructions to Butler in General Grant s report Appendix twenty five IN FIELD CULPEPER C H VA April nine eighteen sixty four major GENERAL GEO G MEADE Com d g Army of the Potomac For information and as instruction to govern your preparations for the coming campaign the following is communicated confidentially for your own perusal alone So far as practicable all the armies are to move together and towards one common centre Banks has been instructed to turn over the guarding of the Red River to General Steele and the navy to abandon Texas with the exception of the Rio Grande and to concentrate all the force he can not less than twenty five thousand men to move on Mobile This he is to do without reference to other movements From the scattered condition of his command however he cannot possibly get it together to leave New Orleans before the first of May if so soon Sherman will move at the same time you do or two or three days in advance Jo Johnston s army being his objective point and the heart of Georgia his ultimate aim If successful he will secure the line from Chattanooga to Mobile with the aid of Banks Sigel cannot spare troops from his army to reinforce either of the great armies but he can aid them by moving directly to his front This he has been directed to do and is now making preparations for it Two columns of his command will make south at the same time with the general move one from Beverly from ten to twelve thousand strong under Major General Ord the other from Charleston Va principally cavalry under Brig General Crook The former of these will endeavor to reach the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad about south of Covington and if found practicable will work eastward to Lynchburg and return to its base by way of the Shenandoah Valley or join you The other will strike at Saltville Va and come eastward to join Ord The cavalry from Ord s command will try tributaries would furnish us an easy line over which to bring all supplies to within easy hauling distance of every position the army could occupy from the Rapidan to the James River But Lee could if he chose detach or move his whole army north on a line rather interior to the one I would have to take in following A movement by his left our right would obviate this but all that was done would have to be done with the supplies and ammunition we started with All idea of adopting this latter plan was abandoned when the limited quantity of supplies possible to take with us was considered The country over which we would have to pass was so exhausted of all food or forage that we would be obliged to carry everything with us While these preparations were going on the enemy was not entirely idle In the West Forrest made a raid in West Tennessee up to the northern border capturing the garrison of four or five hundred men at Union City and followed it up by an attack on Paducah Kentucky on the banks of the Ohio While he was able to enter the city he failed to capture the forts or any part of the garrison On the first intelligence of Forrest s raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against him and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself into Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him before he got my order Forrest however fell back rapidly and attacked the troops at Fort Pillow a station for the protection of the navigation of the Mississippi River The garrison to force a passage southward if they are successful in reaching the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to cut the main lines of the road connecting Richmond with all the South and South west Gillmore will join Butler with about ten thousand men from South Carolina Butler can reduce his garrison so as to take twenty three thousand men into the field directly to his front The force will be commanded by major General W F Smith With Smith and Gillmore Butler will seize City Point and operate against Richmond from the south side of the river His movement will be simultaneous with yours Lee s army will be your objective point Wherever Lee goes there you will go also The only point upon which I am now in doubt is whether it will be better to cross the Rapidan above or below him Each plan presents great advantages over the other with corresponding objections By crossing above Lee is cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond and going north on a raid But if we take this route all we do must be done whilst the rations we start with hold out We separate from Butler so that he cannot be directed how to company operate By the other route Brandy Station can be used as a base of supplies until another is secured on the York or James rivers These advantages and objections I will talk over with you more fully than I can write them Burnside with a force of probably twenty five thousand men will reinforce you Immediately upon his arrival which will be shortly after the twentieth inst I will give him the defence of the road from Bull Run as far south as we wish to hold it This will enable you to collect all your strength about Brandy Station and to the front There will be naval company operation on the James River and transports and ferries will be provided so that should Lee fall back into his intrenchments at Richmond Butler s force and yours will be a unit or at least can be made to act as such What I would direct then is that you commence at once reducing baggage to the very lowest possible standard Two wagons to a regiment of five hundred men is the greatest number that should be allowed for all baggage exclusive of subsistence stores and ordnance stores One wagon to brigade and one to division headquarters is sufficient and about two to corps headquarters Should by Lee s right flank be our route you will want to make arrangements for having supplies of all sorts promptly forwarded to White House on the Pamunkey Your estimates for this contingency should be made at once If not wanted there there is every probability they will be wanted on the James River or elsewhere If Lee s left is turned large provision will have to be made for ordnance stores I would say not much short of five hundred rounds of infantry ammunition would do By the other half the amount would be sufficient U S GRANT Lieutenant General twenty six General John A Logan upon whom devolved the command of the Army of the Tennessee during this battle in his report gave our total loss in killed wounded and missing at three thousand five hundred twenty one and estimated that of the enemy to be not less than ten thousand and General G M Dodge graphically describing to General Sherman the enemy s attack the full weight of which fell first upon and was broken by his depleted command remarks The disparity of forces can be seen from the fact that in the charge made by my two brigades under Fuller and Mersy they took three hundred fifty one prisoners representing forty nine different regiments eight brigades and three divisions and brought back eight battle flags

John Gibbon to be Major Generals Colonel S S Carroll eighth Ohio Volunteers Colonel E Upton one hundred and twenty first New York Volunteers Colonel William McCandless twod Pennsylvania Reserves to be Brigadier Generals I would also recommend Major General W S Hancock for Brigadier General in the regular army His services and qualifications are eminently deserving of this recognition In making these recommendations I do not wish the claims of General G M Dodge for promotion forgotten but recommend his name to be sent in at the same time I would also ask to have General Wright assigned to the command of the Sixth Army Corps I would further ask the confirmation of General Humphreys to the rank of Major General General Meade has more than met my most sanguine expectations He and Sherman are the fittest officers for large commands I have come in contact with If their services can be rewarded by promotion to the rank of Major Generals in the regular army the honor would be worthily bestowed and I would feel personally gratified I would not like to see one of these promotions at this time without seeing both U S GRANT Lieut General thirty two QUARLES MILLS VA May twenty six eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL HALLECK Washington D C The relative position of the two armies is now as follows Lee s right rests on a swamp east of the Richmond and Fredericksburg road and south of the North Anna his centre on the river at Ox Ford and his left at Little River with the crossings of Little River guarded as far up as we have gone Hancock with his corps and one division of the ninth corps crossed at Chesterfield Ford and covers the right wing of Lee s army One division of the ninth corps is on the north bank of the Anna at Ox Ford with bridges above and below at points nearest to it where both banks are held by us so that it could reinforce either wing of our army with equal facility The fifth and sixth corps with one division of the ninth corps run from the south bank of the Anna from a short distance above Ox Ford to Little River and parallel with and near to the enemy To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not justify To turn the enemy by his right between the two Annas is impossible on account of the swamp upon which his right rests To turn him by the left leaves Little River New Found River and South Anna River all of them streams presenting considerable obstacles to the movement of our army to be crossed I have determined therefore to turn the enemy s right by crossing at or near Hanover Town This crosses all three streams at once and leaves us still where we can draw supplies During the last night the teams and artillery not in position belonging to the right wing of our army and one division of that wing were quietly withdrawn to the north bank of the river and moved down to the rear of the left As soon as it is dark this division with most of the cavalry will commence a forced march for Hanover Town to seize and hold the crossings The balance of the right wing will withdraw at the same hour and follow as rapidly as possible The left wing will also withdraw from the south bank of the river to night and follow in rear of the right wing Lee s army is really whipped The prisoners we now take show it and the action of his army shows it unmistakably A battle with them outside of intrenchments cannot be had Our men feel that they have gained the MORALE over the enemy and attack him with confidence I may be mistaken but I feel that our success over Lee s army is already assured The promptness and rapidity with which you have forwarded reinforcements has contributed largely to the feeling of confidence inspired in our men and to break down that of the enemy We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central and Fredericksburg roads I want to leave a gap on the roads north of Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have to import rail from elsewhere Even if a crossing is not effected at Hanover Town it will probably be necessary for us to move on down the Pamunkey until a crossing is effected I think it advisable therefore to change our base of supplies from Port Royal to the White House I wish you would direct this change at once and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge there in condition for crossing troops and artillery and leave men to hold it U S GRANT Lieut General thirty three NEAR COLD HARBOR June three eighteen sixty four seven A M MAJOR GENERAL MEADE Commanding A P The moment it becomes certain that an assault cannot succeed suspend the offensive but when one does succeed push it vigorously and if necessary pile in troops at the successful point from wherever they can be taken I shall go to where you are in the course of an hour U S GRANT Lieut General thirty four COLD HARBOR June fifty one thousand eight hundred sixty four MAJOR GENERAL HALLECK Chief of Staff of the Army Washington D C A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would be impracticable to hold a line north east of Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad to enable us to use that road for supplying the army To do so would give us a long vulnerable line of road to protect exhausting much of our strength to guard it and would leave open to the enemy all of his lines of communication on the south side of the James My idea from the start has been to beat Lee s army if possible north of Richmond then after destroying his lines of communication on the north side of the James River to transfer the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond or follow him south if he should retreat I now find after over thirty days of trial the enemy deems it of the first importance to run no risks with the armies they now have They act purely on the defensive behind breastworks or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them and where in case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing to make all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside of the city I have therefore resolved upon the following plan I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by the Army of the Potomac taking advantage of any favorable circumstance that may present itself until the cavalry can be sent west to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad from about Beaver Dam for some twenty five or thirty miles west When this is effected I will move the army to the south side of the James River either by crossing the Chickahominy and marching near to City Point or by going to the mouth of the Chickahominy on north side and crossing there To provide for this last and most possible contingency several ferry boats of the largest class ought to be immediately provided Once on the south side of the James River I can cut off all sources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the canal If Hunter succeeds in reaching Lynchburg that will be lost to him also Should Hunter not succeed I will still make the effort to destroy the canal by sending cavalry up the south side of the river with a pontoon train to cross wherever they can The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebels can protect themselves only by strong intrenchments whilst our army is not only confident of protecting itself without intrenchments but that it can beat and drive the enemy wherever and whenever he can be found without this protection U S GRANT Lieutenant General thirty five COLD HARBOR VA June six eighteen sixty four MAJOR GENERAL D HUNTER Commanding Dept W Va General Sheridan leaves here to morrow morning with instructions to proceed to Charlottesville Va and to commence there the destruction of the Va Cen R R destroying this way as much as possible The complete destruction of this road and of the canal on James River is of great importance to us According to the instructions I sent to General Halleck for your guidance you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence there It would be of great value to us to get possession of Lynchburg for a single day But that point is of so much importance to the enemy that in attempting to get it such resistance may be met as to defeat your getting onto the road or canal at all I see in looking over the letter to General Halleck on the subject of your instructions that it rather indicates that your route should be from Staunton via Charlottesville If you have so understood it you will be doing just what I want The direction I would now give is that if this letter reaches you in the valley between Staunton and Lynchburg you immediately turn east by the most practicable road From thence move eastward along the line of the road destroying it completely and thoroughly until you join General Sheridan After the work laid out for General Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done proceed to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid out in General Sheridan s instructions If any portion of your force especially your cavalry is needed back in your Department you are authorized to send it back If on receipt of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem it practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy the canal Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal U S GRANT Lieut General thirty six FROM A STATEMENT OF LOSSES COMPILED IN THE ADJUTANT

officers who made a survey of the front from Bermuda Hundred report against the probability of success from an attack there The chances they think will be better on Burnside s front If this is attempted it will be necessary to concentrate all the force possible at the point in the enemy s line we expect to penetrate All officers should be fully impressed with the absolute necessity of pushing entirely beyond the enemy s present line if they should succeed in penetrating it and of getting back to their present line promptly if they should not succeed in breaking through To the right and left of the point of assault all the artillery possible should be brought to play upon the enemy in front during the assault Their lines would be sufficient for the support of the artillery and all the reserves could be brought on the flanks of their commands nearest to the point of assault ready to follow in if successful The field artillery and infantry held in the lines during the first assault should be in readiness to move at a moment s notice either to their front or to follow the main assault as they should receive orders One thing however should be impressed on corps commanders If they see the enemy giving away on their front or moving from it to reinforce a heavily assaulted portion of their line they should take advantage of such knowledge and act promptly without waiting for orders from army commanders General Ord can company operate with his corps in this movement and about five thousand troops from Bermuda Hundred can be sent to reinforce you or can be used to threaten an assault between the Appomattox and James rivers as may be deemed best This should be done by Tuesday morning if done at all If not attempted we will then start at the date indicated to destroy the railroad as far as Hicksford at least and to Weldon if possible Whether we send an expedition on the road or assault at Petersburg Burnside s mine will be blown up U S GRANT Lieutenant

Parker upon official headed paper and a copy furnished General Lee The fac simile herewith shows the color of the paper of the original document and all interlineations and erasures There is a popular error to the effect that Generals Grant and Lee each signed the articles of surrender The document in the form of a letter was signed only by General Grant in the parlor of McLean s house while General Lee was sitting in the room and General Lee immediately wrote a letter accepting the terms and handed it to General Grant End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Personal Memoirs of U S Grant

confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web
