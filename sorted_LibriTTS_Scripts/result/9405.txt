the Border Widow The Banks o Yarrow Hugh of Lincoln Sir Patrick Spens Introduction Goethe who saw so many things with such clearness of vision brought out the charm of the popular ballad for readers of a later day in his remark that the value of these songs of the people is to be found in the fact that their motives are drawn directly from nature and he added that in the art of saying things compactly uneducated men have greater skill than those who are educated It is certainly true that no kind of verse is so completely out of the atmosphere of modern writing as the popular ballad No other form of verse has therefore in so great a degree the charm of freshness In material treatment and spirit these bat lads are set in sharp contrast with the poetry of the hour They deal with historical events or incidents with local traditions with personal adventure or achievement They are almost without exception entirely objective Contemporary poetry is on the other hand very largely subjective and even when it deals with events or incidents it invests them to such a degree with personal emotion and imagination it so modifies and colours them with temperamental effects that the resulting poem is much more a study of subjective conditions than a picture or drama of objective realities This projection of the inward upon the outward world in such a degree that the dividing line between the two is lost is strikingly illustrated in Maeterlinck s plays Nothing could be in sharper contrast for instance than the famous ballad of The Hunting of the Cheviot and Maeterlinck s Princess Maleine There is no atmosphere in a strict use of the word in the spirited and compact account of the famous contention between the Percies and the Douglases of which Sir Philip Sidney said that I found not my heart moved more than with a Trumpet It is a breathless rushing narrative of a swift succession of events told with the most straight forward simplicity In the Princess Maleine on the other hand the narrative is so charged with subjective feeling the world in which the action takes place is so deeply tinged with lights that never rested on any actual landscape that all sense of reality is lost The play depends for its effect mainly upon atmosphere Certain very definite impressions are produced with singular power but there is no clear clean stamping of occurrences on the mind The imagination is skilfully awakened and made to do the work of observation The note of the popular ballad is its objectivity it not only takes us out of doors but it also takes us out of the individual consciousness The manner is entirely subordinated to the matter the poet if there was a poet in the case obliterates himself What we get is a definite report of events which have taken place not a study of a man s mind nor an account of a man s feelings The true balladist is never introspective he is concerned not with himself but with his story There is no self disclosure in his song To the mood of Senancour and Amiel he was a stranger Neither he nor the men to whom he recited or sang would have understood that mood They were primarily and unreflectively absorbed in the world outside of themselves They saw far more than they meditated they recorded far more than they moralized The popular ballads are as a rule entirely free from didacticism in any form that is one of the main sources of their unfailing charm They show not only a childlike curiosity about the doings of the day and the things that befall men but a childlike indifference to moral inference and justification The bloodier the fray the better for ballad purposes no one feels the necessity of apology either for ruthless aggression or for useless blood letting the scene is reported as it was presented to the eye of the spectator not to his moralizing faculty He is expected to see and to sing not to scrutinize and meditate In those rare cases in which a moral inference is drawn it is always so obvious and elementary that it gives the impression of having been fastened on at the end of the song in deference to ecclesiastical rather than popular feeling The social and intellectual conditions which fostered self unconsciousness interest in things incidents and adventures rather than in moods and inward experiences and the unmoral or non moralizing attitude towards events fostered also that delightful naivete which contributes greatly to the charm of many of the best ballads a naivete which often heightens the pathos and at times softens it with touches of apparently unconscious humour the naivete of the child which has in it something of the freshness of a wildflower and yet has also a wonderful instinct for making the heart of the matter plain This quality has almost entirely disappeared from contemporary verse among cultivated races one must go to the peasants of remote parts of the Continent to discover even a trace of its presence It has a real but short lived charm like the freshness which shines on meadow and garden in the brief dawn which hastens on to day This frank direct play of thought and feeling on an incident or series of incidents compensates for the absence of a more perfect art in the ballads using the word art in its true sense as including complete adequate and beautiful handling of subject matter and masterly working out of its possibilities These popular songs so dear to the hearts of the generations on whose lips they were fashioned and to all who care for the fresh note the direct word the unrestrained emotion rarely touch the highest points of poetic achievement Their charm lies not in their perfection of form but in their spontaneity sincerity and graphic power They are not rivers of song wide deep and swift they are rather cool clear springs among the hills In the reactions against sophisticated poetry which set in from lime to time the popular ballad the true folk song has often been exalted at the expense of other forms of verse It is idle to attempt to arrange the various forms of poetry in an order of absolute values it is enough that each has its own quality and therefore its own value The drama the epic the ballad the lyric each strikes its note in the complete expression of human emotion and experience Each belongs to a particular stage of development and each has the authority and the enduring charm which attach to every authentic utterance of the spirit of man under the conditions of life In this wide range of human expression the ballad follows the epic as a kind of aftermath a second and scattered harvest springing without regularity or nurture out of a rich and unexhausted soil The epic fastens upon some event of such commanding importance that it marks a main current of history some story historic or mythologic some incident susceptible of extended narrative treatment It is always in its popular form a matter of growth it is direct simple free from didacticism representing as Aristotle says a single action entire and complete It subordinates character to action it delights in episode and dialogue it is content to tell the story as a story and leave the moralization to hearers or readers The popular ballad is so closely related to the popular epic that it may be said to reproduce its qualities and characteristics within a narrower compass and on a smaller scale It also is a piece of the memory of the people or a creation of the imagination of the people but the tradition or fact which it preserves is of local rather than national importance It is indifferent to nice distinctions and delicate gradations or shadings its power springs from its directness vigour and simplicity It is often entirely occupied with the narration or description of a single episode it has no room for dialogue but it often secures the effect of the dialogue by its unconventional freedom of phrase and sometimes by the introduction of brief and compact charge and denial question and reply Sometimes the incidents upon which the ballad makers fastened have a unity or connection with each other which hints at a complete story The ballads which deal with Robin Hood are so numerous and so closely related that they constantly suggest not only the possibility but the probability of epic treatment It is surprising that the richness of the material and its notable illustrative quality did not inspire some earlier Chaucer to combine the incidents in a sustained narrative But the epic poet did not appear and the most representative of English popular heroes remains the central figure in a series of detached episodes and adventures preserved in a long line of disconnected ballads This apparent arrest in the ballad stage of a story which seemed destined to become an epic naturally suggests the vexed question of the author ship of the popular ballads They are in a very real sense the songs of the people they make no claim to individual authorship on the contrary the inference of what may be called community authorship is in many instances irresistible They are the product of a social condition which so to speak holds song of this kind in solution of an age in which improvisation singing and dancing are the most natural and familiar forms of expression They deal almost without exception with matters which belong to the community memory or imagination they constantly reappear with variations so noticeable as to indicate free and common handling of themes of wide local interest All this is true of the popular ballad but all this does not decisively settle the question of authorship What share did the community have in the making of these songs and what share fell to individual singers Herder whose conception of the origin and function of literature was so vitalizing in the general aridity of thinking about the middle of the last century and who did even more for ballad verse in Germany than Bishop Percy did in England laid emphasis almost exclusively on community authorship His profound instinct for reality in all forms of art his deep feeling for life and the immense importance he attached to spontaneity and unconsciousness in the truest productivity made community authorship not only attractive but inevitable to him In his pronounced reaction against the superficial ideas of literature so widely held in the Germany of his time he espoused the conception of community authorship as the only possible explanation of the epics ballads and other folk songs In nature and popular life or universal experience he found the rich sources of the poetry whose charm he felt so deeply and whose power and beauty he did so much to reveal to his contemporaries Genius and nature are magical words with him because they suggested such depths of being under all forms of expression such unity of the whole being of a race in its thought its emotion and its action such entire unconsciousness of self or of formulated aim and such spontaneity of spirit and speech The language of those times when words had not yet been divided into nobles middle class and plebeians was he said the richest for poetical purposes Our tongue compared with the idiom of the savage seems adapted rather for reflection than for the senses or imagination The rhythm of popular verse is so delicate so rapid so precise that it is no easy matter to defect it with our eyes but do not imagine it to have been equally difficult for those living populations who listened to instead of reading it who were accustomed to the sound of it from their infancy who themselves sang it and whose ear had been formed by its cadence This conception of poetry as arising in the hearts of the people and taking form on their lips is still more definitely and strikingly expressed in two sentences which let us into the heart of Herder s philosophy of poetry Poetry in those happy days lived in the ears of the people on the lips and in the harps of living bards it sang of history of the events of the day of mysteries miracles and signs It was the flower of a nation s character language and country of its occupations its prejudices its passions its aspirations and its soul In these words at once comprehensive and vague after the manner of Herder we find ourselves face to face with that conception not only of popular song in all its forms but with literature as a whole which has revolutionized literary study in this century and revitalized it as well For Herder was a man of prophetic instinct he sometimes felt more clearly than he saw he divined where he could not reach results by analysis He was often vague fragmentary and inconclusive like all men of his type but he had a genius for getting at the heart of things His statements often need qualification but he is almost always on the tight track When he says that the great traditions in which both the memory and the imagination of a race were engaged and which were still living in the mouths of the people of themselves took on poetic form he is using language which is too general to convey a definite impression of method but he is probably suggesting the deepest truth with regard to these popular stories They actually were of community origin they actually were common property they were given a great variety of forms by a great number of persons the forms which have come down to us are very likely the survivors of a kind of in formal competition which went on for years at the fireside and at the festivals of a whole country side Barger whose Lenore is one of the most widely known of modern ballads held the same view of the origin of popular song and was even more definite in his confession of faith than Herder He declared in the most uncompromising terms that all real poetry must have a popular origin can be and must be of the people for that is the seal of its perfection And he comments on the delight with which he has listened in village street and home to unwritten songs the poetry which finds its way in quiet rivulets to the remotest peasant home In like manner Helene Vacaresco overheard the songs of the Roumanian people hiding in the maize to catch the reaping songs listening at spinning parties at festivals at death beds at taverns taking the songs down from the lips of peasant women fortune tellers gypsies and all manner of humble folk who were the custodians of this vagrant community verse We have passed so entirely out of the song making period and literature has become to us so exclusively the work of a professional class that we find it difficult to imagine the intellectual and social conditions which fostered improvisation on a great scale and trained the ear of great populations to the music of spoken poetry It is almost impossible for us to disassociate literature from writing There is still however a considerable volume of unwritten literature in the world in the form of stories songs proverbs and pithy phrases a literature handed down in large part from earlier times but still receiving additions from contemporary men and women This unwritten literature is to be found it is hardly necessary to say almost exclusively among country people remote from towns and whose mental attitude and community feeling reproduce in a way the conditions under which the English and Scotch ballads were originally composed The Roumanian peasants sing their songs upon every occasion of domestic or local interest and sowing and harvesting birth christening marriage the burial these notable events in the life of the country side are all celebrated by unknown poets or rather by improvisers who give definite form to sentiments phrases and words which are on many lips The Russian peasant tells his stories as they were told to him those heroic epics whose life is believed in some cases to date back at least a thousand years These great popular stories form a kind of sacred inheritance bequeathed by one generation to another as a possession of the memory and are almost entirely unrelated to the written literature of the country Miss Hapgood tells a very interesting story of a government official stationed on the western shore of Lake Onega who became so absorbed in the search for this literature of the people that he followed singers and reciters from place to place eager to learn from their lips the most widely known of these folk tales On such an expedition of discovery he found himself one stormy night on an island in the lake The hut of refuge was already full of stormbound peasants when he entered Having made himself some tea and spread his blanket in a vacant place he fell asleep He was presently awakened by a murmur of recurring sounds Sitting up he found the group of peasants hanging on the words of an old man of kindly face expressive eyes and melodious voice from whose lips flowed a marvellous song grave and gay by turns monotonous and passionate in succession but wonderfully fresh picturesque and fascinating The listener soon became aware that he was hearing for the first time the famous story of Sadko the Merchant of Novgorod It was like being present at the birth of a piece of literature The fact that unwritten songs and stories still exist in great numbers among remote country folk of our own time and that additions are still made to them help us to understand the probable origin of our own popular ballads and what community authorship may really mean To put ourselves even in thought in touch with the ballad making period in English and Scotch history we must dismiss from our minds all modern ideas of authorship all notions of individual origination and ownership of any form of words Professor ten Brink tells us that in the ballad making age there was no production there was only reproduction There was a stock of traditions memories experiences held in common by large populations in constant use on the lips of numberless persons told and retold in many forms with countless changes variations and modifications without conscious artistic purpose with no sense of personal control or possession with no constructive aim either in plot or treatment no composition in the modern sense of the term Such a mass of poetic material in the possession of a large community was in a sense fluid and ran into a thousand forms almost without direction or premeditation Constant use of such rich material gave a poetic turn of thought and speech to countless persons who under other conditions would have given no sign of the possession of the faculty of imagination There was not only the stimulus to the faculty which sees events and occurrences with the eyes of the imagination but there was also constant and familiar use of the language of poetry To speak metrically or rhythmically is no difficult matter if one is in the atmosphere or habit of verse making and there is nothing surprising either in the feats of memory or of improvisation performed by the minstrels and balladists of the old time The faculty of improvising was easily developed and was very generally used by people of all classes This facility is still possessed by rural populations among whom songs are still composed as they are sting each member of the company contributing a new verse or a variation suggested by local conditions of a well known stanza When to the possession of a mass of traditions and stories and of facility of improvisation is added the habit of singing and dancing it is not difficult to reconstruct in our own thought the conditions under which popular poetry came into being nor to understand in what sense a community can make its own songs In the brave days when ballads were made the rustic peoples were not mute as they are to day nor sad as they have become in so many parts of England They sang and they danced by instinct and as an expression of social feeling Originally the ballads were not only sung but they gave measure to the dance they grew from mouth to mouth in the very act of dancing individual dancers adding verse to verse and the frequent refrain coming in as a kind of chorus Gesture and to a certain extent acting would naturally accompany so free and general an expression of community feeling There was no poet because all were poets To quote Professor ten Brink once more Song and playing were cultivated by peasants and even by freedmen and serfs At beer feasts the harp went from hand to hand Herein lies the essential difference between that age and our own The result of poetical activity was not the property and was not the production of a single person but of the community The work of the individual endured only as long as its delivery lasted He gained personal distinction only as a virtuoso The permanent elements of what he presented the material the ideas even the style and metre already existed The work of the singer was only a ripple in the stream of national poetry Who can say how much the individual contributed to it or where in his poetical recitation memory ceased and creative impulse began In any case the work of the individual lived on only as the ideal possession of the aggregate body of the people and it soon lost the stamp of originality In view of such a development of poetry we must assume a time when the collective consciousness of a people or race is paramount in its unity when the intellectual life of each is nourished from the same treasury of views and associations of myths and sagas when similar interests stir each breast and the ethical judgment of all applies itself to the same standard In such an age the form of poetical expression will also be common to all necessarily solemn earnest and simple When the conditions which produced the popular ballads become clear to the imagination their depth of rootage not only in the community life but in the community love becomes also clear We under stand the charm which these old songs have for us of a later age and the spell which they cast upon men and women who knew the secret of their birth we understand why the minstrels of the lime when popular poetry was in its best estate were held in such honour why Taillefer sang the song of Roland at the head of the advancing Normans on the day of Hastings and why good Bishop Aldhelm when he wanted to get the ears of his people stood on the bridge and sang a ballad These old songs were the flowering of the imagination of the people they drew their life as directly from the general experience the common memory the universal feelings as did the Greek dramas in those primitive times when they were part of rustic festivity and worship The popular ballads have passed away with the conditions which produced them Modern poets have in several instances written ballads of striking picturesqueness and power but as unlike the ballad of popular origin as the world of to day is unlike the world in which Chevy Chase was first sung These modern ballads are not necessarily better or worse than their predecessors but they are necessarily different It is idle to exalt the wild flower at the expense of the garden flower each has its fragrance its beauty its sentiment and the world is wide In the selection of the ballads which appear in this volume no attempt has been made to follow a chronological order or to enforce a rigid principle of selection of any kind The aim has been to bring within moderate compass a collection of these songs of the people which should fairly represent the range the descriptive felicity the dramatic power and the genuine poetic feeling of a body of verse which is still it is to be feared unfamiliar to a large number of those to whom it would bring refreshment and delight HAMILTON WRIGHT MABIE Chevy Chace God prosper long our noble king Our liffes and safetyes all A woefull hunting once there did In Chevy Chace befall To drive the

none	none	King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid I read that once in Affrica A princely wight did raine Who had to name Cophetua As poets they did faine From natures lawes he did decline For sure he was not of my minde He cared not for women kind But did them all disdaine But marke what hapned on a day As he out of his window lay He saw a beggar all in gray The which did cause his paine The blinded boy that shootes so trim From heaven downe did hie He drew a dart and shot at him In place where he did lye Which soone did pierse him to the quicke And when he felt the arrow pricke Which in his tender heart did sticke He looketh as he would dye What sudden chance is this quoth he That I to love must subject be Which never thereto would agree But still did it defie Then from the window he did come And laid him on his bed A thousand heapes of care did runne Within his troubled head For now he meanes to crave her love And now he seekes which way to proove How he his fancie might remoove And not this beggar wed But Cupid had him so in snare That this poor begger must prepare A salve to cure him of his care Or els he would be dead And as he musing thus did lye He thought for to devise How he might have her companye That so did maze his eyes In thee quoth he doth rest my life For surely thou shalt be my wife Or else this hand with bloody knife The Gods shall sure suffice Then from his bed he soon arose And to his pallace gate he goes Full little then this begger knowes When she the king espies The gods preserve your majesty The beggers all gan cry Vouchsafe to give your charity Our childrens food to buy The king to them his purse did cast And they to part it made great haste This silly woman was the last That after them did hye The king he cal d her back againe And unto her he gave his chaine And said With us you shal remaine Till such time as we dye For thou quoth he shalt be my wife And honoured for my queene With thee I meane to lead my life As shortly shall be seene Our wedding shall appointed be And every thing in its degree Come on quoth he and follow me Thou shalt go shift thee cleane What is thy name faire maid quoth he Penelophon O King quoth she With that she made a lowe courtsey A trim one as I weene Thus hand in hand along they walke Unto the king s pallace The king with courteous comly talke This begger doth embrace The begger blusheth scarlet red And straight againe as pale as lead But not a word at all she said She was in such amaze At last she spake with trembling voyce And said O King I doe rejoyce That you wil take me for your choyce And my degree so base And when the wedding day was come The king commanded strait The noblemen both all and some Upon the queene to wait And she behaved herself that day As if she had never walkt the way She had forgot her gowne of gray Which she did weare of late The proverbe old is come to passe The priest when he begins his masse Forgets that ever clerke he was He knowth not his estate Here you may read Cophetua Through long time fancie fed Compelled by the blinded boy The begger for to wed He that did lovers lookes disdaine To do the same was glad and faine Or else he would himselfe have slaine In storie as we read Disdaine no whit O lady deere But pitty now thy servant heere Least that it hap to thee this yeare As to that king it did And thus they led a quiet life During their princely raine And in a tombe were buried both As writers sheweth plaine The lords they tooke it grievously The ladies tooke it heavily The commons cryed pitiously Their death to them was paine Their fame did sound so passingly That it did pierce the starry sky And throughout all the world did flye To every princes realme King Leir and his Three Daughters King Leir once ruled in this land With princely power and peace And had all things with hearts content That might his joys increase Amongst those things that nature gave Three daughters fair had he So princely seeming beautiful As fairer could not be So on a time it pleas d the king A question thus to move Which of his daughters to his grace Could shew the dearest love For to my age you bring content Quoth he then let me hear Which of you three in plighted troth The kindest will appear To whom the eldest thus began Dear father mind quoth she Before your face to do you good My blood shall render d be And for your sake my bleeding heart Shall here be cut in twain Ere that I see your reverend age The smallest grief sustain And so will I the second said Dear father for your sake The worst of all extremities I ll gently undertake And serve your highness night and day With diligence and love That sweet content and quietness Discomforts may remove In doing so you glad my soul The aged king reply d But what sayst thou my youngest girl How is thy love ally d My love quoth young Cordelia then Which to your grace I owe Shall be the duty of a child And that is all I ll show And wilt thou shew no more quoth he Than doth thy duty bind I well perceive thy love is small When as no more I find Henceforth I banish thee my court Thou art no child of mine Nor any part of this my realm By favour shall be thine Thy elder sisters loves are more Than well I can demand To whom I equally bestow My kingdome and my land My pompal state and all my goods That lovingly I may With those thy sisters be maintain d Until my dying day Thus flattering speeches won renown By these two sisters here The third had causeless banishment Yet was her love more dear For poor Cordelia patiently Went wandring up and down Unhelp d unpity d gentle maid Through many an English town Untill at last in famous France She gentler fortunes found Though poor and bare yet she was deem d The fairest on the ground Where when the king her virtues heard And this fair lady seen With full consent of all his court He made his wife and queen Her father old King Leir this while With his two daughters staid Forgetful of their promis d loves Full soon the same decay d And living in Queen Ragan s court The eldest of the twain She took from him his chiefest means And most of all his train For whereas twenty men were wont To wait with bended knee She gave allowance but to ten And after scarce to three Nay one she thought too much for him So took she all away In hope that in her court good king He would no longer stay Am I rewarded thus quoth he In giving all I have Unto my children and to beg For what I lately gave I ll go unto my Gonorell My second child I know Will be more kind and pitiful And will relieve my woe Full fast he hies then to her court Where when she heard his moan Return d him answer that she griev d That all his means were gone But no way could relieve his wants Yet if that he would stay Within her kitchen he should have What scullions gave away When he had heard with bitter tears He made his answer then In what I did let me be made Example to all men I will return again quoth he Unto my Ragan s court She will not use me thus I hope But in a kinder sort Where when he came she gave command To drive him thence away When he was well within her court She said he would not stay Then back again to Gonorel The woeful king did hie That in her kitchen he might have What scullion boys set by But there of that he was deny d Which she had promis d late For once refusing he should not Come after to her gate Thus twixt his daughters for relief He wandred up and down Being glad to feed on beggars food That lately wore a crown And calling to remembrance then His youngest daughters words That said the duty of a child Was all that love affords But doubting to repair to her Whom he had ban sh d so Grew frantic mad for in his mind He bore the wounds of woe Which made him rend his milk white locks And tresses from his head And all with blood bestain his cheeks With age and honour spread To hills and woods and watry founts He made his hourly moan Till hills and woods and senseless things Did seem to sigh and groan Even thus possest with discontents He passed o er to France In hopes from fair Cordelia there To find some gentler chance Most virtuous dame which when she heard Of this her father s grief As duty bound she quickly sent Him comfort and relief And by a train of noble peers In brave and gallant sort She gave in charge he should be brought To Aganippus court Whose royal king with noble mind So freely gave consent To muster up his knights at arms To fame and courage bent And so to England came with speed To repossesse King Leir And drive his daughters from their thrones By his Cordelia dear Where she true hearted noble queen Was in the battel stain Yet he good king in his old days Possest his crown again But when he heard Cordelia s death Who died indeed for love Of her dear father in whose cause She did this battle move He swooning fell upon her breast From whence he never parted But on her bosom left his life That was so truly hearted The lords and nobles when they saw The end of these events The other sisters unto death They doomed by consents And being dead their crowns they left Unto the next of kin Thus have you seen the fall of pride And disobedient sin Fair Rosamond When as King Henry rulde this land The second of that name Besides the queene he dearly lovde A faire and comely dame Most peerlesse was her beautye founde Her favour and her face A sweeter creature in this worlde Could never prince embrace Her crisped lockes like threads of golde Appeard to each man s sight Her sparkling eyes like Orient pearles Did cast a heavenlye light The blood within her crystal cheekes Did such a colour drive As though the lillye and the rose For mastership did strive Yea Rosamonde fair Rosamonde Her name was called so To whom our queene Dame Ellinor Was known a deadlye foe The king therefore for her defence Against the furious queene At Woodstocke builded such a bower The like was never seene Most curiously that bower was built Of stone and timber strong An hundered and fifty doors Did to this bower belong And they so cunninglye contriv d With turnings round about That none but with a clue of thread Could enter in or out And for his love and ladyes sake That was so faire and brighte The keeping of this bower he gave Unto a valiant knighte But fortune that doth often frowne Where she before did smile The kinges delighte and ladyes joy Full soon shee did beguile For why the kinges ungracious sonne Whom he did high advance Against his father raised warres Within the realme of France But yet before our comelye king The English land forsooke Of Rosamond his lady faire His farewelle thus he tooke My Rosamonde my only Rose That pleasest best mine eye The fairest flower in all the worlde To feed my fantasye The flower of mine affected heart Whose sweetness doth excelle My royal Rose a thousand times I bid thee nowe farwelle For I must leave my fairest flower My sweetest Rose a space And cross the seas to famous France Proud rebelles to abase But yet my Rose be sure thou shalt My coming shortlye see And in my heart when hence I am Ile beare my Rose with mee When Rosamond that ladye brighte Did heare the king saye soe The sorrowe of her grieved heart Her outward lookes did showe And from her cleare and crystall eyes The teares gusht out apace Which like the silver pearled dewe Ranne downe her comely face Her lippes erst like the corall redde Did waxe both wan and pale And for the sorrow she conceivde Her vitall spirits faile And falling downe all in a swoone Before King Henryes face Full oft he in his princelye armes Her bodye did embrace And twentye times with watery eyes He kist her tender cheeke Untill he had revivde againe Her senses milde and meeke Why grieves my Rose my sweetest Rose The king did often say Because quoth shee to bloodye warres My lord must part awaye But since your Grace on forrayne coastes Amonge your foes unkinde Must goe to hazard life and limbe Why should I staye behinde Nay rather let me like a page Your sworde and target beare That on my breast the blowes may lighte Which would offend you there Or lett mee in your royal tent Prepare your bed at nighte And with sweete baths refresh your grace At your returne from fighte So I your presence may enjoye No toil I will refuse But wanting you my life is death Nay death Ild rather chuse Content thy self my dearest love Thy rest at home shall bee In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle For travell fits not thee Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres Soft peace their sexe delightes Not rugged campes but courtlye bowers Gay feastes not cruell fightes My Rose shall safely here abide With musicke passe the daye Whilst I amonge the piercing pikes My foes seeke far awaye My Rose shall shine in pearle and golde Whilst Ime in armour dighte Gay galliards here my love shall dance Whilst I my foes goe fighte And you Sir Thomas whom I truste To bee my loves defence Be carefull of my gallant Rose When I am parted hence And therewithall he fetcht a sigh As though his heart would breake And Rosamonde for very griefe Not one plaine word could speake And at their parting well they mighte In heart be grieved sore After that daye faire Rosamonde The king did see no more For when his Grace had past the seas And into France was gone With envious heart Queene Ellinor To Woodstocke came anone And forth she calls this trustye knighte In an unhappy houre Who with his clue of twined thread Came from this famous bower And when that they had wounded him The queene this thread did gette And wente where Ladye Rosamonde Was like an angell sette But when the queene with stedfast eye Beheld her beauteous face She was amazed in her minde At her exceeding grace Cast off from thee those robes she said That riche and costlye bee And drinke thou up this deadlye draught Which I have brought to thee Then presentlye upon her knees Sweet Rosamonde did falle And pardon of the queene she crav d For her offences all Take pitty on my youthfull yeares Faire Rosamonde did crye And lett mee not with poison stronge Enforced bee to dye I will renounce my sinfull life And in some cloyster bide Or else be banisht if you please To range the world soe wide And for the fault which I have done Though I was forc d theretoe Preserve my life and punish mee As you thinke meet to doe And with these words her lillie handes She wrunge full often there And downe along her lovely face Did trickle many a teare But nothing could this furious queene Therewith appeased bee The cup of deadlye poyson stronge As she knelt on her knee She gave this comelye dame to drinke Who tooke it in her hand And from her bended knee arose And on her feet did stand And casting up her eyes to heaven Shee did for mercye calle And drinking up the poison stronge Her life she lost withalle And when that death through everye limbe Had showde its greatest spite Her chiefest foes did plain confesse Shee was a glorious wight Her body then they did entomb When life was fled away At Godstowe neare to Oxford towne As may be seene this day Phillida and Corydon In the merrie moneth of Maye In a morne by break of daye With a troope of damselles playing Forthe I yode forsooth a maying When anon by a wood side Where that Maye was in his pride I espied all alone Phillida and Corydon Much adoe there was God wot He wold love and she wold not She sayde Never man was trewe He sayes None was false to you He sayde hee had lovde her longe She sayes love should have no wronge Corydon wold kisse her then She sayes Maydes must kisse no men Tyll they doe for good and all When she made the shepperde call All the heavens to wytnes truthe Never loved a truer youthe Then with manie a prettie othe Yea and nay and faithe and trothe Suche as seelie shepperdes use When they will not love abuse Love that had bene long deluded Was with kisses sweete concluded And Phillida with garlands gaye Was made the lady of the Maye Fair Margaret and Sweet William As it fell out on a long summer s day Two lovers they sat on a hill They sat together that long summer s day And could not talk their fill I see no harm by you Margaret And you see none by mee Before to morrow at eight o the clock A rich wedding you shall see Fair Margaret sat in her bower wind w Combing her yellow hair There she spyed sweet William and his bride As they were a riding near Then down she layd her ivory combe And braided her hair in twain She went alive out of her bower But ne er came alive in t again When day was gone and night was come And all men fast asleep Then came the spirit of Fair Marg ret And stood at William s feet Are you awake sweet William shee said Or sweet William are you asleep God give you joy of your gay bride bed And me of my winding sheet When day was come and night was gone And all men wak d from sleep Sweet William to his lady sayd My dear I have cause to weep I dreamt a dream my dear ladye Such dreames are never good I dreamt my bower was full of red wine And my bride bed full of blood Such dreams such dreams my honoured sir They never do prove good To dream thy bower was full of red wine And thy bride bed full of blood He called up his merry men all By one by two and by three Saying I ll away to fair Marg ret s bower By the leave of my ladie And when he came to fair Marg ret s bower He knocked at the ring And who so ready as her seven brethren To let sweet William in Then he turned up the covering sheet Pray let me see the dead Methinks she looks all pale and wan She hath lost her cherry red I ll do more for thee Margaret Than any of thy kin For I will kiss thy pale wan lips Though a smile I cannot win With that bespake the seven brethren Making most piteous mone You may go kiss your jolly brown bride And let our sister alone If I do kiss my jolly brown bride I do but what is right I ne er made a vow to yonder poor corpse By day nor yet by night Deal on deal on my merry men all Deal on your cake and your wine For whatever is dealt at her funeral to day Shall be dealt to morrow at mine Fair Margaret dyed to day to day Sweet William dyed the morrow Fair Margaret dyed for pure true love Sweet William dyed for sorrow Margaret was buryed in the lower chancel And William in the higher Out of her brest there sprang a rose And out of his a briar They grew till they grew unto the church top And then they could grow no higher And there they tyed in a true lover s knot Which made all the people admire Then came the clerk of the parish As you the truth shall hear And by misfortune cut them down Or they had now been there Annan Water Annan Water s

arms lying On fair Kirkconnell lea I wad I were where Helen lies Night and day on me she cries And I am weary of the skies Since my Love died for me Robin Hood and Allen a Dale Come listen to me you gallants so free All you that love mirth for to hear And I will tell you of a bold outlaw That lived in Nottinghamshire As Robin Hood in the forest stood All under the greenwood tree There he was aware of a brave young man As fine as fine might be The youngster was clad in scarlet red In scarlet fine and gay And he did frisk it over the plain And chaunted a roundelay As Robin Hood next morning stood Amongst the leaves so gay There did he espy the same young man Come drooping along the way The scarlet he wore the day before It was clean cast away And at every step he fetched a sigh Alas and a well a day Then stepped forth brave Little John And Midge the miller s son Which made the young man bend his bow When as he see them come Stand off stand off the young man said What is your will with me You must come before our master straight Under yon greenwood tree And when he came bold Robin before Robin asked him courteously O hast thou any money to spare For my merry men and me I have no money the young man said But five shillings and a ring And that I have kept this seven long years To have at my wedding Yesterday I should have married a maid But she was from me ta en And chosen to be an old knight s delight Whereby my poor heart is slain What is thy name then said Robin Hood Come tell me without any fail By the faith of my body then said the young man My name it is Allen a Dale What wilt thou give me said Robin Hood In ready gold or fee To help thee to thy true love again And deliver her unto thee I have no money then quoth the young man No ready gold nor fee But I will swear upon a book Thy true servant for to be How many miles is it to thy true love Come tell me without guile By the faith of my body then said the young man It is but five little mile Then Robin he hasted over the plain He did neither stint nor lin Until he came unto the church Where Allen should keep his weddin What hast thou here the bishop then said I prithee now tell unto me I am a bold harper quoth Robin Hood And the best in the north country O welcome O welcome the bishop he said That music best pleaseth me You shall have no music quoth Robin Hood Till the bride and bridegroom I see With that came in a wealthy knight Which was both grave and old And after him a finikin lass Did shine like the glistering gold This is not a fit match quoth Robin Hood That you do seem to make here For since we are come into the church The bride shall chuse her own dear Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth And blew blasts two and three When four and twenty bowmen bold Came leaping over the lea And when they came into the church yard Marching all in a row The first man was Allen a Dale To give bold Robin his bow This is thy true love Robin he said Young Allen as I hear say And you shall be married this same time Before we depart away That shall not be the bishop he cried For thy word shall not stand They shall be three times asked in the church As the law is of our land Robin Hood pulled off the bishop s coat And put it upon Little John By the faith of my body then Robin said This cloth doth make thee a man When Little John went into the quire The people began to laugh He asked them seven times into church Lest three times should not be enough Who gives me this maid said Little John Quoth Robin Hood That do I And he that takes her from Allen a Dale Full dearly he shall her buy And then having ended this merry wedding The bride looked like a queen And so they returned to the merry greenwood Amongst the leaves so green Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne When shaws beene sheene and shradds full fayre And leaves both large and longe Itt is merrye walkyng in the fayre forrest To heare the small birdes songe The woodweele sang and wold not cease Sitting upon the spraye

Yett neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy Them fettled to flye away Robin was reachles on a roote And stumbled at that tyde And Guy was quicke and nimble with all And hitt him ore the left side Ah deere Lady sayd Robin Hood tho Thou art but mother and may I think it was never mans destinye To dye before his day Robin thought on Our Ladye deere And soone leapt up againe And strait he came with a backward stroke And he Sir Guy hath slayne He took Sir Guy s head by the hayre And stuck itt upon his bowes end Thou hast beene a traytor all thy liffe Which thing must have an end Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe And nicked Sir Guy in the face That he was never on woman born Cold tell whose head it was Sayes Lye there lye there now Sir Guy And with me be not wrothe Iff thou have had the worst

blowe Itt blowes soe well in tyde And yonder comes that wightye yeoman Cladd in his capull hyde Come hyther come hyther thou good Sir Guy Aske what thou wilt of mee O I will none of thy gold sayd Robin Nor I will none of thy fee But now I have slaine the master he sayes Let me goe strike the knave For this is all the rewarde I aske Nor noe other will I have Thou art a madman said the sheriffe Thou sholdst have had a knightes fee But seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad Well granted it shale be When Little John heard his master speake Well knewe he it was his steven Now shall I be looset quoth Little John With Christ his might in heaven Fast Robin hee hyed him to Little John He thought to loose him belive The sheriffe and all his companye Fast after him can drive Stand abacke stand abacke sayd Robin Why draw you mee so neere Itt was never the use in our countrye Ones shrift another shold heere But Robin pulled forth an Irysh knife And losed John hand and foote And gave him Sir Guy s bow into his hand And bade it be his boote Then John he took Guy s bow in his hand His boltes and arrowes eche one When the sheriffe saw Little John bend his bow He fettled him to be gone Towards his house in Nottingham towne He fled full fast away And soe did all the companye Not one behind wold stay But he cold neither runne soe fast Nor away soe fast cold ryde But Little John with an arrowe soe broad He shott him into the backe syde Robin Hood s Death and Burial When Robin Hood and Little John Down a down a down a down Went o er yon bank of broom Said Robin Hood to Little John We have shot for many a pound Hey down a down a down But I am not able to shoot one shot more My arrows will not flee But I have a cousin lives down below Please God she will bleed me Now Robin is to fair Kirkley gone As fast as he can win But before he came there as we do hear He was taken very ill And when that he came to fair Kirkley hall He knocked all at the ring But none was so ready as his cousin herself For to let bold Robin in Will you please to sit down cousin Robin she said And drink some beer with me No I will neither eat nor drink Till I am blooded by thee Well I have a room cousin Robin she said Which you did never see And if you please to walk therein You blooded by me shall be She took him by the lily white hand And led him to a private room And there she blooded bold Robin Hood Whilst one drop of blood would run She blooded him in the vein of the arm And locked him up in the room There did he bleed all the live long day Until the next day at noon He then bethought him of a casement door Thinking for to begone He was so weak he could not leap Nor he could not get down He then bethought him of his bugle horn Which hung low down to his knee He set his horn unto his mouth And blew out weak blasts three Then Little John when hearing him As he sat under the tree I fear my master is near dead He blows so wearily Then Little John to Fair Kirkley is gone As fast as he can dree But when he came to Kirkley hall He broke locks two or three Until he came bold Robin to Then he fell on his knee A boon a boon cries Little John Master I beg of thee What is that boon quoth Robin Hood Little John thou begst of me It is to burn fair Kirkley hall And all their nunnery Now nay now nay quoth Robin Hood That boon I ll not grant thee I never hurt woman in all my life Nor man in woman s company I never hurt fair maid in all my time Nor at my end shall it be But give me my bent bow in my hand And a broad arrow I ll let flee And where this arrow is taken up There shall my grave digged be Lay me a green sod under my head And another under my feet And lay my bent bow by my side Which was my music sweet And make my grave of gravel and green Which is most right and meet Let me have length and breadth enough With a green sod under my head That they may say when I am dead Here lies bold Robin Hood These words they readily promised him Which did bold Robin please And there they buried bold Robin Hood Near to the fair Kirkleys The Twa Corbies As I was walking all alane I heard twa corbies making a maen The tane unto the t ither did say Whaur shall we gang and dine the day O doun beside yon auld fail dyke I wot there lies a new slain knight And naebody kens that he lies there But his hawk his hound and his lady fair His hound is to the hunting gane His hawk to fetch the wild fowl hame His lady s ta en another mate Sae we may mak our dinner sweet O we ll sit on his white hause bane And I ll pyke out his bonny blue e en Wi ae lock o his gowden hair We ll theek our nest when it blaws bare Mony a ane for him makes maen But nane shall ken whaur he is gane Over his banes when they are bare The wind shall blaw for evermair Waly Waly Love be Bonny A SCOTTISH SONG O waly waly up the bank And waly waly down the brae And waly waly yon burn side Where I and my love were wont to gae I leant my back unto an aik I thought it was a trusty tree But first it bow d and syne it brak Sae my true love did lichtly me O waly waly but gin love be bonny A little time while it is new But when its auld it waxeth cauld And fades awa like morning dew O wherfore shuld I busk my head Or wherfore shuld I kame my hair For my true love has me forsook And says he ll never loe me mair Now Arthur Seat sall be my bed The sheets shall neir be prest by me Saint Anton s well sall be my drink Since my true love has forsaken me Marti mas wind when wilt thou blaw And shake the green leaves aff the tree O gentle death when wilt thou cum For of my life I am wearye Tis not the frost that freezes fell Nor blawing snaws inclemencye Tis not sic cauld that makes me cry But my love s heart grown cauld to me Whan we came in by Glasgow town We were a comely sight to see My love was clad in black velvet And I myself in cramasye But had I wist before I kist That love had been sae ill to win I had lockt my heart in a case of gowd And pinnd it with a siller pin And oh that my young babe were born And set upon the nurse s knee And I myself were dead and gane And the green grass growing over me The Nut brown Maid Be it right or wrong these men among On women do complain Affirming this how that it is A labour spent in vain To love them wele for never a dele They love a man again For let a man do what he can Their favour to attain Yet if a new do them pursue Their first true lover then Laboureth for nought for from her thought He is a banished man I say not nay but that all day It is both writ and said That woman s faith is as who saith All utterly decayed But nevertheless right good witness In this case might be laid That they love true and continue Record the Nut brown Maid Which when her love came her to prove To her to make his moan Would not depart for in her heart She loved but him alone Then between us let us discuss What was all the manere Between them two we will also Tell all the pain and fere That she was in Now I begin So that ye me answere Wherefore all ye that present be I pray you give an ear I am the knight I come by night As secret as I can Saying Alas thus standeth the case I am a banished man SHE And I your will for to fulfil In this will not refuse Trusting to shew in wordes few That men have an ill use To their own shame women to blame And causeless them accuse Therefore to you I answer now All women to excuse Mine own heart dear with you what chere I pray you tell anone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE It standeth so a dede is do Whereof great harm shall grow My destiny is for to die A shameful death I trowe Or else to flee the one must be None other way I know But to withdraw as an outlaw And take me to my bow Wherefore adieu my own heart true None other rede I can For I must to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE O Lord what is this worldys bliss That changeth as the moon My summer s day in lusty May Is darked before the noon I hear you say farewell Nay nay We depart not so soon Why say ye so wheder will ye go Alas what have ye done All my welfare to sorrow and care Should change if ye were gone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE I can believe it shall you grieve And somewhat you distrain But afterward your paines hard Within a day or twain Shall soon aslake and ye shall take Comfort to you again Why should ye ought for to make thought Your labour were in vain And thus I do and pray you to As heartily as I can For I must to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE Now sith that ye have shewed to me The secret of your mind I shall be plain to you again Like as ye shall me find Sith it is so that ye will go I wolle not leave behind Shall never be said the Nut brown Maid Was to her love unkind Make you ready for so am I Although it were anone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE Yet I you rede to take good heed What men will think and say Of young and old it shall be told That ye be gone away Your wanton will for to fulfil In green wood you to play And that ye might from your delight No longer make delay Rather than ye should thus for me Be called an ill woman Yet would I to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE Though it be sung of old and young That I should be to blame Theirs be the charge that speak so large In hurting of my name For I will prove that faithful love It is devoid of shame In your distress and heaviness To part with you the same And sure all tho that do not so True lovers are they none For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE I counsel you remember how It is no maiden s law Nothing to doubt but to renne out To wood with an outlaw For ye must there in your hand bear A bow ready to draw And as a thief thus must you live Ever in dread and awe Whereby to you great harm might grow Yet had I lever than That I had to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE I think not nay but as ye say It is no maiden s lore But love may make me for your sake As I have said before To come on foot to hunt and shoot To get us meat in store For so that I your company May have I ask no more From which to part it maketh my heart As cold as any stone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE For an outlaw this is the law That men him take and bind Without pity hanged to be And waver with the wind If I had nede as God forbede What rescue could ye find Forsooth I trow ye and your bow For fear would draw behind And no mervayle for little avail Were in your counsel then Wherefore I will to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE Right well know ye that women be But feeble for to fight No womanhede it is indeed To be bold as a knight Yet in such fear if that ye were With enemies day or night I would withstand with bow in hand To greve them as I might And you to save as women have From death men many a one For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE Yet take good hede for ever I drede That ye could not sustain The thorny ways the deep valleys The snow the frost the rain The cold the heat for dry or wet We must lodge on the plain And us above none other roof But a brake bush or twain Which soon should grieve you I believe And ye would gladly then That I had to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE Sith I have here been partynere With you of joy and bliss I must als part of your woe Endure as reason is Yet am I sure of one pleasure And shortly it is this That where ye be me seemeth parde I could not fare amiss Without more speech I you beseech That we were soon agone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE If ye go thyder ye must consider When ye have lust to dine There shall no meat be for you gete Nor drink beer ale nor wine No shetes clean to lie between Made of thread and twine None other house but leaves and boughs To cover your head and mine O mine heart sweet this evil diete Should make you pale and wan Wherefore I will to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE Among the wild dere such an archere As men say that ye be Ne may not fail of good vitayle Where is so great plenty And water clear of the ryvere Shall be full sweet to me With which in hele I shall right wele Endure as ye shall see And or we go a bed or two I can provide anone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE Lo yet before ye must do more If ye will go with me As cut your hair up by your ear Your kirtle by the knee With bow in hand for to withstand Your enemies if need be And this same night before day light To wood ward will I flee If that ye will all this fulfil Do it shortly as ye can Else will I to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE I shall as now do more for you Than longeth to womanhede To shorte my hair a bow to bear To shoot in time of need O my sweet mother before all other For you I have most drede But now adieu I must ensue Where fortune doth me lead All this make ye Now let us flee The day cometh fast upon For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE Nay nay not so ye shall not go And I shall tell ye why Your appetite is to be light Of love I wele espy For like as ye have said to me In like wise hardely Ye would answere whosoever it were In way of company It is said of old Soon hot soon cold And so is a woman Wherefore I to the wood will go Alone a banished man SHE If ye take heed it is no need Such words to say by me For oft ye prayed and long assayed Or I you loved parde And though that I of ancestry A baron s daughter be Yet have you proved how I you loved A squire of low degree And ever shall whatso befall To die therefore anone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE A baron s child to be beguiled It were a cursed dede To be felawe with an outlawe Almighty God forbede Yet better were the poor squyere Alone to forest yede Than ye should say another day That by my cursed dede Ye were betrayed Wherefore good maid The best rede that I can Is that I to the green wood go Alone a banished man SHE Whatever befall I never shall Of this thing you upbraid But if ye go and leave me so Then have ye me betrayed Remember you wele how that ye dele For if ye as ye said Be so unkind to leave behind Your love the Nut brown Maid Trust me truly that I shall die Soon after ye be gone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE If that ye went ye should repent For in the forest now I have purvayed me of a maid Whom I love more than you Another fayrere than ever ye were I dare it wele avow And of you both each should be wroth With other as I trow It were mine ease to live in peace So will I if I can Wherefore I to the wood will go Alone a banished man SHE Though in the wood I understood Ye had a paramour All this may nought remove my thought But that I will be your And she shall find me soft and kind And courteys every hour Glad to fulfil all that she will Command me to my power For had ye lo an hundred mo Of them I would be one For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE Mine own dear love I see the proof That ye be kind and true Of maid and wife in all my life The best that ever I knew Be merry and glad be no more sad The case is changed new For it were ruth that for your truth Ye should have cause to rue Be not dismayed whatsoever I said To you when I began I will not to the green wood go I am no banished man SHE These tidings be more glad to me Than to be made a queen If I were sure they should endure But it is often seen When men will break promise they speak The wordes on the splene Ye shape some wile me to beguile And steal from me I ween Then were the case worse than it was And I more wo begone For in my mind of all mankind I love but you alone HE Ye shall not nede further to drede I will not disparage You God defend sith ye descend Of so great a lineage Now understand to Westmoreland Which is mine heritage I will you bring and with a ring By way of marriage I will you take and lady make As shortly as I can Thus have you won an erly s son And not a banished man AUTHOR Here may ye see that women be In love meek kind and stable Let never man reprove them then Or call them variable But rather pray God that we may To them be comfortable Which sometime proveth such as he loveth If they be charitable For sith men would that women should Be meek to them each one Much more ought they to God obey And serve but Him alone The Fause Lover A fair

ride Into England to take a prey The Earl of Fife withouten strife He bound him over Solway The great would ever together ride That race they may rue for aye Over Ottercap hill they came in And so down by Rotheley crag Upon Green Leighton they lighted down Styrande many a stag And boldly brente Northumberland And harried many a town They did our Englishmen great wrong To battle that were not bown Then spake a berne upon the bent Of comfort that was not cold And said We have brente Northumberland We have all wealth in holde Now we have harried all Bamborough shire All the wealth in the world have we I rede we ride to Newcastle So still and stalworthlye Upon the morrow when it was day The standards shone full bright To the Newcastle they took the way And thither they came full right Sir Henry Percy lay at the Newcastle I tell you withouten dread He has been a March man all his days And kept Berwick upon Tweed To the Newcastle when they came The Scots they cried on hyght Sir Harry Percy an thou bist within Come to the field and fight For we have brente Northumberland Thy heritage good and right And syne my lodging I have take With my brand dubbed many a knight Sir Harry Percy came to the walls The Scottish host for to see And thou hast brente Northumberland Full sore it rueth me If thou hast harried all Bamborough shire Thou hast done me great envy For the trespass thou hast me done The one of us shall die Where shall I bide thee said the Douglas Or where wilt thou come to me At Otterburn in the high way There mayst thou well lodged be The roe full reckless there she runs To make thee game and glee The falcon and the pheasant both Among the holtes on hee There mayst thou have thy wealth at will Well lodged there mayst thou be It shall not be long ere I come thee till Said Sir Harry Percye There shall I bide thee said the Douglas By the faith of my body Thither shall I come said Sir Harry Percy My troth I plight to thee A pipe of wine he gave them over the walls For sooth as I you say There he made the Douglas drink And all his host that day The Douglas turned him homeward again For sooth withouten nay He took his lodging at Otterburn Upon a Wednesday And there he pyght his standard down His getting more and less And syne he warned his men to go And get their geldings gress A Scottish knight hoved upon the bent A watch I dare well say So was he ware on the noble Percy In the dawning of the day He pricked to his pavilion door As fast as he might ronne Awaken Douglas cried the knight For His love that sits in throne Awaken Douglas cried the knight For thou mayst waken with wynne Yonder have I spied the proud Percy And seven standards with him Nay by my troth the Douglas said It is but a feigned tale He durst not look on my broad banner For all England so hayle Was I not yesterday at the Newcastle That stands so fair on Tyne For all the men the Percy had He could not garre me once to dyne He stepped out at his pavilion door To look and it were less Array you lordyngs one and all For here begins no peace The Earl of Menteith thou art my eme The forward I give to thee The Earl of Huntley cawte and keen He shall with thee be The Lord of Buchan in armour bright On the other hand he shall be Lord Johnstone and Lord Maxwell They two shall be with me Swynton fair field upon your pride To battle make you bowen Sir Davy Scot Sir Walter Steward Sir John of Agerstone THE SECOND FYTTE The Percy came before his host Which ever was a gentle knight Upon the Douglas loud did he cry I will hold that I have hight For thou hast brente Northumberland And done me great envy For this trespass thou hast me done The one of us shall die The Douglas answered him again With great words up on hee And said I have twenty against thy one Behold and thou mayst see With that the Percy was grieved sore For sooth as I you say He lighted down upon his foot And shot his horse clean away Every man saw that he did so That ryall was ever in rout Every man shot his horse him fro And light him round about Thus Sir Harry Percy took the field For sooth as I you say Jesu Christ in heaven on high Did help him well that day But nine thousand there was no more If chronicle will not layne Forty thousand Scots and four That day fought them again But when the battle began to join In haste there came a knight Then letters fair forth hath he ta en And thus he said full right My lord your father he greets you well With many a noble knight He desires you to bide That he may see this fight The baron of Grastock is come out of the west With him a noble company All they lodge at your father s this night And the battle fain would they see For Jesu s love said Sir Harry Percy That died for you and me Wend to my lord my father again And say thou saw me not with ee My troth is plight to yon Scottish knight It needs me not to layne That I should bide him upon this bent And I have his troth again And if that I wend off this ground For sooth unfoughten away He would me call but a coward knight In his land another day Yet had I lever to be rynde and rent By Mary that mykel may Than ever my manhood should be reproved With a Scot another day Wherefore shoot archers for my sake And let sharp arrows flee Minstrels play up for your warison And well quit it shall be Every man think on his true love And mark him to the Trinity For to God I make mine a vow This day will I not flee The bloody heart in the Douglas arms His standard stood on high That every man might full well know Beside stood starres three The white Li n on the English part For sooth as I you sayne The luces and the crescents both The Scots fought them again Upon Saint Andrew loud did they cry And thrice they shout on hyght And syne marked them on our Englishmen As I have told you right Saint George the bright our Lady s knight To name they were full fain Our Englishmen they cried on hyght And thrice they shout again With that sharp arrows began to flee I tell you in certain Men of arms began to join Many a doughty man was there slain The Percy and the Douglas met That either of them was fain They schapped together while that they sweat With swords of fine Collayne Till the blood from their basenets ran As the roke doth in the rain Yield thee to me said the Douglas Or else thou shalt be slain For I see by thy bright basenet Thou art some man of might And so I do by thy burnished brand Thou art an earl or else a knight By my good faith said the noble Percy Now hast thou rede full right Yet will I never yield me to thee While I may stand and fight They swapped together while that they sweat With swordes sharp and long Each on other so fast they beat Till their helms came in pieces down The Percy was a man of strength I tell you in this stound He smote the Douglas at the sword s length That he felled him to the ground The sword was sharp and sore did byte I tell you in certain To the heart he did him smite Thus was the Douglas slain The standards stood still on each side With many a grievous groan There they fought the day and all the night And many a doughty man was slone There was no freyke that there would fly But stiffly in stour did stand Echone hewing on other while they might dry With many a baleful brand There was slain upon the Scottes side For sooth and certainly Sir James of Douglas there was slain That day that he did die The Earl of Menteith he was slain Grysely groaned upon the ground Sir Davy Scot Sir Walter Steward Sir John of Agerstone Sir Charles Murray in that place That never a foot would fly Sir Hugh Maxwell a lord he was With the Douglas did he die There was slain upon the Scottes side For sooth as I you say Of four and forty thousand Scots Went but eighteen away There was slain upon the English side For sooth and certainly A gentle knight Sir John Fitzhugh It was the more pity Sir James Harebotell there was slain For him their hearts were sore The gentle Lovel there was slain That the Percy s standard bore There was slain upon the English side For sooth as I you say Of nine thousand Englishmen Five hundred came away The others were slayne in the field Christ keep their souls from woe Seeing there were so few friends Against so many a foe Then on the morn they made them biers Of birch and hazel gray Many a widow with weeping tears Their makes they fetch away This fray began at Otterburn Between the night and the day There the Douglas lost his life And the Percy was led away Then was there a Scottish prisoner ta en Sir Hugh Montgomery was his name For sooth as I you say He borrowed the Percy home again Now let us all for the Percy pray To Jesu most of might To bring his soul to the bliss of heaven For he was a gentle knight The Lament of the Border Widow My love he
