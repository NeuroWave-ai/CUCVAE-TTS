missus ABRAHAM LINCOLN OR THIRTY YEARS A SLAVE AND FOUR YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE NEW YORK G W Carleton company Publishers M DCCC LXVIII PREFACE I have often been asked to write my life as those who know me know that it has been an eventful one At last I have acceded to the importunities of my friends and have hastily sketched some of the striking incidents that go to make up my history My life so full of romance may sound like a dream to the matter of fact reader nevertheless everything I have written is strictly true much has been omitted but nothing has been exaggerated In writing as I have done I am well aware that I have invited criticism but before the critic judges harshly let my explanation be carefully read and weighed If I have portrayed the dark side of slavery I also have painted the bright side The good that I have said of human servitude should be thrown into the scales with the evil that I have said of it I have kind true hearted friends in the South as well as in the North and I would not wound those Southern friends by sweeping condemnation simply because I was once a slave They were not so much responsible for the curse under which I was born as the God of nature and the fathers who framed the Constitution for the United States The law descended to them and it was but natural that they should recognize it since it manifestly was their interest to do so And yet a wrong was inflicted upon me a cruel custom deprived me of my liberty and since I was robbed of my dearest right I would not have been human had I not rebelled against the robbery God rules the Universe I was a feeble instrument in His hands and through me and the enslaved millions of my race one of the problems was solved that belongs to the great problem of human destiny and the solution was developed so gradually that there was no great convulsion of the harmonies of natural laws A solemn truth was thrown to the surface and what is better still it was recognized as a truth by those who give force to moral laws An act may be wrong but unless the ruling power recognizes the wrong it is useless to hope for a correction of it Principles may be right but they are not established within an hour The masses are slow to reason and each principle to acquire moral force must come to us from the fire of the crucible the fire may inflict unjust punishment but then it purifies and renders stronger the principle not in itself but in the eyes of those who arrogate judgment to themselves When the war of the Revolution established the independence of the American colonies an evil was perpetuated slavery was more firmly established and since the evil had been planted it must pass through certain stages before it could be eradicated In fact we give but little thought to the plant of evil until it grows to such monstrous proportions that it overshadows important interests then the efforts to destroy it become earnest As one of the victims of slavery I drank of the bitter water but then since destiny willed it so and since I aided in bringing a solemn truth to the surface as a truth perhaps I have no right to complain Here as in all things pertaining to life I can afford to be charitable It may be charged that I have written too freely on some questions especially in regard to missus Lincoln I do not think so at least I have been prompted by the purest motive missus Lincoln by her own acts forced herself into notoriety She stepped beyond the formal lines which hedge about a private life and invited public criticism The people have judged her harshly and no woman was ever more traduced in the public prints of the country The people knew nothing of the secret history of her transactions therefore they judged her by what was thrown to the surface For an act may be wrong judged purely by itself but when the motive that prompted the act is understood it is construed differently I lay it down as an axiom that only that is criminal in the sight of God where crime is meditated missus Lincoln may have been imprudent but since her intentions were good she should be judged more kindly than she has been But the world do not know what her intentions were they have only been made acquainted with her acts without knowing what feeling guided her actions If the world are to judge her as I have judged her they must be introduced to the secret history of her transactions The veil of mystery must be drawn aside the origin of a fact must be brought to light with the naked fact itself If I have betrayed confidence in anything I have published it has been to place missus Lincoln in a better light before the world A breach of trust if breach it can be called of this kind is always excusable My own character as well as the character of missus Lincoln is at stake since I have been intimately associated with that lady in the most eventful periods of her life I have been her confidante and if evil charges are laid at her door they also must be laid at mine since I have been a party to all her movements To defend myself I must defend the lady that I have served The world have judged missus Lincoln by the facts which float upon the surface and through her have partially judged me and the only way to convince them that wrong was not meditated is to explain the motives that actuated us I have written nothing that can place missus Lincoln in a worse light before the world than the light in which she now stands therefore the secret history that I publish can do her no harm I have excluded everything of a personal character from her letters the extracts introduced only refer to public men and are such as to throw light upon her unfortunate adventure in New York These letters were not written for publication for which reason they are all the more valuable they are the frank overflowings of the heart the outcropping of impulse the key to genuine motives They prove the motive to have been pure and if they shall help to stifle the voice of calumny I am content I do not forget before the public journals vilified missus Lincoln that ladies who moved in the Washington circle in which she moved freely canvassed her character among themselves They gloated over many a tale of scandal that grew out of gossip in their own circle If these ladies could say everything bad of the wife of the President why should I not be permitted to lay her secret history bare especially when that history plainly shows that her life like all lives has its good side as well as its bad side None of us are perfect for which reason we should heed the voice of charity when it whispers in our ears Do not magnify the imperfections of others Had missus Lincoln s acts never become public property I should not have published to the world the secret chapters of her life I am not the special champion of the widow of our lamented President the reader of the pages which follow will discover that I have written with the utmost frankness in regard to her have exposed her faults as well as given her credit for honest motives I wish the world to judge her as she is free from the exaggerations of praise or scandal since I have been associated with her in so many things that have provoked hostile criticism and the judgment that the world may pass upon her I flatter myself will present my own actions in a better light ELIZABETH KECKLEY fourteen Carroll Place New York March fourteen eighteen sixty eight CHAPTER I WHERE I WAS BORN My life has been an eventful one I was born a slave was the child of slave parents therefore I came upon the earth free in God like thought but fettered in action 
6032_58192_000003_000002	train-clean-360	My birthplace was Dinwiddie Court House in Virginia 
6032_58192_000003_000003	train-clean-360	My recollections of childhood are distinct perhaps for the reason that many stirring incidents are associated with that period 
none	none	I am now on the shady side of forty and as I sit alone in my room the brain is busy and a rapidly moving panorama brings scene after scene before me some pleasant and others sad and when I thus greet old familiar faces I often find myself wondering if I am not living the past over again 
6032_58192_000003_000005	train-clean-360	The visions are so terribly distinct that I almost imagine them to be real 
none	none	Hour after hour I sit while the scenes are being shifted and as I gaze upon the panorama of the past I realize how crowded with incidents my life has been 
6032_58192_000003_000007	train-clean-360	Every day seems like a romance within itself and the years grow into ponderous volumes 
6032_58192_000003_000008	train-clean-360	As I cannot condense I must omit many strange passages in my history 
6032_58192_000003_000009	train-clean-360	From such a wilderness of events it is difficult to make a selection but as I am not writing altogether the history of myself I will confine my story to the most important incidents which I believe influenced the moulding of my character 
6032_58192_000003_000010	train-clean-360	As I glance over the crowded sea of the past these incidents stand forth prominently the guide posts of memory 
6032_58192_000003_000011	train-clean-360	I presume that I must have been four years old when I first began to remember at least I cannot now recall anything occurring previous to this period 
none	none	My master colonel 
6032_58192_000003_000013	train-clean-360	A Burwell was somewhat unsettled in his business affairs and while I was yet an infant he made several removals 
6032_58192_000003_000014	train-clean-360	While living at Hampton Sidney College Prince Edward County Va missus Burwell gave birth to a daughter a sweet black eyed baby my earliest and fondest pet 
6032_58192_000003_000015	train-clean-360	To take care of this baby was my first duty 
none	none	True I was but a child myself only four years old but then I had been raised in a hardy school had been taught to rely upon myself and to prepare myself to render assistance to others The lesson was not a bitter one for I was too young to indulge in philosophy and the precepts that I then treasured and practised I believe developed those principles of character which have enabled me to triumph over so many difficulties Notwithstanding all the wrongs that slavery heaped upon me I can bless it for one thing youth s important lesson of self reliance 
6032_58192_000003_000019	train-clean-360	The baby was named Elizabeth and it was pleasant to me to be assigned a duty in connection with it for the discharge of that duty transferred me from the rude cabin to the household of my master My simple attire was a short dress and a little white apron 
6032_58192_000003_000020	train-clean-360	My old mistress encouraged me in rocking the cradle by telling me that if I would watch over the baby well keep the flies out of its face and not let it cry I should be its little maid 
6032_58192_000003_000021	train-clean-360	This was a golden promise and I required no better inducement for the faithful performance of my task I began to rock the cradle most industriously when lo out pitched little pet on the floor 
none	none	I instantly cried out Oh the baby is on the floor and not knowing what to do I seized the fire shovel in my perplexity and was trying to shovel up my tender charge when my mistress called to me to let the child alone and then ordered that I be taken out and lashed for my carelessness The blows were not administered with a light hand I assure you and doubtless the severity of the lashing has made me remember the incident so well 
6032_58192_000003_000024	train-clean-360	This was the first time I was punished in this cruel way but not the last 
6032_58192_000003_000025	train-clean-360	The black eyed baby that I called my pet grew into a self willed girl and in after years was the cause of much trouble to me 
none	none	I grew strong and healthy and notwithstanding I knit socks and attended to various kinds of work I was repeatedly told when even fourteen years old that I would never be worth my salt 
6032_58192_000003_000027	train-clean-360	When I was eight mister Burwell s family consisted of six sons and four daughters with a large family of servants 
none	none	My mother was kind and forbearing missus Burwell a hard task master and as mother had so much work to do in making clothes et cetera for the family besides the slaves I determined to render her all the assistance in my power and in rendering her such assistance my young energies were taxed to the utmost 
6032_58192_000003_000029	train-clean-360	I was my mother s only child which made her love for me all the stronger 
none	none	I did not know much of my father for he was the slave of another man and when mister Burwell moved from Dinwiddie he was separated from us and only allowed to visit my mother twice a year during the Easter holidays and Christmas 
6032_58192_000003_000031	train-clean-360	At last mister Burwell determined to reward my mother by making an arrangement with the owner of my father by which the separation of my parents could be brought to an end 
none	none	It was a bright day indeed for my mother when it was announced that my father was coming to live with us The old weary look faded from her face and she worked as if her heart was in every task 
6032_58192_000003_000034	train-clean-360	But the golden days did not last long 
none	none	The radiant dream faded all too soon In the morning my father called me to him and kissed me then held me out at arms length as if he were regarding his child with pride She is growing into a large fine girl he remarked to my mother I dun no which I like best you or Lizzie as both are so dear to me My mother s name was Agnes and my father delighted to call me his Little Lizzie While yet my father and mother were speaking hopefully joyfully of the future mister Burwell came to the cabin with a letter in his hand He was a kind master in some things and as gently as possible informed my parents that they must part for in two hours my father must join his master at Dinwiddie and go with him to the West where he had determined to make his future home The announcement fell upon the little circle in that rude log cabin like a thunderbolt I can remember the scene as if it were but yesterday how my father cried out against the cruel separation his last kiss his wild straining of my mother to his bosom the solemn prayer to Heaven the tears and sobs the fearful anguish of broken hearts The last kiss the last good by and he my father was gone gone forever 
6032_58192_000004_000007	train-clean-360	The shadow eclipsed the sunshine and love brought despair 
6032_58192_000004_000008	train-clean-360	The parting was eternal 
none	none	The cloud had no silver lining but I trust that it will be all silver in heaven 
6032_58192_000004_000010	train-clean-360	We who are crushed to earth with heavy chains who travel a weary rugged thorny road groping through midnight darkness on earth earn our right to enjoy the sunshine in the great hereafter 
none	none	At the grave at least we should be permitted to lay our burdens down that a new world a world of brightness may open to us The light that is denied us here should grow into a flood of effulgence beyond the dark mysterious shadows of death Deep as was the distress of my mother in parting with my father her sorrow did not screen her from insult 
6032_58192_000004_000014	train-clean-360	My old mistress said to her Stop your nonsense there is no necessity for you putting on airs 
6032_58192_000004_000015	train-clean-360	Your husband is not the only slave that has been sold from his family and you are not the only one that has had to part 
none	none	There are plenty more men about here and if you want a husband so badly stop your crying and go and find another To these unfeeling words my mother made no reply 
6032_58192_000004_000017	train-clean-360	She turned away in stoical silence with a curl of that loathing scorn upon her lips which swelled in her heart 
none	none	My father and mother never met again in this world 
6032_58192_000005_000001	train-clean-360	They kept up a regular correspondence for years and the most precious mementoes of my existence are the faded old letters that he wrote full of love and always hoping that the future would bring brighter days 
none	none	In nearly every letter is a message for me Tell my darling little Lizzie he writes to be a good girl and to learn her book Kiss her for me and tell her that I will come to see her some day Thus he wrote time and again but he never came He lived in hope but died without ever seeing his wife and child 
6032_58192_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I note a few extracts from one of my father s letters to my mother following copy literally

6032_58192_000012_000001	train-clean-360	We were living at Prince Edward in Virginia and master had just purchased his hogs for the winter for which he was unable to pay in full 
6032_58192_000012_000002	train-clean-360	To escape from his embarrassment it was necessary to sell one of the slaves 
6032_58192_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Little Joe the son of the cook was selected as the victim 
6032_58192_000012_000004	train-clean-360	His mother was ordered to dress him up in his Sunday clothes and send him to the house 
6032_58192_000012_000005	train-clean-360	He came in with a bright face was placed in the scales and was sold like the hogs at so much per pound His mother was kept in ignorance of the transaction but her suspicions were aroused 
none	none	When her son started for Petersburgh in the wagon the truth began to dawn upon her mind and she pleaded piteously that her boy should not be taken from her but master quieted her by telling her that he was simply going to town with the wagon and would be back in the morning Morning came but little Joe did not return to his mother Morning after morning passed and the mother went down to the grave without ever seeing her child again 
6032_58192_000012_000008	train-clean-360	One day she was whipped for grieving for her lost boy 
none	none	Colonel Burwell never liked to see one of his slaves wear a sorrowful face and those who offended in this particular way were always punished Alas the sunny face of the slave is not always an indication of sunshine in the heart 
6032_58192_000012_000011	train-clean-360	Colonel Burwell at one time owned about seventy slaves all of which were sold and in a majority of instances wives were separated from husbands and children from their parents 
none	none	Slavery in the Border States forty years ago was different from what it was twenty years ago 
6032_58192_000012_000013	train-clean-360	Time seemed to soften the hearts of master and mistress and to insure kinder and more humane treatment to bondsmen and bondswomen 
6032_58192_000012_000014	train-clean-360	When I was quite a child an incident occurred which my mother afterward impressed more strongly on my mind 
6032_58192_000012_000015	train-clean-360	One of my uncles a slave of Colonel Burwell lost a pair of ploughlines and when the loss was made known the master gave him a new pair and told him that if he did not take care of them he would punish him severely 
none	none	In a few weeks the second pair of lines was stolen and my uncle hung himself rather than meet the displeasure of his master 
6032_58192_000012_000017	train-clean-360	My mother went to the spring in the morning for a pail of water and on looking up into the willow tree which shaded the bubbling crystal stream she discovered the lifeless form of her brother suspended beneath one of the strong branches 
6032_58192_000012_000018	train-clean-360	Rather than be punished the way Colonel Burwell punished his servants he took his own life 
none	none	Slavery had its dark side as well as its bright side CHAPTER II GIRLHOOD AND ITS SORROWS I must pass rapidly over the stirring events of my early life When I was about fourteen years old I went to live with my master s eldest son a Presbyterian minister His salary was small and he was burdened with a helpless wife a girl that he had married in the humble walks of life She was morbidly sensitive and imagined that I regarded her with contemptuous feelings because she was of poor parentage I was their only servant and a gracious loan at that They were not able to buy me so my old master sought to render them assistance by allowing them the benefit of my services From the very first I did the work of three servants and yet I was scolded and regarded with distrust 
4731_58193_000002_000006	train-clean-360	The years passed slowly and I continued to serve them and at the same time grew into strong healthy womanhood 
none	none	I was nearly eighteen when we removed from Virginia to Hillsboro North Carolina where young mister Burwell took charge of a church 
4731_58193_000002_000008	train-clean-360	The salary was small and we still had to practise the closest economy 
none	none	mister Bingham a hard cruel man the village schoolmaster was a member of my young master s church and he was a frequent visitor to the parsonage She whom I called mistress seemed to be desirous to wreak vengeance on me for something and Bingham became her ready tool During this time my master was unusually kind to me he was naturally a good hearted man but was influenced by his wife It was Saturday evening and while I was bending over the bed watching the baby that I had just hushed into slumber mister Bingham came to the door and asked me to go with him to his study Wondering what he meant by his strange request I followed him and when we had entered the study he closed the door and in his blunt way remarked Lizzie I am going to flog you I was thunderstruck and tried to think if I had been remiss in anything I could not recollect of doing anything to deserve punishment and with surprise exclaimed Whip me mister Bingham what for No matter he replied I am going to whip you so take down your dress this instant Recollect I was eighteen years of age was a woman fully developed and yet this man coolly bade me take down my dress 
4731_58193_000004_000001	train-clean-360	I drew myself up proudly firmly and said No mister Bingham I shall not take down my dress before you 
none	none	Moreover you shall not whip me unless you prove the stronger Nobody has a right to whip me but my own master and nobody shall do so if I can prevent it 
4731_58193_000005_000000	train-clean-360	My words seemed to exasperate him 
4731_58193_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He seized a rope caught me roughly and tried to tie me 
none	none	I resisted with all my strength but he was the stronger of the two and after a hard struggle succeeded in binding my hands and tearing my dress from my back 
4731_58193_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Then he picked up a rawhide and began to ply it freely over my shoulders 
none	none	With steady hand and practised eye he would raise the instrument of torture nerve himself for a blow and with fearful force the rawhide descended upon the quivering flesh 
4731_58193_000005_000005	train-clean-360	It cut the skin raised great welts and the warm blood trickled down my back 
4731_58193_000005_000006	train-clean-360	Oh God 
none	none	I can feel the torture now the terrible excruciating agony of those moments I did not scream I was too proud to let my tormentor know what I was suffering I closed my lips firmly that not even a groan might escape from them and I stood like a statue while the keen lash cut deep into my flesh As soon as I was released stunned with pain bruised and bleeding I went home and rushed into the presence of the pastor and his wife wildly exclaiming Master Robert why did you let mister Bingham flog me What have I done that I should be so punished
4731_58193_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Go away he gruffly answered do not bother me 
4731_58193_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I would not be put off thus 
none	none	What have I done I will know why I have been flogged I saw his cheeks flush with anger but I did not move He rose to his feet and on my refusing to go without an explanation seized a chair struck me and felled me to the floor I rose bewildered almost dead with pain crept to my room dressed my bruised arms and back as best I could and then lay down but not to sleep 
4731_58193_000008_000003	train-clean-360	No I could not sleep for I was suffering mental as well as bodily torture 
none	none	My spirit rebelled against the unjustness that had been inflicted upon me and though I tried to smother my anger and to forgive those who had been so cruel to me it was impossible The next morning I was more calm and I believe that I could then have forgiven everything for the sake of one kind word But the kind word was not proffered and it may be possible that I grew somewhat wayward and sullen Though I had faults I know now as I felt then harshness was the poorest inducement for the correction of them It seems that mister Bingham had pledged himself to missus Burwell to subdue what he called my stubborn pride On Friday following the Saturday on which I was so savagely beaten mister Bingham again directed me come to his study I went but with the determination to offer resistance should he attempt to flog me again On entering the room I found him prepared with a new rope and a new cowhide I told him that I was ready to die but that he could not conquer me In struggling with him I bit his finger severely when he seized a heavy stick and beat me with it in a shameful manner Again I went home sore and bleeding but with pride as strong and defiant as ever The following Thursday mister Bingham again tried to conquer me but in vain 
4731_58193_000008_000015	train-clean-360	We struggled and he struck me many savage blows 
none	none	As I stood bleeding before him nearly exhausted with his efforts he burst into tears and declared that it would be a sin to beat me any more My suffering at last subdued his hard heart he asked my forgiveness and afterwards was an altered man He was never known to strike one of his servants from that day forward mister Burwell he who preached the love of Heaven who glorified the precepts and examples of Christ who expounded the Holy Scriptures Sabbath after Sabbath from the pulpit when mister Bingham refused to whip me any more was urged by his wife to punish me himself One morning he went to the wood pile took an oak broom cut the handle off and with this heavy handle attempted to conquer me I fought him but he proved the strongest At the sight of my bleeding form his wife fell upon her knees and begged him to desist

none	none	There have been six weddings since October the most respectable one was about a fortnight ago I was asked to be the first attendant but as usual with all my expectations I was disappointed for on the wedding day I felt more like being locked up in a three cornered box than attending a wedding About a week before Christmas I was bridesmaid for Ann Nash when the night came I was in quite a trouble I did not know whether my frock was clean or dirty I only had a week s notice and the body and sleeves to make and only one hour every night to work on it so you can see with these troubles to overcome my chance was rather slim I must now close although I could fill ten pages with my griefs and misfortunes no tongue could express them as I feel don t forget me though and answer my letters soon I will write you again and would write more now but Miss Anna says it is time I had finished Tell Miss Elizabeth that I wish she would make haste and get married for mistress says that I belong to her when she gets married I wish you would send me a pretty frock this summer if you will send it to missus Robertson s Miss Bet will send it to me Farewell darling mother Your affectionate daughter ELIZABETH HOBBS Footnote A March eighteen sixty eight CHAPTER III HOW I GAINED MY FREEDOM The years passed and brought many changes to me but on these I will not dwell as I wish to hasten to the most interesting part of my story My troubles in North Carolina were brought to an end by my unexpected return to Virginia where I lived with mister Garland who had married Miss Ann e Burwell one of my old master s daughters His life was not a prosperous one and after struggling with the world for several years he left his native State a disappointed man He moved to saint Louis hoping to improve his fortune in the West but ill luck followed him there and he seemed to be unable to escape from the influence of the evil star of his destiny When his family myself included joined him in his new home on the banks of the Mississippi we found him so poor that he was unable to pay the dues on a letter advertised as in the post office for him The necessities of the family were so great that it was proposed to place my mother out at service The idea was shocking to me Every gray hair in her old head was dear to me and I could not bear the thought of her going to work for strangers She had been raised in the family had watched the growth of each child from infancy to maturity they had been the objects of her kindest care and she was wound round about them as the vine winds itself about the rugged oak They had been the central figures in her dream of life a dream beautiful to her since she had basked in the sunshine of no other And now they proposed to destroy each tendril of affection to cloud the sunshine of her existence when the day was drawing to a close when the shadows of solemn night were rapidly approaching My mother my poor aged mother go among strangers to toil for a living No a thousand times no I would rather work my fingers to the bone bend over my sewing till the film of blindness gathered in my eyes nay even beg from street to street I told mister Garland so and he gave me permission to see what I could do I was fortunate in obtaining work and in a short time I had acquired something of a reputation as a seamstress and dress maker The best ladies in saint Louis were my patrons and when my reputation was once established I never lacked for orders With my needle I kept bread in the mouths of seventeen persons for two years and five months While I was working so hard that others might live in comparative comfort and move in those circles of society to which their birth gave them entrance the thought often occurred to me whether I was really worth my salt or not and then perhaps the lips curled with a bitter sneer It may seem strange that I should place so much emphasis upon words thoughtlessly idly spoken but then we do many strange things in life and cannot always explain the motives that actuate us The heavy task was too much for me and my health began to give way About this time mister Keckley whom I had met in Virginia and learned to regard with more than friendship came to saint Louis He sought my hand in marriage and for a long time I refused to consider his proposal for I could not bear the thought of bringing children into slavery of adding one single recruit to the millions bound to hopeless servitude fettered and shackled with chains stronger and heavier than manacles of iron I made a proposition to buy myself and son the proposition was bluntly declined and I was commanded never to broach the subject again I would not be put off thus for hope pointed to a freer brighter life in the future Why should my son be held in slavery I often asked myself He came into the world through no will of mine and yet God only knows how I loved him The Anglo Saxon blood as well as the African flowed in his veins the two currents commingled one singing of freedom the other silent and sullen with generations of despair Why should not the Anglo Saxon triumph why should it be weighed down with the rich blood typical of the tropics Must the life current of one race bind the other race in chains as strong and enduring as if there had been no Anglo Saxon taint By the laws of God and nature as interpreted by man one half of my boy was free and why should not this fair birthright of freedom remove the curse from the other half raise it into the bright joyous sunshine of liberty I could not answer these questions of my heart that almost maddened me and I learned to regard human philosophy with distrust Much as I respected the authority of my master I could not remain silent on a subject that so nearly concerned me One day when I insisted on knowing whether he would permit me to purchase myself and what price I must pay for myself he turned to me in a petulant manner thrust his hand into his pocket drew forth a bright silver quarter of a dollar and proffering it to me said Lizzie I have told you often not to trouble me with such a question If you really wish to leave me take this it will pay the passage of yourself and boy on the ferry boat and when you are on the other side of the river you will be free It is the cheapest way that I know of to accomplish what you desire I looked at him in astonishment and earnestly replied No master I do not wish to be free in such a manner If such had been my wish I should never have troubled you about obtaining your consent to my purchasing myself I can cross the river any day as you well know and have frequently done so but will never leave you in such a manner By the laws of the land I am your slave you are my master and I will only be free by such means as the laws of the country provide He expected this answer and I knew that he was pleased Some time afterwards he told me that he had reconsidered the question that I had served his family faithfully that I deserved my freedom and that he would take twelve hundred dollars for myself and boy This was joyful intelligence for me and the reflection of hope gave a silver lining to the dark cloud of my life faint it is true but still a silver lining Taking a prospective glance at liberty I consented to marry The wedding was a great event in the family The ceremony took place in the parlor in the presence of the family and a number of guests mister Garland gave me away and the pastor Bishop Hawks performed the ceremony who had solemnized the bridals of mister G s own children The day was a happy one but it faded all too soon mister Keckley let me speak kindly of his faults proved dissipated and a burden instead of a help mate More than all I learned that he was a slave instead of a free man as he represented himself to be With the simple explanation that I lived with him eight years let charity draw around him the mantle of silence I went to work in earnest to purchase my freedom but the years passed and I was still a slave mister Garland s family claimed so much of my attention in fact I supported them that I was not able to accumulate anything In the mean time mister Garland died and mister Burwell a Mississippi planter came to saint Louis to settle up the estate He was a kind hearted man and said I should be free and would afford me every facility to raise the necessary amount to pay the price of my liberty Several schemes were urged upon me by my friends At last I formed a resolution to go to New York state my case and appeal to the benevolence of the people The plan seemed feasible and I made preparations to carry it out When I was almost ready to turn my face northward missus Garland told me that she would require the names of six gentlemen who would vouch for my return and become responsible for the amount at which I was valued I had many friends in saint Louis and as I believed that they had confidence in me I felt that I could readily obtain the names desired I started out stated my case and obtained five signatures to the paper and my heart throbbed with pleasure for I did not believe that the sixth would refuse me I called he listened patiently then remarked Yes yes Lizzie the scheme is a fair one and you shall have my name But I shall bid you good by when you start Good by for a short time I ventured to add No good by for all time and he looked at me as if he would read my very soul with his eyes I was startled What do you mean mister Farrow Surely you do not think that I do not mean to come back No No what then Simply this you mean to come back that is you mean so now but you never will When you reach New York the abolitionists will tell you what savages we are and they will prevail on you to stay there and we shall never see you again But I assure you mister Farrow you are mistaken I not only mean to come back but will come back and pay every cent of the twelve hundred dollars for myself and child I was beginning to feel sick at heart for I could not accept the signature of this man when he had no faith in my pledges No slavery eternal slavery rather than be regarded with distrust by those whose respect I esteemed But I am not mistaken he persisted Time will show When you start for the North I shall bid you good by The heart grew heavy Every ray of sunshine was eclipsed With humbled pride weary step tearful face and a dull aching pain I left the house I walked along the street mechanically The cloud had no silver lining now The rosebuds of hope had withered and died without lifting up their heads to receive the dew kiss of morning There was no morning for me all was night dark night I reached my own home and weeping threw myself upon the bed My trunk was packed my luncheon was prepared by mother the cars were ready to bear me where I would not hear the clank of chains where I would breathe the free invigorating breezes of the glorious North I had dreamed such a happy dream in imagination had drunk of the water the pure sweet crystal water of life but now now the flowers had withered before my eyes darkness had settled down upon me like a pall and I was left alone with cruel mocking shadows The first paroxysm of grief was scarcely over when a carriage stopped in front of the house missus Le Bourgois one of my kind patrons got out of it and entered the door She seemed to bring sunshine with her handsome cheery face She came to where I was and in her sweet way said Lizzie I hear that you are going to New York to beg for money to buy your freedom I have been thinking over the matter and told Ma it would be a shame to allow you to go North to beg for what we should give you You have many friends in saint Louis and I am going to raise the twelve hundred dollars required among them I have two hundred dollars put away for a present am indebted to you one hundred dollars mother owes you fifty dollars and will add another fifty to it and as I do not want the present I will make the money a present to you Don t start for New York now until I see what I can do among your friends Like a ray of sunshine she came and like a ray of sunshine she went away The flowers no longer were withered drooping Again they seemed to bud and grow in fragrance and beauty missus Le Bourgois God bless her dear good heart was more than successful The twelve hundred dollars were raised and at last my son and myself were free Free free what a glorious ring to the word Free the bitter heart struggle was over Free the soul could go out to heaven and to God with no chains to clog its flight or pull it down Free the earth wore a brighter look and the very stars seemed to sing with joy Yes free free by the laws of man and the smile of God and Heaven bless them who made me so The following copied from the original papers contain in brief the history of my emancipation I promise to give Lizzie and her son George their freedom on the payment

6106-58195-0002	train-other-500	and feeling exhausted with work I determined to make a change I had a conversation with mister Keckley informed him that since he persisted in dissipation we must separate
none	none	 that I was going North 
6106-58195-0003	train-other-500	and that I should never live with him again at least until I had good evidence of his reform He was rapidly debasing himself and although I was willing to work for him I was not willing to share his degradation Poor man he had his faults
6106-58195-0004	train-other-500	but over these faults death has drawn a veil My husband is now sleeping in his grave and in the silent grave I would bury all unpleasant memories of him I left saint Louis in the spring of eighteen sixty
6106-58195-0005	train-other-500	taking the cars direct for Baltimore where I stopped six weeks attempting to realize a sum of money by forming classes of young colored women and teaching them my system of cutting and fitting dresses The scheme was not successful
6106-58195-0006	train-other-500	for after six weeks of labor and vexation I left Baltimore with scarcely money enough to pay my fare to Washington Arriving in the capital I sought and obtained work at two dollars and a half per day However
6106-58195-0007	train-other-500	as I was notified that I could only remain in the city ten days without obtaining a license to do so such being the law and as I did not know whom to apply to for assistance I was sorely troubled
none	none	 I also had to have some one vouch to the authorities that I was a free woman 
6106-58195-0008	train-other-500	My means were too scanty and my profession too precarious to warrant my purchasing a license In my perplexity I called on a lady for whom I was sewing Miss Ringold
none	none	 a member of general Mason s family from Virginia 
6106-58195-0009	train-other-500	I stated my case and she kindly volunteered to render me all the assistance in her power She called on Mayor Burritt with me and Miss Ringold succeeded in making an arrangement for me to remain in Washington
6106-58195-0010	train-other-500	without paying the sum required for a license moreover I was not to be molested I rented apartments in a good locality and soon had a good run of custom The summer passed winter came
none	none	 and I was still in Washington 
6106-58195-0011	train-other-500	missus Davis wife of Senator Jefferson Davis came from the South in November of eighteen sixty with her husband Learning that missus Davis wanted a modiste I presented myself
6106-58195-0012	train-other-500	and was employed by her on the recommendation of one of my patrons and her intimate friend missus Captain Hetsill I went to the house to work
none	none	 but finding that they were such late risers 
6106-58195-0013	train-other-500	and as I had to fit many dresses on missus Davis I told her that I should prefer giving half the day to her working the other in my own room for some of my other lady patrons missus D consented to the proposition
none	none	 and it was arranged that I should come to her own house every day after twelve M It was the winter before the breaking out of that fierce and bloody war between the two sections of the country 
6106-58195-0014	train-other-500	and as mister Davis occupied a leading position his house was the resort of politicians and statesmen from the South Almost every night as I learned from the servants and other members of the family
6106-58195-0015	train-other-500	secret meetings were held at the house and some of these meetings were protracted to a very late hour The prospects of war were freely discussed in my presence
none	none	 by mister and missus Davis and their friends 
6106-58195-0016	train-other-500	The holidays were approaching and missus Davis kept me busy in manufacturing articles of dress for herself and children She desired to present mister Davis on Christmas
none	none	 with a handsome dressing gown The material was purchased 
6106-58195-0017	train-other-500	and for weeks the work had been under way Christmas eve came and the gown had been laid aside so often that it was still unfinished I saw that missus D was anxious to have it completed so I volunteered to remain and work on it
6106-58195-0018	train-other-500	Wearily the hours dragged on but there was no rest for my busy fingers I persevered in my task notwithstanding my head was aching missus Davis was busy in the adjoining room
6106-58195-0019	train-other-500	arranging the Christmas tree for the children I looked at the clock and the hands pointed to a quarter of twelve I was arranging the cords on the gown when the Senator came in he looked somewhat careworn and his step seemed to be a little nervous
6106-58195-0020	train-other-500	He leaned against the door and expressed his admiration of the Christmas tree but there was no smile on his face Turning round he saw me sitting in the adjoining room and quickly exclaimed That you Lizzie
none	none	 why are you here so late 
6106-58195-0021	train-other-500	Still at work I hope that missus Davis is not too exacting No sir I answered missus Davis was very anxious to have this gown finished to night and I volunteered to remain and complete it
6106-58195-0022	train-other-500	Well well the case must be urgent and he came slowly towards me took the gown in his hand and asked the color of the silk as he said the gas light was so deceptive to his old eyes
none	none	 It is a drab changeable silk mister Davis I answered 
6106-58195-0023	train-other-500	and might have added that it was rich and handsome but did not well knowing that he would make the discovery in the morning He smiled curiously but turned and walked from the room without another question He inferred that the gown was for him
6106-58195-0024	train-other-500	that it was to be the Christmas present from his wife and he did not wish to destroy the pleasure that she would experience
none	none	 in believing that the gift would prove a surprise 
6106-58195-0025	train-other-500	In this respect as in many others he always appeared to me as a thoughtful considerate man in the domestic circle As the clock struck twelve I finished the gown little dreaming of the future that was before it
6106-58195-0026	train-other-500	It was worn I have not the shadow of a doubt by mister Davis during the stormy years that he was the President of the Confederate States The holidays passed and before the close of January the war was discussed in mister Davis s family
6106-58195-0027	train-other-500	as an event certain to happen in the future missus Davis was warmly attached to Washington and I often heard her say that she disliked the idea of breaking up old associations and going South to suffer from trouble and deprivation
6106-58195-0028	train-other-500	One day while discussing the question in my presence with one of her intimate friends she exclaimed I would rather remain in Washington and be kicked about than go South and be missus President
none	none	 Her friend expressed surprise at the remark and missus Davis insisted that the opinion was an honest one 
6106-58195-0029	train-other-500	While dressing her one day she said to me Lizzie you are so very handy that I should like to take you South with me When do you go South missus Davis I inquired Oh I cannot tell just now but it will be soon
none	none	 You know there is going to be war Lizzie 
6106-58195-0030	train-other-500	No But I tell you yes Who will go to war I asked The North and South was her ready reply The Southern people will not submit to the humiliating demands of the Abolition party they will fight first
none	none	 And which do you think will whip The South of course 
6106-58195-0031	train-other-500	The South is impulsive is in earnest and the Southern soldiers will fight to conquer The North will yield when it sees the South is in earnest rather than engage in a long and bloody war But missus Davis
none	none	 are you certain that there will be war 
6106-58195-0032	train-other-500	Certain I know it You had better go South with me I will take good care of you Besides when the war breaks out the colored people will suffer in the North The Northern people will look upon them as the cause of the war
6106-58195-0033	train-other-500	and I fear in their exasperation will be inclined to treat you harshly Then I may come back to Washington in a few months and live in the White House The Southern people talk of choosing mister Davis for their President
6106-58195-0034	train-other-500	In fact it may be considered settled that he will be their President
none	none	 As soon as we go South and secede from the other States 
6106-58195-0035	train-other-500	we will raise an army and march on Washington and then I shall live in the White House I was bewildered with what I heard I had served missus Davis faithfully and she had learned to place the greatest confidence in me
6106-58195-0036	train-other-500	At first I was almost tempted to go South with her for her reasoning seemed plausible At the time the conversation was closed with my promise to consider the question I thought over the question much and the more I thought
6106-58195-0037	train-other-500	the less inclined I felt to accept the proposition so kindly made by missus Davis I knew the North to be strong and believed that the people would fight for the flag that they pretended to venerate so highly
6106-58195-0038	train-other-500	The Republican party had just emerged from a heated campaign flushed with victory and I could not think that the hosts composing the party would quietly yield all they had gained in the Presidential canvass
6106-58195-0039	train-other-500	A show of war from the South I felt would lead to actual war in the North and with the two sections bitterly arrayed against each other I preferred to cast my lot among the people of the North I parted with missus Davis kindly
6106-58195-0040	train-other-500	half promising to join her in the South if further deliberation should induce me to change my views A few weeks before she left Washington I made two chintz wrappers for her She said that she must give up expensive dressing for a while
none	none	 and that she with the Southern people 
6106-58195-0041	train-other-500	now that war was imminent must learn to practise lessons of economy She left some fine needle work in my hands which I finished and forwarded to her at Montgomery Alabama in the month of June through the assistance of missus Emory
6106-58195-0042	train-other-500	one of her oldest and best friends Since bidding them good by at Washington early in the year eighteen sixty I have never met any of the Davis family Years of excitement years of bloodshed
6106-58195-0043	train-other-500	and hundreds of thousands of graves intervene between the months I spent in the family and now The years have brought many changes and in view of these terrible changes
none	none	 even I who was once a slave 
6106-58195-0044	train-other-500	who have been punished with the cruel lash who have experienced the heart and soul tortures of a slave s life can say to mister Jefferson Davis Peace you have suffered Go in peace
6106-58195-0045	train-other-500	In the winter of eighteen sixty five I was in Chicago and one day visited the great charity fair
6106-58195-0046	train-other-500	held for the benefit of the families of those soldiers who were killed or wounded during the war In one part of the building was a wax figure of Jefferson Davis wearing over his other garments
none	none	 the dress in which it was reported that he was captured 
6106-58195-0047	train-other-500	There was always a great crowd around this figure and I was naturally attracted towards it I worked my way to the figure and in examining the dress made the pleasing discovery that it was one of the chintz wrappers that I had made for missus Davis
6106-58195-0048	train-other-500	a short time before she departed from Washington for the South When it was announced that I recognized the dress as one that I had made for the wife of the late Confederate President there was great cheering and excitement and I at once became the object of the deepest curiosity
6106-58195-0049	train-other-500	Great crowds followed me and in order to escape from the embarrassing situation I left the building I believe it now is pretty well established that mister Davis had on a water proof cloak instead of a dress as first reported
6106-58195-0050	train-other-500	when he was captured This does not invalidate any portion of my story The dress on the wax figure at the fair in Chicago unquestionably was one of the chintz wrappers that I made for missus Davis in January eighteen sixty in Washington
6106-58195-0051	train-other-500	and I infer since it was not found on the body of the fugitive President of the South it was taken from the trunks of missus Davis captured at the same time
none	none	 Be this as it may the coincidence is none the less striking and curious CHAPTER V MY INTRODUCTION TO missus LINCOLN 
6106-58196-0000	train-other-500	Ever since arriving in Washington I had a great desire to work for the ladies of the White House and to accomplish this end I was ready to make almost any sacrifice consistent with propriety Work came in slowly
6106-58196-0001	train-other-500	and I was beginning to feel very much embarrassed for I did not know how I was to meet the bills staring me in the face
none	none	 It is true the bills were small but then they were formidable to me who had little or nothing to pay them with 
6106-58196-0002	train-other-500	While in this situation I called at the Ringolds where I met missus Captain Lee missus L was in a state bordering on excitement as the great event of the season the dinner party given in honor of the Prince of Wales
6106-58196-0003	train-other-500	was soon to come off and she must have a dress suitable for the occasion The silk had been purchased but a dress maker had not yet been found Miss Ringold recommended me and I received the order to make the dress
6106-58196-0004	train-other-500	When I called on missus Lee the next day her husband was in the room and handing me a roll of bank bills amounting to one hundred dollars he requested me to purchase the trimmings and to spare no expense in making a selection
none	none	 With the money in my pocket I went out in the street entered the store of Harper Mitchell and asked to look at their laces mister Harper waited on me himself and was polite and kind 
6106-58196-0006	train-other-500	When I asked permission to carry the laces to missus Lee in order to learn whether she could approve my selection or not he gave a ready assent When I reminded him that I was a stranger
none	none	 and that the goods were valuable 
6106-58196-0007	train-other-500	he remarked that he was not afraid to trust me that he believed my face was the index to an honest heart It was pleasant to be spoken to thus and I shall never forget the kind words of mister Harper I often recall them
6106-58196-0008	train-other-500	for they are associated with the dawn of a brighter period in my dark life I purchased the trimmings and mister Harper allowed me a commission of twenty five dollars on the purchase The dress was done in time and it gave complete satisfaction
6106-58196-0009	train-other-500	missus Lee attracted great attention at the dinner party and her elegant dress proved a good card for me I received numerous orders and was relieved from all pecuniary embarrassments
none	none	 One of my patrons was missus general McClean a daughter of general Sumner One day when I was very busy missus McC drove up to my apartments came in where I was engaged with my needle and in her emphatic way said Lizzie I am invited to dine at Willard s on next Sunday 
6106-58196-0011	train-other-500	and positively I have not a dress fit to wear on the occasion I have just purchased material and you must commence work on it right away
none	none	 But missus McClean I replied 
6106-58196-0012	train-other-500	I have more work now promised than I can do It is impossible for me to make a dress for you to wear on Sunday next Pshaw Nothing is impossible I must have the dress made by Sunday and she spoke with some impatience
6106-58196-0013	train-other-500	I am sorry I began but she interrupted me Now don t say no again I tell you that you must make the dress I have often heard you say that you would like to work for the ladies of the White House Well I have it in my power to obtain you this privilege
6106-58196-0014	train-other-500	I know missus Lincoln well and you shall make a dress for her provided you finish mine in time to wear at dinner on Sunday The inducement was the best that could have been offered I would undertake the dress
6106-58196-0015	train-other-500	if I should have to sit up all night every night to make my pledge good I sent out and employed assistants and after much worry and trouble
none	none	 the dress was completed to the satisfaction of missus McClean 
6106-58196-0016	train-other-500	It appears that missus Lincoln had upset a cup of coffee on the dress she designed wearing on the evening of the reception after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States which rendered it necessary
none	none	 that she should have a new one for the occasion On asking missus McClean who her dress maker was that lady promptly informed her Lizzie Keckley Lizzie Keckley The name is familiar to me 
6106-58196-0018	train-other-500	She used to work for some of my lady friends in saint Louis and they spoke well of her Can you recommend her to me With confidence Shall I send her to you If you please I shall feel under many obligations for your kindness The next Sunday
none	none	 missus McClean sent me a message to call at her house at four o clock P M that day As she did not state why I was to call I determined to wait till Monday morning Monday morning came and nine o clock found me at missus McC s house 
6106-58196-0020	train-other-500	The streets of the capital were thronged with people for this was Inauguration day A new President a man of the people from the broad prairies of the West was to accept the solemn oath of office was to assume the responsibilities
6106-58196-0021	train-other-500	attached to the high position of Chief Magistrate of the United States Never was such deep interest felt in the inauguration proceedings as was felt today for threats of assassination had been made
6106-58196-0022	train-other-500	and every breeze from the South came heavily laden with the rumors of war Around Willard s hotel swayed an excited crowd and it was with the utmost difficulty that I worked my way to the house on the opposite side of the street
none	none	 occupied by the McCleans missus McClean was out but presently an aide on General McClean s staff called and informed me that I was wanted at Willard s I crossed the street and on entering the hotel was met by missus McClean who greeted me Lizzie why did you not come yesterday as I requested missus Lincoln wanted to see you but I fear that now you are too late I am sorry missus McClean 
6106-58196-0025	train-other-500	You did not say what you wanted with me yesterday so I judged that this morning would do as well You should have come yesterday she insisted Go up to missus Lincoln s room giving me the number she may find use for you yet
6106-58196-0026	train-other-500	With a nervous step I passed on and knocked at missus Lincoln s door A cheery voice bade me come in and a lady inclined to stoutness about forty years of age stood before me You are Lizzie Keckley I believe
none	none	 I bowed assent The dress maker that missus McClean recommended Yes madam Very well I have not time to talk to you now but would like to have you call at the White House at eight o clock to morrow morning where I shall then be 
6106-58196-0028	train-other-500	I bowed myself out of the room and returned to my apartments The day passed slowly for I could not help but speculate in relation to the appointed interview for the morrow My long cherished hope was about to be realized
6106-58196-0029	train-other-500	and I could not rest Tuesday morning at eight o clock I crossed the threshold of the White House for the first time I was shown into a waiting room and informed that missus Lincoln was at breakfast
6106-58196-0030	train-other-500	In the waiting room I found no less than three mantua makers waiting for an interview with the wife of the new President It seems that missus Lincoln had told several of her lady friends that she had urgent need for a dress maker
6106-58196-0031	train-other-500	and that each of these friends had sent her mantua maker to the White House Hope fell at once With so many rivals for the position sought after I regarded my chances for success as extremely doubtful
6106-58196-0032	train-other-500	I was the last one summoned to missus Lincoln s presence All the others had a hearing and were dismissed I went up stairs timidly and entering the room with nervous step discovered the wife of the President
6106-58196-0033	train-other-500	standing by a window looking out and engaged in lively conversation with a lady missus Grimsly as I afterwards learned missus L came forward and greeted me warmly You have come at last missus Keckley
none	none	 who have you worked for in the city 
6106-58196-0034	train-other-500	Among others missus Senator Davis has been one of my best patrons was my reply
none	none	 missus Davis So you have worked for her have you 
6106-58196-0035	train-other-500	Of course you gave satisfaction
none	none	 so far good 
6106-58196-0036	train-other-500	Can you do my work Yes missus Lincoln Will you have much work for me to do That missus Keckley will depend altogether upon your prices I trust that your terms are reasonable I cannot afford to be extravagant
6106-58196-0037	train-other-500	We are just from the West and are poor If you do not charge too much I shall be able to give you all my work I do not think there will be any difficulty about charges missus Lincoln my terms are reasonable Well
6106-58196-0038	train-other-500	if you will work cheap you shall have plenty to do I can t afford to pay big prices so I frankly tell you so in the beginning The terms were satisfactorily arranged and I measured missus Lincoln took the dress with me
none	none	 a bright rose colored moire antique 
6106-58196-0039	train-other-500	and returned the next day to fit it on her A number of ladies were in the room all making preparations for the levee to come off on Friday night
none	none	 These ladies I learned were relatives of missus L s 
6106-58196-0040	train-other-500	missus Edwards and missus Kellogg her own sisters and Elizabeth Edwards and Julia Baker her nieces missus Lincoln this morning was dressed in a cashmere wrapper quilted down the front and she wore a simple head dress
6106-58196-0041	train-other-500	The other ladies wore morning robes
none	none	 I was hard at work on the dress when I was informed that the levee had been postponed from Friday night 
6106-58196-0042	train-other-500	till Tuesday night This of course gave me more time to complete my task missus Lincoln sent for me and suggested some alteration in style
none	none	 which was made She also requested that I make a waist of blue watered silk for missus Grimsly as work on the dress would not require all my time Tuesday evening came and I had taken the last stitches on the dress I folded it and carried it to the White House with the waist for missus Grimsly When I went up stairs I found the ladies in a terrible state of excitement missus Lincoln was protesting that she could not go down for the reason that she had nothing to wear missus Keckley you have disappointed me deceived me Why do you bring my dress at this late hour Because I have just finished it and I thought I should be in time But you are not in time missus Keckley you have bitterly disappointed me I have no time now to dress and what is more I will not dress and go down stairs I am sorry if I have disappointed you missus Lincoln for I intended to be in time Will you let me dress you I can have you ready in a few minutes 
6106-58196-0043	train-other-500	No I won t be dressed
none	none	 I will stay in my room 
6106-58196-0044	train-other-500	mister Lincoln can go down with the other ladies But there is plenty of time for you to dress Mary joined in missus Grimsly and missus Edwards Let missus Keckley assist you and she will soon have you ready Thus urged she consented
6106-58196-0045	train-other-500	I dressed her hair and arranged the dress on her It fitted nicely and she was pleased mister Lincoln came in threw himself on the sofa laughed with Willie and little Tad and then commenced pulling on his gloves
6106-58196-0046	train-other-500	quoting poetry all the while You seem to be in a poetical mood to night said his wife Yes mother these are poetical times was his pleasant reply I declare you look charming in that dress
6106-58196-0047	train-other-500	missus Keckley has met with great success And then he proceeded to compliment the other ladies missus Lincoln looked elegant in her rose colored moire antique She wore a pearl necklace pearl ear rings pearl bracelets
6106-58196-0048	train-other-500	and red roses in her hair missus Baker was dressed in lemon colored silk missus Kellogg in a drab silk ashes of rose missus Edwards in a brown and black silk Miss Edwards in crimson
6106-58196-0049	train-other-500	and missus Grimsly in blue watered silk Just before starting downstairs missus Lincoln s lace handkerchief was the object of search It had been displaced by Tad who was mischievous and hard to restrain The handkerchief found
6106-58196-0050	train-other-500	all became serene missus Lincoln took the President s arm and with smiling face led the train below
none	none	 I was surprised at her grace and composure 
6106-58196-0051	train-other-500	I had heard so much in current and malicious report of her low life of her ignorance and vulgarity that I expected to see her embarrassed on this occasion Report I soon saw was wrong
6106-58196-0052	train-other-500	No queen accustomed to the usages of royalty all her life could have comported herself with more calmness and dignity than did the wife of the President She was confident and self possessed
6106-58196-0053	train-other-500	and confidence always gives grace This levee was a brilliant one and the only one of the season I became the regular modiste of missus Lincoln
6106-58196-0054	train-other-500	I made fifteen or sixteen dresses for her during the spring and early part of the summer when she left Washington spending the hot weather at Saratoga Long Branch and other places
none	none	 In the mean time I was employed by missus Senator Douglas 
6106-58196-0055	train-other-500	one of the loveliest ladies that I ever met missus Secretary Wells missus Secretary Stanton and others
none	none	 missus Douglas always dressed in deep mourning with excellent taste and several of the leading ladies of Washington society were extremely jealous of her superior attractions CHAPTER VI WILLIE LINCOLN S DEATH BED missus Lincoln returned to Washington in November and again duty called me to the White House The war was now in progress and every day brought stirring news from the front the front where the Gray opposed the Blue where flashed the bright sabre in the sunshine where were heard the angry notes of battle the deep roar of cannon and the fearful rattle of musketry where new graves were being made every day where brother forgot a mother s early blessing and sought the lifeblood of brother and friend raised the deadly knife against friend Oh the front with its stirring battle scenes Oh the front with its ghastly heaps of dead The life of the nation was at stake and when the land was full of sorrow there could not be much gayety at the capital The days passed quietly with me I soon learned that some people had an intense desire to penetrate the inner circle of the White House No President and his family heretofore occupying this mansion ever excited so much curiosity as the present incumbents mister Lincoln had grown up in the wilds of the West and evil report had said much of him and his wife The polite world was shocked and the tendency to exaggerate intensified curiosity As soon as it was known that I was the modiste of missus Lincoln parties crowded around and affected friendship for me hoping to induce me to betray the secrets of the domestic circle One day a woman I will not call her a lady drove up to my rooms gave me an order to make a dress and insisted on partly paying me in advance She called on me every day and was exceedingly kind When she came to take her dress away she cautiously remarked missus Keckley you know missus Lincoln Yes You are her modiste are you not Yes You know her very well do you not I am with her every day or two Don t you think you would have some influence with her I cannot say missus Lincoln I presume would listen to anything I should suggest but whether she would be influenced by a suggestion of mine is another question I am sure that you could influence her missus Keckley Now listen I have a proposition to make I have a great desire to become an inmate of the White House I have heard so much of mister Lincoln s goodness that I should like to be near him and if I can enter the White House no other way I am willing to go as a menial My dear missus Keckley will you not recommend me to missus Lincoln as a friend of yours out of employment and ask her to take me as a chambermaid If you will do this you shall be well rewarded It may be worth several thousand dollars to you in time I looked at the woman in amazement A bribe and to betray the confidence of my employer Turning to her with a glance of scorn I said Madam you are mistaken in regard to my character Sooner than betray the trust of a friend I would throw myself into the Potomac river I am not so base as that Pardon me but there is the door and I trust that you will never enter my room again She sprang to her feet in deep confusion and passed through the door murmuring Very well you will live to regret your action today Never never I exclaimed and closed the door after her with a bang I afterwards learned that this woman was an actress and that her object was to enter the White House as a servant learn its secrets and then publish a scandal to the world I do not give her name for such publicity would wound the sensitive feelings of friends who would have to share her disgrace without being responsible for her faults I simply record the incident to show how I often was approached by unprincipled parties It is unnecessary to say that I indignantly refused every bribe offered The first public appearance of missus Lincoln that winter was at the reception on New Year s Day This reception was shortly followed by a brilliant levee The day after the levee I went to the White House and while fitting a dress to missus Lincoln she said Lizabeth she had learned to drop the E Lizabeth I have an idea These are war times and we must be as economical as possible You know the President is expected to give a series of state dinners every winter and these dinners are very costly Now I want to avoid this expense and my idea is that if I give three large receptions the state dinners can be scratched from the programme What do you think Lizabeth I think that you are right missus Lincoln I am glad to hear you say so If I can make mister Lincoln take the same view of the case I shall not fail to put the idea into practice Before I left her room that day mister Lincoln came in She at once stated the case to him He pondered the question a few moments before answering Mother I am afraid your plan will not work But it will work if you will only determine that it shall work It is breaking in on the regular custom he mildly replied But you forget father these are war times and old customs can be done away with for the once The idea is economical you must admit Yes mother but we must think of something besides economy I do think of something else Public receptions are more democratic than stupid state dinners are more in keeping with the spirit of the institutions of our country as you would say if called upon to make a stump speech There are a great many strangers in the city foreigners and others whom we can entertain at our receptions but whom we cannot invite to our dinners I believe you are right mother You argue the point well I think that we shall have to decide on the receptions So the day was carried The question was decided and arrangements were made for the first reception It now was January and cards were issued for February The children Tad and Willie were constantly receiving presents Willie was so delighted with a little pony that he insisted on riding it every day The weather was changeable and exposure resulted in a severe cold which deepened into fever He was very sick and I was summoned to his bedside It was sad to see the poor boy suffer Always of a delicate constitution he could not resist the strong inroads of disease The days dragged wearily by and he grew weaker and more shadow like He was his mother s favorite child and she doted on him It grieved her heart sorely to see him suffer When able to be about he was almost constantly by her side When I would go in her room almost always I found blue eyed Willie there reading from an open book or curled up in a chair with pencil and paper in hand He had decidedly a literary taste and was a studious boy A short time before his death he wrote this simple little poem WASHINGTON D C October thirty eighteen sixty one DEAR SIR I enclose you my first attempt at poetry Yours truly WM W LINCOLN To the Editor of the National Republican LINES ON THE DEATH OF COLONEL EDWARD BAKER THERE was no patriot like Baker So noble and so true He fell as a soldier on the field His face to the sky of blue His voice is silent in the hall Which oft his presence graced No more he ll hear the loud acclaim Which rang from place to place No squeamish notions filled his breast The Union was his theme No surrender and no compromise His day thought and night s dream His Country has her part to pay To rds those he has left behind His widow and his children all She must always keep in mind Finding that Willie continued to grow worse missus Lincoln determined to withdraw her cards of invitation and postpone the reception mister Lincoln thought that the cards had better not be withdrawn At least he advised that the doctor be consulted before any steps were taken Accordingly doctor Stone was called in He pronounced Willie better and said that there was every reason for an early recovery He thought since the invitations had been issued it would be best to go on with the reception Willie he insisted was in no immediate danger missus Lincoln was guided by these counsels and no postponement was announced On the evening of the reception Willie was suddenly taken worse His mother sat by his bedside a long while holding his feverish hand in her own and watching his labored breathing The doctor claimed there was no cause for alarm I arranged missus Lincoln s hair then assisted her to dress Her dress was white satin trimmed with black lace The trail was very long and as she swept through the room mister Lincoln was standing with his back to the fire his hands behind him and his eyes on the carpet His face wore a thoughtful solemn look The rustling of the satin dress attracted his attention He looked at it a few moments then in his quaint quiet way remarked Whew our cat has a long tail to night missus Lincoln did not reply The President added Mother it is my opinion if some of that tail was nearer the head it would be in better style and he glanced at her bare arms and neck She had a beautiful neck and arm and low dresses were becoming to her She turned away with a look of offended dignity and presently took the President s arm and both went down stairs to their guests leaving me alone with the sick boy The reception was a large and brilliant one and the rich notes of the Marine Band in the apartments below came to the sick room in soft subdued murmurs like the wild faint sobbing of far off spirits Some of the young people had suggested dancing but mister Lincoln met the suggestion with an emphatic veto The brilliance of the scene could not dispel the sadness that rested upon the face of missus Lincoln During the evening she came upstairs several times and stood by the bedside of the suffering boy She loved him with a mother s heart and her anxiety was great The night passed slowly morning came and Willie was worse He lingered a few days and died God called the beautiful spirit home and the house of joy was turned into the house of mourning I was worn out with watching and was not in the room when Willie died but was immediately sent for I assisted in washing him and dressing him and then laid him on the bed when mister Lincoln came in I never saw a man so bowed down with grief He came to the bed lifted the cover from the face of his child gazed at it long and earnestly murmuring My poor boy he was too good for this earth God has called him home I know that he is much better off in heaven but then we loved him so It is hard hard to have him die Great sobs choked his utterance He buried his head in his hands and his tall frame was convulsed with emotion I stood at the foot of the bed my eyes full of tears looking at the man in silent awe stricken wonder His grief unnerved him and made him a weak passive child I did not dream that his rugged nature could be so moved I shall never forget those solemn moments genius and greatness weeping over love s idol lost There is a grandeur as well as a simplicity about the picture that will never fade With me it is immortal I really believe that I shall carry it with me across the dark mysterious river of death missus Lincoln s grief was inconsolable The pale face of her dead boy threw her into convulsions Around him love s tendrils had been twined and now that he was dressed for the tomb it was like tearing the tendrils out of the heart by their roots Willie she often said if spared by Providence would be the hope and stay of her old age But Providence had not spared him The light faded from his eyes and the death dew had gathered on his brow In one of her paroxysms of grief the President kindly bent over his wife took her by the arm and gently led her to the window With a stately solemn gesture he pointed to the lunatic asylum Mother do you see that large white building on the hill yonder Try and control your grief or it will drive you mad and we may have to send you there missus Lincoln was so completely overwhelmed with sorrow that she did not attend the funeral Willie was laid to rest in the cemetery and the White House was draped in mourning Black crape everywhere met the eye contrasting strangely with the gay and brilliant colors of a few days before Party dresses were laid aside and every one who crossed the threshold of the Presidential mansion spoke in subdued tones when they thought of the sweet boy at rest Under the sod and the dew Previous to this I had lost my son Leaving Wilberforce he went to the battle field with the three months troops and was killed in Missouri found his grave on the battle field where the gallant General Lyon fell It was a sad blow to me and the kind womanly letter that missus Lincoln wrote to me when she heard of my bereavement was full of golden words of comfort Nathaniel Parker Willis the genial poet now sleeping in his grave wrote this beautiful sketch of Willie Lincoln after the sad death of the bright eyed boy This little fellow had his acquaintances among his father s friends and I chanced to be one of them He never failed to seek me out in the crowd shake hands and make some pleasant remark and this in a boy of ten years of age was to say the least endearing to a stranger But he had more than mere affectionateness His self possession aplomb as the French call it was extraordinary I was one day passing the White House when he was outside with a play fellow on the side walk mister Seward drove in with Prince Napoleon and two of his suite in the carriage and in a mock heroic way terms of intimacy evidently existing between the boy and the Secretary the official gentleman took off his hat and the Napoleon did the same all making the young Prince President a ceremonious salute Not a bit staggered with the homage Willie drew himself up to his full height took off his little cap with graceful self possession and bowed down formally to the ground like a little ambassador They drove past and he went on unconcernedly with his play the impromptu readiness and good judgment being clearly a part of his nature His genial and open expression of countenance was none the less ingenuous and fearless for a certain tincture of fun and it was in this mingling of qualities that he so faithfully resembled his father With all the splendor that was around this little fellow in his new home he was so bravely and beautifully himself and that only A wild flower transplanted from the prairie to the hot house he retained his prairie habits unalterably pure and simple till he died His leading trait seemed to be a fearless and kindly frankness willing that everything should be as different as it pleased but resting unmoved in his own conscious single heartedness I found I was studying him irresistibly as one of the sweet problems of childhood that the world is blessed with in rare places and the news of his death I was absent from Washington on a visit to my own children at the time came to me like a knell heard unexpectedly at a merry making On the day of the funeral I went before the hour to take a near farewell look at the dear boy for they had embalmed him to send home to the West to sleep under the sod of his own valley and the coffin lid was to be closed before the service The family had just taken their leave of him and the servants and nurses were seeing him for the last time and with tears and sobs wholly unrestrained for he was loved like an idol by every one of them He lay with eyes closed his brown hair parted as we had known it pale in the slumber of death but otherwise unchanged for he was dressed as if for the evening and held in one of his hands crossed upon his breast a bunch of exquisite flowers a message coming from his mother while we were looking upon him that those flowers might be preserved for her She was lying sick in her bed worn out with grief and over watching The funeral was very touching Of the entertainments in the East Room the boy had been for those who now assembled more especially a most life giving variation With his bright face and his apt greetings and replies he was remembered in every part of that crimson curtained hall built only for pleasure of all the crowds each night certainly the one least likely to be death s first mark He was his father s favorite They were intimates often seen hand in hand And there sat the man with a burden on his brain at which the world marvels bent now with the load at both heart and brain staggering under a blow like the taking from him of his child His men of power sat around him McClellan with a moist eye when he bowed to the prayer as I could see from where I stood and Chase and Seward with their austere features at work and senators and ambassadors and soldiers all struggling with their tears great hearts sorrowing with the President as a stricken man and a brother That God may give him strength for all his burdens is I am sure at present the prayer of a nation This sketch was very much admired by missus Lincoln I copy it from the scrap book in which she pasted it with many tears with her own hands CHAPTER VII WASHINGTON IN eighteen sixty two three In the summer of eighteen sixty two freedmen began to flock into Washington from Maryland and Virginia They came with a great hope in their hearts and with all their worldly goods on their backs Fresh from the bonds of slavery fresh from the benighted regions of the plantation they came to the Capital looking for liberty and many of them not knowing it when they found it Many good friends reached forth kind hands but the North is not warm and impulsive For one kind word spoken two harsh ones were uttered there was something repelling in the atmosphere and the bright joyous dreams of freedom to the slave faded were sadly altered in the presence of that stern practical mother reality Instead of flowery paths days of perpetual sunshine and bowers hanging with golden fruit the road was rugged and full of thorns the sunshine was eclipsed by shadows and the mute appeals for help too often were answered by cold neglect Poor dusky children of slavery men and women of my own race the transition from slavery to freedom was too sudden for you The bright dreams were too rudely dispelled you were not prepared for the new life that opened before you and the great masses of the North learned to look upon your helplessness with indifference learned to speak of you as an idle dependent race Reason should have prompted kinder thoughts Charity is ever kind One fair summer evening I was walking the streets of Washington accompanied by a friend when a band of music was heard in the distance We wondered what it could mean and curiosity prompted us to find out its meaning We quickened our steps and discovered that it came from the house of missus Farnham The yard was brilliantly lighted ladies and gentlemen were moving about and the band was playing some of its sweetest airs We approached the sentinel on duty at the gate and asked what was going on He told us that it was a festival given for the benefit of the sick and wounded soldiers in the city This suggested an idea to me If the white people can give festivals to raise funds for the relief of suffering soldiers why should not the well to do colored people go to work to do something for the benefit of the suffering blacks I could not rest The thought was ever present with me and the next Sunday I made a suggestion in the colored church that a society of colored people be formed to labor for the benefit of the unfortunate freedmen The idea proved popular and in two weeks the Contraband Relief Association was organized with forty working members In September of eighteen sixty two missus Lincoln left Washington for New York and requested me to follow her in a few days and join her at the Metropolitan Hotel I was glad of the opportunity to do so for I thought that in New York I would be able to do something in the interests of our society Armed with credentials I took the train for New York and went to the Metropolitan where missus Lincoln had secured accommodations for me The next morning I told missus Lincoln of my project and she immediately headed my list with a subscription of two hundred dollars I circulated among the colored people and got them thoroughly interested in the subject when I was called to Boston by missus Lincoln who wished to visit her son Robert attending college in that city I met mister Wendell Phillips and other Boston philanthropists who gave me all the assistance in their power We held a mass meeting at the Colored Baptist Church reverend mister Grimes in Boston raised a sum of money and organized there a branch society The society was organized by missus Grimes wife of the pastor assisted by missus Martin wife of reverend Stella Martin This branch of the main society during the war was able to send us over eighty large boxes of goods contributed exclusively by the colored people of Boston Returning to New York we held a successful meeting at the Shiloh Church reverend Henry Highland Garnet pastor The Metropolitan Hotel at that time as now employed colored help I suggested the object of my mission to Robert Thompson Steward of the Hotel who immediately raised quite a sum of money among the dining room waiters mister Frederick Douglass contributed two hundred dollars besides lecturing for us Other prominent colored men sent in liberal contributions From England B a large quantity of stores was received missus Lincoln made frequent contributions as also did the President In eighteen sixty three I was re elected President of the Association which office I continue to hold For two years after Willie s death the White House was the scene of no fashionable display The memory of the dead boy was duly respected In some things missus Lincoln was an altered woman Sometimes when in her room with no one present but myself the mere mention of Willie s name would excite her emotion and any trifling memento that recalled him would move her to tears She could not bear to look upon his picture and after his death she never crossed the threshold of the Guest s Room in which he died or the Green Room in which he was embalmed There was something supernatural in her dread of these things and something that she could not explain Tad s nature was the opposite of Willie s and he was always regarded as his father s favorite child His black eyes fairly sparkled with mischief The war progressed fair fields had been stained with blood thousands of brave men had fallen and thousands of eyes were weeping for the fallen at home There were desolate hearthstones in the South as well as in the North and as the people of my race watched the sanguinary struggle the ebb and flow of the tide of battle they lifted their faces Zionward as if they hoped to catch a glimpse of the Promised Land beyond the sulphureous clouds of smoke which shifted now and then but to reveal ghastly rows of new made graves Sometimes the very life of the nation seemed to tremble with the fierce shock of arms In eighteen sixty three the Confederates were flushed with victory and sometimes it looked as if the proud flag of the Union the glorious old Stars and Stripes must yield half its nationality to the tri barred flag that floated grandly over long columns of gray These were sad anxious days to mister Lincoln and those who saw the man in privacy only could tell how much he suffered One day he came into the room where I was fitting a dress on missus Lincoln His step was slow and heavy and his face sad Like a tired child he threw himself upon a sofa and shaded his eyes with his hands He was a complete picture of dejection missus Lincoln observing his troubled look asked Where have you been father To the War Department was the brief almost sullen answer Any news Yes plenty of news but no good news It is dark dark everywhere He reached forth one of his long arms and took a small Bible from a stand near the head of the sofa opened the pages of the holy book and soon was absorbed in reading them A quarter of an hour passed and on glancing at the sofa the face of the President seemed more cheerful The dejected look was gone and the countenance was lighted up with new resolution and hope The change was so marked that I could not but wonder at it and wonder led to the desire to know what book of the Bible afforded so much comfort to the reader Making the search for a missing article an excuse I walked gently around the sofa and looking into the open book I discovered that mister Lincoln was reading that divine comforter Job He read with Christian eagerness and the courage and hope that he derived from the inspired pages made him a new man I almost imagined that I could hear the Lord speaking to him from out the whirlwind of battle Gird up thy loins now like a man I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me What a sublime picture was this A ruler of a mighty nation going to the pages of the Bible with simple Christian earnestness for comfort and courage and finding both in the darkest hours of a nation s calamity Ponder it O ye scoffers at God s Holy Word and then hang your heads for very shame Frequent letters were received warning mister Lincoln of assassination but he never gave a second thought to the mysterious warnings The letters however sorely troubled his wife She seemed to read impending danger in every rustling leaf in every whisper of the wind Where are you going now father she would say to him as she observed him putting on his overshoes and shawl I am going over to the War Department mother to try and learn some news But father you should not go out alone You know you are surrounded with danger All imagination What does any one want to harm me for Don t worry about me mother as if I were a little child for no one is going to molest me and with a confident unsuspecting air he would close the door behind him descend the stairs and pass out to his lonely walk For weeks when trouble was anticipated friends of the President would sleep in the White House to guard him from danger Robert would come home every few months bringing new joy to the family circle He was very anxious to quit school and enter the army but the move was sternly opposed by his mother We have lost one son and his loss is as much as I can bear without being called upon to make another sacrifice she would say when the subject was under discussion But many a poor mother has given up all her sons mildly suggested mister Lincoln and our son is not more dear to us than the sons of other people are to their mothers That may be but I cannot bear to have Robert exposed to danger His services are not required in the field and the sacrifice would be a needless one The services of every man who loves his country are required in this war You should take a liberal instead of a selfish view of the question mother Argument at last prevailed and permission was granted Robert to enter the army With the rank of Captain and A D C he went to the field and remained in the army till the close of the war I well recollect a little incident that gave me a clearer insight into Robert s character He was at home at the time the Tom Thumb combination was at Washington The marriage of little Hopo my thumb Charles Stratton to Miss Warren created no little excitement in the world and the people of Washington participated in the general curiosity Some of missus Lincoln s friends made her believe that it was the duty of missus Lincoln to show some attention to the remarkable dwarfs Tom Thumb had been caressed by royalty in the Old World and why should not the wife of the President of his native country smile upon him also Verily duty is one of the greatest bugbears in life A hasty reception was arranged and cards of invitation issued I had dressed missus Lincoln and she was ready to go below and receive her guests when Robert entered his mother s room You are at leisure this afternoon are you not Robert Yes mother Of course then you will dress and come down stairs No mother I do not propose to assist in entertaining Tom Thumb My notions of duty perhaps are somewhat different from yours Robert had a lofty soul and he could not stoop to all of the follies and absurdities of the ephemeral current of fashionable life missus Lincoln s love for her husband sometimes prompted her to act very strangely She was extremely jealous of him and if a lady desired to court her displeasure she could select no surer way to do it than to pay marked attention to the President These little jealous freaks often were a source of perplexity to mister Lincoln If it was a reception for which they were dressing he would come into her room to conduct her downstairs and while pulling on his gloves ask with a merry twinkle in his eyes Well mother who must I talk with to night shall it be missus D That deceitful woman No you shall not listen to her flattery Well then what do you say to Miss C She is too young and handsome to practise deceit Young and handsome you call her You should not judge beauty for me No she is in league with missus D and you shall not talk with her Well mother I must talk with some one Is there any one that you do not object to trying to button his glove with a mock expression of gravity I don t know as it is necessary that you should talk to anybody in particular You know well enough mister Lincoln that I do not approve of your flirtations with silly women just as if you were a beardless boy fresh from school But mother I insist that I must talk with somebody I can t stand around like a simpleton and say nothing If you will not tell me who I may talk with please tell me who I may not talk with There is missus D and Miss C in particular I detest them both missus B also will come around you but you need not listen to her flattery These are the ones in particular Very well mother now that we have settled the question to your satisfaction we will go down stairs and always with stately dignity he proffered his arm and led the way Footnote B The Sheffield Anti Slavery Society of England contributed through mister Frederick Douglass to the Freedmen s Relief Association twenty four dollars Aberdeen Ladies Society forty dollars Anti Slavery Society of Edinburgh Scotland forty eight dollars Friends at Bristol England one hundred seventy six dollars Birmingham Negro s Friend Society fifty dollars Also received through mister Charles R Douglass from the Birmingham Society thirty three dollars CHAPTER VIII CANDID OPINIONS Often mister and missus Lincoln discussed the relations of Cabinet officers and gentlemen prominent in politics in my presence I soon learned that the wife of the President had no love for mister Salmon P Chase at that time Secretary of the Treasury She was well versed in human character was somewhat suspicious of those by whom she was surrounded and often her judgment was correct Her intuition about the sincerity of individuals was more accurate than that of her husband She looked beyond and read the reflection of action in the future Her hostility to mister Chase was very bitter She claimed that he was a selfish politician instead of a true patriot and warned mister Lincoln not to trust him too far The daughter of the Secretary was quite a belle in Washington and missus Lincoln who was jealous of the popularity of others had no desire to build up her social position through political favor to her father Miss Chase now missus Senator Sprague was a lovely woman and was worthy of all the admiration she received mister Lincoln was more confiding than his wife He never suspected the fidelity of those who claimed to be his friends Honest to the very core himself and frank as a child he never dreamed of questioning the sincerity of others Father I do wish that you would inquire a little into the motives of Chase said his wife one day The President was lying carelessly upon a sofa holding a newspaper in his hands Mother you are too suspicious I give you credit for sagacity but you are disposed to magnify trifles Chase is a patriot and one of my best friends Yes one of your best friends because it is his interest to be so He is anything for Chase If he thought he could make anything by it he would betray you to morrow I fear that you are prejudiced against the man mother I know that you do him injustice mister Lincoln you are either blind or will not see I am not the only one that has warned you against him True I receive letters daily from all parts of the country telling me not to trust Chase but then these letters are written by the political enemies of the Secretary and it would be unjust and foolish to pay any attention to them Very well you will find out some day if you live long enough that I have read the man correctly I only hope that your eyes may not be opened to the truth when it is too late The President as far as I could judge from his conversation with his wife continued to confide in mister Chase to the time of his tragic death missus Lincoln was especially severe on mister Wm H Seward Secretary of State She but rarely lost an opportunity to say an unkind word of him One morning I went to the White House earlier than usual mister Lincoln was sitting in a chair reading a paper stroking with one hand the head of little Tad I was basting a dress for missus Lincoln A servant entered and handed the President a letter just brought by a messenger He broke the seal and when he had read the contents his wife asked Who is the letter from father Seward I must go over and see him today Seward I wish you had nothing to do with that man He cannot be trusted You say the same of Chase If I listened to you I should soon be without a Cabinet Better be without it than to confide in some of the men that you do Seward is worse than Chase He has no principle Mother you are mistaken your prejudices are so violent that you do not stop to reason Seward is an able man and the country as well as myself can trust him Father you are too honest for this world You should have been born a saint You will generally find it a safe rule to distrust a disappointed ambitious politician It makes me mad to see you sit still and let that hypocrite Seward twine you around his finger as if you were a skein of thread It is useless to argue the question mother You cannot change my opinion missus Lincoln prided herself upon her ability to read character She was shrewd and far seeing and had no patience with the frank confiding nature of the President When Andrew Johnson was urged for military Governor of Tennessee missus Lincoln bitterly opposed the appointment He is a demagogue she said almost fiercely and if you place him in power mister Lincoln mark my words you will rue it some day General McClellan when made Commander in Chief was the idol of the soldiers and never was a general more universally popular He is a humbug remarked missus Lincoln one day in my presence What makes you think so mother good naturedly inquired the President Because he talks so much and does so little If I had the power I would very soon take off his head and put some energetic man in his place But I regard McClellan as a patriot and an able soldier He has been much embarrassed The troops are raw and the subordinate officers inclined to be rebellious There are too many politicians in the army with shoulder straps McClellan is young and popular and they are jealous of him They will kill him off if they can McClellan can make plenty of excuse for himself therefore he needs no advocate in you If he would only do something and not promise so much I might learn to have a little faith in him I tell you he is a humbug and you will have to find some man to take his place that is if you wish to conquer the South missus Lincoln could not tolerate General Grant He is a butcher she would often say and is not fit to be at the head of an army But he has been very successful in the field argued the President Yes he generally manages to claim a victory but such a victory He loses two men to the enemy s one He has no management no regard for life If the war should continue four years longer and he should remain in power he would depopulate the North I could fight an army as well myself According to his tactics there is nothing under the heavens to do but to march a new line of men up in front of the rebel breastworks to be shot down as fast as they take their position and keep marching until the enemy grows tired of the slaughter Grant I repeat is an obstinate fool and a butcher Well mother supposing that we give you command of the army No doubt you would do much better than any general that has been tried There was a twinkle in the eyes and a ring of irony in the voice I have often heard missus Lincoln say that if Grant should ever be elected President of the United States she would desire to leave the country and remain absent during his term of office It was well known that missus Lincoln s brothers were in the Confederate army and for this reason it was often charged that her sympathies were with the South Those who made the hasty charge were never more widely mistaken One morning on my way to the White House I heard that Captain Alexander Todd one of her brothers had been killed I did not like to inform missus Lincoln of his death judging that it would be painful news to her I had been in her room but a few minutes when she said with apparent unconcern Lizzie I have just heard that one of my brothers has been killed in the war I also heard the same missus Lincoln but hesitated to speak of it for fear the subject would be a painful one to you You need not hesitate Of course it is but natural that I should feel for one so nearly related to me but not to the extent that you suppose He made his choice long ago He decided against my husband and through him against me He has been fighting against us and since he chose to be our deadly enemy I see no special reason why I should bitterly mourn his death I felt relieved and in subsequent conversations learned that missus Lincoln had no sympathy for the South Why should I sympathize with the rebels she would say are they not against me They would hang my husband to morrow if it was in their power and perhaps gibbet me with him How then can I sympathize with a people at war with me and mine She always objected to being thought Southern in feeling mister Lincoln was generous by nature and though his whole heart was in the war he could not but respect the valor of those opposed to him His soul was too great for the narrow selfish views of partisanship Brave by nature himself he honored bravery in others even his foes Time and again I have heard him speak in the highest terms of the soldierly qualities of such brave Confederate generals as Lee Stonewall Jackson and Joseph E Johns t on Jackson was his ideal soldier He is a brave honest Presbyterian soldier were his words what a pity that we should have to fight such a gallant fellow If we only had such a man to lead the armies of the North the country would not be appalled with so many disasters As this is a rambling chapter I will here record an incident showing his feeling toward Robert E Lee The very morning of the day on which he was assassinated his son captain Robert Lincoln came into the room with a portrait of General Lee in his hand The President took the picture laid it on a table before him scanned the face thoughtfully and said It is a good face it is the face of a noble noble brave man I am glad that the war is over at last Looking up at Robert he continued Well my son you have returned safely from the front The war is now closed and we soon will live in peace with the brave men that have been fighting against us I trust that the era of good feeling has returned with the war and that henceforth we shall live in peace Now listen to me Robert you must lay aside your uniform and return to college I wish you to read law for three years and at the end of that time I hope that we will be able to tell whether you will make a lawyer or not His face was more cheerful than I had seen it for a long while and he seemed to be in a generous forgiving mood CHAPTER IX BEHIND THE SCENES Some of the freedmen and freedwomen had exaggerated ideas of liberty To them it was a beautiful vision a land of sunshine rest and glorious promise They flocked to Washington and since their extravagant hopes were not realized it was but natural that many of them should bitterly feel their disappointment The colored people are wedded to associations and when you destroy these you destroy half of the happiness of their lives They make a home and are so fond of it that they prefer it squalid though it be to the comparative ease and luxury of a shifting roaming life Well the emancipated slaves in coming North left old associations behind them and the love for the past was so strong that they could not find much beauty in the new life so suddenly opened to them Thousands of the disappointed huddled together in camps fretted and pined like children for the good old times In visiting them in the interests of the Relief Society of which I was president they would crowd around me with pitiful stories of distress Often I heard them declare that they would rather go back to slavery in the South and be with their old masters than to enjoy the freedom of the North I believe they were sincere in these declarations because dependence had become a part of their second nature and independence brought with it the cares and vexations of poverty I was very much amused one day at the grave complaints of a good old simple minded woman fresh from a life of servitude She had never ventured beyond a plantation until coming North The change was too radical for her and she could not exactly understand it She thought as many others thought that mister and missus Lincoln were the government and that the President and his wife had nothing to do but to supply the extravagant wants of every one that applied to them The wants of this old woman however were not very extravagant Why Missus Keckley said she to me one day I is been here eight months and Missus Lingom an t even give me one shife Bliss God childen if I had ar know dat de Government and Mister and Missus Government was going to do dat ar way I neber would ave comed here in God s wurld My old missus us t gib me two shifes eber year I could not restrain a laugh at the grave manner in which this good old woman entered her protest Her idea of freedom was two or more old shifts every year Northern readers may not fully recognize the pith of the joke On the Southern plantation the mistress according to established custom every year made a present of certain under garments to her slaves which articles were always anxiously looked forward to and thankfully received The old woman had been in the habit of receiving annually two shifts from her mistress and she thought the wife of the President of the United States very mean for overlooking this established custom of the plantation While some of the emancipated blacks pined for the old associations of slavery and refused to help themselves others went to work with commendable energy and planned with remarkable forethought They built themselves cabins and each family cultivated for itself a small patch of ground The colored people are fond of domestic life and with them domestication means happy children a fat pig a dozen or more chickens and a garden Whoever visits the Freedmen s Village now in the vicinity of Washington will discover all of these evidences of prosperity and happiness The schools are objects of much interest Good teachers white and colored are employed and whole brigades of bright eyed dusky children are there taught the common branches of education These children are studious and the teachers inform me that their advancement is rapid I number among my personal friends twelve colored girls employed as teachers in the schools at Washington The Colored Mission Sabbath School established through the influence of general Brown at the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church is always an object of great interest to the residents of the Capital as well as to the hundreds of strangers visiting the city In eighteen sixty four the receptions again commenced at the White House For the first two years of mister Lincoln s administration the President selected a lady to join in the promenade with him which left missus Lincoln free to choose an escort from among the distinguished gentlemen that always surrounded her on such occasions This custom at last was discontinued by missus Lincoln Lizabeth I was sewing in her room and she was seated in a comfortable arm chair Lizabeth I have been thinking over a little matter As you are well aware the President at every reception selects a lady to lead the promenade with him Now it occurs to me that this custom is an absurd one On such occasions our guests recognize the position of the President as first of all consequently he takes the lead in everything well now if they recognize his position they should also recognize mine I am his wife and should lead with him And yet he offers his arm to any other lady in the room making her first with him and placing me second The custom is an absurd one and I mean to abolish it The dignity that I owe to my position as missus President demands that I should not hesitate any longer to act missus Lincoln kept her word Ever after this she either led the promenade with the President or the President walked alone or with a gentleman The change was much remarked but the reason why it was made I believe was never generally known In eighteen sixty four much doubt existed in regard to the re election of mister Lincoln and the White House was besieged by all grades of politicians missus Lincoln was often blamed for having a certain class of men around her I have an object in view Lizabeth she said to me in reference to this matter In a political canvass it is policy to cultivate every element of strength These men have influence and we require influence to re elect mister Lincoln I will be clever to them until after the election and then if we remain at the White House I will drop every one of them and let them know very plainly that I only made tools of them They are an unprincipled set and I don t mind a little double dealing with them Does mister Lincoln know what your purpose is I asked God no he would never sanction such a proceeding so I keep him in the dark and will tell him of it when all is over He is too honest to take the proper care of his own interests so I feel it to be my duty to electioneer for him mister Lincoln as every one knows was far from handsome He was not admired for his graceful figure and finely moulded face but for the nobility of his soul and the greatness of his heart His wife was different He was wholly unselfish in every respect and I believe that he loved the mother of his children very tenderly He asked nothing but affection from her but did not always receive it When in one of her wayward impulsive moods she was apt to say and do things that wounded him deeply If he had not loved her she would have been powerless to cloud his thoughtful face or gild it with a ray of sunshine as she pleased We are indifferent to those we do not love and certainly the President was not indifferent to his wife She often wounded him in unguarded moments but calm reflection never failed to bring regret missus Lincoln was extremely anxious that her husband should be re elected President of the United States In endeavoring to make a display becoming her exalted position she had to incur many expenses mister Lincoln s salary was inadequate to meet them and she was forced to run in debt hoping that good fortune would favor her and enable her to extricate herself from an embarrassing situation She bought the most expensive goods on credit and in the summer of eighteen sixty four enormous unpaid bills stared her in the face What do you think about the election Lizabeth she said to me one morning I think that mister Lincoln will remain in the White House four years longer I replied looking up from my work What makes you think so Somehow I have learned to fear that he will be defeated Because he has been tried and has proved faithful to the best interests of the country The people of the North recognize in him an honest man and they are willing to confide in him at least until the war has been brought to a close The Southern people made his election a pretext for rebellion and now to replace him by some one else after years of sanguinary war would look too much like a surrender of the North So mister Lincoln is certain to be re elected He represents a principle and to maintain this principle the loyal people of the loyal States will vote for him even if he had no merits to commend him Your view is a plausible one Lizabeth and your confidence gives me new hope If he should be defeated I do not know what would become of us all To me to him there is more at stake in this election than he dreams of What can you mean missus Lincoln I do not comprehend Simply this I have contracted large debts of which he knows nothing and which he will be unable to pay if he is defeated What are your debts missus Lincoln They consist chiefly of store bills I owe altogether about twenty seven thousand dollars the principal portion at Stewart s in New York You understand Lizabeth that mister Lincoln has but little idea of the expense of a woman s wardrobe He glances at my rich dresses and is happy in the belief that the few hundred dollars that I obtain from him supply all my wants I must dress in costly materials The people scrutinize every article that I wear with critical curiosity The very fact of having grown up in the West subjects me to more searching observation To keep up appearances I must have money more than mister Lincoln can spare for me He is too honest to make a penny outside of his salary consequently I had and still have no alternative but to run in debt And mister Lincoln does not even suspect how much you owe God no this was a favorite expression of hers and I would not have him suspect If he knew that his wife was involved to the extent that she is the knowledge would drive him mad He is so sincere and straightforward himself that he is shocked by the duplicity of others He does not know a thing about any debts and I value his happiness not to speak of my own too much to allow him to know anything This is what troubles me so much If he is re elected I can keep him in ignorance of my affairs but if he is defeated then the bills will be sent in and he will know all and something like a hysterical sob escaped her missus Lincoln sometimes feared that the politicians would get hold of the particulars of her debts and use them in the Presidential campaign against her husband and when this thought occurred to her she was almost crazy with anxiety and fear When in one of these excited moods she would fiercely exclaim The Republican politicians must pay my debts Hundreds of them are getting immensely rich off the patronage of my husband and it is but fair that they should help me out of my embarrassment I will make a demand of them and when I tell them the facts they cannot refuse to advance whatever money I require CHAPTER X THE SECOND INAUGURATION missus Lincoln came to my apartments one day towards the close of the summer of eighteen sixty four to consult me in relation to a dress And here let me remark I never approved of ladies attached to the Presidential household coming to my rooms I always thought that it would be more consistent with their dignity to send for me and let me come to them instead of their coming to me I may have peculiar notions about some things and this may be regarded as one of them No matter I have recorded my opinion I cannot forget the associations of my early life Well missus Lincoln came to my rooms and as usual she had much to say about the Presidential election After some conversation she asked Lizzie where do you think I will be this time next summer Why in the White House of course I cannot believe so I have no hope of the re election of mister Lincoln The canvass is a heated one the people begin to murmur at the war and every vile charge is brought against my husband No matter I replied mister Lincoln will be re elected I am so confident of it that I am tempted to ask a favor of you A favor Well if we remain in the White House I shall be able to do you many favors What is the special favor Simply this missus Lincoln I should like for you to make me a present of the right hand glove that the President wears at the first public reception after his second inaugural You shall have it in welcome It will be so filthy when he pulls it off I shall be tempted to take the tongs and put it in the fire I cannot imagine Lizabeth what you want with such a glove I shall cherish it as a precious memento of the second inauguration of the man who has done so much for my race He has been a Jehovah to my people has lifted them out of bondage and directed their footsteps from darkness into light I shall keep the glove and hand it down to posterity You have some strange ideas Lizabeth Never mind you shall have the glove that is if mister Lincoln continues President after the fourth of March next I held missus Lincoln to her promise That glove is now in my possession bearing the marks of the thousands of hands that grasped the honest hand of mister Lincoln on that eventful night Alas it has become a prouder sadder memento than I ever dreamed prior to making the request it would be In due time the election came off and all of my predictions were verified The loyal States decided that mister Lincoln should continue at the nation s helm Autumn faded winter dragged slowly by and still the country resounded with the clash of arms The South was suffering yet suffering was borne with heroic determination and the army continued to present a bold defiant front With the first early breath of spring thousands of people gathered in Washington to witness the second inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States It was a stirring day in the National Capital and one that will never fade from the memory of those who witnessed the imposing ceremonies The morning was dark and gloomy clouds hung like a pall in the sky as if portending some great disaster But when the President stepped forward to receive the oath of office the clouds parted and a ray of sunshine streamed from the heavens to fall upon and gild his face It is also said that a brilliant star was seen at noon day It was the noon day of life with mister Lincoln and the star as viewed in the light of subsequent events was emblematic of a summons from on high This was Saturday and on Monday evening I went to the White House to dress missus Lincoln for the first grand levee While arranging missus L s hair the President came in It was the first time I had seen him since the inauguration and I went up to him proffering my hand with words of congratulation He grasped my outstretched hand warmly and held it while he spoke Thank you Well Madam Elizabeth he always called me Madam Elizabeth I don t know whether I should feel thankful or not The position brings with it many trials We do not know what we are destined to pass through But God will be with us all I put my trust in God He dropped my hand and with solemn face walked across the room and took his seat on the sofa Prior to this I had congratulated missus Lincoln and she had answered with a sigh Thank you Elizabeth but now that we have won the position I almost wish it were otherwise Poor mister Lincoln is looking so broken hearted so completely worn out I fear he will not get through the next four years Was it a presentiment that made her take a sad view of the future News from the front was never more cheering On every side the Confederates were losing ground and the lines of blue were advancing in triumph As I would look out my window almost every day I could see the artillery going past on its way to the open space of ground to fire a salute in honor of some new victory From every point came glorious news of the success of the soldiers that fought for the Union And yet in their private chamber away from the curious eyes of the world the President and his wife wore sad anxious faces I finished dressing missus Lincoln and she took the President s arm and went below It was one of the largest receptions ever held in Washington Thousands crowded the halls and rooms of the White House eager to shake mister Lincoln by his hand and receive a gracious smile from his wife The jam was terrible and the enthusiasm great The President s hand was well shaken and the next day on visiting missus Lincoln I received the soiled glove that mister Lincoln had worn on his right hand that night Many colored people were in Washington and large numbers had desired to attend the levee but orders were issued not to admit them A gentleman a member of Congress on his way to the White House recognized mister Frederick Douglass the eloquent colored orator on the outskirts of the crowd How do you do mister Douglass A fearful jam to night You are going in of course No that is no to your last question Not going in to shake the President by the hand Why pray The best reason in the world Strict orders have been issued not to admit people of color It is a shame mister Douglass that you should thus be placed under ban Never mind wait here and I will see what can be done The gentleman entered the White House and working his way to the President asked permission to introduce mister Douglass to him Certainly said mister Lincoln Bring mister Douglass in by all means I shall be glad to meet him The gentleman returned and soon mister Douglass stood face to face with the President mister Lincoln pressed his hand warmly saying mister Douglass I am glad to meet you I have long admired your course and I value your opinions highly mister Douglass was very proud of the manner in which mister Lincoln received him On leaving the White House he came to a friend s house where a reception was being held and he related the incident with great pleasure to myself and others On the Monday following the reception at the White House everybody was busy preparing for the grand inaugural ball to come off that night I was in missus Lincoln s room the greater portion of the day While dressing her that night the President came in and I remarked to him how much mister Douglass had been pleased on the night he was presented to mister Lincoln missus L at once turned to her husband with the inquiry Father why was not mister Douglass introduced to me I do not know I thought he was presented But he was not It must have been an oversight then mother I am sorry you did not meet him I finished dressing her for the ball and accompanied her to the door She was dressed magnificently and entered the ball room leaning on the arm of Senator Sumner a gentleman that she very much admired mister Lincoln walked into the ball room accompanied by two gentlemen This ball closed the season It was the last time that the President and his wife ever appeared in public Some days after missus Lincoln with a party of friends went to City Point on a visit missus Lincoln had returned to Washington prior to the twod of April On Monday April threed missus Secretary Harlan came into my room with material for a dress While conversing with her I saw artillery pass the window and as it was on its way to fire a salute I inferred that good news had been received at the War Department My reception room was on one side of the street and my work room on the other side Inquiring the cause of the demonstration we were told that Richmond had fallen missus Harlan took one of my hands in each of her own and we rejoiced together I ran across to my work room and on entering it discovered that the girls in my employ also had heard the good news They were particularly elated as it was reported that the rebel capital had surrendered to colored troops I had promised my employees a holiday when Richmond should fall and now that Richmond had fallen they reminded me of my promise I recrossed to my reception room and missus Harlan told me that the good news was enough for her she could afford to wait for her dress and to give the girls a holiday and a treat by all means She returned to her house and I joined my girls in the joy of the long promised holiday We wandered about the streets of the city with happy faces and hearts overflowing with joy The clerks in the various departments also enjoyed a holiday and they improved it by getting gloriously fuddled Towards evening I saw S and many other usually clear headed men in the street in a confused uncertain state of mind missus Lincoln had invited me to accompany her to City Point I went to the White House and told her that if she intended to return I would regard it as a privilege to go with her as City Point was near Petersburg my old home missus L said she designed returning and would be delighted to take me with her so it was arranged that I should accompany her A few days after we were on board the steamer en route for City Point missus Lincoln was joined by missus Secretary Harlan and daughter Senator Sumner and several other gentlemen Prior to this mister Lincoln had started for City Point and before we reached our destination he had visited Richmond Petersburg and other points We arrived on Friday and missus Lincoln was much disappointed when she learned that the President had visited the late Confederate capital as she had greatly desired to be with him when he entered the conquered stronghold It was immediately arranged that the entire party on board the River Queen should visit Richmond and other points with the President The next morning after the arrangement was perfected we were steaming up James River the river that so long had been impassable even to our gunboats The air was balmy and the banks of the river were beautiful and fragrant with the first sweet blossoms of spring For hours I stood on deck breathing the pure air and viewing the landscape on either side of the majestically flowing river Here stretched fair fields emblematic of peace and here deserted camps and frowning forts speaking of the stern vicissitudes of war Alas how many changes had taken place since my eye had wandered over the classic fields of dear old Virginia A birthplace is always dear no matter under what circumstances you were born since it revives in memory the golden hours of childhood free from philosophy and the warm kiss of a mother I wondered if I should catch a glimpse of a familiar face I wondered what had become of those I once knew had they fallen in battle been scattered by the relentless tide of war or were they still living as they lived when last I saw them I wondered now that Richmond had fallen and Virginia been restored to the clustering stars of the Union if the people would come together in the bonds of peace and as I gazed and wondered the River Queen rapidly carried us to our destination The Presidential party were all curiosity on entering Richmond They drove about the streets of the city and examined every object of interest The Capitol presented a desolate appearance desks broken and papers scattered promiscuously in the hurried flight of the Confederate Congress I picked up a number of papers and by curious coincidence the resolution prohibiting all free colored people from entering the State of Virginia In the Senate chamber I sat in the chair that Jefferson Davis sometimes occupied also in the chair of the Vice President Alexander H Stephens We paid a visit to the mansion occupied by mister Davis and family during the war and the ladies who were in charge of it scowled darkly upon our party as we passed through and inspected the different rooms After a delightful visit we returned to City Point That night in the cabin of the River Queen smiling faces gathered around the dinner table One of the guests was a young officer attached to the Sanitary Commission He was seated near missus Lincoln and by way of pleasantry remarked missus Lincoln you should have seen the President the other day on his triumphal entry into Richmond He was the cynosure of all eyes The ladies kissed their hands to him and greeted him with the waving of handkerchiefs He is quite a hero when surrounded by pretty young ladies The young officer suddenly paused with a look of embarrassment missus Lincoln turned to him with flashing eyes with the remark that his familiarity was offensive to her Quite a scene followed and I do not think that the Captain who incurred missus Lincoln s displeasure will ever forget that memorable evening in the cabin of the River Queen at City Point Saturday morning the whole party decided to visit Petersburg and I was only too eager to accompany them When we arrived at the city numbers crowded around the train and a little ragged negro boy ventured timidly into the car occupied by mister Lincoln and immediate friends and in replying to numerous questions used the word tote Tote remarked mister Lincoln what do you mean by tote Why massa to tote um on your back Very definite my son I presume when you tote a thing you carry it By the way Sumner turning to the Senator what is the origin of tote Its origin is said to be African The Latin word totum from totus means all an entire body the whole But my young friend here did not mean an entire body or anything of the kind when he said he would tote my things for me interrupted the President Very true continued the Senator He used the word tote in the African sense to carry to bear Tote in this sense is defined in our standard dictionaries as a colloquial word of the Southern States used especially by the negroes Then you regard the word as a good one Not elegant certainly For myself I should prefer a better word but since it has been established by usage I cannot refuse to recognize it Thus the conversation proceeded in pleasant style Getting out of the car the President and those with him went to visit the forts and other scenes while I wandered off by myself in search of those whom I had known in other days War grim visaged war I soon discovered had brought many changes to the city so well known to me in the days of my youth I found a number of old friends but the greater portion of the population were strange to me The scenes suggested painful memories and I was not sorry to turn my back again upon the city A large peculiarly shaped oak tree I well remember attracted the particular attention of the President it grew upon the outskirts of Petersburg and as he had discovered it on his first visit a few days previous to the second he insisted that the party should go with him to take a look at the isolated and magnificent specimen of the stately grandeur of the forest Every member of the party was only too willing to accede to the President s request and the visit to the oak was made and much enjoyed On our return to City Point from Petersburg the train moved slowly and the President observing a terrapin basking in the warm sunshine on the wayside had the conductor stop the train and one of the brakemen bring the terrapin in to him The movements of the ungainly little animal seemed to delight him and he amused himself with it until we reached James River where our steamer lay Tad stood near and joined in the happy laugh with his father For a week the River Queen remained in James River anchored the greater portion of the time at City Point and a pleasant and memorable week was it to all on board During the whole of this time a yacht lay in the stream about a quarter of a mile distant and its peculiar movements attracted the attention of all on board General Grant and missus Grant were on our steamer several times and many distinguished officers of the army also were entertained by the President and his party mister Lincoln when not off on an excursion of any kind lounged about the boat talking familiarly with every one that approached him The day before we started on our journey back to Washington mister Lincoln was engaged in reviewing the troops in camp He returned to the boat in the evening with a tired weary look Mother he said to his wife I have shaken so many hands to day that my arms ache tonight I almost wish that I could go to bed now As the twilight shadows deepened the lamps were lighted and the boat was brilliantly illuminated as it lay in the river decked with many colored lights it looked like an enchanted floating palace A military band was on board and as the hours lengthened into night it discoursed sweet music Many officers came on board to say good by and the scene was a brilliant one indeed About ten o clock mister Lincoln was called upon to make a speech Rising to his feet he said You must excuse me ladies and gentlemen I am too tired to speak to night On next Tuesday night I make a speech in Washington at which time you will learn all I have to say And now by way of parting from the brave soldiers of our gallant army I call upon the band to play Dixie It has always been a favorite of mine and since we have captured it we have a perfect right to enjoy it On taking his seat the band at once struck up with Dixie that sweet inspiring air and when the music died away there were clapping of hands and other manifestations of applause At eleven o clock the last good by was spoken the lights were taken down the River Queen rounded out into the water and we were on our way back to Washington We arrived at the Capital at six o clock on Sunday evening where the party separated each going to his and her own home This was one of the most delightful trips of my life and I always revert to it with feelings of genuine pleasure CHAPTER XI THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN I had never heard mister Lincoln make a public speech and knowing the man so well was very anxious to hear him On the morning of the Tuesday after our return from City Point missus Lincoln came to my apartments and before she drove away I asked permission to come to the White House that night and hear mister Lincoln speak Certainly Lizabeth if you take any interest in political speeches come and listen in welcome Thank you missus Lincoln May I trespass further on your kindness by asking permission to bring a friend with me Yes bring your friend also By the way come in time to dress me before the speaking commences I will be in time You may rely upon that Good morning I added as she swept from my room and passing out into the street entered her carriage and drove away About seven o clock that evening I entered the White House As I went up stairs I glanced into mister Lincoln s room through the half open door and seated by a desk was the President looking over his notes and muttering to himself His face was thoughtful his manner abstracted and I knew as I paused a moment to watch him that he was rehearsing the part that he was to play in the great drama soon to commence Proceeding to missus Lincoln s apartment I worked with busy fingers and in a short time her toilette was completed Great crowds began to gather in front of the White House and loud calls were made for the President The band stopped playing and as he advanced to the centre window over the door to make his address I looked out and never saw such a mass of heads before It was like a black gently swelling sea The swaying motion of the crowd in the dim uncertain light was like the rising and falling of billows like the ebb and flow of the tide upon the stranded shore of the ocean Close to the house the faces were plainly discernible but they faded into mere ghostly outlines on the outskirts of the assembly and what added to the weird spectral beauty of the scene was the confused hum of voices that rose above the sea of forms sounding like the subdued sullen roar of an ocean storm or the wind soughing through the dark lonely forest It was a grand and imposing scene and when the President with pale face and his soul flashing through his eyes advanced to speak he looked more like a demigod than a man crowned with the fleeting days of mortality The moment the President appeared at the window he was greeted with a storm of applause and voices re echoed the cry A light a light A lamp was brought and little Tad at once rushed to his father s side exclaiming Let me hold the light Papa let me hold the light missus Lincoln directed that the wish of her son be gratified and the lamp was transferred to his hands The father and son standing there in the presence of thousands of free citizens the one lost in a chain of eloquent ideas the other looking up into the speaking face with a proud manly look formed a beautiful and striking tableau There were a number of distinguished gentlemen as well as ladies in the room nearly all of whom remarked the picture I stood a short distance from mister Lincoln and as the light from the lamp fell full upon him making him stand out boldly in the darkness a sudden thought struck me and I whispered to the friend at my side What an easy matter would it be to kill the President as he stands there He could be shot down from the crowd and no one be able to tell who fired the shot I do not know what put such an idea into my head unless it was the sudden remembrance of the many warnings that mister Lincoln had received The next day I made mention to missus Lincoln of the idea that had impressed me so strangely the night before and she replied with a sigh Yes yes mister Lincoln s life is always exposed Ah no one knows what it is to live in constant dread of some fearful tragedy The President has been warned so often that I tremble for him on every public occasion I have a presentiment that he will meet with a sudden and violent end I pray God to protect my beloved husband from the hands of the assassin mister Lincoln was fond of pets He had two goats that knew the sound of his voice and when he called them they would come bounding to his side In the warm bright days he and Tad would sometimes play in the yard with these goats for an hour at a time One Saturday afternoon I went to the White House to dress missus Lincoln I had nearly completed my task when the President came in It was a bright day and walking to the window he looked down into the yard smiled and turning to me asked Madam Elizabeth you are fond of pets are you not O yes sir I answered Well come here and look at my two goats I believe they are the kindest and best goats in the world See how they sniff the clear air and skip and play in the sunshine Whew what a jump he exclaimed as one of the goats made a lofty spring Madam Elizabeth did you ever before see such an active goat Musing a moment he continued He feeds on my bounty and jumps with joy Do you think we could call him a bounty jumper But I flatter the bounty jumper My goat is far above him I would rather wear his horns and hairy coat through life than demean myself to the level of the man who plunders the national treasury in the name of patriotism The man who enlists into the service for a consideration and deserts the moment he receives his money but to repeat the play is bad enough but the men who manipulate the grand machine and who simply make the bounty jumper their agent in an outrageous fraud are far worse They are beneath the worms that crawl in the dark hidden places of earth His lips curled with haughty scorn and a cloud was gathering on his brow Only a moment the shadow rested on his face Just then both goats looked up at the window and shook their heads as if they would say How d ye do old friend See Madam Elizabeth exclaimed the President in a tone of enthusiasm my pets recognize me How earnestly they look There they go again what jolly fun and he laughed outright as the goats bounded swiftly to the other side of the yard Just then missus Lincoln called out Come Lizabeth if I get ready to go down this evening I must finish dressing myself or you must stop staring at those silly goats missus Lincoln was not fond of pets and she could not understand how mister Lincoln could take so much delight in his goats After Willie s death she could not bear the sight of anything he loved not even a flower Costly bouquets were presented to her but she turned from them with a shudder and either placed them in a room where she could not see them or threw them out of the window She gave all of Willie s toys everything connected with him away as she said she could not look upon them without thinking of her poor dead boy and to think of him in his white shroud and cold grave was maddening I never in my life saw a more peculiarly constituted woman Search the world over and you will not find her counterpart After mister Lincoln s death the goats that he loved so well were given away I believe to missus Lee nee Miss Blair one of the few ladies with whom missus Lincoln was on intimate terms in Washington During my residence in the Capital I made my home with mister and missus Walker Lewis people of my own race and friends in the truest sense of the word The days passed without any incident of particular note disturbing the current of life On Friday morning April fourteenth alas what American does not remember the day I saw missus Lincoln but for a moment She told me that she was to attend the theatre that night with the President but I was not summoned to assist her in making her toilette Sherman had swept from the northern border of Georgia through the heart of the Confederacy down to the sea striking the death blow to the rebellion Grant had pursued General Lee beyond Richmond and the army of Virginia that had made such stubborn resistance was crumbling to pieces Fort Sumter had fallen the stronghold first wrenched from the Union and which had braved the fury of Federal guns for so many years was restored to the Union the end of the war was near at hand and the great pulse of the loyal North thrilled with joy The dark war cloud was fading and a white robed angel seemed to hover in the sky whispering Peace peace on earth good will toward men Sons brothers fathers friends sweethearts were coming home Soon the white tents would be folded the volunteer army be disbanded and tranquillity again reign Happy happy day happy at least to those who fought under the banner of the Union There was great rejoicing throughout the North From the Atlantic to the Pacific flags were gayly thrown to the breeze and at night every city blazed with its tens of thousand lights But scarcely had the fireworks ceased to play and the lights been taken down from the windows when the lightning flashed the most appalling news over the magnetic wires The President has been murdered spoke the swift winged messenger and the loud huzza died upon the lips A nation suddenly paused in the midst of festivity and stood paralyzed with horror transfixed with awe Oh memorable day Oh memorable night Never before was joy so violently contrasted with sorrow At eleven o clock at night I was awakened by an old friend and neighbor Miss M Brown with the startling intelligence that the entire Cabinet had been assassinated and mister Lincoln shot but not mortally wounded When I heard the words I felt as if the blood had been frozen in my veins and that my lungs must collapse for the want of air mister Lincoln shot the Cabinet assassinated What could it mean The streets were alive with wondering awe stricken people Rumors flew thick and fast and the wildest reports came with every new arrival The words were repeated with blanched cheeks and quivering lips I waked mister and missus Lewis and told them that the President was shot and that I must go to the White House I could not remain in a state of uncertainty I felt that the house would not hold me They tried to quiet me but gentle words could not calm the wild tempest They quickly dressed themselves and we sallied out into the street to drift with the excited throng We walked rapidly towards the White House and on our way passed the residence of Secretary Seward which was surrounded by armed soldiers keeping back all intruders with the point of the bayonet We hurried on and as we approached the White House saw that it too was surrounded with soldiers Every entrance was strongly guarded and no one was permitted to pass The guard at the gate told us that mister Lincoln had not been brought home but refused to give any other information More excited than ever we wandered down the street Grief and anxiety were making me weak and as we joined the outskirts of a large crowd I began to feel as meek and humble as a penitent child A gray haired old man was passing I caught a glimpse of his face and it seemed so full of kindness and sorrow that I gently touched his arm and imploringly asked Will you please sir to tell me whether mister Lincoln is dead or not Not dead he replied but dying God help us and with a heavy step he passed on Not dead but dying then indeed God help us We learned that the President was mortally wounded that he had been shot down in his box at the theatre and that he was not expected to live till morning when we returned home with heavy hearts I could not sleep I wanted to go to missus Lincoln as I pictured her wild with grief but then I did not know where to find her and I must wait till morning Never did the hours drag so slowly Every moment seemed an age and I could do nothing but walk about and hold my arms in mental agony Morning came at last and a sad morning was it The flags that floated so gayly yesterday now were draped in black and hung in silent folds at half mast The President was dead and a nation was mourning for him Every house was draped in black and every face wore a solemn look People spoke in subdued tones and glided whisperingly wonderingly silently about the streets About eleven o clock on Saturday morning a carriage drove up to the door and a messenger asked for Elizabeth Keckley Who wants her I asked I come from missus Lincoln If you are missus Keckley come with me immediately to the White House I hastily put on my shawl and bonnet and was driven at a rapid rate to the White House Everything about the building was sad and solemn I was quickly shown to missus Lincoln s room and on entering saw missus L tossing uneasily about upon a bed The room was darkened and the only person in it besides the widow of the President was missus Secretary Welles who had spent the night with her Bowing to missus Welles I went to the bedside Why did you not come to me last night Elizabeth I sent for you missus Lincoln asked in a low whisper I did try to come to you but I could not find you I answered as I laid my hand upon her hot brow I afterwards learned that when she had partially recovered from the first shock of the terrible tragedy in the theatre missus Welles asked Is there no one missus Lincoln that you desire to have with you in this terrible affliction Yes send for Elizabeth Keckley I want her just as soon as she can be brought here Three messengers it appears were successively despatched for me but all of them mistook the number and failed to find me Shortly after entering the room on Saturday morning missus Welles excused herself as she said she must go to her own family and I was left alone with missus Lincoln She was nearly exhausted with grief and when she became a little quiet I asked and received permission to go into the Guests Room where the body of the President lay in state When I crossed the threshold of the room I could not help recalling the day on which I had seen little Willie lying in his coffin where the body of his father now lay I remembered how the President had wept over the pale beautiful face of his gifted boy and now the President himself was dead The last time I saw him he spoke kindly to me but alas the lips would never move again The light had faded from his eyes and when the light went out the soul went with it What a noble soul was his noble in all the noble attributes of God Never did I enter the solemn chamber of death with such palpitating heart and trembling footsteps as I entered it that day No common mortal had died The Moses of my people had fallen in the hour of his triumph Fame had woven her choicest chaplet for his brow Though the brow was cold and pale in death the chaplet should not fade for God had studded it with the glory of the eternal stars When I entered the room the members of the Cabinet and many distinguished officers of the army were grouped around the body of their fallen chief They made room for me and approaching the body I lifted the white cloth from the white face of the man that I had worshipped as an idol looked upon as a demi god Notwithstanding the violence of the death of the President there was something beautiful as well as grandly solemn in the expression of the placid face There lurked the sweetness and gentleness of childhood and the stately grandeur of godlike intellect I gazed long at the face and turned away with tears in my eyes and a choking sensation in my throat Ah never was man so widely mourned before The whole world bowed their heads in grief when Abraham Lincoln died Returning to missus Lincoln s room I found her in a new paroxysm of grief Robert was bending over his mother with tender affection and little Tad was crouched at the foot of the bed with a world of agony in his young face I shall never forget the scene the wails of a broken heart the unearthly shrieks the terrible convulsions the wild tempestuous outbursts of grief from the soul I bathed missus Lincoln s head with cold water and soothed the terrible tornado as best I could Tad s grief at his father s death was as great as the grief of his mother but her terrible outbursts awed the boy into silence Sometimes he would throw his arms around her neck and exclaim between his broken sobs Don t cry so Mamma don t cry or you will make me cry too You will break my heart missus Lincoln could not bear to hear Tad cry and when he would plead to her not to break his heart she would calm herself with a great effort and clasp her child in her arms Every room in the White House was darkened and every one spoke in subdued tones and moved about with muffled tread The very atmosphere breathed of the great sorrow which weighed heavily upon each heart missus Lincoln never left her room and while the body of her husband was being borne in solemn state from the Atlantic to the broad prairies of the West she was weeping with her fatherless children in her private chamber She denied admittance to almost every one and I was her only companion except her children in the days of her great sorrow There were many surmises as to who was implicated with J Wilkes Booth in the assassination of the President A new messenger had accompanied mister and missus Lincoln to the theatre on that terrible Friday night It was the duty of this messenger to stand at the door of the box during the performance and thus guard the inmates from all intrusion It appears that the messenger was carried away by the play and so neglected his duty that Booth gained easy admission to the box missus Lincoln firmly believed that this messenger was implicated in the assassination plot One night I was lying on a lounge near the bed occupied by missus Lincoln One of the servants entering the room missus L asked Who is on watch to night The new messenger was the reply What the man who attended us to the theatre on the night my dear good husband was murdered He I believe is one of the murderers Tell him to come in to me The messenger had overheard missus Lincoln s words through the half open door and when he came in he was trembling violently She turned to him fiercely So you are on guard to night on guard in the White House after helping to murder the President Pardon me but I did not help to murder the President I could never stoop to murder much less to the murder of so good and great a man as the President But it appears that you did stoop to murder No no don t say that he broke in God knows that I am innocent I don t believe you Why were you not at the door to keep the assassin out when he rushed into the box I did wrong I admit and I have bitterly repented it but I did not help to kill the President I did not believe that any one would try to kill so good a man in such a public place and the belief made me careless I was attracted by the play and did not see the assassin enter the box But you should have seen him You had no business to be careless I shall always believe that you are guilty Hush I shan t hear another word she exclaimed as the messenger essayed to reply Go now and keep your watch she added with an imperious wave of her hand With mechanical step and white face the messenger left the room and missus Lincoln fell back on her pillow covered her face with her hands and commenced sobbing Robert was very tender to his mother in the days of her sorrow He suffered deeply as his haggard face indicated but he was ever manly and collected when in the presence of his mother missus Lincoln was extremely nervous and she refused to have anybody about her but myself Many ladies called but she received none of them Had she been less secluded in her grief perhaps she would have had many warmer friends to day than she has But far be it from me to harshly judge the sorrow of any one Could the ladies who called to condole with missus Lincoln after the death of her husband and who were denied admittance to her chamber have seen how completely prostrated she was with grief they would have learned to speak more kindly of her Often at night when Tad would hear her sobbing he would get up and come to her bed in his white sleeping clothes Don t cry Mamma I cannot sleep if you cry Papa was good and he has gone to heaven He is happy there He is with God and brother Willie Don t cry Mamma or I will cry too The closing appeal always proved the most effectual as missus Lincoln could not bear to hear her child cry Tad had been petted by his father but petting could not spoil such a manly nature as his He seemed to realize that he was the son of a President to realize it in its loftiest and noblest sense One morning while being dressed he looked up at his nurse and said Pa is dead I can hardly believe that I shall never see him again I must learn to take care of myself now He looked thoughtful a moment then added Yes Pa is dead and I am only Tad Lincoln now little Tad like other little boys I am not a President s son now I won t have many presents any more Well I will try and be a good boy and will hope to go some day to Pa and brother Willie in heaven He was a brave manly child and knew that influence had passed out of their hands with the death of his father and that his position in life was altered He seemed to feel that people petted him and gave him presents because they wanted to please the President of the United States From that period forward he became more independent and in a short time learned to dispense with the services of a nurse While in Chicago I saw him get out his clothes one Sunday morning and dress himself and the change was such a great one to me for while in the White House servants obeyed his every nod and bid that I could scarcely refrain from shedding tears Had his father lived I knew it would have been different with his favorite boy Tad roomed with Robert and he always took pride in pleasing his brother After the Committee had started West with the body of the President there was quite a breeze of excitement for a few days as to where the remains should be interred Secretary Stanton and others held frequent conferences with Robert mister Todd missus Lincoln s cousin and doctor Henry an old schoolmate and friend of mister Lincoln The city authorities of Springfield had purchased a beautiful plat of ground in a prosperous portion of the city and work was rapidly progressing on the tomb when missus Lincoln made strenuous objection to the location She declared that she would stop the body in Chicago before it should be laid to rest in the lot purchased for the purpose by the City of Springfield She gave as a reason that it was her desire to be laid by the side of her husband when she died and that such would be out of the question in a public place of the kind As is well known the difficulty was finally settled by placing the remains of the President in the family vault at Oak Ridge a charming spot for the home of the dead After the President s funeral missus Lincoln rallied and began to make preparations to leave the White House One day she suddenly exclaimed God Elizabeth what a change Did ever woman have to suffer so much and experience so great a change I had an ambition to be missus President that ambition has been gratified and now I must step down from the pedestal My poor husband had he never been President he might be living to day Alas all is over with me Folding her arms for a few moments she rocked back and forth then commenced again more vehemently than ever My God Elizabeth I can never go back to Springfield no never until I go in my shroud to be laid by my dear husband s side and may Heaven speed that day I should like to live for my sons but life is so full of misery that I would rather die And then she would go off into a fit of hysterics CHAPTER XII missus LINCOLN LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE For five weeks missus Lincoln was confined to her room Packing afforded quite a relief as it so closely occupied us that we had not much time for lamentation Letters of condolence were received from all parts of the country and even from foreign potentates but mister Andrew Johnson the successor of mister Lincoln never called on the widow or even so much as wrote a line expressing sympathy for her grief and the loss of her husband Robert called on him one day to tell him that his mother would turn the White House over to him in a few days and he never even so much as inquired after their welfare missus Lincoln firmly believes that mister Johnson was concerned in the assassination plot In packing missus Lincoln gave away everything intimately connected with the President as she said that she could not bear to be reminded of the past The articles were given to those who were regarded as the warmest of mister Lincoln s admirers All of the presents passed through my hands The dress that missus Lincoln wore on the night of the assassination was given to missus Slade the wife of an old and faithful messenger The cloak stained with the President s blood was given to me as also was the bonnet worn on the same memorable night Afterwards I received the comb and brush that mister Lincoln used during his residence at the White House With this same comb and brush I had often combed his head When almost ready to go down to a reception he would turn to me with a quizzical look Well Madam Elizabeth will you brush my bristles down to night Yes mister Lincoln Then he would take his seat in an easy chair and sit quietly while I arranged his hair As may well be imagined I was only too glad to accept this comb and brush from the hands of missus Lincoln The cloak bonnet comb and brush the glove worn at the first reception after the second inaugural and mister Lincoln s over shoes also given to me I have since donated for the benefit of Wilberforce University a colored college near Xenia Ohio destroyed by fire on the night that the President was murdered There was much surmise when missus Lincoln left the White House what her fifty or sixty boxes not to count her score of trunks could contain Had the government not been so liberal in furnishing the boxes it is possible that there would have been less demand for so much transportation The boxes were loosely packed and many of them with articles not worth carrying away missus Lincoln had a passion for hoarding old things believing with Toodles that they were handy to have about the house The bonnets that she brought with her from Springfield in addition to every one purchased during her residence in Washington were packed in the boxes and transported to Chicago She remarked that she might find use for the material some day and it was prudent to look to the future I am sorry to say that missus Lincoln s foresight in regard to the future was only confined to cast off clothing as she owed at the time of the President s death different store bills amounting to seventy thousand dollars mister Lincoln knew nothing of these bills and the only happy feature of his assassination was that he died in ignorance of them Had he known to what extent his wife was involved the fact would have embittered the only pleasant moments of his life I disclose this secret in regard to missus Lincoln s debts in order to explain why she should subsequently have labored under pecuniary embarrassment The children as well as herself had received a vast number of presents during mister Lincoln s administration and these presents constituted a large item in the contents of the boxes The only article of furniture so far as I know taken away from the White House by missus Lincoln was a little dressing stand used by the President I recollect hearing him say one day Mother this little stand is so handy and suits me so well that I do not know how I shall get along without it when we move away from here He was standing before a mirror brushing his hair when he made the remark Well father missus Lincoln replied if you like the stand so well we will take it with us when we go away Not for the world he exclaimed but she interrupted him I should like to know what difference it makes if we put a better one in its place That alters the question If you will put a stand in its place worth twice as much as this one and the Commissioner consents then I have no objection missus Lincoln remembered these words and with the consent of the Commissioner took the stand to Chicago with her for the benefit of little Tad Another stand I must not forget to add was put in its place It is charged that a great deal of furniture was lost from the White House during mister Lincoln s occupation of it Very true and it can be accounted for in this way In some respects to put the case very plainly missus Lincoln was penny wise and pound foolish When she moved into the White House she discharged the Steward whose business it was to look after the affairs of the household When the Steward was dismissed there was no one to superintend affairs and the servants carried away many pieces of furniture In this manner the furniture rapidly disappeared Robert was frequently in the room where the boxes were being packed and he tried without avail to influence his mother to set fire to her vast stores of old goods What are you going to do with that old dress mother he would ask Never mind Robert I will find use for it You do not understand this business And what is more I hope I never may understand it I wish to heaven the car would take fire in which you place these boxes for transportation to Chicago and burn all of your old plunder up and then with an impatient gesture he would turn on his heel and leave the room Robert is so impetuous his mother would say to me after the closing of the door He never thinks about the future Well I hope that he will get over his boyish notions in time Many of the articles that missus Lincoln took away from the White House were given after her arrival in Chicago for the benefit of charity fairs At last everything was packed and the day for departure for the West came I can never forget that day it was so unlike the day when the body of the President was borne from the hall in grand and solemn state Then thousands gathered to bow the head in reverence as the plumed hearse drove down the line There was all the pomp of military display drooping flags battalions with reversed arms and bands playing dirge like airs Now the wife of the President was leaving the White House and there was scarcely a friend to tell her good by She passed down the public stairway entered her carriage and quietly drove to the depot where we took the cars The silence was almost painful It had been arranged that I should go to Chicago When missus Lincoln first suggested her plan I strongly objected but I had been with her so long that she had acquired great power over me I cannot go West with you missus Lincoln I said when the idea was first advanced But you must go to Chicago with me Elizabeth I cannot do without you You forget my business missus Lincoln I cannot leave it Just now I have the spring trousseau to make for missus Douglas and I have promised to have it done in less than a week Never mind missus Douglas can get some one else to make her trousseau You may find it to your interest to go I am very poor now but if Congress makes an appropriation for my benefit you shall be well rewarded It is not the reward but I commenced by way of reply but she stopped me Now don t say another word about it if you do not wish to distress me I have determined that you shall go to Chicago with me and you must go When missus Douglas learned that missus Lincoln wished me to accompany her West she sent me word Never mind me Do all you can for missus Lincoln My heart s sympathy is with her Finding that no excuse would be accepted I made preparations to go to Chicago with missus L The green car had specially been chartered for us and in this we were conveyed to the West doctor Henry accompanied us and he was remarkably attentive and kind The first night out missus Lincoln had a severe headache and while I was bathing her temples she said to me Lizabeth you are my best and kindest friend and I love you as my best friend I wish it were in my power to make you comfortable for the balance of your days If Congress provides for me depend upon it I will provide for you The trip was devoid of interest We arrived in Chicago without accident or delay and apartments were secured for us at the Tremont House where we remained one week At the expiration of this time missus Lincoln decided that living at the hotel was attended with too much expense so it was arranged that we should go to the country Rooms were selected at Hyde Park a summer resort Robert and Tad accompanied their mother to Hyde Park We arrived about three o clock in the afternoon of Saturday The place had just been opened the summer before and there was a newness about everything The accommodations were not first class the rooms being small and plainly furnished It was a lively day for us all Robert occupied himself unpacking his books and arranging them on the shelves in the corner of his small but neat room I assisted him he talking pleasantly all the while When we were through he folded his arms stood off a little distance from the mantel with an abstracted look as if he were thinking of the great change in his fortunes contrasting the present with the past Turning to me he asked Well missus Keckley how do you like our new quarters This is a delightful place and I think you will pass your time pleasantly I answered He looked at me with a quizzical smile then remarked You call it a delightful place Well perhaps it is Since you do not have to stay here you can safely say as much about the charming situation as you please I presume that I must put up with it as mother s pleasure must be consulted before my own But candidly I would almost as soon be dead as be compelled to remain three months in this dreary house He seemed to feel what he said and going to the window he looked out upon the view with moody countenance I passed into missus Lincoln s room and found her lying upon the bed sobbing as if her heart would break What a dreary place Lizzie And to think that I should be compelled to live here because I have not the means to live elsewhere Ah what a sad change has come to us all I had listened to her sobbing for eight weeks therefore I was never surprised to find her in tears Tad was the only cheerful one of the party He was a child of sunshine and nothing seemed to dampen the ardor of his spirits Sunday was a very quiet day I looked out of my window in the morning upon the beautiful lake that formed one of the most delightful views from the house The wind was just strong enough to ripple the broad bosom of the water and each ripple caught a jewel from the sunshine and threw it sparkling up towards the sky Here and there a sail boat silently glided into view or sank below the faint blue line that marked the horizon glided and melted away like the spectral shadows that sometimes haunt the white snow fields in the cold tranquil light of a winter s moon As I stood by my window that morning looking out upon the lake my thoughts were etherealized the reflected sunbeams suggested visions of crowns studded with the jewels of eternal life and I wondered how any one could call Hyde Park a dreary place I had seen so much trouble in my life that I was willing to fold my arms and sink into a passive slumber slumber anywhere so the great longing of the soul was gratified rest Robert spent the day in his room with his books while I remained in missus Lincoln s room talking with her contrasting the present with the past and drawing plans for the future She held no communication by letter or otherwise with any of her relatives or old friends saying that she wished to lead a secluded life for the summer Old faces she claimed would only bring back memories of scenes that she desired to forget and new faces she felt assured could not sympathize with her distress or add to the comforts of her situation On Monday morning Robert was getting ready to ride into Chicago as business called him to the city Where you goin brother Bob Tad generally called Robert brother Bob Only into town was the brief reply Mayn t I go with you Ask mother I think that she will say no Just then missus Lincoln came in and Tad ran to her with the eager question Oh Ma can t I go to town with brother Bob I want to go so badly Go to town No you must stay and keep me company Besides I have determined that you shall get a lesson every day and I am going to commence to day with you I don t want to get a lesson I won t get a lesson broke in the impetuous boy I don t want to learn my book I want to go to town I suppose you want to grow up to be a great dunce Hush Tad you shall not go to town until you have said a lesson and the mother looked resolute May I go after I learn my book was the next question Yes if Robert will wait for you Oh Bob will wait won t you Bob No I cannot wait but the landlord is going in this afternoon and you can go with him You must do as mother tells you Tad You are getting to be a big boy now and must start to school next fall and you would not like to go to school without knowing how to read Where s my book Ma Get my book quick I will say my lesson and he jumped about the room boisterously boy like Be quiet Tad Here is your book and we will now begin the first lesson said his mother as she seated herself in an easy chair Tad had always been much humored by his parents especially by his father He suffered from a slight impediment in his speech and had never been made to go to school consequently his book knowledge was very limited I knew that his education had been neglected but had no idea he was so deficient as the first lesson at Hyde Park proved him to be Drawing a low chair to his mother s side he opened his book and began to slowly spell the first word A P E Well what does A p e spell Monkey was the instant rejoinder The word was illustrated by a small wood cut of an ape which looked to Tad s eyes very much like a monkey and his pronunciation was guided by the picture and not by the sounds of the different letters Nonsense exclaimed his mother A p e does not spell monkey Does spell monkey Isn t that a monkey and Tad pointed triumphantly to the picture No it is not a monkey Not a monkey what is it then An ape An ape taint an ape Don t I know a monkey when I see it No if you say that is a monkey I do know a monkey I ve seen lots of them in the street with the organs I know a monkey better than you do cause I always go out into the street to see them when they come by and you don t But Tad listen to me An ape is a species of the monkey It looks like a monkey but it is not a monkey It shouldn t look like a monkey then Here Yib he always called me Yib isn t this a monkey and don t A p e spell monkey Ma don t know anything about it and he thrust his book into my face in an earnest excited manner I could not longer restrain myself and burst out laughing Tad looked very much offended and I hastened to say I beg your pardon Master Tad I hope that you will excuse my want of politeness He bowed his head in a patronizing way and returned to the original question Isn t this a monkey Don t A p e spell monkey No Tad your mother is right A p e spells ape You don t know as much as Ma Both of you don t know anything and Master Tad s eyes flashed with indignation Robert entered the room and the question was referred to him After many explanations he succeeded in convincing Tad that A p e does not spell monkey and the balance of the lesson was got over with less difficulty Whenever I think of this incident I am tempted to laugh and then it occurs to me that had Tad been a negro boy not the son of a President and so difficult to instruct he would have been called thick skulled and would have been held up as an example of the inferiority of race I know many full negro boys able to read and write who are not older than Tad Lincoln was when he persisted that A p e spelt monkey Do not imagine that I desire to reflect upon the intellect of little Tad Not at all he is a bright boy a son that will do honor to the genius and greatness of his father I only mean to say that some incidents are about as damaging to one side of the question as to the other If a colored boy appears dull so does a white boy sometimes and if a whole race is judged by a single example of apparent dulness another race should be judged by a similar example I returned to Washington with missus Lincoln s best wishes for my success in business The journey was devoid of incident After resting a few days I called at the White House and transacted some business for missus Lincoln I had no desire to enter the house for everything about it bitterly reminded me of the past and when I came out of the door I hoped that I had crossed the threshold for the last time I was asked by some of my friends if I had sent my business cards to mister Johnson s family and my answer was that I had not as I had no desire to work for the President s family mister Johnson was no friend to mister Lincoln and he had failed to treat missus Lincoln in the hour of her greatest sorrow with even common courtesy Having promised to make a spring trousseau for missus Senator Douglas as soon as I should return from Chicago I called on her to meet the engagement She appeared pleased to see me and in greeting me asked with evident surprise Why Keckley she always called me Keckley is this you I did not know you were coming back It was reported that you designed remaining with missus Lincoln all summer missus Lincoln would have been glad to have kept me with her had she been able Able What do you mean by that Simply this Already she is laboring under pecuniary embarrassment and was only able to pay my expenses and allow me nothing for my time You surprise me I thought she was left in good circumstances So many think it appears missus Lincoln I assure you is now practising the closest economy I must do something for myself missus Douglas so I have come back to Washington to open my shop The next day I collected my assistants and my business went on as usual Orders came in more rapidly than I could fill them One day in the middle of the month of June the girl who was attending the door came into the cutting room where I was hard at work missus Keckley there is a lady below who wants to see you Who is she I don t know I did not learn her name Is her face familiar Does she look like a regular customer No she is a stranger I don t think she was ever here before She came in an open carriage with a black woman for an attendant It may be the wife of one of Johnson s new secretaries Do go down missus Keckley exclaimed my work girls in a chorus I went below and on entering the parlor a plainly dressed lady rose to her feet and asked Is this the dressmaker Yes I am a dressmaker missus Keckley Yes missus Lincoln s former dressmaker were you not Yes I worked for missus Lincoln Are you very busy now Very indeed Can you do anything for me That depends upon what is to be done and when it is to be done Well say one dress now and several others a few weeks later I can make one dress for you now but no more I cannot finish the one for you in less than three weeks That will answer I am missus Patterson the daughter of President Johnson I expect my sister missus Stover here in three weeks and the dress is for her We are both the same size and you can fit the dress to me The terms were satisfactorily arranged and after measuring missus Patterson she bade me good morning entered her carriage and drove away When I went up stairs into the work room the girls were anxious to learn who my visitor was It was missus Patterson the daughter of President Johnson I answered in response to several questions What the daughter of our good Moses Are you going to work for her I have taken her order I fear that Johnson will prove a poor Moses and I would not work for any of the family remarked one of the girls None of them appeared to like mister Lincoln s successor I finished the dress for missus Patterson and it gave satisfaction I afterwards learned that both missus Patterson and missus Stover were kindhearted plain unassuming women making no pretensions to elegance One day when I called at the White House in relation to some work that I was doing for them I found missus Patterson busily at work with a sewing machine The sight was a novel one to me for the White House for as long as I remained with missus Lincoln I do not recollect ever having seen her with a needle in her hand The last work done for the Johnsons by me were two dresses one for each of the sisters missus Patterson subsequently wrote me a note requesting me to cut and fit a dress for her to which I replied that I never cut and fitted work to be made up outside of my work room This brought our business relations to an abrupt end The months passed and my business prospered I continually received letters from missus Lincoln and as the anniversary of her husband s death approached she wrote in a sadder strain Before I left Chicago she had exacted the promise that should Congress make an appropriation for her benefit I must join her in the West and go with her to visit the tomb of the President for the first time The appropriation was made one of the conditions of my visit for without relief from Congress she would be unable to bear my expenses The appropriation was not made and so I was unable to join missus Lincoln at the appointed time She wrote me that her plan was to leave Chicago in the morning with Tad reach Springfield at night stop at one of the hotels drive out to Oak Ridge the next day and take the train for Chicago the same evening thus avoiding a meeting with any of her old friends This plan as she afterwards wrote me was carried out When the second anniversary approached President Johnson and party were swinging round the circle and as they were to visit Chicago she was especially anxious to be away from the city when they should arrive accordingly she hurried off to Springfield and spent the time in weeping over the tomb where repose the hallowed ashes of her husband During all this time I was asked many questions about missus Lincoln some prompted by friendship but a greater number by curiosity but my brief answers I fear were not always accepted as the most satisfactory CHAPTER XIII THE ORIGIN OF THE RIVALRY BETWEEN mister DOUGLAS AND mister LINCOLN missus Lincoln from her girlhood up had an ambition to become the wife of a President When a little girl as I was told by one of her sisters she was disposed to be a little noisy at times and was self willed One day she was romping about the room making more noise than the nerves of her grandmother could stand The old lady looked over her spectacles and said in a commanding tone Sit down Mary Do be quiet What on earth do you suppose will become of you if you go on this way Oh I will be the wife of a President some day carelessly answered the petted child missus Lincoln as Miss Mary Todd was quite a belle in Springfield Illinois and from all accounts she was fond of flirting She generally managed to keep a half dozen gentlemen biting at the hook that she baited so temptingly for them The world if I mistake not are not aware that the rivalry between mister Lincoln and mister Stephen A Douglas commenced over the hand of Miss Mary Todd The young lady was ambitious and she smiled more sweetly upon mister Douglas and mister Lincoln than any of her other admirers as they were regarded as rising men She played her part so well that neither of the rivals for a long time could tell who would win the day mister Douglas first proposed for her hand and she discarded him The young man urged his suit boldly Mary you do not know what you are refusing You have always had an ambition to become the wife of a President of the United States Pardon the egotism but I fear that in refusing my hand to night you have thrown away your best chance to ever rule in the White House I do not understand you mister Douglas Then I will speak more plainly You know Mary that I am ambitious like yourself and something seems to whisper in my ear You will be President some day Depend upon it I shall make a stubborn fight to win the proud position You have my best wishes mister Douglas still I cannot consent to be your wife I shall become missus President or I am the victim of false prophets but it will not be as missus Douglas I have this little chapter in a romantic history from the lips of missus Lincoln herself At one of the receptions at the White House shortly after the first inauguration missus Lincoln joined in the promenade with Senator Douglas He was holding a bouquet that had been presented to her and as they moved along he said Mary it reminds me of old times to have you lean upon my arm You refer to the days of our youth I must do you the credit mister Douglas to say that you were a gallant beau Not only a beau but a lover Do you remember the night our flirtation was brought to an end Distinctly You now see that I was right I am missus President but not missus Douglas True you have reached the goal before me but I do not despair missus Douglas a nobler woman does not live if I am spared may possibly succeed you as missus President A few evenings after mister Douglas had been discarded mister Lincoln made a formal proposal for the hand of Miss Todd but it appears that the young lady was not willing to capitulate at once She believed that she could send her lover adrift to day and win him back to morrow You are bold mister Lincoln Love makes me bold You honor me pardon me but I cannot consent to be your wife Is this your final answer Miss Todd and the suitor rose nervously to his feet I do not often jest mister Lincoln Why should I reconsider to morrow my decision of to day Excuse me Your answer is sufficient I was led to hope that I might become dearer to you than a friend but the hope it seems has proved an idle one I have the honor to say good night Miss Todd and pale yet calm mister Lincoln bowed himself out of the room He rushed to his office in a frantic state of mind doctor Henry his most intimate friend happened to come in and was surprised to see the young lawyer walking the floor in an agitated manner What is the matter Lincoln You look desperate Matter I am sick of the world It is a heartless deceitful world and I care not how soon I am out of it You rave What has happened Have you been quarrelling with your sweetheart Quarrel I wish to God it was a quarrel for then I could look forward to reconciliation the girl has refused to become my wife after leading me to believe that she loved me She is a heartless coquette Don t give up the conquest so easily Cheer up man you may succeed yet Perhaps she is only testing your love No I believe that she is going to marry Douglas If she does I will blow my brains out Nonsense That would not mend matters Your brains were given to you for different use Come we will go to your room now Go to bed and sleep on the question and you will get up feeling stronger to morrow and doctor Henry took the arm of his friend Lincoln led him home and saw him safely in bed The next morning the doctor called at mister Lincoln s room and found that his friend had passed a restless night Excitement had brought on fever which threatened to assume a violent form as the cause of the excitement still remained Several days passed and mister Lincoln was confined to his bed doctor Henry at once determined to call on Miss Todd and find out how desperate the case was Miss Todd was glad to see him and she was deeply distressed to learn that mister Lincoln was ill She wished to go to him at once but the Doctor reminded her that she was the cause of his illness She frankly acknowledged her folly saying that she only desired to test the sincerity of mister Lincoln s love that he was the idol of her heart and that she would become his wife The Doctor returned with joyful news to his patient The intelligence proved the best remedy for the disease Mutual explanations followed and in a few months mister Lincoln led Miss Todd to the altar in triumph I learned these facts from doctor Henry and missus Lincoln I believe them to be facts and as such have recorded them They do not agree with mister Herndon s story that mister Lincoln never loved but one woman and that woman was Ann Rutledge but then mister Herndon s story must be looked upon as a pleasant piece of fiction When it appeared missus Lincoln felt shocked that one who pretended to be the friend of her dead husband should deliberately seek to blacken his memory mister Lincoln was far too honest a man to marry a woman that he did not love He was a kind and an indulgent husband and when he saw faults in his wife he excused them as he would excuse the impulsive acts of a child In fact missus Lincoln was never more pleased than when the President called her his child wife Before closing this rambling chapter I desire to refer to another incident After the death of my son Miss Mary Welsh a dear friend one of my old saint Louis patrons called to see me and on broaching the cause of my grief she condoled with me She knew that I had looked forward to the day when my son would be a support to me knew that he was to become the prop and main stay of my old age and knowing this she advised me to apply for a pension I disliked the idea very much and told her so told her that I did not want to make money out of his death She explained away all of my objections argued that Congress had made an appropriation for the specific purpose of giving a pension to every widow who should lose an only son in the war and insisted that I should have my rights She was so enthusiastic in the matter that she went to see honorable Owen Lovejoy then a member of the House from Illinois and laid my case before him mister Lovejoy was very kind and said as I was entitled to the pension I should have it even if he had to bring the subject before Congress I did not desire public agitation and mister Lovejoy prepared my claim and laid it before the Commissioners In the meantime he left Washington and mister Joseph Lovejoy his brother prosecuted the claim for me and finally succeeded in securing me a pension of eight dollars per month mister Joseph Lovejoy was inclined to the Democratic party and he pressed my claim with great earnestness he hoped that the claim would not be allowed as he said the rejection of it would make capital for his party Nevertheless the pension was granted and I am none the less thankful to mister Joseph Lovejoy for his kindness to me and interest in my welfare CHAPTER XIV OLD FRIENDS In order to introduce a pleasant chapter of my life I must take a slight retrospective glance missus Ann e Garland the mistress from whom I purchased my freedom in saint Louis had five daughters all lovely attractive girls I used to take pride in dressing the two eldest Miss Mary and Miss Carrie for parties Though the family labored under pecuniary embarrassment I worked for these two young girls and they were always able to present a good appearance in society They were much admired and both made the best matches of the season Miss Mary married doctor Pappan and Miss Carrie doctor John Farrow I loved them both tenderly and they were warmly attached to me Both are now dead and when the death film was gathering in the eyes each called for me and asked to die in my arms Miss Carrie did not long survive her sister and I wept many tears over the death beds of the two lovely flowers that had blossomed so sweetly beneath my eyes Each breathed her last in the arms that had sheltered them so often in the bright rosy period of life My mother took care of my son and Miss Nannie Garland the fourth daughter when a wee thing became my especial charge She slept in my bed and I watched over her as if she had been my own child She called me Yiddie and I could not have loved her more tenderly had she been the sister of my unfortunate boy She was about twelve years old when I purchased my freedom and resigned my charge to other hands After mister Garland s death the widow moved to Vicksburg Mississippi and I lost sight of the family for a few years My mother accompanied them to Vicksburg where she died I made two visits to Vicksburg as a free woman the object of my second visit being to look after the few effects left by my mother As I did not visit my mother s grave at the time the Garlands were much surprised but I offered no explanation The reason is not difficult to understand My mother was buried in a public ground and the marks of her grave as I learned were so obscure that the spot could not be readily designated To look upon a grave and not feel certain whose ashes repose beneath the sod is painful and the doubt which mystifies you weakens the force if not the purity of the love offering from the heart Memory preserved a sunny picture of my mother s face and I did not wish to weave sombre threads threads suggestive of a deserted grave yard into it and thus impair its beauty After spending a few weeks with the family I returned to saint Louis and then came North The war broke out and I lost all trace of the Garlands Often during my residence in Washington I recalled the past and wondered what had become of those who claimed my first duty and my first love When I would mention their names and express interest in their welfare my Northern friends would roll up their eyes in surprise Why Lizzie how can you have a kind thought for those who inflicted a terrible wrong upon you by keeping you in bondage they would ask You forget the past is dear to every one for to the past belongs that golden period the days of childhood The past is a mirror that reflects the chief incidents of my life To surrender it is to surrender the greatest part of my existence early impressions friends and the graves of my father my mother and my son These people are associated with everything that memory holds dear and so long as memory proves faithful it is but natural that I should sigh to see them once more But they have forgotten you They are too selfish to give a single thought to you now that you no longer are their slave Perhaps so but I cannot believe it You do not know the Southern people as well as I do how warm is the attachment between master and slave My Northern friends could not understand the feeling therefore explanation was next to useless They would listen with impatience and remark at the close with a shrug of the shoulders You have some strange notions Lizzie In the fall of eighteen sixty five a lady called on me at my apartments in Washington Her face looked familiar but I could not place her When I entered the room she came towards me eagerly You are surprised to see me I know I am just from Lynchburg and when I left cousin Ann e I promised to call and see you if I came to Washington I am here you see according to promise I was more bewildered than ever Cousin Ann e Pardon me Oh I see you do not recognize me I am missus General Longstreet but you knew me when a girl as Bettie Garland Bettie Garland And is this indeed you I am so glad to see you Where does Miss Ann e live now I always called my last mistress Miss Ann e Ah I thought you could not forget old friends Cousin Ann e is living in Lynchburg All the family are in Virginia They moved to the old State during the war Fannie is dead Nannie has grown into a woman and is married to General Meem Hugh was killed in the war and now only Spot Maggie and Nannie are left Fannie dead and poor Hugh You bring sad news as well as pleasant And so my little pet is married I can hardly believe it she was only a child when I saw her last Yes Nannie is married to a noble man General Meem belongs to one of the best families in Virginia They are now living at Rude s Hill up beyond Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley All of them want to see you very badly I should be delighted to go to them Miss Bettie I can hardly realize that you are the wife of General Longstreet and just think you are now sitting in the very chair and the very room where missus Lincoln has often sat She laughed The change is a great one Lizzie we little dream to day what to morrow will bring forth Well we must take a philosophical view of life After fighting so long against the Yankees General Longstreet is now in Washington sueing for pardon and we propose to live in peace with the United States again I had many questions to ask her about old friends and the time passed rapidly She greeted me with the frankness that she had always extended to me and I was transported to days of the long ago Her stay in Washington was brief as the General arranged his business and they left the capital the next day missus Longstreet gave me the Garlands address and I wrote to them expressing the hope that I would be able to see them before long In reply came letters full of tender sympathy and affection In the winter of eighteen sixty five Miss Nannie wrote to me that she had the best husband in the world that they designed going to housekeeping in the spring and that they would be glad to have me make them a visit in July eighteen sixty six She sent me a pressing invitation You must come to me dear Lizzie she wrote We are now living at Rude s Hill I am dying to see you Ma Maggie Spot and Minnie sister Mary s child are with me and you only are needed to make the circle complete Come I will not take no for an answer I was anxious to go myself and when I received the urgent invitation I concluded to go at once and I wrote them to expect me in August On the tenth of August I left Washington for Virginia taking the train for Harper s Ferry The journey was attended with several disappointments We arrived at Harper s Ferry in the night and being asleep at the time I was carried to the station beyond where I had to wait and take the return train After returning to Harper s Ferry where I changed cars for Winchester I missed the train and was detained another day From Winchester the only way to reach Rude s Hill was by a line of stages We commenced the weary drive in the evening and rode all night A young gentleman in the stage said that he knew General Meem well and that he would tell me when we reached the place Relying upon him I went to sleep and it appears that the polite young gentleman followed my example About four o clock in the morning one of the passengers shook me and asked Aunty don t you want to get out at Rude s Hill I started up rubbing my eyes Yes Are we there More than there We have passed it Passed it Yes It is six miles back You should not sleep so soundly Aunty Why did you not tell me sooner I am so anxious to be there Fact is I forgot it Never mind Get out at this village and you can find conveyance back The village New Market was in a dilapidated condition everything about it spoke plainly of the sad destruction of war Getting out of the stage I went into a house by courtesy named a hotel where I obtained a cup of coffee Is there no conveyance from here to Rude s Hill I asked Yes the stage returns this evening answered the landlord This evening I want to go as soon as possible I should die if I had to stay all day in this lonely place A colored man behind the bar seeing how earnest I was came forward and informed me that he would drive me over to General Meem s place in an hour This was joyful news and I urged him to get ready to start as soon as possible While standing in the door of the hotel impatiently waiting for my colored friend to drive round with his little wagon a fat old lady waddled across the street and greeted me Ain t you Lizzie Yes I answered surprised that she should know my name I thought so They have been expecting you at Rude s Hill every day for two weeks and they do but little but talk about you missus Meem was in town yesterday and she said that she expected you this week certain They will be mighty glad to see you Why will you believe it they actually have kept a light burning in the front window every night for ten nights in order that you might not go by the place should you arrive in the night Thank you It is pleasant to know that I am expected I fell asleep in the stage and failed to see the light so am here instead of at Rude s Hill Just then the colored man drove up with the wagon and I got in with him and was soon on the road to General Meem s country seat As we drove up to Rude s Hill I observed a young man standing in the yard and believing it to be Spot whom I had not seen for eight years I beckoned to him With an exclamation of joy he came running towards me His movements attracted the attention of the family and in a minute the door was crowded with anxious inquiring faces It is Lizzie It is Lizzie was the happy cry from all parties In my eagerness to get to them I stepped from the wagon to the top of the stile intending to make a triumphant leap into the yard but alas my exultation was brief My hoop skirt caught on one of the posts and I fell sprawling into the yard Spot reached me first and picked me up only to put me into the arms of Miss Nannie her sister Maggie and missus Garland Could my friends of the North have seen that meeting they would never have doubted again that the mistress had any affection for her former slave I was carried to the house in triumph In the parlor I was divested of my things and placed in an easy chair before a bright fire The servants looked on in amazement Lizzie you are not changed a bit You look as young as when you left us in saint Louis years ago and missus Meem my foster child kissed me again Here Lizzie this is Minnie Minnie Pappan sister Mary s child Hasn t she grown and Miss Maggie led a tall queenly lady up to me Minnie Poor dear Miss Mary s child I can hardly believe it She was only a baby when I saw her last It makes me feel old to see how large she has grown Miss Minnie you are larger than your mother was your dear mother whom I held in my arms when she died and I brushed a tear from each of my eyes Have you had your breakfast Lizzie asked missus Garland No she has not exclaimed her children in a chorus I will get her breakfast for her and Nannie Maggie and Minnie started for the kitchen It is not necessary that all should go said missus Garland Here is the cook she will get breakfast ready But the three did not heed her All rushed to the kitchen and soon brought me a nice hot breakfast While I was eating the cook remarked I declar I nebber did see people carry on so Wonder if I should go off and stay two or three years if all ob you wud hug and kiss me so when I cum back After I had finished my breakfast General Meem came in He greeted me warmly Lizzie I am very glad to see you I feel that you are an old acquaintance I have heard so much of you through my wife her sister and her mother Welcome to Rude s Hill I was much pleased with his appearance and closer acquaintance proved him to be a model gentleman Rude s Hill during the war was once occupied by General Stonewall Jackson for his head quarters which gave more than ordinary interest to the place The location was delightful but the marks of war could be seen everywhere on the plantation General Meem was engaged in planting and he employed a large number of servants to assist him in his work About a mile from Rude s Hill was Mount Airy the elegant country seat of the General s brother The two families visited each other a great deal and as both entertained plenty of company the Autumn months passed pleasantly I was comfortably quartered at Rude s Hill and was shown every attention We sewed together talking of old times and every day either drove out or rode on horseback The room in which I sat in the daytime was the room that General Jackson always slept in and people came from far and near to look at it General Jackson was the ideal soldier of the Southern people and they worshipped him as an idol Every visitor would tear a splinter from the walls or windows of the room to take away and treasure as a priceless relic It did not take me long to discover that I was an object of great curiosity in the neighborhood My association with missus Lincoln and my attachment for the Garlands whose slave I had once been clothed me with romantic interest Colonel Harry Gilmore well known as a partisan leader in Maryland and Virginia during the war was a frequent visitor at Mount Airy and Rude s Hill One day I accompanied a party to a tournament and General Meem laughed pleasantly over the change that had come to me in so short a time Why Lizzie you are riding with Colonel Gilmore Just think of the change from Lincoln to Gilmore It sounds like a dream But then the change is an evidence of the peaceful feeling of this country a change I trust that augurs brighter days for us all I had many long talks with missus Garland in one of which I asked what had become of the only sister of my mother formerly maid to missus G s mother She is dead Lizzie Has been dead for some years A maid in the old time meant something different from what we understand by a maid at the present time Your aunt used to scrub the floor and milk a cow now and then as well as attend to the orders of my mother My mother was severe with her slaves in some respects but then her heart was full of kindness She had your aunt punished one day and not liking her sorrowful look she made two extravagant promises in order to effect a reconciliation both of which were accepted On condition that her maid would look cheerful and be good and friendly with her the mistress told her she might go to church the following Sunday and that she would give her a silk dress to wear on the occasion Now my mother had but one silk dress in the world silk not being so plenty in those days as it is now and yet she gave this dress to her maid to make friends with her Two weeks afterward mother was sent for to spend the day at a neighbor s house and on inspecting her wardrobe discovered that she had no dress fit to wear in company She had but one alternative and that was to appeal to the generosity of your aunt Charlotte Charlotte was summoned and enlightened in regard to the situation the maid proffered to loan the silk dress to her mistress for the occasion and the mistress was only too glad to accept She made her appearance at the social gathering duly arrayed in the silk that her maid had worn to church on the preceding Sunday We laughed over the incident when missus Garland said Lizzie during the entire war I used to think of you every day and have longed to see you so much When we heard you were with missus Lincoln the people used to tell me that I was foolish to think of ever seeing you again that your head must be completely turned But I knew your heart and could not believe that you would forget us I always argued that you would come and see us some day You judged me rightly Miss Ann e How could I forget you whom I had grown up with from infancy Northern people used to tell me that you would forget me but I told them I knew better and hoped on Ah love is too strong to be blown away like gossamer threads The chain is strong enough to bind life even to the world beyond the grave Do you always feel kindly towards me Lizzie To tell you candidly Miss Ann e I have but one unkind thought and that is that you did not give me the advantages of a good education What I have learned has been the study of after years You are right I did not look at things then as I do now I have always regretted that you were not educated when a girl But you have not suffered much on this score since you get along in the world better than we who enjoyed every educational advantage in childhood I remained five weeks at Rude s Hill and they were five of the most delightful weeks of my life I designed going direct to Richmond but the cholera was reported to be raging in that city so I took the train for Baltimore In Baltimore I stopped with missus Annette Jordan missus Garland had given me a letter to missus Douglas Gordon who introduced me to several Baltimore ladies among others missus Doctor Thomas who said to me with tears in her eyes Lizzie you deserve to meet with success for having been so kind to our friends in the days of the past I wish there were more women in the world like you I will always do what little I can to promote your welfare After remaining in Baltimore a few days I came to the conclusion that I could do better in Washington so I returned to the capital and reopened my business In the spring of eighteen sixty seven Miss Maggie Garland paid a visit to Baltimore Before leaving Virginia she said to some of her friends in Lynchburg that she designed going by Washington to see Lizzie Her friends ridiculed the idea but she persisted I love Lizzie next to mother She has been a mother to us all Half the pleasure of my visit is that I will be able to see her She wrote me a letter saying that she designed visiting me asking if it would be agreeable I replied Yes come by all means I shall be so glad to see you She came and stayed at my rooms and expressed surprise to find me so comfortably fixed I can not do better than conclude this chapter with two letters from my dear young friends the first from missus General Meem and the second from Miss Maggie Garland These letters show the goodness of their hearts and the frankness of their natures I trust that they will not object to the publicity that I give them RUDE S HILL Sept fourteen eighteen sixty seven MY DEAR LIZZIE I am nearly ashamed of myself for neglecting to acknowledge the receipt of your letter and the very acceptable box of patterns some weeks ago but you will pardon my remissness I know for you can imagine what a busy time I ve had all summer with a house full of company most of the time and with very inefficient servants and in some departments none at all so I have had to be at times dining room servant house maid and the last and most difficult dairy maid But I have turned that department over to our gardener who though as green at the business as myself seems willing to learn and has been doing the milking all summer These are a few of the reasons why I have not written to you before for I hope you will always believe that you occupy a large place in my memory and affection whether I write to you or not and such a poor correspondent as yourself ought not to complain Mother Mag Uncle John and Spot are still with us the former will pass the winter with me but the others all talk of leaving before long The approach of winter always scatters our guests and we have to spend the long dreary winters alone But we are to have the railroad to Mt Jackson by Christmas perhaps sooner and then if we can raise the wind we can spend a portion of the winter in the city and I hope you will find time to come up and spend the day with me as we will be near neighbors I so seldom indulge in the pleasant task of writing letters that I scarcely know what will interest my correspondent but I flatter myself that you will be glad to hear anything and everything about us all so I ll begin with the children Hugh has improved a great deal and is acknowledged to be the smartest child and the finest looking in the State he talks as plainly as I do and just as understandingly as a child of ten years old his nurse often says we need not set our hearts on that child he is too smart ever to be raised but I trust his badness will save him for he is terribly spoilt as such interesting children are bound to be Miss Eliza no longer called Jane is getting to be a little star girl as her Papa calls her she is just learning to walk and says a good many words quite plainly You would never take her for the same little cry baby of last summer and she is a little beauty too as white as the driven snow with the most beautiful blue eyes and long dark lashes you ever saw She will set somebody crazy if she grows up to be as lovely as she now promises to be My dear good husband has been like myself run to death this summer but it agrees with him and I never saw him looking better He has fallen off a little which is a great improvement I think He often speaks of you and wonders if you were sufficiently pleased with your visit last summer to repeat it I hope so for we will always be glad to welcome you to Rude s Hill whenever you have time to come provided of course you have the wish also Spot expects to hang out his shingle in saint Louis next winter His health is greatly improved though he is still very thin and very very much like dear father Mag has promised to teach a little cousin of ours who lives in Nelson County until February and will leave here in two weeks to commence her labors I hate to see her leave but she is bent on it and our winters are so unattractive that I do not like to insist on her shutting herself up all winter with three old people She will have very pleasant society at Cousin Buller s and will perhaps spend the rest of the winter with Aunt Pris if Uncle Armistead remains in Binghampton New York as he talks of doing Do write to me before you get too busy with your fall and winter work I am so anxious to hear all your plans and about your stay in New York By the by I will have to direct this to Washington as I do not know your New York address I suppose your friends will forward it If you are going to remain any length of time in New York send me your address and I will write again I have somehow made out a long letter though there is not much in it and I hope you will do the same before long All send love Yours affectionately N R G MEEM My pen and ink are both so wretched that I fear you will find some difficulty in making out this scratch but put on your specks and what you can t read just guess at I enclose a very poor likeness of Hugh taken last spring don t show it to anybody for I assure you there is scarcely the faintest resemblance to him now in it N R G M I give only a few extracts from the pleasant letter from Miss Maggie Garland The reader will observe that she signs herself Your child Mag an expression of love warmly appreciated by me SEDDES Dec seventeen eighteen sixty seven So many months have passed my dear Lizzie since I was cheered by a sight of your welcome handwriting that I must find out what is the matter and see if I can t persuade you to write me a few lines Whatever comes weal or woe you know I shall always love you and I have no idea of letting you forget me so just make up your mind to write me a nice long letter and tell me what you are doing with yourself this cold weather I am buried in the wilds of Amherst and the cold chilling blasts of December come whistling around and tell us plainly that the reign of the snow king has begun in good earnest Since October I have been teaching for my cousin mister Claiborne and although I am very happy and every one is so kind to me I shall not be sorry when the day comes when I shall shut up school books forever None of Miss Ann e s children were cut out for school marms were they Yiddie I am sure I was only made to ride in my carriage and play on the piano Don t you think so You must write me where you are so I can stop and see you on my way North for you know dear Lizzie no one can take your place in my heart I expect to spend the Christmas holidays in Lynchburg It will be very gay there and I will be glad enough to take a good dance This is a short letter to send you after such a long silence but tis too cold to write Let me hear from you very soon Your child MAG Please write for I long to hear from you CHAPTER XV THE SECRET HISTORY OF missus LINCOLN S WARDROBE IN NEW YORK In March eighteen sixty seven missus Lincoln wrote to me from Chicago that as her income was insufficient to meet her expenses she would be obliged to give up her house in the city and return to boarding She said that she had struggled long enough to keep up appearances and that the mask must be thrown aside I have not the means she wrote to meet the expenses of even a first class boarding house and must sell out and secure cheap rooms at some place in the country It will not be startling news to you my dear Lizzie to learn that I must sell a portion of my wardrobe to add to my resources so as to enable me to live decently for you remember what I told you in Washington as well as what you understood before you left me here in Chicago I cannot live on seventeen hundred dollars a year and as I have many costly things which I shall never wear I might as well turn them into money and thus add to my income and make my circumstances easier It is humiliating to be placed in such a position but as I am in the position I must extricate myself as best I can Now Lizzie I want to ask a favor of you It is imperative that I should do something for my relief and I want you to meet me in New York between the thirtieth of August and the fifth of September next to assist me in disposing of a portion of my wardrobe I knew that missus Lincoln s income was small and also knew that she had many valuable dresses which could be of no value to her packed away in boxes and trunks I was confident that she would never wear the dresses again and thought that since her need was urgent it would be well enough to dispose of them quietly and believed that New York was the best place to transact a delicate business of the kind She was the wife of Abraham Lincoln the man who had done so much for my race and I could refuse to do nothing for her calculated to advance her interests I consented to render missus Lincoln all the assistance in my power and many letters passed between us in regard to the best way to proceed It was finally arranged that I should meet her in New York about the middle of September While thinking over this question I remembered an incident of the White House When we were packing up to leave Washington for Chicago she said to me one morning Lizzie I may see the day when I shall be obliged to sell a portion of my wardrobe If Congress does not do something for me then my dresses some day may have to go to bring food into my mouth and the mouths of my children I also remembered of missus L having said to me at different times in the years of eighteen sixty three and four that her expensive dresses might prove of great assistance to her some day In what way missus Lincoln I do not understand I ejaculated the first time she made the remark to me Very simple to understand mister Lincoln is so generous that he will not save anything from his salary and I expect that we will leave the White House poorer than when we came into it and should such be the case I will have no further need for an expensive wardrobe and it will be policy to sell it off I thought at the time that missus Lincoln was borrowing trouble from the future and little dreamed that the event which she so dimly foreshadowed would ever come to pass I closed my business about the tenth of September and made every arrangement to leave Washington on the mission proposed On the fifteenth of September I received a letter from missus Lincoln postmarked Chicago saying that she should leave the city so as to reach New York on the night of the seventeenth and directing me to precede her to the metropolis and secure rooms for her at the saint Denis Hotel in the name of missus Clarke as her visit was to be incog The contents of the letter were startling to me I had never heard of the saint Denis and therefore presumed that it could not be a first class house And I could not understand why missus Lincoln should travel without protection under an assumed name I knew that it would be impossible for me to engage rooms at a strange hotel for a person whom the proprietors knew nothing about I could not write to missus Lincoln since she would be on the road to New York before a letter could possibly reach Chicago I could not telegraph her for the business was of too delicate a character to be trusted to the wires that would whisper the secret to every curious operator along the line In my embarrassment I caught at a slender thread of hope and tried to derive consolation from it I knew missus Lincoln to be indecisive about some things and I hoped that she might change her mind in regard to the strange programme proposed and at the last moment despatch me to this effect The sixteenth and then the seventeenth of September passed and no despatch reached me so on the eighteenth I made all haste to take the train for New York After an anxious ride I reached the city in the evening and when I stood alone in the streets of the great metropolis my heart sank within me I was in an embarrassing situation and scarcely knew how to act I did not know where the saint Denis Hotel was and was not certain that I should find missus Lincoln there after I should go to it I walked up to Broadway and got into a stage going up town with the intention of keeping a close look out for the hotel in question A kind looking gentleman occupied the seat next to me and I ventured to inquire of him If you please sir can you tell me where the saint Denis Hotel is Yes we ride past it in the stage I will point it out to you when we come to it Thank you sir The stage rattled up the street and after a while the gentleman looked out of the window and said This is the saint Denis Do you wish to get out here Thank you Yes sir He pulled the strap and the next minute I was standing on the pavement I pulled a bell at the ladies entrance to the hotel and a boy coming to the door I asked Is a lady by the name of missus Clarke stopping here She came last night I believe I do not know I will ask at the office and I was left alone The boy came back and said Yes missus Clarke is here Do you want to see her Yes Well just walk round there She is down here now I did not know where round there exactly was but I concluded to go forward I stopped however thinking that the lady might be in the parlor with company and pulling out a card asked the boy to take it to her She heard me talking and came into the hall to see herself My dear Lizzie I am so glad to see you she exclaimed coming forward and giving me her hand I have just received your note I had written her that I should join her on the eighteenth and have been trying to get a room for you Your note has been here all day but it was never delivered until to night Come in here until I find out about your room and she led me into the office The clerk like all modern hotel clerks was exquisitely arrayed highly perfumed and too self important to be obliging or even courteous This is the woman I told you about I want a good room for her missus Lincoln said to the clerk We have no room for her madam was the pointed rejoinder But she must have a room She is a friend of mine and I want a room for her adjoining mine We have no room for her on your floor That is strange sir I tell you that she is a friend of mine and I am sure you could not give a room to a more worthy person Friend of yours or not I tell you we have no room for her on your floor I can find a place for her on the fifth floor That sir I presume will be a vast improvement on my room Well if she goes to the fifth floor I shall go too sir What is good enough for her is good enough for me Very well madam Shall I give you adjoining rooms and send your baggage up Yes and have it done in a hurry Let the boy show us up Come Elizabeth and missus L turned from the clerk with a haughty glance and we commenced climbing the stairs I thought we should never reach the top and when we did reach the fifth story what accommodations Little three cornered rooms scantily furnished I never expected to see the widow of President Lincoln in such dingy humble quarters How provoking missus Lincoln exclaimed sitting down on a chair when we had reached the top and panting from the effects of the climbing I declare I never saw such unaccommodating people Just to think of them sticking us away up here in the attic I will give them a regular going over in the morning But you forget They do not know you missus Lincoln would be treated differently from missus Clarke True I do forget Well I suppose I shall have to put up with the annoyances Why did you not come to me yesterday Lizzie I was almost crazy when I reached here last night and found you had not arrived I sat down and wrote you a note I felt so badly imploring you to come to me immediately This note was afterwards sent to me from Washington It reads as follows saint DENIS HOTEL BROADWAY N Y Wednesday Sept seventeenth MY DEAR LIZZIE I arrived here last evening in utter despair at not finding you I am frightened to death being here alone Come I pray you by next train Inquire for missus CLARKE Room ninety four fifth or sixth Story House so crowded could not get another spot I wrote you especially to meet me here last evening it makes me wild to think of being here alone Come by next train without fail Your friend missus LINCOLN I am booked missus Clarke inquire for no other person Come come come I will pay your expenses when you arrive here I shall not leave here or change my room until you come Your friend M L Do not leave this house without seeing me Come I transcribe the letter literally In reply to missus Lincoln s last question I explained what has already been explained to the reader that I was in hope she would change her mind and knew that it would be impossible to secure the rooms requested for a person unknown to the proprietors or attaches of the hotel The explanation seemed to satisfy her Turning to me suddenly she exclaimed You have not had your dinner Lizzie and must be hungry I nearly forgot about it in the joy of seeing you You must go down to the table right away She pulled the bell rope and a servant appearing she ordered him to give me my dinner I followed him down stairs and he led me into the dining hall and seated me at a table in one corner of the room I was giving my order when the steward came forward and gruffly said You are in the wrong room I was brought here by the waiter I replied It makes no difference I will find you another place where you can eat your dinner I got up from the table and followed him and when outside of the door said to him It is very strange that you should permit me to be seated at the table in the dining room only for the sake of ordering me to leave it the next moment Are you not missus Clarke s servant was his abrupt question I am with missus Clarke It is all the same servants are not allowed to eat in the large dining room Here this way you must take your dinner in the servants hall Hungry and humiliated as I was I was willing to follow to any place to get my dinner for I had been riding all day and had not tasted a mouthful since early morning On reaching the servants hall we found the door of the room locked The waiter left me standing in the passage while he went to inform the clerk of the fact In a few minutes the obsequious clerk came blustering down the hall Did you come out of the street or from missus Clarke s room From missus Clarke s room I meekly answered My gentle words seemed to quiet him and then he explained It is after the regular hour for dinner The room is locked up and Annie has gone out with the key My pride would not let me stand longer in the hall Very well I remarked as I began climbing the stairs I will tell missus Clarke that I cannot get any dinner He looked after me with a scowl on his face You need not put on airs I understand the whole thing I said nothing but continued to climb the stairs thinking to myself Well if you understand the whole thing it is strange that you should put the widow of ex President Abraham Lincoln in a three cornered room in the attic of this miserable hotel When I reached missus Lincoln s rooms tears of humiliation and vexation were in my eyes What is the matter Lizzie she asked I cannot get any dinner Cannot get any dinner What do you mean I then told her of all that had transpired below The insolent overbearing people she fiercely exclaimed Never mind Lizzie you shall have your dinner Put on your bonnet and shawl What for What for Why we will go out of the hotel and get you something to eat where they know how to behave decently and missus Lincoln already was tying the strings of her bonnet before the glass Her impulsiveness alarmed me Surely missus Lincoln you do not intend to go out on the street to night Yes I do Do you suppose I am going to have you starve when we can find something to eat on every corner But you forget You are here as missus Clarke and not as missus Lincoln You came alone and the people already suspect that everything is not right If you go outside of the hotel to night they will accept the fact as evidence against you Nonsense what do you suppose I care for what these low bred people think Put on your things No missus Lincoln I shall not go outside of the hotel to night for I realize your situation if you do not missus Lincoln has no reason to care what these people may say about her as missus Lincoln but she should be prudent and give them no opportunity to say anything about her as missus Clarke It was with difficulty I could convince her that she should act with caution She was so frank and impulsive that she never once thought that her actions might be misconstrued It did not occur to her that she might order dinner to be served in my room so I went to bed without a mouthful to eat The next morning missus Lincoln knocked at my door before six o clock Come Elizabeth get up I know you must be hungry Dress yourself quickly and we will go out and get some breakfast I was unable to sleep last night for thinking of you being forced to go to bed without anything to eat I dressed myself as quickly as I could and together we went out and took breakfast at a restaurant on Broadway some place between six hundred nine and the saint Denis Hotel I do not give the number as I prefer leaving it to conjecture Of one thing I am certain the proprietor of the restaurant little dreamed who one of his guests was that morning After breakfast we walked up Broadway and entering Union Square Park took a seat on one of the benches under the trees watched the children at play and talked over the situation missus Lincoln told me Lizzie yesterday morning I called for the Herald at the breakfast table and on looking over the list of diamond brokers advertised I selected the firm of W H Brady company six hundred nine Broadway After breakfast I walked down to the house and tried to sell them a lot of jewelry I gave my name as missus Clarke I first saw mister Judd a member of the firm a very pleasant gentleman We were unable to agree about the price He went back into the office where a stout gentleman was seated at the desk but I could not hear what he said I know now what was said and so shall the reader in parentheses mister Brady has since told me that he remarked to mister Judd that the woman must be crazy to ask such outrageous prices and to get rid of her as soon as possible Soon after mister Judd came back to the counter another gentleman mister Keyes as I have since learned a silent partner in the house entered the store He came to the counter and in looking over my jewelry discovered my name inside of one of the rings I had forgotten the ring and when I saw him looking at the name so earnestly I snatched the bauble from him and put it into my pocket I hastily gathered up my jewelry and started out They asked for my address and I left my card missus Clarke at the saint Denis Hotel They are to call to see me this forenoon when I shall enter into negotiations with them Scarcely had we returned to the hotel when mister Keyes called and missus Clarke disclosed to him that she was missus Lincoln He was much elated to find his surmise correct missus L exhibited to him a large number of shawls dresses and fine laces and told him that she was compelled to sell them in order to live He was an earnest Republican was much affected by her story and denounced the ingratitude of the government in the severest terms She complained to him of the treatment she had received at the saint Denis and he advised her to move to another hotel forthwith She readily consented and as she wanted to be in an out of the way place where she would not be recognized by any of her old friends he recommended the Earle Hotel in Canal street On the way down to the hotel that morning she acceded to a suggestion made by me and supported by mister Keyes that she confide in the landlord and give him her name without registering so as to ensure the proper respect Unfortunately the Earle Hotel was full and we had to select another place We drove to the Union Place Hotel where we secured rooms for missus Clarke missus Lincoln changing her mind deeming it would not be prudent to disclose her real name to any one After we had become settled in our new quarters Messrs Keyes and Brady called frequently on missus Lincoln and held long conferences with her They advised her to pursue the course she did and were sanguine of success missus Lincoln was very anxious to dispose of her things and return to Chicago as quickly and quietly as possible but they presented the case in a different light and I regret to say she was guided by their counsel Pooh said mister Brady place your affairs in our hands and we will raise you at least one hundred thousand dollars in a few weeks The people will not permit the widow of Abraham Lincoln to suffer they will come to her rescue when they know she is in want The argument seemed plausible and missus Lincoln quietly acceded to the proposals of Keyes and Brady We remained quietly at the Union Place Hotel for a few days On Sunday missus Lincoln accepted the use of a private carriage and accompanied by me she drove out to Central Park We did not enjoy the ride much as the carriage was a close one and we could not throw open the window for fear of being recognized by some one of the many thousands in the Park missus Lincoln wore a heavy veil so as to more effectually conceal her face We came near being run into and we had a spasm of alarm for an accident would have exposed us to public gaze and of course the masquerade would have been at an end On Tuesday I hunted up a number of dealers in secondhand clothing and had them call at the hotel by appointment missus Lincoln soon discovered that they were hard people to drive a bargain with so on Thursday we got into a close carriage taking a bundle of dresses and shawls with us and drove to a number of stores on Seventh Avenue where an attempt was made to dispose of a portion of the wardrobe The dealers wanted the goods for little or nothing and we found it a hard matter to drive a bargain with them missus Lincoln met the dealers squarely but all of her tact and shrewdness failed to accomplish much I do not care to dwell upon this portion of my story Let it answer to say that we returned to the hotel more disgusted than ever with the business in which we were engaged There was much curiosity at the hotel in relation to us as our movements were watched and we were regarded with suspicion Our trunks in the main hall below were examined daily and curiosity was more keenly excited when the argus eyed reporters for the press traced missus Lincoln s name on the cover of one of her trunks The letters had been rubbed out but the faint outlines remained and these outlines only served to stimulate curiosity Messrs Keyes and Brady called often and they made missus Lincoln believe that if she would write certain letters for them to show to prominent politicians they could raise a large sum of money for her They argued that the Republican party would never permit it to be said that the wife of Abraham Lincoln was in want that the leaders of the party would make heavy advances rather than have it published to the world that missus Lincoln s poverty compelled her to sell her wardrobe missus L s wants were urgent as she had to borrow six hundred dollars from Keyes and Brady and she was willing to adopt any scheme which promised to place a good bank account to her credit At different times in her room at the Union Place Hotel she wrote the following letters CHICAGO Sept eighteen eighteen sixty seven mister BRADY Commission Broker No six hundred nine Broadway New York I have this day sent to you personal property which I am compelled to part with and which you will find of considerable value The articles consist of four camels hair shawls one lace dress and shawl a parasol cover a diamond ring two dress patterns some furs et cetera Please have them appraised and confer by letter with me Very respectfully missus LINCOLN CHICAGO mister BRADY No six hundred nine Broadway N Y City DEAR SIR The articles I am sending you to dispose of were gifts of dear friends which only urgent necessity compels me to part with and I am especially anxious that they shall not be sacrificed The circumstances are peculiar and painfully embarrassing therefore I hope you will endeavor to realize as much as possible for them Hoping to hear from you I remain very respectfully missus A LINCOLN Sept twenty five eighteen sixty seven W H BRADY esquire My great great sorrow and loss have made me painfully sensitive but as my feelings and pecuniary comforts were never regarded or even recognized in the midst of my overwhelming bereavement now that I am pressed in a most startling manner for means of subsistence I do not know why I should shrink from an opportunity of improving my trying position Being assured that all you do will be appropriately executed and in a manner that will not startle me very greatly and excite as little comment as possible again I shall leave all in your hands I am passing through a very painful ordeal which the country in remembrance of my noble and devoted husband should have spared me I remain with great respect very truly missus LINCOLN P S As you mention that my goods have been valued at over twenty four thousand dollars I will be willing to make a reduction of eight thousand dollars and relinquish them for sixteen thousand dollars If this is not accomplished I will continue to sell and advertise largely until every article is sold I must have means to live at least in a medium comfortable state M L The letters are dated Chicago and addressed to mister Brady though every one of them was written in New York for when missus L left the West for the East she had settled upon no definite plan of action mister Brady proposed to show the letters to certain politicians and ask for money on a threat to publish them if his demands as missus Lincoln s agent were not complied with When writing the letters I stood at missus Lincoln s elbow and suggested that they be couched in the mildest language possible Never mind Lizzie she said anything to raise the wind One might as well be killed for a sheep as a lamb This latter expression was a favorite one of hers she meaning by it that if one must be punished for an act such as theft for instance that the punishment would be no more severe if a sheep were taken instead of a lamb mister Brady exhibited the letters quite freely but the parties to whom they were shown refused to make any advances Meanwhile our stay at the Union Place Hotel excited so much curiosity that a sudden movement was rendered expedient to avoid discovery We sent the large trunks to six hundred nine Broadway packed the smaller ones paid our bills at the hotel and one morning hastily departed for the country where we remained three days The movement was successful The keen eyed reporters for the daily papers were thrown off the scent and when we returned to the city we took rooms at the Brandreth House where missus Lincoln registered as missus Morris I had desired her to go to the Metropolitan Hotel and confide in the proprietors as the Messrs Leland had always been very kind to her treating her with distinguished courtesy whenever she was their guest but this she refused to do Several days passed and Messrs Brady and Keyes were forced to acknowledge that their scheme was a failure The letters had been shown to various parties but every one declined to act Aside from a few dresses sold at small prices to secondhand dealers missus Lincoln s wardrobe was still in her possession Her visit to New York had proved disastrous and she was goaded into more desperate measures Money she must have and to obtain it she proposed to play a bolder game She gave mister Brady permission to place her wardrobe on exhibition for sale and authorized him to publish the letters in the World After coming to this determination she packed her trunks to return to Chicago I accompanied her to the depot and told her good by on the very morning that the letters appeared in the World missus Lincoln wrote me the incidents of the journey and the letter describes the story more graphically than I could hope to do I suppress many passages as they are of too confidential a nature to be given to the public CHICAGO October sixth My DEAR LIZZIE My ink is like myself and my spirits failing so I write you to day with a pencil I had a solitary ride to this place as you may imagine varied by one or two amusing incidents I found after you left me I could not continue in the car in which you left me owing to every seat s berth being engaged so being simple Mrs Clarke I had to eat humble pie in a car less commodious My thoughts were too much with my dry goods and interests at six hundred nine Broadway to care much for my surroundings as uncomfortable as they were In front of me sat a middle aged gray haired respectable looking gentleman who for the whole morning had the page of the World before him which contained my letters and business concerns About four hours before arriving at Chicago a consequential looking man of formidable size seated himself by him and it appears they were entirely unknown to each other The well fed looking individual opened the conversation with the man who had read the World so attentively and the conversation soon grew warm and earnest The war and its devastation engaged them The bluffy individual doubtless a Republican who had pocketed his many thousands spoke of the widows of the land made so by the war My reading man remarked to him Are you aware that missus Lincoln is in indigent circumstances and has to sell her clothing and jewelry to gain means to make life more endurable The well conditioned man replied I do not blame her for selling her clothing if she wishes it I suppose when sold she will convert the proceeds into five twenties to enable her to have means to be buried The World man turned towards him with a searching glance and replied with the haughtiest manner That woman is not dead yet The discomfited individual looked down never spoke another word and in half an hour left his seat and did not return I give you word for word as the conversation occurred May it be found through the execution of my friends Messrs Brady and Keyes that that woman is not yet dead and being alive she speaketh and gaineth valuable hearers Such is life Those who have been injured how gladly the injurer would consign them to mother earth and forgetfulness Hoping I should not be recognized at Fort Wayne I thought I would get out at dinner for a cup of tea will show you what a creature of fate I am as miserable as it sometimes is I went into the dining room alone and was ushered up to the table where at its head sat a very elegant looking gentleman at his side a middle aged lady My black veil was doubled over my face I had taken my seat next to him he at the head of the table I at his left hand I immediately felt a pair of eyes was gazing at me I looked him full in the face and the glance was earnestly returned I sipped my water and said mister S is this indeed you His face was as pale as the table cloth We entered into conversation when I asked him how long since he had left Chicago He replied Two weeks since He said How strange you should be on the train and I not know it As soon as I could escape from the table I did so by saying I must secure a cup of tea for a lady friend with me who has a head ache I had scarcely returned to the car when he entered it with a cup of tea borne by his own aristocratic hands I was a good deal annoyed by seeing him and he was so agitated that he spilled half of the cup over my elegantly gloved hands He looked very sad and I fancied six hundred nine Broadway occupied his thoughts I apologized for the absent lady who wished the cup by saying that in my absence she had slipped out for it His heart was in his eyes notwithstanding my veiled face Pity for me I fear has something to do with all this I never saw his manner so gentle and sad This was nearly evening and I did not see him again as he returned to the lady who was his sister in law from the East What evil spirit possessed me to go out and get that cup of tea When he left me woman like I tossed the cup of tea out of the window and tucked my head down and shed bitter tears At the depot my darling little Taddie was waiting for me and his voice never sounded so sweet My dear Lizzie do visit mister Brady each morning at nine o clock and urge them all you can I see by the papers Stewart has returned To morrow I will send the invoice of goods which please to not give up How much I miss you tongue cannot tell Forget my fright and nervousness of the evening before Of course you were as innocent as a child in all you did I consider you my best living friend and I am struggling to be enabled some day to repay you Write me often as you promised Always truly yours M L It is not necessary for me to dwell upon the public history of missus Lincoln s unfortunate venture The question has been discussed in all the newspapers of the land and these discussions are so recent that it would be useless to introduce them in these pages even if I had an inclination to do so The following from the New York Evening Express briefly tells the story The attraction for ladies and the curious and speculative of the other sex in this city just now is the grand exposition of Lincoln dresses at the office of mister Brady on Broadway a few doors south of Houston street The publicity given to the articles on exhibition and for sale has excited the public curiosity and hundreds of people principally women with considerable leisure moments at disposal daily throng the rooms of mister Brady and give himself and his shop woman more to do than either bargained for when a lady with face concealed with a veil called and arranged for the sale of the superabundant clothing of a distinguished and titled but nameless lady Twenty five dresses folded or tossed about by frequent examinations lie exposed upon a closed piano and upon a lounge shawls rich and rare are displayed upon the backs of chairs but the more exacting obtain a better view and closer inspection by the lady attendant throwing them occasionally upon her shoulders just to oblige so that their appearance on promenade might be seen and admired Furs laces and jewelry are in a glass case but the four thousand dollars in gold point outfit is kept in a paste board box and only shown on special request The feeling of the majority of visitors is adverse to the course missus Lincoln has thought proper to pursue and the criticisms are as severe as the cavillings are persistent at the quality of some of the dresses These latter are labelled at missus Lincoln s own estimate and prices range from twenty five dollars to seventy five dollars about fifty per cent less than cost Some of them if not worn long have been worn much they are jagged under the arms and at the bottom of the skirt stains are on the lining and other objections present themselves to those who oscillate between the dresses and dollars notwithstanding they have been worn by Madam Lincoln as a lady who looked from behind a pair of gold spectacles remarked Other dresses however have scarcely been worn one perhaps while missus Lincoln sat for her picture and from one the basting threads had not yet been removed The general testimony is that the wearing apparel is high priced and some of the examiners say that the cost figures must have been put on by the dressmakers or if such was not the case that gold was two hundred fifty when they were purchased and is now but one hundred forty so that a dress for which one hundred fifty dollars was paid at the rate of high figures cannot be called cheap at half that sum after it has been worn considerable and perhaps passed out of fashion The peculiarity of the dresses is that the most of them are cut low necked a taste which some ladies attribute to missus Lincoln s appreciation of her own bust On Saturday last an offer was made for all the dresses The figure named was less than the aggregate estimate placed on them mister Brady however having no discretionary power he declined to close the bargain but notified missus Lincoln by mail Of course as yet no reply has been received missus L desires that the auction should be deferred till the thirty first of the present month and efforts made to dispose of the articles at private sale up to that time A missus C called on mister Brady this morning and examined minutely each shawl Before leaving the lady said that at the time when there was a hesitancy about the President issuing the Emancipation Proclamation she sent to missus Lincoln an ashes of rose shawl which was manufactured in China forwarded to France and thence to missus C in New York The shawl the lady remarked was a very handsome one and should it come into the hands of mister Brady to be sold would like to be made aware of the fact so as to obtain possession again mister Brady promised to acquaint the ashes of rose donor if the prized article should be among the two trunks of goods now on the way from Chicago So many erroneous reports were circulated that I made a correct statement to one of the editors of the New York Evening News The article based upon the memoranda furnished by me appeared in the News of Oct twelve eighteen sixty seven I reproduce a portion of it in this connection missus Lincoln feels sorely aggrieved at many of the harsh criticisms that have been passed upon her for travelling incognito She claims that she adopted this course from motives of delicacy desiring to avoid publicity While here she spoke to but two former acquaintances and these two gentlemen whom she met on Broadway Hundreds passed her who had courted her good graces when she reigned supreme at the White House but there was no recognition It was not because she had changed much in personal appearance but was merely owing to the heavy crape veil that hid her features from view She seeks to defend her course while in this city and with much force too Adverting to the fact that the Empress of France frequently disposes of her cast off wardrobe and publicly too without being subjected to any unkind remarks regarding its propriety she claims the same immunity here as is accorded in Paris to Eugenie As regards her obscurity while in this city she says that foreigners of note and position frequently come to our stores and under assumed names travel from point to point throughout our vast domain to avoid recognition and the inconveniences resulting from being known though it even be in the form of honors For herself she regards quiet preferable to ostentatious show which would have cost her much indirectly if not directly and this she felt herself unable to bear according to the measure of her present state of finances In a recent letter to her bosom friend missus Elizabeth Keckley missus Lincoln pathetically remarks Elizabeth if evil come from this pray for my deliverance as I did it for the best This referred to her action in placing her personal effects before the public for sale and to the harsh remarks that have been made thereon by some whom she had formerly regarded as her friends As to the articles which belonged to mister Lincoln they can all be accounted for in a manner satisfactory even to an over critical public During the time mister Lincoln was in office he was the recipient of several canes After his death one was given to the honorable Charles Sumner another to Fred Douglass another to the reverend H H Garnet of this city and another to mister Wm Slade the present steward of the White House who in mister Lincoln s lifetime was his messenger This gentleman also received some of mister Lincoln s apparel among which was his heavy gray shawl Several other of the messengers employed about the White House came in for a share of the deceased President s effects The shepherd plaid shawl which mister Lincoln wore during the milder weather and which was rendered somewhat memorable as forming part of his famous disguise together with the Scotch cap when he wended his way secretly to the Capitol to be inaugurated as President was given to doctor Abbot of Canada who had been one of his warmest friends During the war this gentleman as a surgeon in the United States army was in Washington in charge of a hospital and thus became acquainted with the head of the nation His watch his penknife his gold pencil and his glasses are now in possession of his son Robert Nearly all else than these few things have passed out of the family as missus Lincoln did not wish to retain them But all were freely given away and not an article was parted with for money The reverend doctor Gurley of Washington was the spiritual adviser of the President and his family They attended his church When little Willie died he officiated at the funeral He was a most intimate friend of the family and when mister Lincoln lay upon his death bed mister Gurley was by his side He as his clergyman performed the funeral rites upon the body of the deceased President when it lay cold in death at the City of Washington He received the hat worn last by mister Lincoln as we have before stated and it is still retained by him The dress that was worn by missus Lincoln on the night of the assassination was presented to missus Wm Slade It is a black silk with a little white stripe Most of the other articles that adorned missus Lincoln on that fatal night became the property of missus Keckley She has the most of them carefully stowed away and intends keeping them during her life as mementos of a mournful event The principal articles among these are the earrings the bonnet and the velvet cloak The writer of this saw the latter on Thursday It bears most palpable marks of the assassination being completely bespattered with blood that has dried upon its surface and which can never be removed A few words as regard the disposition and habits of missus Lincoln She is no longer the sprightly body she was when her very presence illumed the White House with gayety Now she is sad and sedate seeking seclusion and maintaining communication merely with her most intimate personal friends The most of her time she devotes to instructive reading within the walls of her boudoir Laying her book aside spasmodically she places her hand upon her forehead as if ruminating upon something momentous Then her hand wanders amid her heavy tresses while she ponders for but a few seconds then by a sudden start she approaches her writing stand seizes a pen and indites a few hasty lines to some trusty friend upon the troubles that weigh so heavily upon her Speedily it is sent to the post office but hardly has the mail departed from the city before she regrets her hasty letter and would give much to recall it But too late it is gone and probably the secrets it contains are not confidentially kept by the party to whom it was addressed and soon it furnishes inexhaustible material for gossip loving people As some citizens have expressed themselves desirous of aiding missus Lincoln a subscription book was opened at the office of her agent mister Brady No six hundred nine Broadway this morning There is no limitation as to the amount which may be given though there was a proposition that a dollar should be contributed by each person who came forward to inspect the goods Had each person who handled these articles given this sum a handsome amount would already have been realized The colored people are moving in this matter They intend to take up collections in their churches for the benefit of missus Lincoln They are enthusiastic and a trifle from every African in this city would in the aggregate swell into an immense sum which would be doubly acceptable to missus Lincoln It would satisfy her that the black people still have the memory of her deceased husband fresh in their minds The goods still remain exposed to sale but it is now announced that they will be sold at public auction on the thirtieth of this month unless they be disposed of before that at private sale It is stated in the article that the colored people are moving in this matter The colored people were surprised to hear of missus Lincoln s poverty and the news of her distress called forth strong sympathy from their warm generous hearts reverend H H Garnet of New York City and mister Frederick Douglass of Rochester N Y proposed to lecture in behalf of the widow of the lamented President and schemes were on foot to raise a large sum of money by contribution The colored people recognized Abraham Lincoln as their great friend and they were anxious to show their kind interest in the welfare of his family in some way more earnest and substantial than simple words I wrote missus Lincoln what we proposed to do and she promptly replied declining to receive aid from the colored people I showed her letter to mister Garnet and mister Douglass and the whole project was at once abandoned She afterwards consented to receive contributions from my people but as the services of Messrs Douglass Garnet and others had been refused when first offered they declined to take an active part in the scheme so nothing was ever done The following letters were written before missus Lincoln declined to receive aid from the colored people one hundred eighty three BLEECKER saint NEW YORK October sixteenth eighteen sixty seven J H BRADY esquire I have just received your favor together with the circulars I will do all that lies in my power but I fear that will not be as much as you anticipate I think however that a contribution from the colored people of New York will be worth something in a moral point of view and likely that will be the most that will be accomplished in the undertaking I am thoroughly with you in the work although but little may be done I am truly yours HENRY HIGHLAND GARNET P S I think it would be well if you would drop a line to mister Frederick Douglass at Rochester New York H H G ROCHESTER Oct eighteen eighteen sixty seven MY DEAR missus KECKLEY You judge me rightly I am willing to do what I can to place the widow of our martyr President in the affluent position which her relation to that good man and to the country entitles her to But I doubt the wisdom of getting up a series of lectures for that purpose that is just the last thing that should be done Still if the thing is done it should be done on a grand scale The best speakers in the country should be secured for the purpose You should not place me at the head nor at the foot of the list but sandwich me between for thus out of the way it would not give color to the idea I am to speak in Newark on Wednesday evening next and will endeavor to see you on the subject Of course if it would not be too much to ask I would gladly see missus Lincoln if this could be done in a quiet way without the reporters getting hold of it and using it in some way to the prejudice of that already much abused lady As I shall see you soon there is less reason to write you at length I am dear madam With high respect Very truly yours FREDERICK DOUGLASS POTTSVILLE Oct twenty nine eighteen sixty seven MY DEAR missus KECKLEY You know the drift of my views concerning the subscription for missus Lincoln Yet I wish to place them more distinctly before you so that if you have occasion to refer to me in connection with the matter you can do so with accuracy and certainty It is due missus Lincoln that she should be indemnified as far as money can do so for the loss of her beloved husband Honor gratitude and a manly sympathy all say yes to this I am willing to go farther than this and say that missus Lincoln herself should be the judge of the amount which shall be deemed sufficient believing that she would not transcend reasonable limits The obligation resting on the nation at large is great and increasing but especially does it become colored men to recognize that obligation It was the hand of Abraham Lincoln that broke the fetters of our enslaved people and let them out of the house of bondage When he was slain our great benefactor fell and left his wife and children to the care of those for whom he gave up all Shame on the man or woman who under such circumstances would grudge a few paltry dollars to smooth the pathway of such a widow All this and more I feel and believe But such is the condition of this question owing to party feeling and personal animosities now mixed up with it that we are compelled to consider these in the effort we are making to obtain subscriptions Now about the meeting in Cooper Institute I hold that that meeting should only be held in concert with other movements It is bad generalship to put into the field only a fraction of your army when you have no means to prevent their being cut to pieces It is gallant to go forth single handed but is it wise I want to see something more than the spiteful Herald behind me when I step forward in this cause at the Cooper Institute Let mister Brady out with his circulars with his list of commanding names let the Herald and Tribune give a united blast upon their bugles let the city be placarded and the doors of Cooper Institute be flung wide open and the people without regard to party come up to the discharge of this national duty Don t let the cause be made ridiculous by failure at the outset mister Garnet and I could bear any mortification of this kind but the cause could not And our cause must not be damaged by any such generalship which would place us in the van unsupported I shall be at home by Saturday please write me and let me know how matters are proceeding Show this letter to Messrs Brady and Garnet I am dear madam Very truly yours FREDERICK DOUGLASS ROCHESTER Oct thirty eighteen sixty seven MY DEAR missus KECKLEY It is just possible that I may not take New York in my route homeward In that case please write me directly at Rochester and let me know fully how the subscription business is proceeding The meeting here last night was a grand success I speak again this evening and perhaps at Reading tomorrow evening My kind regards to all who think of me at twenty one including missus Lawrence Very truly yours FREDK DOUGLASS ROCHESTER Nov ten eighteen sixty seven MY DEAR missus KECKLEY I very easily read your handwriting With practice you will not only write legibly but elegantly so no more apologies for bad writing Penmanship has always been one of my own deficiencies and I know how to sympathize with you I am just home and find your letter awaiting me You should have received an earlier answer but for this absence I am sorry it will be impossible for me to see you before I go to Washington I am leaving home this week for Ohio and shall go from Ohio to Washington I shall be in New York a day or two after my visit to Washington and will see you there Any public demonstration in which it will be desirable for me to take part ought to come off the last of this month or the first of next I thank you sincerely for the note containing a published letter of dear missus Lincoln both letters do credit to the excellent lady I prize her beautiful letter to me very highly It is the letter of a refined and spirited lady let the world say what it will of her I would write her a word of acknowledgment but for fear to burden her with correspondence I am glad that mister Garnet and yourself saw mister Greeley and that he takes the right view of the matter but we want more than right views and delay is death to the movement What you now want is action and cooperation If mister Brady does not for any reason find himself able to move the machinery somebody else should be found to take his place he made a good impression on me when I saw him but I have not seen the promised simultaneous movement of which we spoke when together This whole thing should be in the hands of some recognized solid man in New York No man would be better than mister Greeley no man in the State is more laughed at and yet no man is more respected and trusted a dollar placed in his hands would be as safe for the purpose as in a burglar proof safe and what is better still everybody believes this This testimonial must be more than a negro testimonial It is a great national duty mister Lincoln did everything for the black man but he did it not for the black man s sake but for the nation s sake His life was given for the nation but for being President mister Lincoln would have been alive and missus Lincoln would have been a wife and not a widow as now Do all you can dear missus Keckley nobody can do more than you in removing the mountains of prejudice towards that good lady and opening the way of success in the plan I am dear madam very truly yours FREDERICK DOUGLASS Many persons called at six hundred nine Broadway to examine missus Lincoln s wardrobe but as curiosity prompted each visit but few articles were sold Messrs Brady Keyes were not very energetic and as will be seen by the letters of missus Lincoln published in the Appendix that lady ultimately lost all confidence in them It was proposed to send circulars stating missus Lincoln s wants and appealing to the generosity of the people for aid broad cast over the country but the scheme failed Messrs Brady Keyes were unable to obtain the names of prominent men whom the people had confidence in for the circular to give character and responsibility to the movement so the whole thing was abandoned With the reverend mister Garnet I called on mister Greeley at the office of the Tribune in connection with this scheme mister Greeley received us kindly and listened patiently to our proposals then said I shall take pleasure in rendering you what assistance I can but the movement must be engineered by responsible parties Messrs Brady Keyes are not the men to be at the head of it Nobody knows who they are or what they are Place the matter in the hands of those that the people know and have some confidence in and then there will be a chance for success We thanked mister Greeley for his advice for we believed it to be good advice and bowed ourselves out of his room When Messrs Brady Keyes were informed of the result of our interview they became very much excited and denounced mister Greeley as an old fool This put an end to the circular movement The enterprise was nipped in the bud and with the bud withered missus Lincoln s last hope for success A portion of the wardrobe was then taken to Providence to be exhibited but without her consent mister Brady remarked that the exhibition would bring in money and as money must be raised this was the last resort He was of the impression that missus Lincoln would approve of any movement so it ended in success This at least is a charitable view to take of the subject Had the exhibition succeeded in Providence it is my opinion that the agents of Brady Keyes would now be travelling over the country exposing missus Lincoln s wardrobe to the view of the curious at so much per head As is well known the city authorities refused to allow the exhibition to take place in Providence therefore mister Brady returned to New York with the goods and the travelling show scheme like the circular scheme was abandoned Weeks lengthened into months and at missus Lincoln s urgent request I remained in New York to look after her interests When she left the city I engaged quiet lodgings in a private family where I remained about two months when I moved to fourteen Carroll Place and became one of the regular boarders of the house missus Lincoln s venture proved so disastrous that she was unable to reward me for my services and I was compelled to take in sewing to pay for my daily bread My New York expedition has made me richer in experience but poorer in purse During the entire winter I have worked early and late and practised the closest economy missus Lincoln s business demanded much of my time and it was a constant source of trouble to me When missus L left for the West I expected to be able to return to Washington in one week from the day but unforeseen difficulties arose and I have been detained in the city for several months As I am writing the concluding pages of this book I have succeeded in closing up missus Lincoln s imprudent business arrangement at six hundred nine Broadway The firm of Brady Keyes is dissolved and mister Keyes has adjusted the account The story is told in a few words On the fourth of March I received the following invoice from mister Keyes March four sixty eight Invoice of articles sent to missus A Lincoln one Trunk one Lace dress one do do flounced five Lace shawls three Camel hair shawls one Lace parasol cover one do handkerchief one Sable boa one White do one Set furs two Paisley shawls two Gold bracelets sixteen Dresses two Opera cloaks one Purple shawl one Feather cape twenty eight yds silk ARTICLES SOLD one Diamond ring three Small do one Set furs one Camel hair shawl one Red do two Dresses one Child s shawl one Lace Chantilly shawl The charges of the firm amounted to eight hundred dollars missus Lincoln sent me a check for this amount I handed this check to mister Keyes and he gave me the following receipt Received New York March four eighteen sixty eight of missus Abraham Lincoln eight hundred and twenty dollars by draft on American National Bank New York S C KEYES I packed the articles invoiced and expressed the trunks to missus Lincoln at Chicago I then demanded and received a receipt worded as follows Received New York March four eighteen sixty eight of missus Abraham Lincoln eight hundred and twenty dollars in full of all demands of every kind up to date S C KEYES This closed up the business and with it I close the imperfect story of my somewhat romantic life I have experienced many ups and downs but still am stout of heart The labor of a lifetime has brought me nothing in a pecuniary way I have worked hard but fortune fickle dame has not smiled upon me If poverty did not weigh me down as it does I would not now be toiling by day with my needle and writing by night in the plain little room on the fourth floor of No fourteen Carroll Place And yet I have learned to love the garret like room Here with missus Amelia Lancaster as my only companion I have spent many pleasant hours as well as sad ones and every chair looks like an old friend In memory I have travelled through the shadows and the sunshine of the past and the bare walls are associated with the visions that have come to me from the long ago As I love the children of memory so I love every article in this room for each has become a part of memory itself Though poor in worldly goods I am rich in friendships and friends are a recompense for all the woes of the darkest pages of life For sweet friendship s sake I can bear more burdens than I have borne The letters appended from missus Lincoln to myself throw a flood of light upon the history of the old clothes speculation in New York APPENDIX LETTERS FROM missus LINCOLN TO missus KECKLEY CHICAGO Sunday Morning Oct six MY DEAR LIZZIE I am writing this morning with a broken heart after a sleepless night of great mental suffering R came up last evening like a maniac and almost threatening his life looking like death because the letters of the World were published in yesterday s paper I could not refrain from weeping when I saw him so miserable But yet my dear good Lizzie was it not to protect myself and help others and was not my motive and action of the purest kind Pray for me that this cup of affliction may pass from me or be sanctified to me I weep whilst I am writing I pray for death this morning Only my darling Taddie prevents my taking my life I shall have to endure a round of newspaper abuse from the Republicans because I dared venture to relieve a few of my wants Tell mister Brady and Keyes not to have a line of mine once more in print I am nearly losing my reason Your friend M L CHICAGO Oct eight MY DEAR LIZZIE Bowed down with suffering and anguish again I write you As we might have expected the Republicans are falsifying me and doing just as they did when they prevented the Congressional appropriation missus knows something about these same people As her husband is living they dare not utter all they would desire to speak You know yourself how innocently I have acted and from the best and purest motives They will howl on to prevent my disposing of my things What a vile vile set they are The Tribune here mister White s paper wrote a very beautiful editorial yesterday in my behalf yet knowing that I have been deprived of my rights by the party I suppose I would be mobbed if I ventured out What a world of anguish this is and how I have been made to suffer You would not recognize me now The glass shows me a pale wretched haggard face and my dresses are like bags on me And all because I was doing what I felt to be my duty Our minister mister Swazey called on me yesterday and said I had done perfectly right missus F says every one speaks in the same way The politicians knowing they have deprived me of my just rights would prefer to see me starve rather than dispose of my things They will prevent the sale of anything so I have telegraphed for them I hope you have received from B the letters I have consigned to his care See to this Show none of them Write me every day M L CHICAGO Wednesday October ninth MY DEAR LIZZIE It appears as if the fiends had let loose for the Republican papers are tearing me to pieces in this border ruffian West If I had committed murder in every city in this blessed Union I could not be more traduced And you know how innocent I have been of the intention of doing wrong A piece in the morning Tribune signed B pretending to be a lady says there is no doubt missus L is deranged has been for years past and will end her life in a lunatic asylum They would doubtless like me to begin it now mister S a very kind sympathizing minister has been with me this morning and has now gone to see mister Medill of the Tribune to know if he sanctioned his paper publishing such an article Pray for me dear Lizzie for I am very miserable and broken hearted Since writing this I have just received a letter from mister Keyes begging and pleading with me to allow them to use my name for donations I think I will consent Truly yours M L CHICAGO Sunday Oct thirteen MY DEAR LIZZIE I am greatly disappointed having only received one letter from you since we parted which was dated the day after Day after day I sent to missus F for letters After your promise of writing to me every other day I can scarcely understand it I hope to morrow will bring me a letter from you How much I miss you cannot be expressed I hope you have arrived safely in Washington and will tell me everything Was there ever such cruel newspaper abuse lavished upon an unoffending woman as has been showered upon my devoted head The people of this ungrateful country are like the dogs in the manger will neither do anything themselves nor allow me to improve my own condition What a Government we have All their abuse lavished upon me only lowers themselves in the estimation of all true hearted people The Springfield Journal had an editorial a few days since with the important information that missus Lincoln had been known to be deranged for years and should be pitied for all her strange acts I should have been all right if I had allowed them to take possession of the White House In the comfortable stealings by contracts from the Government these low creatures are allowed to hurl their malicious wrath at me with no one to defend me or protect me if I should starve These people injure themselves far more than they could do me by their lies and villany Their aim is to prevent my goods being sold or anything being done for me In this I very much fear they have succeeded Write me my dear friend your candid opinion about everything I wished to be made better off quite as much to improve your condition as well as for myself Two weeks ago dear Lizzie we were in that den of discomfort and dirt Now we are far asunder Every other day for the past week I have had a chill brought on by excitement and suffering of mind In the midst of it I have moved into my winter quarters and am now very comfortably situated My parlor and bedroom are very sweetly furnished I am lodged in a handsome house a very kind good quiet family and their meals are excellent I consider myself fortunate in all this I feel assured that the Republicans who to cover up their own perfidy and neglect have used every villanous falsehood in their power to injure me I fear they have more than succeeded but if their day of reckoning does not come in this world it will surely in the next Saturday I have determined to shed no more tears over all their cruel falsehoods yet just now I feel almost forsaken by God and man except by the latter to be vilified Write me all that Keyes and Brady think of the result For myself after such abuse I expect nothing Oh that I could see you Write me dear Lizzie if only a line I cannot understand your silence Hereafter direct your letters to missus A Lincoln four hundred sixty West Washington street Chicago Ill care of D Cole Remember four hundred sixty I am always so anxious to hear from you I am feeling so friendless in the world I remain always your affectionate friend M L POSTSCRIPT TO LETTER OF OCT twenty four I cannot send this letter off without writing you two little incidents that have occurred within the past week We may call it justice rendered for evil words to say the least There is a paper published in Chicago called the Republican owned and published by Springfield men Each morning since my return it has been thrown at my door filled with abuse of myself Four days ago a piece appeared in it asking What right had missus L to diamonds and laces Yesterday morning an article appeared in the same paper announcing that the day previous at the house of mister Bunn the owner of the paper in Springfield Illinois the house had been entered at eleven in the morning by burglars and had been robbed of five diamond rings and a quantity of fine laces This morning s paper announces the recovery of these articles mister Bunn who made his hundreds of thousands off our government is running this paper and denouncing the wife of the man from whom he obtained his means I enclose you the article about the recovery of the goods A few years ago he had a small grocery in S These facts can be authenticated Another case in point The evening I left my house to come here the young daughter of one of my neighbors in the same block was in a house not a square off and in a childish manner was regretting that I could not retain my house The man in the house said Why waste your tears and regrets on missus Lincoln An hour afterward the husband and wife went out to make a call doubtless to gossip about me on their return they found their young boy had almost blinded himself with gunpowder Who will say that the cry of the widow and fatherless is disregarded in His sight If man is not merciful God will be in his own time M L CHICAGO October twenty nine MY DEAR LIZZIE I received a very pleasant note from mister F Douglass on yesterday I will reply to it this morning and enclose it to you to hand or send him immediately In this morning s Tribune there was a little article evidently designed to make capital against me just now that three of my brothers were in the Southern army during the war If they had been friendly with me they might have said they were half brothers of missus L whom she had not known since they were infants and as she left Kentucky at an early age her sympathies were entirely Republican that her feelings were entirely with the North during the war and always I never failed to urge my husband to be an extreme Republican and now in the day of my trouble you see how this very party is trying to work against me Tell mister Douglass and every one how deeply my feelings were enlisted in the cause of freedom Why harp upon these half brothers whom I never knew since they were infants and scarcely then for my early home was truly at a boarding school Write to him all this and talk it to every one else If we succeed I will soon send you enough for a very large supply of trimming material for the winter Truly M L CHICAGO Nov second MY DEAR LIZZIE Your letter of last Wednesday is received and I cannot refrain from expressing my surprise that before now K and B did not go out in search of names and have sent forth all those circulars Their conduct is becoming mysterious We have heard enough of their talk it is time now they should be acting Their delay I fear has ruined the business The circulars should all have been out before the election I cannot understand their slowness As mister Greeley s home is in New York he could certainly have been found had he been sought and there are plenty of other good men in New York as well as himself I venture to say that before the election not a circular will be sent out I begin to think they are making a political business of my clothes and not for my benefit either Their delay in acting is becoming very suspicious Their slow bad management is ruining every prospect of success I fear you are only losing your time in New York and that I shall be left in debt for what I am owing the firm I have written to K and B and they do nothing that I request I want neither mister Douglass nor Garnet to lecture in my behalf The conduct in New York is disgusting me with the whole business I cannot understand what they have been about Their delay has only given the enemies time to gather strength what does it all mean Of course give the lady at six hundred nine permission to sell the dresses cheaper I am feeling wretchedly over the slowness and do nothing style of B K I believe in my heart I am being used as a tool for party purposes and they do not design sending out a circular Your friend M L CHICAGO Nov nine eighteen sixty seven MY DEAR LIZZIE Did you receive a letter a few days since with one enclosed for F Douglass also a printed letter of mine which I wished him to read Do write me every other day at least I am so nervous and miserable And Lizzie dear I fear we have not the least chance of success Do remain in New York a little longer and occupy yourself with the sewing of your friends Then I shall be able to learn some thing about my business In your heart you know there will be no success Why do you not candidly express yourself to me Write me if only a few lines and that very frequently R called up on yesterday with Judge Davis R goes with Judge D on Tuesday to settle the estate which will give us each about twenty five thousand dollars with the income I told you of seventeen hundred dollars a year for each of us You made a mistake about my house costing twenty seven hundred dollars it was seventeen hundred dollars The twenty two thousand dollars Congress gave me I spent for house and furniture which owing to the smallness of my income I was obliged to leave I mention about the division of the estate to you dear Lizzie because when it is done the papers will harp upon it You can explain everything in New York please do so to every one Please see H G if it should come out in the papers I had hoped if something was gained to have immediately placed you in more pleasant circumstances Do urge F D to add his name to the circular also get them to have Beecher s There must not be an hour s delay in this R is very spiteful at present and I think hurries up the division to cross my purposes He mentioned yesterday that he was going to the Rocky Mountains so soon as Edgar Welles joined him He is very deep Write me do when you receive this Your silence pains me Truly yours M L CHICAGO NOV nine MY DEAR LIZZIE I closed and sent off my letter before I had finished all I had to say Do not hint to K or B or any one else my doubts of them only watch them As to S so many falsehoods are told in the papers that all the stuff about his wife and himself may be untrue I hope it may prove so I received a letter from Keyes this morning I believe I wrote you that I had How hard it is that I cannot see and talk with you in this time of great great trouble I feel as if I had not a friend in the world save yourself I sometimes wish myself out of this world of sorrow and care I fear my fine articles at B s are getting pulled to pieces and soiled I do not wish you to leave N Y without having the finest articles packed up and returned to me The single white camel s hair shawl and the two Paisleys I wish returned to me if none of them are sold Do you think there is the least chance of their being sold I will give you a list of the articles I wish returned to me from mister Brady s before you leave New York for Washington one Camel s hair shawl double black centre one Camel s hair shawl double white centre one Single white camel s hair shawl two Paisley shawls white one Pair bracelets and diamond ring one Fine lace handkerchief three Black lace shawls two Black lama shawls one Dress silk unmade white and black one White boa one Russian sable boa one Russian sable cape one A sable cape cuffs and muff one Chinchilla set The lace dress flounce and shawl if there is no possibility of their being sold Also all other fine articles return me save the dresses which with prices lowered may be sold M L CHICAGO Nov fifteen sixty seven MY DEAR KECKLEY Your last letter has been received and believe me I duly appreciate your great interest in my affairs I hope the day may arrive when I can return your kindness in more than words As you are aware of my beloved husband s great indulgence to me in pecuniary matters thereby allowing me to indulge in bestowing favors on those whom I considered worthy of it it is in this respect I feel chiefly the humiliation of my small circumscribed income If Congress or the Nation had given me the four years salary I should have been able to live as the widow of the great President Lincoln should with sufficient means to give liberally to all benevolent objects and at my death should have left at least half of it to the freedmen for the liberty of whom his precious sacred life was sacrificed The men who prevented this being done by their villanous unscrupulous falsehoods are no friends of the colored race and as you well know have led Johnson on in his wicked course God is just and the day of retribution will come to all such if not in this world in the great hereafter to which those hoary headed sinners are so rapidly hastening with an innocent conscience I did not feel it necessary to raise my weak woman s voice against the persecutions that have assailed me emanating from the tongues of such men as Weed company I have felt that their infamous false lives was a sufficient vindication of my character They have never forgiven me for standing between my pure and noble husband and themselves when for their own vile purposes they would have led him into error All this the country knows and why should I dwell longer on it In the blissful home where my worshipped husband dwells God is ever merciful and it is the consolation of my broken heart that my darling husband is ever retaining the devoted love which he always so abundantly manifested for his wife and children in this life I feel assured his watchful loving eyes are always watching over us and he is fully aware of the wrong and injustice permitted his family by a country he lost his life in protecting I write earnestly because I feel very deeply It appears to me a very remarkable coincidence that most of the good feeling regarding my straitened circumstances proceeds from the colored people in whose cause my noble husband was so largely interested Whether we are successful or not mister F Douglass and mister Garnet will always have my most grateful thanks They are very noble men If any favorable results should crown their efforts you may well believe at my death whatever sum it may be will be bequeathed to the colored people who are very near my heart In yesterday s paper it was announced that Gov Andrew s family were having one hundred thousand dollars contributed to them Gov A was a good man but what did he do compared to President Lincoln Right and left the latter gave when he had but little to bestow and in consequence his family are now feeling it yet for my life I would not recall a dollar he ever gave Yet his favorite expression when I have playfully alluded to the rainy day that might be in store for himself and his own on several occasions he has looked at me so earnestly and replied Cast your bread upon the waters Although the petty sum of twenty two thousand dollars was an insufficient return for Congress to make me and allowanced to its meagreness by men who traduced and vilified the loved wife of the great man who made them and from whom they amassed great fortunes for Weed and Seward and R did this last And yet all this was permitted by an American people who owed their remaining a nation to my husband I have dwelt too long on this painful subject but when I have been compelled from a pitiful income to make a boarding house of my home as I now am doing think you that it does not rankle in my heart Fortunately with my husband s great great love for me the knowledge of this future for his petted and idolized wife was spared him and yet I feel in my heart he knows it all mister Sumner the intimate friend of better days called to see me two or three weeks since he who had been an habitue of the White House both the rooms of the President and my own reception room in either place he was always sure of a heartfelt welcome my present situation must have struck a painful chord in his noble sympathizing heart And yet when I endeavored to ameliorate my condition the cry has been so fearful against me as to cause me to forget my own identity and suppose I had plundered the nation indeed and committed murder This certainly cannot be America the land of the free the home of the brave The evening before mister Sumner s last call I had received mister Douglass s letter I mentioned the circumstance to mister Sumner who replied mister Frederick Douglass is a very noble talented man and I know of no one who writes a more beautiful letter I am sending you a long letter Lizzie but I rely a great deal on your indulgence My fear is that you will not be able to decipher the scrawl written so hastily I remain truly yours MARY LINCOLN CHICAGO Nov seventeen MY DEAR LIZZIE By the time you receive this note you will doubtless find the papers raving over the large income which we are each said to have Knowing exactly the amount we each will have which I have already informed you I was going to say I have been shocked at the fabulous sum set down to each but I have learned not to be surprised at anything Of course it is gotten up to defeat success You will now see the necessity for those circulars being issued weeks since I enclose you a scrap from yesterday s Times of C marked No one also No two to day s Times The sum of eleven thousand dollars has been subtracted in twenty four hours from the same paper If it continues for a few days longer it will soon be right It is a secesh paper says Congress gave me twenty five thousand dollars as a present besides twenty thousand dollars of remaining salary The twenty five thousand dollars you know to be utterly false You can show this note to B K also the scraps sent Let no one see them but themselves and then burn them It is all just as I expected that when the division took place a mountain would be made of a mole hill And I fear it will succeed in injuring the premeditated plans If the war rages the Evening News might simply say that the sum assigned each was false that seventy five thousand dollars was the sum the administrator Judge Davis filed his bonds for But by all means my authority must not be given And then the Evening News can descant on the twenty five thousand dollars each with income of seventeen hundred dollars each and missus Lincoln s share she not being able to touch any of her sons portion My word or testimony must not appear in the article only the paper must speak decidedly It must be managed very judiciously and without a day s delay Yours truly M L Nov seventeen Private for yourself LIZZIE Show the note enclosed with this to B K do not let them retain it an instant after reading nor the printed articles I knew these falsehoods would be circulated when the estate was divided What has been the cause of the delay about the circulars I fear between ourselves we have reason to distrust those men Whatever is raised by the colored people I solemnly give my word at my death it shall all every cent be returned to them And out of the sum if it is fifty thousand dollars you shall have five thousand dollars at my death and I cannot live long suffering as I am now doing If twenty five thousand dollars is raised by your people you shall have the sum at my death and in either event the twenty five thousand dollars raised or fifty thousand dollars I will give you three hundred dollars a year and the promised sum at my death It will make your life easier I have more faith in F D s and G s efforts than in B K I assure you This division has been trumped up just now through spite I have written to Judge Davis for an exact statement which I will send to you when received Write if any thing is doing Truly M L CHICAGO November twenty one MY DEAR LIZZIE Your letter of Tuesday is just received I have just written B a note of thanks for his kindness also requesting the articles of which I gave you a list Do see Keyes about it K will have it done And will you see that they are forwarded to me before you leave New York K sent me a telegram on yesterday that eight names were on the circulars and that they would be sent out immediately What success do you think they will have By all means assure K B I have great confidence in them These circulars must bring some money Your letter made me quite sad Talk to K B of the grateful feelings I express towards them Do pet up B and see my things returned to me Can you not dear Lizzie be employed in sewing for some of your lady friends in New York until December first If I ever get any money you will be well remembered be assured R and a party of young men leave for the Rocky Mountains next Monday to be absent three weeks If the circulars are sent out of course the blasts will be blown over again So R is out of the way at the time and money comes in I will not care Write the hour you receive this I hope they will send out one hundred fifty thousand circulars Urge K B to do this Your friend M L Saturday Morning November twenty threed MY DEAR LIZZIE Although I am suffering with a fearful headache to day yet as your note of Wednesday is received I must write I am grieved to find that you are so wretchedly low spirited On Wednesday the twentieth of November K sent me the telegram I send you If he is not in earnest what does it mean What is the rate of expenses that B has gone to in my business that he dares to withhold my immense amount of goods Do you believe they intend sending out those circulars Of course you will be well rewarded if we have any success but as to five hundred dollars now I have it not for myself or any one else Pray what does B propose to charge for his expenses I pray God there will be some success although dear Lizzie entirely between ourselves I fear I am in villanous hands As to money I haven t it for myself just now even if nothing comes in When I get my things back if ever from I will send you some of those dresses to dispose of at Washington for your own benefit If we get something you will find that promises and performance for this life will be forth coming It is mysterious why B NEVER writes and K once perhaps in three weeks All this is very strange M L CHICAGO Sunday Nov twenty fourth MY DEAR LIZZIE I wrote you on yesterday and am aware it was not a pleasant letter although I wrote what I fear will turn out to be truths It will be two weeks to morrow since the legally attested consent from me was received by B and K and yet names have not been obtained for it when last heard from However we will soon see for ourselves If you and I are honest in our motives and intentions it is no reason all the world is so If I should gain nothing pecuniarily by the loud cry that has been made over my affairs it has been a losing game indeed And the laugh of the world will be against me if it turns out as I now think there is no doubt it will be all failure If they had issued those circulars when they should have done before the election then it would have been all right Alas alas what a mistake it has all been I have thought seriously over the whole business and know what I am about I am grateful for the sympathy of mister F Douglass and mister Garnet I see that F D is advertised to lecture in Chicago some time this winter Tell him for me he must call and see me give him my number If I had been able to retain a house I should have offered him apartments when he came to C as it is I have to content myself with lodgings An ungrateful country this I very much fear the malignity of Seward Weed and R will operate in Congress the coming winter and that I will be denounced there with their infamous and villanous falsehoods The father of wickedness and lies will get those men when they pass away and such fiends as they are always linger in this mortal sphere The agitation of mind has very much impaired my health Why why was not I taken when my darling husband was called from my side I have been allowed no rest by those who in my desolation should have protected me How dearly I should love to see you this very sad day Never dear Lizzie think of my great nervousness the night before we parted I had been so harassed with my fears Always yours M L December twenty six MY DEAR LIZZIE Your letters just received I have just written to K to withdraw the C Go to him yourself the moment you receive this The idea of Congress doing anything is ridiculous How much could effect if he chose through others Go to B K the moment you receive this Yours M L CHICAGO December twenty seven DEAR LIZZIE I wrote you a few lines on yesterday I have twice written to mister K to have the C stopped Go and see him on the subject I believe any more newspaper attacks would lay me low As influence has passed away from me with my husband my slightest act is misinterpreted Time makes all things right I am positively suffering for a decent dress I see mister A and some recent visitors eyeing my clothing askance Do send my black merino dress to me very soon I must dress better in the future I tremble at the bill that B K may send me I am so illy prepared to meet any expense All my articles not sold must be sent to me I leave this place early in the spring had you better not go with me and share my fortunes for a year or more Write Yours et cetera M L CLIFTON HOUSE January twelve MY DEAR LIZZIE Your last letter was received a day or two since I have moved my quarters to this house so please direct all your letters here Why did you not urge them not to take my goods to Providence For heaven s sake see K B when you receive this and have them immediately returned to me with their bill I am so miserable I feel like taking my own life My darling boy my Taddie alone I fully believe prevents the deed Your letter announcing that my clothes C were to be paraded in Europe those I gave you has almost turned me wild R would go raving distracted if such a thing was done If you have the least regard for our reason pray write to the bishop that it must not be done How little did I suppose you would do such a thing you cannot imagine how much my overwhelming sorrows would be increased May kind Heaven turn your heart and have you write that this exhibition must not be attempted R would blast us all if you were to have this project carried out Do remember us in our unmitigated anguish and have those clothes worn on those fearful occasions recalled I am positively dying with a broken heart and the probability is that I shall be living but a very short time May we all meet in a better world where such grief is unknown Write me all about yourself I should like you to have about four black widow s caps just such as I had made in the fall in New York sent to me Of course you would not suppose if I had you come out here and work for me six weeks I would not pay your expenses and pay you as you made each dress The probability is that I shall need few more clothes my rest I am inclined to believe is near at hand Go to B K and have my clothes sent me without further publicity I am feeling too weak to write more to day Why are you so silent For the sake of humanity if not me and my children do not have those black clothes displayed in Europe The thought has almost whitened every hair of my head Write when you receive this Your friend M L FOOTNOTE Footnote C The clothes that I have given for the benefit of Wilberforce College They have been deeded to Bishop Payne who will do with them as he thinks best for the cause to which they are dedicated The letter on page three hundred sixty six will explain more fully NEW YORK CITY Jan first eighteen sixty eight BISHOP PAYNE D D DEAR SIR Allow me to donate certain valuable relics to be exhibited for the benefit of Wilberforce University where my son was educated and whose life was sacrificed for liberty These sacred relics were presented to me by missus Lincoln after the assassination of our beloved President Learning that you were struggling to get means to complete the college that was burned on the day our great emancipator was assassinated prompted me to donate in trust to J P Ball agent for Wilberforce College the identical cloak and bonnet worn by missus Lincoln on that eventful night On the cloak can be seen the life blood of Abraham Lincoln This cloak could not be purchased from me though many have been the offers for it I deemed it too sacred to sell but donate it for the cause of educating the four millions of slaves liberated by our President whose private character I revere You well know that I had every chance to learn the true man being constantly in the White House during his whole administration I also donate the glove D worn on his precious hand at the last inaugural reception This glove bears the marks of thousands who shook his hand on that last and great occasion This and many other relics I hope you will receive in the name of the Lincoln fund I also donate the dress worn by missus Lincoln at the last inaugural address of President Lincoln Please receive these from Your sister in Christ L KECKLEY FOOTNOTE Footnote D I have since concluded to retain the glove as a precious souvenir of our beloved President CLIFTON HOUSE Jan fifteen eighteen sixty eight MY DEAR LIZZIE You will think I am sending you a deluge of letters I am so very sad today that I feel that I must write you I went out last evening with Tad on a little business in a street car heavily veiled very imprudently having my month s living in my pocket book and on return found it gone The loss I deserve for being so careless but it comes very hard on poor me Troubles and misfortunes are fast overwhelming me may the end soon come I lost eighty two dollars and quite a new pocket book I am very very anxious about that bill B K may bring in Do go dear Lizzie and implore them to be moderate for I am in a very narrow place Tell them I pray you of this last loss As they have not been successful BETWEEN OURSELVES and only given me great sorrow and trouble I think their demand should be very small Do not mention this to them Do dear Lizzie go to six hundred nine and talk to them on this subject Let my things be sent to me immediately and do see to it that nothing is left behind I can afford to lose nothing they have had placed in their hands I am literally suffering for my black dress Will you send it to me when you receive this I am looking very shabby I hope you have entirely recovered Write when you receive this Very truly yours M L CHICAGO Feb seven mister BRADY I hereby authorize missus Keckley to request my bill from you also my goods An exact account must be given of everything and all goods unsold returned to me Pray hand missus Keckley my bill without fail immediately Respectfully missus LINCOLN SATURDAY Feb twenty nine DEAR LIZZIE I am only able to sit up long enough to write you a line and enclose this check to mister K Give it to him when he gives you up my goods and require from him an exact inventory of them I will write you to morrow The hour you receive this go to him get my goods and do not give him the check until you get the goods and be sure you get a receipt for the check from him In his account given ten days since he said we had borrowed eight hundred seven dollars now he writes for eight hundred twenty dollars Ask him what this means and get him to deduct the thirteen dollars I cannot understand it A letter received from K this morning says if the check is not received the first of the week my goods will be sold so do delay not an hour to see him My diamond ring he writes has been sold the goods sold have amounted to eight hundred twenty four dollars and they appropriate all this for their expenses A precious set truly My diamond ring itself cost more than that sum and I charged them not to sell it under seven hundred dollars Do get my things safely returned to me Truly M L TRANSCRIBER S NOTE Every effort has been made to replicate this text
